<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends
selling the South Korean won and the most-accurate forecaster
Scotiabank sees possible interest-rate cuts, as exporter
earnings are wrecked by currency appreciation. </p>
<p>Goldman yesterday predicted a 3.1 percent drop in the won
against the dollar, after a 9.8 percent gain in the past two
years against the greenback and a 50 percent rally versus the
Japanese yen. Seven large exporters based their 2014 forecasts
on an average exchange rate of 10 won per yen, 12 percent
stronger than last year''s 11.23, according to a December survey
by Korea Trade Insurance Corp. </p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. reported today fourth-quarter
profit missed analysts'' estimates, after Hyundai Motor Co. last
week predicted the slowest sales growth in eight years. Bank of
Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the benchmark rate by a
quarter-percentage point as early as Jan. 9 to mitigate the
won''s gains and spur growth, Goldman forecast. </p>
<p>''Exporters are starting to feel the pinch from the
exchange rates,'' Kwon Goohoon, Goldman''s Seoul-based economist,
said by phone yesterday. ''There seems to be no other immediate
policy options than a rate cut to support growth.'' </p>
<p>Korean exports will see a ''significant'' impact should the
yen fall further, while currency volatility poses the biggest
risk to Asia''s fourth-largest economy, according to minutes of
last month''s central bank board meeting released on Dec. 31.
Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said on Jan. 3 that the
authorities are closely monitoring the yen''s volatility and
President Park Geun Hye said the Japanese currency''s weakness
was a burden eroding South Korean companies'' competitiveness. </p>
<h2>Samsung Earnings </h2>
<p>Seoul''s main bourse got off to the worst start since 2007
after Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors Corp. on Jan. 2 predicted a
4.1 percent increase in 2014''s combined deliveries, the slowest
since 2006, and as analysts cut estimates for profit at Samsung
Electronics. The Kospi index fell 2.6 percent since Dec. 30 as
foreign investors sold more shares than they bought. </p>
<p>The won touched 9.96 versus the yen on Jan. 1, the highest
since September 2008, and fell 0.3 percent to 1,068.46 per
dollar at 10:16 a.m. in Seoul, having reached a five-year high
of 1,048 last week. </p>
<p>Shares in Samsung Electronics, which got 85 percent of
sales from outside its home market in 2012, slid 4.8 percent
this year. Operating profit was 8.3 trillion won ($7.8 billion)
in the final quarter, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said
in a statement today. That compares with the 10 trillion-won
average of 32 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Currency Fluctuations </h2>
<p>''Samsung Electronics is paying close attention to global
foreign-exchange trends and strives to protect its interests
against currency fluctuations,'' the company said in a Jan. 3 e-mailed statement in response to questions. It couldn''t confirm a
Nov. 29 report by the Korea Economic Daily that the company has
based 2014 plan on a rate of 1,050 won per dollar. </p>
<p>Foreign investors bought a net 3.1 trillion won of Kospi
stocks last year, while dumping Indonesian and Thai shares,
exchange data show, as South Korea is positioned to benefit from
a recovery in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>Overseas shipments, which account for about half of Korea''s
economy, will increase 6.4 percent in 2014, after an estimated
2.2 percent gain last year, the trade ministry said on Jan. 1. </p>
<p>A stronger won brings down import costs, helping companies
counter falling overseas income. Steel giant Posco is seeking a
natural hedge by paying for imports of raw materials in foreign
currency earned abroad, spokesman Jeong Yong Min said in a Jan.
3 e-mail. </p>
<h2>''Crying Foul'' </h2>
<p>Smaller exporters with fewer hedging tools are ''crying
foul over what they see as an unfair advantage Japanese rivals
are gaining from the retreating yen,'' Oh Joo Hyun, Korea
Trade''s head of foreign exchange risk management, said Jan. 3. </p>
<p>In Japan, Toyota Motor Corp. will post a record operating
profit of 2.4 trillion yen for the year ending March 31,
according to a Dec. 30 report from the Sankei Newspaper. The
Bank of Japan, which has embarked on an unprecedented stimulus
and debased its currency, has scope to expand purchases even
more, according to 71 percent of economists polled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Rising Risk </h2>
<p>''Korean policy makers may now become more vocal as risks
rise in respect to an erosion of Korea''s external position,''
Sacha Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Scotiabank, said
yesterday. ''Risks are rising and I''d be looking for the won to
weaken off for a bit, particularly given the weaker levels of
the yen. There is also the rising risk that the Bank of Korea
eases policy as a counterweight to won strength.'' </p>
<p>The won will decline to 1,070 versus the dollar by the end
of March, Tihanyi forecasts. That''s weaker than the median
estimate of 1,064 in a Bloomberg survey of 37 strategists. He
predicted the won will strengthen to 9.54 against the yen at the
end of 2014. </p>
<p>Goldman recommended selling the won with a target of 1,100
per dollar, without specifying a timeframe. The yield on five-year sovereign debt fell five basis points this week to 3.26
percent, amid speculation the Bank of Korea will trim the key
rate from 2.5 percent. The yield added 26 basis points in 2013.
All 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect no change
this week. </p>
<p>Consumer inflation has stayed below the BOK''s target range
of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent since May 2012. South
Korea''s current-account surplus will narrow to $38 billion this
year after reaching $63 billion last year, while the economy
will expand 3.8 percent from an estimated growth of 2.8 percent
in 2013, according to central bank projections. </p>
<p>''Korea is a victim of its own success as the economy is in
better shape than most Asian neighbors,'' Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, regional currency strategist in Kuala Lumpur at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd., said in a Jan. 3 interview. ''The won''s
strength has become a problem for exporters like Samsung. It can
be quite dangerous and policy makers can''t intervene or engage
in a race to the bottom without causing a reaction elsewhere in
the region.'' </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), vying with Sony

consumers purchased more than 3 million Xbox One players in
2013, following the Nov. 22 debut of the device in 13 countries. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, announced the

keep pace with Sony''s PlayStation 4, which went on sale a week
earlier in North America. </p>
<p>The companies were neck and neck in early December, with
each selling more than 2 million units in their first 18 days.
The $499 Xbox One and the $399 PlayStation 4 have more powerful
graphics and entertainment functions than older models. To
distinguish its machine, Microsoft has touted its motion-sensing
camera, the ability to control live TV and exclusive games like
''Ryse: Son of Rome'' and ''Dead Rising 3.'' </p>
<p>''Sony''s PS4 clearly bounced back from our mixed early-2013
supply chain checks, and appears to have a slight momentum edge
among core gamers,'' Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W.
Baird  Co., said today in a note. ''However, we view the
console battle as too close to call, with both platforms selling
well over the holidays.'' </p>
<p>Dan Race, a spokesman for Sony, didn''t immediately respond
to an e-mail requesting comment. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 2.1 percent to $36.13 at the close in New
York. The stock gained 40 percent last year. Sony American
depositary receipts advanced 0.7 percent to $17.30 after rising
54 percent last year. </p>

<p>Heartland, the bar in Tokyo''s
Roppongi Hills complex where bankers from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. partied before the 2008
financial crisis, has shut its doors after more than a decade. </p>
<p>The bar, downstairs from the Japan headquarters of Goldman
Sachs and Barclays Plc (BARC) as well as the former Japan head office
of Lehman, is closed as of today, Kan Yamamoto, a spokesman for
Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), said by phone. The Tokyo-based brewer opened
the bar in 2003 to promote its Heartland-brand beer. </p>
<p>''The brand has gained enough support from our customers
now,'' with sales growing at more than 10 percent annually in
recent years, Yamamoto said. There are no plans to move or
reopen the bar in the immediate future, he said. </p>
<p>Once an exuberant party venue where the champagne started
flowing at 5 p.m., Heartland suffered a 30 percent drop in
revenue after Lehman went bankrupt and Goldman Sachs cut back
staff in Japan, leaving it with fewer customers. The bar in
recent years saw an influx of new patrons from Google Inc. (GOOG) and
Apple Inc. (AAPL), both of which moved their Japan headquarters to
Roppongi Hills as financial firms vacated. </p>
<p>Heartland and Goldman Sachs were both original tenants in
Mori Building Co.''s Roppongi Hills development, a complex
including offices, shops, restaurants, apartments, a hotel, an
art museum and a movie theater. </p>
<p>Before the financial crisis, bankers from upstairs would
order as many as 100 champagne glasses for parties and offer
them to bar staff and strangers, Mai Shioya, a manager at
Heartland, said in April last year. After the crisis, customers
drank less even with new tenants such as the tech companies
moving into the complex, she said. </p>
<p>In April 2009, after overseas financial companies cut about
16 percent of their Japan workforce in 15 months, or 4,300 jobs,
Heartland hosted a ''pink-slip party'' to help unemployed
bankers network and find new jobs. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which agreed to
pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations it
facilitated Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme, ''failed miserably''
as a financial institution, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. </p>
<p>''One reason, among others, that Madoff was able to get
away with his crime for so long was that JPMorgan had an
inadequate and inefficient anti-money-laundering program,''
Bharara said at a press conference today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
prosecution by entering into an accord with Bharara''s office
that acknowledged oversight lapses related to an account Madoff
used to fund his fraud. The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion
to settle the U.S. allegations, $350 million in a related case
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, plus
$543 million to cover separate private claims. </p>
<p>''The bank connected the dots when it came to its own
profits, but not when it came to its own legal obligations,''
Bharara said, adding that the bank was aware of Madoff''s
questionable transactions as early as 1994. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank didn''t file any suspicious activity
reports required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. </p>
<h2>Timeline Chart </h2>
<p>''The Bank Secrecy Act is a law that requires financial
institutions to establish and maintain effective anti-money
laundering compliance programs and to know their customer,''
Bharara said. ''It is not a tip. It is not a suggestion. It is a
legal requirement enforceable through criminal sanction. Today''s
charges have been filed because in this regard, JPMorgan as an
institution failed and failed miserably.'' </p>
<p>At the press conference, Bharara displayed a timeline chart
with comments by JPMorgan employees who suspected Madoff''s
fraud, which ended when he was arrested in December 2008 and
cost investors about $17 billion. Madoff is serving a 150-year
federal prison sentence in North Carolina. </p>
<p>A JPMorgan fund manager wrote in December 1998 that
Madoff''s returns are ''possibly too good to be true'' and that
there were ''too many red flags'' for the bank to do business
with Madoff, according to the timeline. </p>
<p>In June 2007, a senior JPMorgan chief risk officer said
''there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that
his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme,''
according to the exhibit. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Probes </h2>
<p>The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. </p>
<p>''We recognize we could have done a better job pulling
together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff
from different parts of the bank over time,'' Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed
statement. ''We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee
knowingly assisted Madoff''s Ponzi scheme.'' </p>
<p>From late 1986 to the Madoff firm''s collapse, the Ponzi
scheme ''was conducted almost exclusively through a demand
deposit account and other linked cash and brokerage accounts
held at JPMorgan,'' prosecutors said in a criminal information
in Manhattan federal court. ''Virtually all client investments
were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at
JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and virtually all client ''redemptions''
were paid from a linked disbursement account.'' </p>
<h2>''Vantage Point'' </h2>
<p>''JPMorgan, because of its vantage point as Madoff''s
banker, had plenty of reasons to be uniquely suspicious about
him. Warning signs abounded,'' Bharara said. </p>
<p>The volume, movement and use of funds should have generated
suspicions among JPMorgan employees, Bharara said. From 1986 to
2008 ''an astounding $150 billion'' went in and out of Madoff''s
JPMorgan account. </p>
<p>In 2006, a derivatives trading desk in JPMorgan''s London
office offered products linked to Madoff''s performance and
invested its own money in Madoff''s feeder funds, Bharara said.
By October 2008, the bank was so concerned about Madoff''s
returns that it redeemed $275 million it had in the funds, he
said. </p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the bank learned Madoff and a client of
JPMorgan''s Private Bank were engaged in questionable banking
processes known as ''round-trip transactions'' that amounted to
what Bharara said was a ''check-kiting scheme.'' </p>
<h2>Closed Account </h2>
<p>These transactions were so questionable that another U.S.
bank involved in the transactions filed a suspicious activity
report and closed Madoff''s account, Bharara said. JPMorgan
allowed the transactions to continue for close to a decade, he
said. </p>
<p>''It took until after the arrest of Madoff, one of the
worst crooks this office has ever seen, for JPMorgan to alert
authorities to what the world already knew,'' George Venizelos,
the FBI assistant director in charge, said in a statement today.
''We all need to be invested in making our markets safer and
more equitable. The FBI can''t do it alone. Traders, compliance
officers, analysts, bankers, and executives are the gatekeepers
of the financial industry. We need their help protecting our
markets.'' </p>
<p>Bharara said today his office plans for ''every penny'' of
the $1.7 billion to go to ''help make Bernie Madoff''s victims
closer to whole.'' </p>

<p>Investors should sell Goldman Sachs

<p>Investors should buy UBS AG (UBSN), while Morgan Stanley (MS) and
Credit Suisse Group AG were given hold ratings, analysts
including Andrew Lim wrote in a note today that began coverage
of the five firms. Fixed-income trading revenue will drop by
''low-single-digit'' percentages, while equity trading climbs by
the same amount, the analysts said. </p>

purchases probably will lead to lower prices for similar assets,
the analysts wrote. Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and
commodity trading, or FICC, probably fell to $73 billion at the
10 largest global investment banks in 2013, about half the level
of 2009, according to industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. </p>

equities ''as investors veer away from the bond bear market,''
they said. </p>
<p>Regulatory limits on leverage will force Goldman Sachs to
curtail its capital return policy and Credit Suisse (CSGN) to take more
actions to boost its ratios, the analysts wrote. Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, probably will show
they hold more risk-weighted assets after regulators review
their trading books, pushing down their capital ratios,
according to the note. </p>

<p>Deutsche Bank AG recruited Yusof Annuar Yaacob, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s Malaysia chairman for
corporate finance, as its country head, according to four people
with knowledge of the appointment. </p>
<p>Yusof Annuar, 48, will start work as the German bank''s
chief country officer and head of Malaysian corporate banking
and securities from the end of February, said one the people,
who asked not to be named because the information is private.
His appointment was approved by the nation''s central bank last
week, one of them said. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank is building its presence in Southeast Asia as
economic growth in the region outperforms developed nations. The
firm handled 208 million ringgit of equity-linked deals in
Malaysia last year, ranking it sixth among foreign lenders,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amount is about a
quarter of second-placed Goldman Sachs''s share, the data show. </p>
<p>Yusof Annuar, a former chief financial officer at Malaysian
mobile-phone company Axiata Group Bhd., joined Goldman in
November 2010. The New York-based bank helped manage some of the
country''s biggest initial share sales last year, including
offerings by Westports Holdings Bhd. and UMW Oil  Gas Corp. </p>
<p>Goldman also made about $500 million arranging three bond
sales for state-owned 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a person
familiar with the matter said in May 2013. </p>
<p>Candice Sun, a Deutsche Bank spokeswomen in Hong Kong,
declined to comment by e-mail. Reuters first reported on the
appointment yesterday. </p>
<p>Yusof Annuar is the latest in several recent key
appointments by Deutsche in Southeast Asia over the past year.
It also tapped Tan Boon-Kee, another former Goldman employee, as
head of client coverage in the region. </p>
<p>Phumchai Kambhato, a former country head of investment
banking at UBS, joined as head of Thai corporate banking and
finance. Philip Lee, a former head of Southeast Asia investment
banking at JPMorgan Chase  Co., is now the German bank''s vice
chairman for Southeast Asia and Singapore head. </p>

<p>The U.S. prosecution of JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) was deferred by a federal judge after the bank
agreed to pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil
allegations it failed to stop Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan''s general counsel, pleaded not
guilty today on behalf of the bank to two violations of the Bank
Secrecy Act in connection with Madoff at an arraignment before
U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel. The judge deferred
prosecution of the case until January 2016, when the case will
be dismissed if the bank complies with the settlement. </p>
<p>''The required judicial intervention to protect the
integrity of the process is not necessary,'' Castel ruled. He
set the next hearing for Jan. 15, 2016. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
prosecution by entering into an accord with the office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that acknowledged
oversight lapses related to a JPMorgan account Madoff used to
fund his fraud. </p>
<p>The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion to settle the U.S.
allegations and $350 million in a related case by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover
separate private claims. </p>
<h2>No Reports </h2>
<p>Bharara said yesterday that the criminal charges will be
dismissed after two years if JPMorgan complies with the
agreement and implements reforms of its anti-money laundering
compliance program. </p>
<p>While JPMorgan had been Madoff''s bank for decades and
discovered questionable transactions as early as 1994, the New
York-based bank didn''t file any suspicious activity reports
required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. JPMorgan
acknowledged in the accord that it ignored red flags for about
15 years that Madoff used his account to run a fraud, Bharara
said. </p>
<p>The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. </p>
<p>The accord brings its legal settlements from the past two
years to more than $29 billion and further eroding its once-record earnings. </p>
<p>The civil case is U.S. v. JPMorgan 14-CV-0063, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) traders
Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout aren''t evading authorities
in the U.S., where they face charges of engaging in securities
fraud to hide losses, their lawyers told a judge in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The men, who are accused of hiding losses that eventually
surpassed $6.2 billion on wrong-way derivatives bets, haven''t
appeared to answer the charges because they live outside the
U.S., the lawyers said. </p>
<p>The attorneys objected to a statement by Joseph
Boryshansky, a lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, who told U.S. District Judge George Daniels at a
hearing today that Martin-Artajo and Grout were ''fugitives''
from the U.S. </p>
<p>''Mr. Martin-Artajo is not a fugitive. He''s a Spanish
citizen who did not flee,'' his lawyer, William Leone, told
Daniels. ''For Mr. Boryshansky to get up and assert Mr. Martin-Artajo is a fugitive from justice is completely out of line.'' </p>
<p>Marc Weinstein, a lawyer for Grout, also said his client
hadn''t fled the U.K. to evade extradition to the U.S. </p>
<p>''He was fired, so he could not attempt to live and be
unemployed in England,'' Weinstein said. ''He, his wife and two
small children moved back to France. He is a citizen of
France.'' </p>
<h2>Parallel Suit </h2>
<p>Martin-Artajo, who now lives in Spain, oversaw trading
strategy for the synthetic portfolio at the bank''s chief
investment office in London. Grout was a trader who worked for
him. </p>
<p>Both men were named in an indictment filed by prosecutors
in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
September. The SEC alleged in a parallel suit that the two men
engaged in a scheme to enhance the portfolio''s apparent
performance and thereby curry favor with their supervisors.
Daniels is presiding over the SEC case. </p>
<p>Boryshansky said federal prosecutors probably would seek to
delay proceedings in the parallel SEC suit so the criminal case
can proceed first. </p>
<p>Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for Bharara''s office, and
Peter Donald, a spokesman for the New York office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment about the status of
pending extradition proceedings for both men. </p>
<p>At a conference in Manhattan in October, Lorin Reisner,
head of the criminal division of Bharara''s office, said that
federal authorities expect that Martin-Artajo would eventually
be extradited to the U.S. He called Grout''s case a ''more
complicated'' matter. </p>
<p>Daniels said today he would wait for a formal request from
prosecutors for a delay in the SEC case. He scheduled the next
hearing for May 14. </p>
<p>The cases are SEC v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-5677, and U.S. v.
Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

the company by 19 percent. </p>
<p>The shares rose 7.9 percent to $78.42 at 4 p.m. in New

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management has been
buying South Korean electronics and auto stocks in recent weeks,
saying concern that the won''s strength will erode exports is
overblown after valuations fell to eight-year lows. </p>
<p>''We have been adding into weakness,'' Grace Tam, a Hong
Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset, which
oversees about $1.5 trillion, said by phone yesterday. She
declined to name specific stocks. ''People worry about the
competitiveness of Korean exports. We think this is overdone.'' </p>
<p>The Kospi index has dropped 4.9 percent from last year''s
high on Oct. 30 as the won strengthened 5.9 percent against the
yen. The benchmark index''s valuation fell to about the same
level as its companies'' net assets last week, a 50 percent
discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index, the widest gap
since July 2005. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world''s biggest
maker of handsets and televisions, has slumped 14 percent while
Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) and Kia Motors Corp. (000270), South Korea''s largest
automakers, fell at least 12 percent. </p>
<p>Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the
nation''s benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point
as early as tomorrow to mitigate the won''s gains and spur
growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Hyundai Motor and
Kia Motors predicted the slowest growth in combined deliveries
since 2006 on Jan. 2, while Samsung Electronics posted its first
profit decline in nine quarters yesterday. </p>
<h2>Global Outlook </h2>
<p>International investors sold a net $2.2 billion of Kospi
shares since the end of October, snapping a record stretch of
inflows into Asia''s fourth-largest economy. The Kospi fell less
than 0.1 percent to 1,958.96 at the close today. Samsung
Electronics slipped 1 percent, while Hyundai Motor climbed 0.2
percent. The two stocks comprise more than 20 percent of the
Kospi''s weighting. </p>
<p>Emerging-market stocks trailed developed-nation equities by
the most since 1998 last year, leaving the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index at the biggest valuation discount since 2004. The
developing-nation gauge trades for 1.5 times net assets, or
about 31 percent below the multiple on the MSCI World Index,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Improving growth in advanced economies including the U.S.
will give South Korean exporters a boost in coming months, Tam
said. The International Monetary Fund plans to raise its global
growth forecast in coming weeks, Christine Lagarde, the fund''s
managing director, told reporters in Nairobi yesterday. </p>
<p>''The Korean market is still very cheap,'' Tam said.

<p>Bafin official Frauke Menke wrote in the letter that
Deutsche Bank''s alleged provision of false information to Bafin

<h2>Former UBS Banker Weil Pleads Not Guilty in Tax-Probe Case </h2>
<p>Raoul Weil, once a top UBS AG banker, pleaded not guilty to
charges that he conspired to use Swiss bank secrecy to help
thousands of Americans cheat on their taxes. </p>
<p>Weil, 54, appeared yesterday in federal court in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, where his lawyer entered the plea on his
behalf. Weil, a Swiss citizen, first appeared in the court Dec.
16, five years after he was indicted and declared a fugitive. He
was arrested Oct. 2 after checking into a hotel in Bologna,
Italy, and later extradited to the U.S. </p>
<p>''We look forward to coming back to Florida and defending
him when we have a trial date,'' Weil''s attorney, Aaron Marcu,
said outside the courtroom. </p>
<p>The former head of UBS AG''s global wealth-management
business, Weil is the highest-ranking banker charged in a U.S.
crackdown on offshore tax evasion. If he doesn''t plead guilty
and cooperate with prosecutors, they must prove that he oversaw
60 private bankers who helped UBS make $200 million a year by
managing $20 billion in assets not declared to the Internal
Revenue Service. </p>
<p>Weil is free on $10.5 million bail and staying under house
arrest in New Jersey. </p>
<p>To prove their case, prosecutors will rely on
''substantially'' the same evidence that led UBS, the biggest
Swiss bank, to pay $780 million in February 2009 to avoid
prosecution, Mark Daly, a U.S. Justice Department trial
attorney, said at Weil''s bail hearing on Dec. 16. The Zurich-based bank admitted it helped defraud the U.S. by setting up
accounts that taxpayers hid from the IRS. </p>
<p>At last month''s hearing, Marcu said his client didn''t know
about a rogue division of bankers. Swiss regulators concluded
that ''Weil was not involved and was not aware of any wrongdoing
by any of these underlings who were multiple levels below him,''
said Marcu of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP in New York.
''The weight of the evidence at the very best, very best, is
equivocal.'' </p>
<p>UBS must cooperate on ''any matter related to the
government''s criminal investigation'' of its cross-border
business, according to the deferred-prosecution agreement. </p>
<p>If Weil cooperates with prosecutors, they can urge a judge
to give him a shorter sentence. He faces as long as five years
in prison. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s second-largest energy company by market value, will report a drop in
fourth-quarter profit after oil and natural gas production
declined amid slumping prices for the commodities. </p>
<p>Net income during the period was ''comparable'' to the $5
billion earned during the third quarter, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement yesterday. That
compares with a $7.25 billion profit posted during the final
three months of 2012. </p>
<p>Chevron joins U.S. competitors such as ConocoPhillips (COP) hurt
by slumping oil and gas output as weakening demand growth in the
world''s largest economies pressures prices. Chevron
underperformed its biggest U.S. rivals -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and
ConocoPhillips -- last year in stock performance and lagged the
industry average by almost half. </p>
<p>''Chevron really struggled on production last year but it
looks like they''re going to turn that around in 2014,'' Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis who
rates Chevron shares a buy, said in a telephone interview. </p>

excluding some extraordinary items, when full fourth-quarter
results are released on Jan. 31. That''s the average of 17
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson plans
to spend almost $40 billion on floating platforms, gas-export
terminals and exploratory wells this year as part of a plan to
boost worldwide output 20 percent by the end of 2017. </p>
<h2>Declining Output </h2>
<p>Chevron pumped the equivalent of 2.564 million barrels of
crude daily during October and November, according to the
statement. That''s almost 4 percent lower than the full-quarter
average of 2.668 million from the year-earlier period. </p>
<p>Given the decline in output, the company has no chance of
meeting its full-year output target announced in March of 2.65
million barrels a day, Youngberg said. </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips warned investors this week that fourth-quarter production slipped to a nine-year low because of bad
weather in the U.S. and the North Sea that interfered with
operations. The Houston-based company said Jan. 7 that output
dropped to a daily average equivalent to 1.475 million barrels a
day. </p>

results on Jan. 30, as is Exxon, the world''s biggest energy

<p>''By putting these parts of the business into one group, I
can do things I couldn''t do,''  Michael Rhodin, who will lead
the Watson Group as senior vice president, said in an interview
today in New York. ''I can make decisions much, much faster on
how to redeploy resources over new opportunities and new ideas.
It''s what the whole structure is all about -- it''s about
speed.'' </p>
<p>Rhodin, previously head of IBM''s Software Solutions Group,
will continue to report to fellow Senior Vice President Steve Mills, who oversees software. </p>
<p>IBM has stumbled amid the industrywide shift into the cloud
era, where information is stored online instead of onsite. The
transition has eroded demand for traditional hardware and
spawned a new crop of competitors. To cope, IBM has spent more
than $7.5 billion since 2010 on 43 software business
acquisitions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Big Data </h2>
<p>In July, the company purchased cloud-computing storage
provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc. for about $2 billion. IBM
will adapt Watson''s technology so it can be delivered through
SoftLayer''s cloud infrastructure, it said today. </p>
<p>Watson and other big-data services, which let customers
mine vast troves of information to make better decisions, were
the company''s biggest focus in 2013, Chief Executive Officer
Ginni Rometty said in March. IBM boosted its expected sales from
the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with
an earlier forecast of $16 billion. </p>
<p>IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $187.38 at the close
in New York. The stock fell 2.1 percent in 2013, the year''s lone
decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. </p>
<p>The Watson Group will also include an incubator for
businesses to build on the technology, which IBM began offering
to outside developers in November. The goal was to have three
apps developed on the platform ready to enter the market early
this year, the company said at the time. </p>
<h2>Two-Way Street </h2>
<p>IBM has received about 890 requests from programmers to
build applications in Watson''s so-called developer ecosystem,
Rhodin said today. The company declined to comment on the number
allowed to use the services. </p>
<p>IBM has to be selective in choosing clients who can use
Watson because customers must upload large amounts of data
before the system can work, Rhodin said. </p>
<p>''There''s work on both sides here,'' he said. ''To even get
started, you have to first find all of your data. For a lot of
companies, that is proving to be harder than they thought it was
going to be.'' </p>
<p>DBS is willing to invest S$15 million ($12 million) over
three years in IBM''s technology, and it plans to extend the
Watson service beyond wealth management to its small-business
and payment services, CEO Piyush Gupta said today at a briefing
in Singapore. </p>
<p>IBM has collaborated on Watson-based projects with health-care organizations, including insurer WellPoint Inc. and
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The company is also
working with Nielsen Holdings NV and Royal Bank of Canada on
services that use Watson to interact with customers. Those first
projects will show other potential clients Watson''s promise,
Gold said. </p>
<p>''The immediate focus is to ensure the success of those
early engagements,'' he said. ''It''s a much more interactive way
to work with clients and partners.'' </p>

Slovakia and Ireland in taking advantage of historically low
yields as the Federal Reserve begins tapering stimulus. </p>
<p>The government hired Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to arrange the transaction, according
to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn''t public. The sale may
take place in the next few weeks, according to the person. </p>
<p>Nations are being drawn by low yields before the Fed
further reduces its $85 billion monthly bond-purchase program
after deciding to trim its buying by $10 billion at its most
recent meeting Dec. 18. Israeli two-year yields were 1.25
percent today compared with a 10-year average of 3.44 percent.
Poland sold 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) of 2024 bonds
yesterday, Ireland issued 3.75 billion euros of 10-year bonds
Jan. 7 and Slovakia is selling 15-year euro securities today. </p>
<p>''For European-based investors, it has a nice
diversification element,'' Michael J Roche, an emerging-market
strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said in a telephone interview
from New York yesterday. ''It has the faster growth of an
emerging market, offers extra yield and it is an improving
credit.'' </p>
<p>The yield on Israel''s euro-denominated bonds maturing in
2020 was little changed at 2.06 percent at 5:42 p.m. in Tel
Aviv. The country sold the debt on March 2010 to yield 4.7
percent. The yield on the country''s euro-denominated bonds due
in 2015 rose for the first time in six days, advancing one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point to 0.91 percent. </p>
<h2>Corporate Sales </h2>
<p>Israel last tapped international bond markets 12 months
ago, when it issued $2 billion of 10- and 30-year paper. The
country is rated A+ by Standard  Poor''s, the fifth highest
investment grade, and equivalent A1 by Moody''s Investors
Service. </p>

<p>The largest U.S. and European oil
companies will pay more for Abu Dhabi crude when the end of a
75-year partnership reduces their direct stakes in the emirate''s
output, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Total
SA (FP) lose their rights as shareholders in the company operating
Abu Dhabi''s onshore oil fields after their joint venture expires
this week. The international companies will then start paying a
premium of 11 cents a barrel over Abu Dhabi''s official selling
price for Murban grade crude, the two people said, declining to
be identified because the contract terms are private. </p>
<p>''As long as their crude price is reasonably competitive
and they''re feeding their trading arms, it''s something they can
deal with,'' Robin Mills, head of consulting at Manaar Energy
Consulting and Project Management, said by telephone from Dubai
today. ''The companies will be betting that they can trade the
crude to add more than 11 cents of value.'' </p>
<p>The end of an accord accounting for more than half of the
output from OPEC''s fourth-largest supplier further weakens, at
least temporarily, the role of international companies in the
group, as member nations seek to retain more oil wealth. Abu
Dhabi holds most of the reserves in the United Arab Emirates,
which pumped 2.76 million barrels a day in December, or 9.2
percent of all oil supplied by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Murban Pricing </h2>
<p>The expiring partnership between the international
companies and state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc,
accounts for about 1.5 million barrels a day of Murban crude,
the U.A.E.''s main blend. Murban for December costs $113.85 a
barrel under Abu Dhabi''s retroactive monthly pricing system. </p>
<p>Adnoc will take full control of the unit operating the
fields while completing a bidding process to award new
concessions, according to a statement from the producer
yesterday. Until a new concession agreement is reached, Exxon,
Shell, BP and Total will buy Murban crude from Adnoc under six-month contracts that will replace some of the oil they would
have taken as equity partners, the people said. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi has pumped oil from its onshore fields under
concession deals with Exxon, Shell, Total, BP and Portugal''s
Partex Oil  Gas, or their predecessors, that have been in
effect since January 1939. Adnoc became a partner in the 1970s,
forming Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, or ADCO, in
which the five foreign partners held a 40 percent stake. </p>
<h2>Production Loss </h2>
<p>''BP, Shell, Total and Exxon, each of whom held a 9.5
percent interest, will see an end to some 150,000 barrels a day
of annual production and the loss of about $50 million of annual
fixed income,'' Deutsche Bank AG analyst Lucas Herrmann wrote in
a note today. ''More surprising is that at this stage there has
been no temporary extension and that Adnoc, the state oil
company, has taken full control of the fields.'' </p>
<p>The four companies, which retain some stakes in Abu Dhabi''s
offshore production, are among 11 from the U.S., Europe and Asia
that submitted bids in October for new production agreements in
the Persian Gulf emirate. Partex, the smallest partner in ADCO
with a 2 percent stake, wasn''t invited to bid. Adnoc may take
until January 2015 to choose new partners, Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi, the company''s director general, said in November. </p>
<h2>Interim Agreements </h2>
<p>Adnoc at first considered signing yearlong oil supply
contracts with BP, Exxon, Shell and Total, the people with
knowledge of the matter said. By signing six-month agreements
instead, the state producer will have greater flexibility in the
event concession agreements are reached earlier than next
January, they said. </p>
<p>Spokesmen at BP, Exxon and Shell declined to comment. Total
media representatives didn''t immediately comment when contacted
by phone. An Adnoc spokesman declined to provide additional
comment beyond what the company said in the statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Korea National Oil Corp. and Italy''s Eni SpA (ENI) have said
they''re bidding for the new concessions. The remaining bidders
are Japan Oil Development Co., China National Petroleum Corp.,
Norway''s Statoil ASA, Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the U.S. and
Russia''s OAO Rosneft, according to Energy Intelligence Group. </p>

<p>Banking clients at DBS Group Holdings
Ltd. (DBS) will soon get investing assistance from Watson, the same
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) technology that triumphed
over human ''Jeopardy!'' contestants. </p>
<p>The Singapore-based bank plans to begin using the tool,
which can answer questions in conversational language and learn
from responses, in the second half of 2014 to aid financial
planners in guiding its wealth-management unit''s affluent
customers, IBM said today. Watson will analyze large volumes of
financial data to help DBS, Southeast Asia''s largest lender,
offer more customized service. </p>
<p>The agreement gives IBM a proving ground as it tries to
show clients the value of its Watson technology. The Armonk, New
York-based company announced today it''s creating a separate
division for Watson to spur growth after six consecutive
quarters of falling revenue. </p>
<p>IBM will invest more than $1 billion in the IBM Watson
Group, including $100 million in venture funding for businesses
that develop applications based on the technology. Based in New
York with a staff of 2,000, the new unit will be separate from
IBM''s hardware, software and services divisions, said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson Solutions. </p>
<p>''It''s the first time that IBM is bringing together all of
the disparate functions that support a business,'' Gold said
said in an interview. ''It''s a kind of doubling down.'' </p>

<p>Major broadcasters are heading for a
showdown in their bid to block a Barry Diller-backed company
from upending the industry''s economics by offering subscribers
live television over the Internet. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court will say as soon as tomorrow whether
it will consider the claim by companies including Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)''s ABC and 21st Century Fox Inc. (FOX) that Aereo Inc.''s business
is built on copyright violations, obtaining broadcast signals
for free and distributing them for a profit. </p>
<p>Both sides in the dispute are seeking a high court hearing,
increasing the chances the justices will step in. If so, the
case will determine the fate of Aereo, a startup that threatens
the billions of dollars in retransmission fees broadcasters get
from pay-TV systems that provide signals to subscribers. </p>
<p>''It''s nothing short of a watershed moment,'' said David Bank, a media analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ''If the Supreme
Court agrees to hear it, we''re going to finally resolve the
issue.'' </p>
<p>A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which
provides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them
with thousands of small antennas, isn''t violating broadcasters''
copyrights. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) are
joining Disney and Fox in urging reversal. </p>
<p>A decision to take up the case this month would mean a
Supreme Court ruling by early July. The justices could also ask
the Obama administration for input, a step that would delay a
resolution. </p>
<h2>Retransmission Fees </h2>
<p>Retransmission fees have become increasingly important for
broadcast networks, supplementing advertising revenue. </p>
<p>Broadcasters are expected to reap more than $4.29 billion
in fees paid by satellite and cable companies this year, a 30
percent gain from last year, according to research firm SNL
Kagan. That revenue is projected to reach $7.15 billion by 2018. </p>
<p>Fox and CBS have said they may abandon their broadcast
signals and become cable networks if Aereo continues unabated. </p>
<p>''We need to be able to be fairly compensated for our
content,'' 21st Century Fox President and Chief Operating
Officer Chase Carey said at an industry conference last year.
''We can''t sit idly by and let an entity steal our signal. We
will move to a subscription model if that''s our only recourse.'' </p>
<p>Conversion to a cable network would mean that broadcast
signals would no longer be freely available over the airwaves. </p>
<h2>Cable Switch </h2>
<p>Should broadcasters make the switch, it would affect about
12 percent of households, according to estimates based on data
from SNL Kagan and Nielsen. About 100 million of 114 million
U.S. homes with televisions subscribe to pay-TV services. </p>
<p>Diller, the billionaire investor who helped create the Fox
network, says New York-based Aereo may eventually get as much as
35 percent of U.S. households to subscribe if it overcomes legal
challenges. The service charges customers $8 a month. </p>
<p>DirecTV, Time Warner Cable Inc. and Charter Communications
Inc. are considering using the same approach, capturing free
broadcast-TV signals to avoid paying retransmission fees,
according to people with knowledge of the companies'' plans. </p>
<p>The cable companies could use Aereo''s approach in an effort
to bypass or reduce the fees they now pay, the people said. </p>
<p>The court fight centers on a provision in the federal
copyright law that gives owners the exclusive right to perform
their works ''publicly.'' The appeals court said Aereo''s service
was legal because the separate antennas let each customer create
a distinct copy of a broadcast program for viewing, so no public
transmission was taking place. </p>
<h2>''Technical Detail'' </h2>
<p>The broadcasters argued in their appeal that Aereo is
trying to use a ''technical detail'' to circumvent well-established legal rights. </p>
<p>''There is no dispute that Aereo has developed a business
model around the massive, for-profit exploitation of the
copyrighted works of others,'' the broadcasters argued. </p>
<p>Aereo is taking the unusual step of encouraging Supreme
Court review of a ruling in the company''s favor, saying it wants
to resolve legal doubt. That stems in part from rulings by two
federal trial judges declaring another company''s similar system
to be a copyright violation. </p>
<p>Litigation has ''created uncertainty that undermines
Aereo''s efforts to expand its footprint and further develop its
business,'' the company told the court. </p>
<p>Chet Kanojia, chief executive officer of Aereo, told
Bloomberg Television yesterday that ''it will become clear what
the road map looks like on the legal front over the next few
months'' if the Supreme Court takes up the case. </p>
<h2>NFL Backing </h2>
<p>Lower court disagreement often prompts the high court to
consider a case, though the justices tend to wait until the same
issue has been decided differently at the appeals court level. </p>
<p>The National Football League and Major League Baseball,
whose games appear on broadcast TV, are backing the media
companies. The broadcasters also have support at the high court
from companies that produce television programs, including Time
Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. </p>
<p>Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) is taking a middle ground in the
debate, saying that while Aereo''s service violates the copyright
laws, the broadcasters'' arguments go too far and threaten
legitimate services. </p>
<p>The local TV broadcast industry is run separately from the
national networks and would face a different challenge if Aereo
is found to be legal. Local broadcasters act as affiliates of
the national networks and negotiate separate deals with pay-TV
operators. </p>
<h2>Consolidating Business </h2>
<p>Local broadcasters have consolidated in the last few years,
a move partly spurred by the growth in retransmission revenue as
well as the value of their broadcasting bandwidth, also known as
spectrum, parts of which could be sold. </p>
<p>The situation led to more than $10 billion in acquisitions
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Aereo''s
legality could threaten the value of those deals, according to
Bank. </p>
<p>''It''s super-complicated from an investor perspective,'' he
said. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
decide whether a rival drink-maker can sue Coca-Cola Co. (KO) for
allegedly deceiving consumers about the amount of pomegranate
juice in one of its beverages. </p>

LLC, saying Food and Drug Administration regulations authorize
the Coca-Cola product''s name. The label on the drink says
''Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices,'' with the

drink contains only 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2
percent blueberry juice. Apple and grape juice constitute 99

health-conscious consumers rightly expect so that they can make

blueberry. </p>

authorizes false-advertising suits, can apply even when the FDA
regulates a product. </p>

to impose the requirements urged by Pom.'' </p>

increasing revenue faster than every major U.S. soft drink
maker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That includes
Coca-Cola Co. (KO), which is poised to report its first annual sales
drop since the financial crisis. Coca-Cola may be motivated to
bid for the maker of Monster and Worx brand energy drinks and 
Peace Tea to protect their distribution agreement, said Stifel

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. agreed to lease 120,000 square feet in a new tower in
Manhattan''s East Village for its Watson Group, developer of the
technology that beat ''Jeopardy!'' champion Ken Jennings. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, will bring the occupancy of
the Fumihiko Maki-designed building at 51 Astor Place to 73
percent, said Ed Minskoff, founder of developer Minskoff
Equities. The 400,000-square-foot (37,000-square-meter), 12-story tower was completed about four months ago, he said. </p>
<p>Minskoff started construction in the aftermath of the
credit crash without any tenants committed. The project tested
the appetite of New York''s technology and media companies for
new offices at a time when they were flocking to converted
factories and warehouses elsewhere in the area known as Midtown
South, roughly from 30th to Canal streets. </p>
<p>''I always said from the day we announced we were going to
develop this property, it would lease after people could walk
through it,'' Minskoff said in a telephone interview. ''Now that
they''re walking through it, the response from most of the people
we''re doing deals with is, ''Wow.'''' </p>
<p>As part of the deal, the tower will be named the IBM Watson
Building, Minskoff said. Watson is cloud-based technology that
answers questions in plain language and learns from the
responses. It''s known for beating Jennings after he won a record
74 straight ''Jeopardy!'' matches against other humans in 2011. </p>
<p>Lori Bosio, a spokeswoman for IBM, declined to comment on
the lease. </p>
<h2>Facebook, Yahoo </h2>
<p>Minskoff declined to reveal terms of the agreement, saying
only that it would be for between 10 and 20 years. He said in
general, tenants are paying rents that are ''in the range'' of
the $88 to $115 a square foot he said he was seeking in 2012. </p>
<p>Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year took space in
buildings completed in the early 20th century. Facebook is
leasing offices at 770 Broadway, which is across the street from
51 Astor Place. </p>
<p>''Our entrance looks straight into their space,'' Minskoff
said. ''All that did was reinforce in my mind the value of the
Astor Place location.'' </p>
<p>Watson''s move to Manhattan was reported by Forbes on its
website on Jan. 8. </p>

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit

held as collateral and said it''s still owed money. </p>
<p>Quah Su Ling sued Goldman Sachs International in London,
accusing it of breach of contract for selling her shares in
Blumont Group Ltd., Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. and
depressing their prices. Goldman Sachs International countersued
for $12.3 million it says it''s still owed. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs International sold the shares in an ''orderly
and measured manner -- consistent with industry practice and
accepted standards -- over the course of three weeks,'' the bank
said in court papers filed in London and made available this
week. The lawsuit is Quah''s ''attempt to delay or avoid
repayment of debt.'' </p>
<p>Shares of the three Singapore companies tumbled with
Asiasons falling 62 percent on Oct. 4, while Blumont declined 56
percent and LionGold was down 42 percent. Over three days from
Oct. 4, the declines erased $6.9 billion from Singapore''s bourse
value. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the city''s stock
exchange said they would probe activities around the shares of
the companies. </p>
<p>Quah, the Chief Executive Officer of IPCO International
Ltd., claimed Goldman Sachs demanded she repay $48 million
within 1 1/2 hours on Oct. 2 and started selling her shares. The
bank hadn''t informed her previously of any shortfall in her
margin loan or give her reasonable time to make payment, Quah
said in court papers. </p>
<p>Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Quah didn''t respond
to two e-mails or a call to her office. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has also been sued in London by James Hong,
an executive director at Blumont. Hong claimed the bank breached
its duties by ''arbitrarily'' selling his shares in the three
Singapore commodity companies held as collateral, according to
the complaint. </p>

<p>The commodities cycle that sent
prices rising almost fourfold over 10 years is reversing and
will eventually drive raw materials into a structural bear
market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. </p>
<p>Growth in shale oil output will keep U.S. energy prices
low, reinforcing economic growth and leading to more tapering of
government stimulus, the bank said in a report dated yesterday.
That will cut raw-material demand in emerging markets and lead
to weakened currencies that will encourage more production. The
new cycle is the opposite of the ''super cycle'' that ran from
2002 through 2011, Goldman said. </p>
<p>''I can''t tell you about one commodity out there that has a
bullish supply-side story,'' Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities
research at Goldman, said at the company''s investor conference
in London today. ''A decade of higher commodity prices generated
a supply response.'' </p>
<p>Commodities posted the first annual drop in five years in
2013 as supply exceeded demand for corn to sugar to nickel and
investors lost faith in precious metals as a store of value amid
signs that economies are improving. As higher prices spurred
miners and farmers to boost production at time when China''s
economic growth slowed, Citigroup Inc. said the ''super cycle''
of gains has ended. </p>
<p>''The rotation away from emerging markets and towards
developed market demand as well as the supply increase,
particularly the U.S. shale revolution, are creating a new
commodity cycle,'' Currie said in the report. ''On net, this new
commodity cycle eventually suggests a structural bear market in
commodities, but we believe that is still in the distant
future.'' </p>
<h2>Weakening Currencies </h2>
<p>The new cycle will lead emerging market nations to increase
production to raise cash to make up for weakening currencies,
which will further weaken prices and reinforce the U.S.
recovery, Goldman said. A ''structural'' bear market is only in
the future because of transportation, processing and
distribution bottlenecks, Goldman said. Surging U.S. oil output
is largely trapped in the country and copper smelters are
failing to process rising supplies from mines, according to the
report. </p>
<p>Commodity cycles last about 25 to 30 years, with the first
half spent on building production capacity to meet demand and
the next 10 to 15 years spent on building capacity to consume,
Currie said. Returns in the last 10 to 15 years will be positive
for industries such as petrochemicals, he said. </p>
<h2>Precious Metals </h2>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s Enhanced Commodity Index will fall 3
percent in the next 12 months, with precious metals dropping 15
percent on top of last year''s 30 percent decline and agriculture
falling 11 percent after sliding 18 percent in 2013, Goldman
said. Industrial metals are forecast to decrease 5 percent and
livestock 3 percent, according to the report. Energy will lose 1
percent, after gaining 5.6 percent in 2013, the bank said. </p>
<p>Gold prices will fall to $1,050 an ounce in 12 months from
$1,246 an ounce now, while copper will be at $6,200 a metric ton
from $7,283 a ton now as the market moves into surplus, the bank
said. A record soybean crop in South America will send prices to
$9.50 a bushel from $12.7325 a bushel now. </p>
<p>While Brent will be at $100 a barrel in 12 months and West
Texas Intermediate oil at $90 a barrel, price risk is ''skewed
to the downside,'' Currie said in the report. Uncertainty about
oil supplies due to geopolitical risks in Libya and South Sudan
means the bank is neutral commodities over the next three
months, with prices forecast to return 3 percent in the period. </p>

<p>Apple Inc. (AAPL) didn''t infringe a patent
owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Motorola Mobility unit over mobile-phone
technology, a U.S. appeals court ruled Jan. 10. </p>
<p>The ruling, posted on the website of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, affirms a victory
Apple won at the U.S. International Trade Commission. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility had unsuccessfully claimed Apple
infringed six patents in a case before the ITC. The sole patent
on appeal involves a way to control the delivery of data to
applications on a wireless device. The three-judge panel of the
Federal Circuit said the commission was correct to rule that
Cupertino, California-based Apple used a different technique. </p>
<p>Google, based in Mountain View, California, inherited the
case when it bought Motorola Mobility in 2012 for $12.4 billion.
The purchase was made in part to get Motorola Mobility''s trove
of more than 17,000 patents, which Google hoped would be used to
counter attacks that its Android operating system was infringing
Apple and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) patents. Thus far, the strategy hasn''t
resulted in a significant legal victory against either company. </p>
<p>The patent in this case also has been asserted against
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. </p>
<p>The case is Motorola Mobility LLC. V. U.S. International
Trade Commission, 13-1666, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain
Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data
Processing Devices, Computers and Components Thereof, 337-745,

<h2>Technology Patent Case Accepted by Top Court at Google''s Urging </h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review a patent ruling
that Google Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) say threatens to open
information-technology companies to new infringement lawsuits. </p>
<p>The justices on Jan. 10 said they will hear an appeal by
Limelight Networks Inc., which is fighting a suit by Akamai
Technologies Inc. (AKAM) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
over Akamai''s patented method for redirecting requests for
Internet content to ensure access during periods of high demand.
The companies compete with one another in that field. </p>
<p>A federal appeals court said Akamai could sue Limelight
even though no single company performed every aspect of the
patented method. Akamai says Limelight takes all but one step
and induces its customers to perform the final step. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
specializes in patent cases, ruled that Limelight could be sued
for inducing infringement. The ruling marked a change for the
Washington-based court, which had previously barred such suits. </p>
<p>Google, Cisco, Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Red Hat Inc. (RHT), Symantec Corp. (SYMC)
and Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) are backing Limelight, which is based in Tempe,
Arizona. Those companies said in a court filing that the
decision would leave technology companies vulnerable because
products like smartphones ''can be used in an almost infinite
combination of ways by other companies and consumers.'' </p>
<p>The Obama administration also urged the nation''s highest
court to intervene and rule for Limelight. </p>
<p>Akamai, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told
the Supreme Court it shouldn''t hear the case. The company said
the rule overturned by the Federal Circuit allowed circumvention
of patents ''in the form of contrived ''non-infringing'' multiple-actor scenarios.'' </p>
<p>The Supreme Court is already preparing to consider another
technology patenting case in its current term, which runs
through June. In that case, the court will decide when software
can be patented. </p>
<p>Akamai won a $45.5 million jury award at an earlier stage
in the litigation. In a separate part of its ruling, the Federal
Circuit said a trial judge was correct to set aside that award. </p>
<p>Drugmakers including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Pfizer
Inc. sided with Akamai at the appeals court level. </p>
<p>The case is Limelight Networks v. Akamai Technologies,
12-786. </p>
<h2>Daiichi Sankyo Wins Dismissal of Apotex Suit Over Drug Patent </h2>
<p>Daiichi Sankyo Co. won dismissal of an Apotex Inc. lawsuit
that sought a court finding that its plan to market a generic
form of the blood pressure drug Benicar didn''t infringe a
Daiichi-held patent. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman in Chicago said
that because Daiichi had disclaimed the patent over which Apotex
sued, there was no legal controversy over which she could rule.
Her decision was released Jan. 10. </p>
<p>Apotex sued Tokyo-based Daiichi in 2012. A finding of non-infringement would have enabled it to compete sooner with
generic drug maker Mylan Inc., which also plans to bring a form
of Benicar to market. </p>
<p>While Daiichi disclaimed the patent and in 2006 asked the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to de-list it, the agency
never acted on that request, the judge said. </p>
<p>The case is Apotex Inc. v. Daiichi Sankyo, 12-cv-9295, U.S.

<h2>Broadcasters Get U.S. Supreme Court Review in Bid to Stop Aereo </h2>
<p>Broadcasters will get a U.S. Supreme Court hearing in their
fight to stop Aereo Inc., the company that is threatening the
industry''s decades-old business model by selling live television
programming over the Internet. </p>
<p>The justices on Dec. 10 agreed to hear an appeal by media
companies including Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s ABC, 21st Century Fox
Inc. (FOX), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) They contend
that Aereo, which is backed by Barry Diller, is violating their
copyrights by using thousands of dime-sized antennas to obtain
broadcast signals without paying fees. </p>
<p>A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which
provides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them
with thousands of small antennas, isn''t violating broadcasters''
copyrights. Broadcasters say the ruling created a blueprint that
might let cable and satellite providers avoid paying
''retransmission'' fees to carry programming. With those fees
estimated to exceed $4 billion this year, some broadcast
companies say they may convert to cable channels if Aereo isn''t
shut down. </p>
<p>The lower court decision ''is already transforming the
industry and threatening the very fundamentals of broadcast
television,'' the broadcasters argued in their appeal. </p>
<p>Aereo joined the broadcasters in urging Supreme Court
review, saying the company needs legal clarity so it can pursue
plans for growth. In separate cases, two federal trial judges
ruled that another company''s similar system was a copyright
violation. </p>
<p>Litigation has ''created uncertainty that undermines
Aereo''s efforts to expand its footprint and further develop its
business,'' the New York-based company told the court. Aereo,
which offers service in 10 cities, said Jan. 8 that it has
raised $34 million to fund expansion. </p>
<p>Under its normal scheduling practices, the Supreme Court
will hear arguments in April and rule by early July. </p>
<p>The case is American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo,
13-461. </p>

<p>Satter has been banned from entering Russia for five years
for overstaying a visa last year, the Foreign Ministry said
today in a statement. His application, using a notification
number provided by the Foreign Ministry and submitted to the
Russian embassy in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, was rejected
last month, according to a statement yesterday on RFE''s website. </p>
<p>''It was not a matter of my having done something,'' Satter

my presence on the territory of the Russian Federation was
undesirable. So we see a tendency toward a return to Cold War

pollster Forsa, said in an interview. That makes it ''more than
likely'' the AfD will enter the European Parliament. </p>

trend that has seen anti-European parties gain support in
countries from the U.K. to Greece, raising the prospect of a

German support for the European Union rose to a record in a poll

<p>A member of JPMorgan''s real-estate financing unit for
almost 35 years, Pfeiffer managed a seven-person portfolio-management team as head of the New York-based bank''s commingled
property funds, which are pension trusts catering to retirement
and governmental plans. Under her leadership, the Strategic

institutional real-estate professionals addresses industry
issues and promotes research, according to its website. </p>
<p>Pfeiffer was elected to the board of the Real Estate
Information Standards for a three-year term starting in January
2012. The group is sponsored by the National Council of Real

<p>Anne Shultz Pfeiffer was born on Aug. 10, 1952, in Aurora,
Illinois. Her father, Robert Shultz, was a Dartmouth College-educated businessman who had a manufacturing firm in the Chicago
area. Her mother, Elizabeth, was a registered nurse. </p>
<p>She attended Naperville Central High School in Naperville,
Illinois, before completing a Bachelor of Business
Administration degree at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas. A certified public accountant, Pfeiffer began her career
at Coopers  Lybrand, where she was a supervising accountant,
before the firm merged with Price Waterhouse in 1998. </p>
<p>Pfeiffer joined JPMorgan in 1979 as the senior finance
officer and served as head of the finance group, as a senior
asset manager and an acquisitions officer, according to

<p>Peru plans to cut its coca crop, the
world''s largest, in half as police increase eradication of the
plant that forms the base ingredient of cocaine, the

<p>Eradication will reduce the crop to 32,000 hectares (79,000
acres) by 2016, the lowest in at least a decade,  curbing
exports of cocaine to countries such as Brazil and Spain, Carmen Masias told reporters in Lima today. </p>
<p>President Ollanta Humala increased spending on eradication
and crop substitution after Peru overtook Colombia in 2012 to
become the world''s largest grower of coca leaf, according to the
United Nations. Coca cultivation fell to 54,360 hectares last
year, 13 percent less than when Humala took office in 2011, as
police destroyed plants at a faster pace than drug gangs
replaced them, according to government estimates. </p>
<p>''We''re very optimistic that we''ll continue increasing the
areas of eradication and reducing growing areas,'' Masias said. </p>
<p>Peru boosted counter-narcotics spending to $387 million
last year from $311 million in 2012, including $109 million in
foreign aid. The government is purchasing 24 Russian helicopters
to support the drugs fight. </p>
<p>Humala increased the target for eradication this year to
30,000 hectares from an initial 26,000 hectares, Masias said.

<p>Alaska plans to jump-start a $45
billion natural gas export project by pitching in more than 10
percent of the cost and joining Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), BP Plc (BP/),
ConocoPhillips and TransCanada Corp. (TRP) as an equity partner. </p>
<p>The agreement between the state and the four companies
outlines a framework in which Alaska would take as much as a 25
percent stake in a proposed gas processing plant, an 800-mile
(1,287-kilometer) pipeline from Alaska''s North Slope and a
liquefaction facility in the Kenai Peninsula. </p>
<p>Governor Sean Parnell has asked the Alaska legislature to
approve the deal and give state agencies the ability to
negotiate shipping and leasing arrangements, according to a
statement released today by the Alaska Department of Natural
Resources. </p>
<p>''This is the first time we''ve had all of the parties
aligned on a path forward,'' Joe Balash, the department''s
commissioner, said in a phone interview today before the
announcement. The deal gives the project a ''good shot'' at
proceeding, he said. </p>
<p>The joint venture renews a prolonged effort to harvest
Alaska''s vast reserves of gas, which have remained largely
untapped since the 1968 discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field.
The North Slope holds more than 35 trillion cubic feet of
discovered gas, almost four times the U.K.''s reserves. </p>
<p>Gas shipments may begin as early as 2021, giving Alaska a
foothold in an increasingly competitive race to supply Asian
countries with liquefied natural gas, or LNG, from North
America. ConocoPhillips has a small LNG export plant in Nikiski
on the Kenai peninsula, the only such facility in the U.S. </p>
<h2>Cost Estimates </h2>
<p>Although the project is expected to cost $45 billion, the
final bill could reach as much as $54 billion, according to a
November 2013 Black and Veatch Ltd. study produced for the
state. The producers estimated in a February 2013 letter to
Parnell that the cost could reach $65 billion. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Alaska will assume a 20
to 25 percent stake in the entire project. TransCanada has
agreed to pay the state''s costs for its share in the $22 billion
gas processing facility and pipeline in exchange for a lower
tariff for shipping the gas. That would represent a $5.5
billion investment, Balash said. </p>
<p>The state would pay as much as $5.75 billion for its share
of the $23 billion liquefaction facility, which would be capable
of shipping 18 million metric tons of LNG a year. The producers
would pay the remaining portion of the $45 billion total project
cost, Balash said. </p>
<h2>Fund Project </h2>
<p>The equity stake will allow Alaska to help fund the project
and control transportation costs, he said. Alaska may sell part
of its stake in the project to a number of LNG buyers, allowing
it to reduce what it owes for the liquefaction facility, Balash
said. </p>
<p>The state''s project carries a higher price tag than similar
efforts to export gas from the Canadian coast that could be
finished as soon as 2018. </p>
<p>Petroliam Nasional Bhd., the Malaysian state energy

<p>The two largest U.S. home lenders
are feeling the bite of competition from smaller firms as
mortgage originations tumble at the fastest rate since 2011. </p>
<p>New loans at Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest, fell 38

<p>Avianca Holdings SA, Colombia''s
biggest airline, gained for a fifth straight day to the highest
since May as JPMorgan Chase  Co. called the stock its top pick
among Latin American carriers. </p>
<p>The shares rose 4.1 percent to 4,405 pesos at 3:09 p.m. in
Bogota, extending the rally this month to 19 percent, which
makes the stock the best performer on the Colcap. They fell 18

American depositary receipts with an overweight rating, or the
equivalent of buy, and a $24 price target. In a research note

<p>Treasuries are having their best
start to a year since 2010 as investors from Jeffrey Gundlach to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say the Federal Reserve will keep its
benchmark interest rate at almost zero into 2016. </p>
<p>U.S. government securities have returned 0.7 percent in
2014 through yesterday, the most for the first two weeks in four
years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
Treasuries fell after a report showed a New York manufacturing
index increased this month more than forecast. Fed officials
Charles Evans and Dennis Lockhart are scheduled to speak. </p>
<p>''Investors who late last year anticipated stronger U.S.
data were forced to buy Treasuries this year to cover short
positions as growth appears to be losing momentum,'' said Nick Stamenkovic, a fixed-income strategist at broker RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh, referring to bets that an asset price
will fall. ''While we expect the Fed to continue with its
tapering program, it''s unlikely that interest rates will rise
any time soon.'' </p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year note yield rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.88 percent at 8:33 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
2.75 percent security due November 2023 was 98 28/32. The yield
will be 3.43 percent by year-end, according to the weighted
average estimate of more than 60 forecasters surveyed by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Jobs Growth </h2>
<p>Treasuries surged on Jan. 10 after a government report
showed the world''s biggest economy added 74,000 jobs in
December, versus the gain of 197,000 projected by a Bloomberg
News survey of economists. </p>
<p>U.S. government securities are rallying after debt due in
10 years and longer tumbled 13 percent 2013, the biggest loss
among 144 sovereign bond indexes globally compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. </p>
<p>Gundlach, whose DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund (DBLTX) beat 81
percent of its competitors in the past year with a 0.5 percent
gain, said short-term interest rates will stay low into 2016.
Gundlach, who is based in Los Angeles, said he''s not so sure
that Treasury yields are headed higher, speaking yesterday in a
webcast. </p>
<p>Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said
yesterday there probably won''t be an interest-rate increase
until early 2016. The Fed will probably conclude its bond-purchase program in late 2014, he said at an event in Frankfurt. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX) gained 4.4 percent
over the past year, beating 92 percent of its peers, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund is run by Jonathan
Beinner and Michael Swell in New York, the data show. </p>
<h2>Fed Speakers </h2>
<p>Evans, who was among officials who voted in favor of
reducing stimulus at the Fed''s Dec. 18 meeting, said last month
he wanted to see more signs that inflation would accelerate and
job-market gains would continue before changing policy. Lockhart
said two days ago that weak payroll growth last month should not
discourage policy makers from reducing monthly bond purchases as
long as the economy continues to strengthen. </p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee last month said it will
continue to keep interest rates exceptionally low ''well past''
a decline in the jobless rate below 6.5 percent. </p>
<p>The Fed has kept its target for overnight loans between
banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent for five years. The
chance of an increase by January 2015 are about 23 percent,
according to futures contracts. </p>
<p>This year''s rally in Treasuries was interrupted yesterday
when Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said the economy
was on ''firmer footing'' and the central bank''s decision to cut
debt purchases was a step in the right direction. Plosser votes
on monetary policy this year. </p>
<h2>Taper Vote </h2>
<p>Policy makers in December announced plans to cut their
monthly bond purchases to $75 billion a month from $85 billion
starting in January. </p>
<p>Reports today will show manufacturing in the New York
region climbed to a four-month high in January, while producer
prices increased in December, based on surveys of economists by
Bloomberg News. The Fed is scheduled to publish its Beige Book
business survey. </p>
<p>The World Bank raised its global growth forecasts, saying
the easing of austerity policies in advanced economies supports
their recovery, improving the outlook for exports from
developing nations. </p>
<p>The Washington-based lender sees the world economy
expanding 3.2 percent this year, compared with a June projection
of 3 percent. U.S. growth will be 2.8 percent, the bank said in
its Global Economic Prospects report published twice a year. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) amassed more U.S. patents than any other company for the
21st straight year, helped by its push into big-data services,
which glean insights by mining large quantities of information. </p>
<p>IBM''s 6,809 patents in 2013 scored an annual record, the
company said yesterday in a statement. With inventors in 41
countries, more than 31 percent of the patents came from
overseas. South Korea''s Samsung Electronics (005930) Co. and Tokyo-based
Canon Inc. (7751) ranked second and third. While computer-related
patents can take almost three years to process, the annual list
shows where companies are seeking growth opportunities. </p>
<p>As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down
revenue, IBM is focusing more on fast-growing areas such as
analytics and cloud computing. Last week, IBM said it''s forming
a separate division for its Watson tool -- a so-called cognitive
technology that can analyze vast amounts of data and answer
questions in plain English. Bernie Meyerson, vice president for
innovation at IBM, said the unit relies on recent patents. </p>
<p>''The work on cognitive is based on numerous of the patents
that were just issued related to Watson,'' Meyerson said in an
interview from IBM''s headquarters in Armonk, New York. ''That
new division is now a major commercial focus. By funding
research in that area, you will fund patents in that area.'' </p>
<p>Samsung claimed the No. 2 spot in the U.S. patent tally,
which it has held since 2007. It received almost 4,700, an 8
percent drop from the previous year. </p>
<p>Once again, only two U.S. companies made the top 10 in
addition to IBM. In 2013, it was software maker Microsoft Corp.
and phone-chip maker Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM); the year before it was
Microsoft and General Electric Co. (GE) </p>
<p>Google Inc., which ranked 11th, and Apple Inc., coming in
at 13th, both rose into the top 20 for the first time together,
research firm IFI Claims Patent Services said in a statement.
BlackBerry Ltd. was 20th in 2013, up from 29th the previous
year. </p>
<h2>Allergan Wins Order Blocking Copies of Lumigan Until 2027 </h2>
<p>Allergan Inc. (AGN) won a patent-infringement lawsuit that will
prevent copies of its Lumigan 0.01% glaucoma treatment from
entering the U.S. market until 2027. </p>
<p>Novartis AG (NOVN)''s Sandoz unit, Actavis Plc (ACT), Hi-Tech Pharmacal
Co. and Lupin Ltd. (LPC) would infringe Allergan''s patents on the
medicine, U.S. District Judge Michael Schneider in Tyler, Texas,
said in an opinion posted on the court''s website yesterday. The
judge also rejected arguments that the patents were invalid, and
ordered that regulatory approval not be granted until they
expire. </p>
<p>Lumigan, which comes in different solution formulas,
generated $452.7 million in sales for the nine months ended
Sept. 30 and accounts for about 10 percent of the Irvine,
California-based company''s revenue. The solution slows the
progression of glaucoma, which can cause blindness. </p>
<p>The case involved five patents. Four expire in 2025 and the
fifth in 2027, according to the website of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. </p>
<p>The generic-drug companies argued that the patents were
little different from ones covering Lumigan 0.03%. An appeals
court last year upheld a patent on that treatment that expires
in August. The judge said the newer patents are for a solution
that limited red eyes, which caused some patients to stop taking
the treatment. </p>
<p>Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Allergan, said the company
had no comment. Officials with the generic-drug makers either
had no immediate comment or didn''t immediately respond to
queries. </p>
<p>Lumigan is Allergan''s second-biggest drug, after Restasis
eye drops. Allergan yesterday received a new patent on Restasis. </p>
<p>The case is Allergan Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 11-cv-00441, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). </p>
<h2>Microsoft Sued for Infringement by Former Litigator''s Client </h2>
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest software company, was
sued for infringement by a company whose lawyer has litigated
patent cases in the past for Microsoft. </p>
<p>IpLearn-Focus LLC filed its lawsuit Jan. 10 in federal
court in San Francisco. The Mountain View, California-based
company is represented by Matthew D. Powers of the Tensegrity
Law Group LLP of Redwood Shores, California. </p>
<p>Powers, who left New York-based Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP
in 2011 to form a patent-litigation firm, represented Microsoft
in cases including a lawsuit filed in June of that year against
TiVo Inc. (TIVO) He defended the Redmond, Washington-based software
maker in a 2007 case brought by patent owner I4i LP, according
to court files. </p>
<p>As of yesterday afternoon, the electronic docket for the
IPLearn-Focus lawsuit didn''t show an entry of any motion by
Microsoft to disqualify Powers. No counsel for Microsoft is
listed. </p>
<p>The lawsuit concerns three patents covering learning
methods and systems that use a remote sensor. IpLearn-Focus said
Microsoft''s Xbox video-game console and services infringe
patents 8,475,174, 8,538,321 and 8,538,320. According to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, those are the
only three patents belonging to IpLearn-Focus. </p>
<p>The company, which doesn''t have a functioning website, also
is listed as the owner of patent application 20140004498, which
was published in the office''s database Jan. 2. That application
is related to the use of detached sensors in a learning
environment. </p>
<p>IpLearn-Focus said in court filings that it put Microsoft
on notice of its alleged infringement on Nov. 1 and that at the
time the complaint was filed it had received no response from
the software maker. </p>
<p>The company said it''s seeking money damages and a
reasonable royalty. It asked that damages be tripled for
Microsoft''s allegedly deliberate infringement. It also requested
attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>Microsoft didn''t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
for comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is IpLearn-Focus LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 14-cv-00151, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). </p>

<h2>Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage </h2>
<h2>Energy Panel Head Decries Number of Fracking Secret Claims </h2>
<p>The head of a panel convened by the Obama administration to
look at safety issues related to hydraulic fracturing said trade
secrets claims about fracking made by the oil and gas industry
harm the industry itself, EE Publishing''s EnergyWire reported. </p>
<p>Professor John M. Deutch of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, at a meeting at the U.S. Energy Department of the
panel he heads, said people are ''dramatically interested'' in
the makeup of fracking fluids and that the industry''s trade
secret claims damage public''s confidence, according to
EnergyWire. </p>
<p>At the same meeting, Eric Milito of the American Petroleum
Institute, said he disagreed with Deutch and the disclosures
being made by the industry are adequate. </p>
<p>The committee was meeting to look at the effectiveness of
the FracFocus website, on which oil and gas drillers identify
the chemicals they use in their fracking fluids, according to
EnergyWire. </p>

<p>Asian currencies are poised to
extend declines amid concern an increase in borrowing costs in
China and a weakening yen threaten economic growth in the
region, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. </p>
<p>''A trend of bearish'' Asian currencies will ''kick off,''
JPMorgan analysts including Hong Kong-based Bert Gochet wrote in
a report yesterday. ''Worries over China''s tight liquidity
stance generate downside risks to growth.'' </p>
<p>China''s money market rates jumped in December to a six-month high, raising concern that tighter lending conditions may
slow the world''s second-largest economy. The yen''s 15 percent
decline over the past year is fueling speculation that a cheaper
currency may help Japanese companies grab export market share
from its competitors in South Korea and Taiwan. </p>
<p>The Philippine peso touched the weakest level since 2010
yesterday on concern the Federal Reserve may accelerate the
withdrawal of stimulus as the U.S. economy improves. The
Malaysian ringgit posted its biggest two-day drop since
November, while the South Korean won fell 1.3 percent from the
five-year high set in December. </p>
<p>The Fed started reducing its monthly bond purchases in
January by $10 billion to $75 billion, reducing capital flows to
emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has
slid as much as 16 percent since May 22, when the Fed signaled
its stimulus program could be trimmed. </p>
<h2>Cash Squeeze </h2>
<p>China''s seven-day repurchase rate surged to 4.98 percent
today in Shanghai, the highest level since Jan. 2, according to
National Interbank Funding Center. New yuan loans slumped to a
one-year low in December and money-supply growth eased, central
bank data showed on Jan. 15. </p>
<p>The cash squeeze will persist this month because
authorities are determined to curb shadow-banking financing and
reduce banks'' reliance on interbank funding amid concerns about
delinquent loans, Haitong International Securities Co., part of
China''s second-largest brokerage, said in a Jan. 15 report. </p>
<p>The yen, which traded at 104.33 per dollar today, may yet
reach 115 this year as the Bank of Japan weighs more stimulus to
offset a sales-tax increase, former board member Nobuyuki
Nakahara said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>The World Bank on Jan. 14 raised its forecast for global
growth to 3.2 percent this year, while lowering the estimates
for China and other emerging-market economies. </p>
<h2>''Purest Expression'' </h2>
<p>Based on conversations with customers, JPMorgan said local
bond funds haven''t received any inflows so far this year. It
would be the first time that has happened in January since 2008,
JPMorgan said, citing data from research company EPFR Global. </p>
<p>The analysts recommend selling the ringgit as the ''purest
expression of positioning for a lack of EM local bond inflows.''
Foreign investors held 45 percent of ringgit-denominated debt in
November, the most among 10 developing countries, making
Malaysia susceptible to capital outflows, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG. </p>
<p>JPMorgan advises further ''underweight'' the Philippine
peso, saying local interest rates are too low. Investors should
also exit a bet that the South Korean won will rise as the yen
weakens. </p>

''Higher capital levels and regulatory constraints make it more challenging for Goldman to be Goldman.'' </p> <p>Shares of the company fell 2 percent to $175.17 at 4:15 p.m., the biggest decline since Nov. 7. While the shares have doubled since December 2011, they are still below their pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading a
rebound in bank lending to mining and energy companies, which
are taking out the most loans since 2011 to refinance debt as
commodity prices slump and acquisitions slow. </p>
<p>Raw-material industries boosted borrowing by 17 percent
last year to $684.7 billion, after a 22 percent drop in 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The top lenders were U.S. banks
JPMorgan at $57.1 billion, Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) at $47.1 billion
and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) at $37.8 billion. The figures reflect
transactions involving more than one bank and include credit
lines, project or term loans and trade finance. </p>
<p>While increased scrutiny from regulators is prompting
JPMorgan and other banks to exit physical commodity businesses
such as warehouses and power plants, lending rose as companies
including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc refinanced
to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Tumbling metal prices
also eroded revenue at mines and smelters last year during the
first commodity slump since the recession of 2008, while the
value of mergers and acquisitions slid 31 percent, data show. </p>
<p>''It was generally not a good year for commodities in 2013,
and that required companies to raise external financing,'' said
Larry Landry, vice chairman of investment banking for JPMorgan
in New York. ''There will be less opportunistic-driven
refinancing in 2014, but hopefully that will be offset by a
meaningful pickup in mergers and acquisitions.'' </p>

Europe as regulators prepare to limit bonuses in the region,

passing inside information on corporate mergers to a friend, the

<p>''It''s not even close to sustainable,'' Peabody said in a telephone interview of the jump in fees from debt. ''It wouldn''t shock me if fixed-income revenues, issuance and trading, were down 20 percent in 2014. Over the course of the year, rising rates will become a dislocative factor that will cut that pipeline at some point.'' </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) plans to invest $1.2 billion to expand its cloud services,
bolstering a business it''s counting on for growth after spending
$2 billion last year to acquire SoftLayer Technologies Inc. </p>
<p>The company, the world''s largest provider of technology
services, plans to add 15 new data centers worldwide by the end
of 2014, said Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of
SoftLayer. IBM is winding down its separate SmartCloud
Enterprise product as early as the first quarter of this year,
except for a premium service that will be offered along with
SoftLayer''s, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>IBM is trying to keep up as customers shift from buying
their own computer servers to relying on the cloud, where data
and applications are delivered online instead of being stored
locally. A slump in demand for hardware has contributed to six
straight reported quarters of declining revenue, forcing the
Armonk, New York-based company to adapt. </p>
<p>''That''s the transformation that IBM is in right now,''
Crosby said. ''That''s why we are spending the money.'' </p>
<p>The new investment shows that IBM views SoftLayer as one of
its biggest bets. The price the technology giant paid to acquire
the Dallas-based company last year was the biggest it has
disclosed for a takeover since the purchase of software company
Lotus Development Corp. in 1995, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Data Centers </h2>
<p>SoftLayer has added about 2,400 customers since the
takeover, up from about 20,000 at the time of the acquisition,
Crosby said. </p>
<p>IBM didn''t specify how soon it will invest the $1.2 billion
nor how it was budgeting for the expense. The company averages
about $4 billion a year in capital expenditures. </p>
<p>SoftLayer is becoming the backbone for IBM''s cloud
business, with related services being integrated with the
platform, Crosby said. The 15 new data centers will bring the
company''s total to 40 locations in 13 countries, IBM said today
in a statement. </p>
<p>''This is fundamental because this allows us global
coverage,'' Erich Clementi, senior vice president of global
technology services, said in an interview. ''We are continuing
to invest in where we think the growth areas are going to be
over the next years.'' </p>
<h2>Government Contracts </h2>
<p>Two of the centers will serve the Washington area to better
support possible government contracts, Crosby said. While IBM
won a cloud-computing contract of as much as $1 billion with the
U.S. Department of the Interior last August, the industry is
filled with new rivals eager to convert IBM''s hardware customers
into cloud users. In October, IBM abandoned a court fight over
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency''s decision to award
Amazon.com Inc a $600 million cloud-computing contract. </p>
<p>IBM clients using SmartCloud Enterprise, its previous
service, have already been switched to the newer product. Crosby
said some of the employees who worked on SmartCloud Enterprise
have moved to SoftLayer, while others have found positions
elsewhere at IBM. </p>
<p>The company declined to comment on whether any jobs were
lost due to the closing of SmartCloud. </p>
<p>IBM reported more than $1 billion in sales from cloud
services last quarter, the first time it has disclosed revenue
from that segment. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
is looking into how IBM reports its revenue from the cloud
business, the company said in July. </p>
<h2>Watson Division </h2>
<p>The plans for investment in SoftLayer''s cloud platform
follows IBM''s move last week to create a new business division
around its Watson technology, which can analyze large volumes of
data and answer questions in conversational language. IBM will
invest more than $1 billion in the unit and give it its own
headquarters in New York. Watson''s big-data services, which let
customers mine vast troves of information, will be run on
SoftLayer''s cloud, the company said. </p>
<p>IBM shares climbed less than 1 percent to $190.09, the
highest since September, at the close in New York. Technology
companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index were little
changed. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) is seeking to sell
pipeline and storage operations in Texas and Louisiana that
together may fetch more than $1 billion, people familiar with
the matter said. </p>
<p>Chevron is working with Jefferies Group LLC to find buyers
for at least four natural gas and crude oil pipeline operations,
said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the
process is private. The San Ramon, California-based company
began sending out offering materials this week, the people said. </p>
<p>Diversified energy companies have been seeking to sell or
spin off transportation and storage operations to cut costs and
focus on exploration. Chevron sold a pipeline business in the
Northwestern U.S. last year to Tesoro Logistics LP, while Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Chesapeake Energy Corp. made similar
divestitures. </p>
<p>Chevron is looking to sell the West Texas LPG Pipeline LP,
a natural gas pipeline 20 percent owned by Atlas Pipeline
Partners LP, one of the people said. It''s also seeking buyers
for a gas storage facility in West Texas, a crude oil terminal
close to the Gulf of Mexico, and at least one of its pipelines
in Louisiana, this person said. </p>
<p>Chevron Spokesman Kent Robertson declined to comment on the
sale as did Jefferies spokesman Richard Khaleel. The company
plans to sell some oil and gas assets to focus on exploration
prospects in Iraq, Canada, and Australia, Chevron''s Chief
Financial Officer Pat Yarrington said in a conference call with
analysts in November. </p>
<p>Chevron will report a fourth-quarter decline in profit amid
a slump in oil and natural gas production, according to a
statement on Jan. 9. The company, run by Chairman and Chief
Executive John S. Watson, plans to spend close to $40 billion on

percent by the end of 2017. </p>

<p>India''s top opposition leader
Narendra Modi promised voters cheaper goods and 100 ''smart
cities'' in unveiling steps to boost Asia''s third-biggest
economy as he seeks to unseat the ruling Congress party. </p>
<p>Modi''s Bharatiya Janata Party will create a stabilization
fund to combat Asia''s fastest inflation and form special courts
to try those who hoard goods, he said in New Delhi yesterday. A
Modi-led government would also improve the rail network and
power supply in the world''s second-most populous nation, he told
thousands of party workers. </p>
<p>''The country has never witnessed such a debacle before,''
Modi, the chief minister of western Gujarat state, said at the
end of a three-day party meeting to devise a strategy to win
elections due by May. ''The 2014 elections are not just for a
change of government, but a fresh ray of hope for Indians.'' </p>
<p>Modi is seeking to harness voter anger over higher prices
of everything from onions to medicine to win power in a nation
where more than 800 million people live on less than $2 per day.
The focus on economic issues also helps draw the spotlight away
from criticism from opponents who accuse him of complicity in
2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, which killed more than 1,000
people and left Modi barred from entering the U.S. </p>
<p>''Modi is a natural communicator, and his ability to take
the conversation forward is helping people forget about his
past,'' said N. Bhaskara Rao, chairman of the New Delhi-based
Centre for Media Studies. ''He''s now batting with a huge lead
and his electoral feet are firmly set.'' </p>
<h2>No Majority </h2>
<p>Opinion polls show Modi''s BJP leading Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh''s Congress party, with neither winning a
majority. The emergence of the anti-graft Aam Aadmi Party, which
is planning to contest the national vote after taking power in
Delhi state last month, has added further uncertainty to the
election outcome. </p>
<p>Singh''s 10-year-old government has struggled to control
spending after implementing programs to boost rural wages and
provide cheap food, putting India at risk of a credit-rating
downgrade to so-called junk status. Modi said he planned to
establish a real-time database of agriculture goods and prices
to bring down costs. </p>
<p>''Ninety percent of the time, these methods of predicting
inflation don''t work because you''re tailing and can''t draw ahead
of the curve,'' said Rajiv Kumar, an economist and former
secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry. ''The devil is really in the details.'' </p>
<h2>''Brand India'' </h2>
<p>In a convention-style speech to cheering party leaders,
Modi pledged to improve education and health facilities, create
more jobs, and attract more tourists as part of building ''Brand
India.'' He called for more satellite cities to drive economic
growth. </p>
<p>''Urbanization should not be seen as a challenge, but as an
opportunity,'' Modi said. </p>
<p>Since 2001, when Modi took office, Gujarat''s economy has
grown 10.1 percent a year on average over the 11-year period
ended March 2012, compared with 7.6 percent nationwide,
according to the Planning Commission and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Companies such as Ford Motor Co. (F) and Reliance
Industries Ltd. announced investments in the state in that time. </p>
<p>''It''ll be very, very difficult for Modi to replicate the
Gujarat model unless the BJP gets an absolute majority in the
elections,'' said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the
Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based policy group. </p>
<h2>''Sacrifice'' </h2>
<p>In his speech, Modi also took swipes at Rahul Gandhi, the
Congress party''s vice president whose family has dominated
Indian politics for more than six decades. His mother Sonia
Gandhi, the party''s president, overruled other senior leaders
last week who wanted Rahul named as the party''s formal prime
minister candidate to counter Modi. </p>
<p>''When defeat is imminent, which mother will sacrifice her
son,'' Modi said, referring to Sonia and Rahul. </p>
<p>Congress leaders have sought to discredit Modi, with Singh
saying earlier this month that Modi ''would be disastrous for
the country'' and presided over a ''mass massacre.'' A party
resolution last week said communal forces threaten ''to rupture
the very basic fabric of our nation''s unity and social
cohesion.'' </p>
<p>The riots followed the killing of Hindu activists in a
train fire, a blaze for which Muslims were later found guilty.
While human rights groups accuse Modi of failing to control
subsequent violence, he denies wrongdoing and a Supreme Court-appointed panel found no evidence that he made decisions that
prevented victims from receiving help. </p>
<h2>Dynasty </h2>
<p>Modi didn''t mention the riots and avoided statements that
would appeal to BJP stalwarts who favor a more predominate role
for Hinduism in India. Hindus make up about 80 percent of the
population, with Muslims accounting for 13 percent, according to
the CIA World Factbook. </p>
<p>Modi instead attacked India''s dynastic politics without
referring to the Gandhis by name. Rahul Gandhi''s great-grandfather, grandmother and father all served as prime
ministers. </p>
<p>''They think it is below their dignity to fight against a
person who was born in a backward class, one whose mother used
to clean dishes in the neighborhood, a person who used to sell
tea in railway compartments,'' Modi said, referring to himself.
''Those having prominent surnames feel it insulting to fight
against those who are known for their work.'' </p>

people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The Spanish cable operator may pick Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in the coming weeks for the IPO after
inviting banks to bid for the work, the people said, asking not
to be identified before a final decision is made. Madrid-based
ONO held talks with investment banks in December and could sell
shares this year if it decides to proceed, the people said. </p>

residential customers and 118,000 small-office and home-office
clients at the end of September. Its net debt at the time was

<p>Nomura Holdings Inc., the most-accurate forecaster of Bank of Korea action in the past six
months, is sticking with its outlook for interest-rate increases
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted a cut. </p>
<p>Kwon Young Sun, Hong Kong-based economist at Nomura, has a
4 percent prediction for 2014 economic expansion, faster than
the central bank''s 3.8 percent, as a rebounding U.S. economy and
a stronger dollar ease pressure on exports. The gap between
three- and 10-year sovereign yields widened to a three-year high
of 79 basis points on Jan. 8 on growth optimism. The won slid
1.1 percent against the greenback this year. </p>
<p>Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo, set to retire on
March 31, will hand off a two-speed economy as exports boom and
household debt damps domestic demand. While political pressure
for rate cuts may intensify as President Park Geun Hye faces
municipal elections on June 4, Nomura sees few economic reasons. </p>
<p>''A solid job market, bottomed-out inflation and improved
GDP growth suggest no need to cut rates,'' said Kwon, who was
the only analyst among 16 to predict the BOK would be on hold
rather than cut in September 2012. ''However, if the new BOK
governor turns out to be very dovish, there is a political risk
of a rate cut even though macro situations improve,'' he said in
a Jan. 17 e-mail interview. </p>
<p>Board members kept the benchmark rate unchanged at 2.5
percent on Jan. 9, citing strength in Asia''s fourth-biggest
economy. That day the central bank projected growth will
accelerate from 2.8 percent in 2013. </p>
<h2>Political Pressure </h2>
<p>Ruling party lawmaker Chung Woo Taik urged the BOK to cut
its interest rate significantly to help the economy, Yonhap
Infomax reported on Jan. 8. Easing the pace of won gains would
be an efficient policy to protect exporters, Chung said,
according to the report. </p>
<p>The political pressure may intensify as the municipal
ballots are the biggest elections since Park took office in
February 2013, according to a Jan. 13 report by Woori Investment
 Securities fixed-income strategist Peter Park. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs expects a 25 basis point rate cut ''in the
near term'' on concern about tightening domestic financial
conditions, Seoul-based economist Kwon Goohoon wrote in a Jan. 9
report. It sees a 3.7 percent expansion in the Korean economy
this year, a Jan. 16 report showed. </p>
<h2>Weaker Won </h2>
<p>The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,063.60 per dollar
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on
Korea''s three-year government bonds fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, this year to 2.9 percent while 10-year
rates rose eight basis points to 3.65 percent, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. </p>
<p>While there is a bias for the dollar to rise against the
won, there is still the chance of a rate cut to revive the local
economy, Adam McCabe, who helps oversee $6 billion as deputy
head of Asian fixed income at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc in
Singapore, said in a Jan. 15 interview. </p>
<p>''Korea has one of the region''s more appealing bond
markets,'' he said. ''There is room for the Korean central bank
to ease monetary policy if it needs to as the domestic economy
continues to disappoint.'' </p>
<h2>Ups and Downs </h2>
<p>The economy may not improve as projected by the central
bank, said Moon Dong Hoon, managing director in the fixed-income
division of KB Asset Management, which oversees 15 trillion won
($14.1 billion) of assets. Ups and downs in the economy may
prompt monetary authorities to lower rates, Seoul-based Moon
said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>Household debt rose to an all-time high of 991.7 trillion
won as of Sept. 30, central bank data showed. Sizable
liabilities and external uncertainty can be a drag on private
consumption and corporate investment, the BOK said on Jan. 9. </p>
<p>South Korea will probably begin to raise rates in the
fourth quarter, according to the median estimate of 28
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Eight analysts from
Barclays Plc to HSBC Holdings Plc expect a 25 basis point
increase by the third quarter, while Goldman and ING Bank NV
project a cut in the first and second quarters respectively. </p>
<p>Exports will increase 6.4 percent this year after an
estimated 2.2 percent gain in 2013, the trade ministry said on
Jan. 1. The unemployment rate was 3 percent last month, close to
the record low of 2.9 percent in November. Producer prices fell
0.4 percent in December from a year ago, the least since
September 2012. Consumer-price inflation of 1.1 percent last
month accelerated from a 14-year low of 0.9 percent in October. </p>
<p>''The underlying trend in growth and job creation is still
positive, with manufacturing, trade and commerce continuing to
add jobs in December,'' said Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based
economist at Barclays. </p>

Verkehrsbetriebe''s 2007 credit-default swap ''could hardly have
been worse'' because it coincided with the start of the global
financial crisis. </p>
<p>''Rather than simply accepting that it had been
unfortunate,'' Rabinowitz said today that BVG ''cast around for
someone other than itself to blame.'' JPMorgan sued the
transport organization to recover $204 million plus interest it
says it is owed. </p>
<p>BVG, which has run the German capital''s trains and buses
for more than 80 years, argues it wasn''t sophisticated enough to
understand the transaction and was misled by JPMorgan and the
bank''s law firm, Clifford Chance LLP. The owner of OK! Magazine,
dentists and elderly care homes have sued lenders over the sale
of derivatives they say they didn''t need or fully comprehend. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment. BVG didn''t immediately respond to e-mails seeking
comment. Anna Ward, a spokeswoman for London-based Clifford
Chance, said the law firm should never have been sued. </p>
<p>''We believe the claims against us are misconceived and
entirely without merit and we will continue to defend our
position robustly,'' Ward said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>0.19 Percent </h2>
<p>The chance of any defaults in the underlying portfolio for
the swap were 0.19 percent when it was signed, Rabinowitz said.
One of the companies linked to the transaction was Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., which collapsed in 2008, sparking
turmoil in the markets. </p>
<p>''Taking on a small risk, even vanishingly small, isn''t the
same thing as taking on no risk at all,'' Rabinowitz said. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps are agreements for one party to pay
another if a target goes bankrupt or fails to pay its debts. The
product can be used as a type of insurance, or to speculate on
the credit-worthiness of companies or assets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan staff ''shut their eyes'' to the fact that BVG had
misunderstood the ''complex credit derivative'' it was signing,
the transport body said in legal documents. Bank employees knew
BVG had no experience in this type of transaction, and gave a
misleading presentation about its risks, according to the
documents. </p>
<h2>''Let Down'' </h2>
<p>''BVG was badly let down by Clifford Chance,'' which had a
conflict of interest because it simultaneously advised both
JPMorgan and the BVG, the German company said in the documents.
The law firm should have turned down the work, or ceased to act,
because of the risk of a conflict of interest, BVG said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan fought for three years to have the case heard in
the U.K., with the European Court of Justice ruling in its favor
in 2011. BVG had sought a trial in Germany. </p>
<p>The trial is scheduled to last for 10 weeks. </p>
<p>The case is: JPMorgan Chase Bank  Anr v Berliner
Verkehrsbetriebe, High Court of Justice, Queen''s Bench Division
Commercial Court: 08-1052 </p>

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit won
a bid to halt Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong''s lawsuit over trading losses on the Brazilian real in
favor of private arbitration. </p>
<p>The ruling was made in a closed hearing today at
Singapore''s High Court. Oei''s lawyer Siraj Omar said he planned
to appeal the decision. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the verdict. </p>
<p>Oei sued Goldman Sachs International in Singapore and the
parent company in New York, alleging the bank misled him into
trading real-yen options. He sought at least $31 million in
damages in each lawsuit. The bank has rejected allegations that
it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter it
wrote to Oei in July and filed in court. </p>
<p>Oei said he relied on the bank''s advice that the real was a
stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar before
betting in May the yen would fall against the Brazilian
currency. </p>
<p>The real has fallen 12 percent since May 15 against the
yen, the second-worst performer among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, after the South African rand. The real has
declined three straight years as widening budget deficits
threaten to trigger Brazil''s first credit-rating downgrade since
2002. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs plans to ask a U.S. judge to dismiss the
lawsuit there in favor of arbitration or move it to Singapore,
according to court papers filed in New York. </p>
<p>''I have not brought this claim because I have lost money
in the trades,'' Oei said in court papers filed in December. ''I
trusted and relied on Goldman Sachs and they abused and breached
that trust.'' </p>

<p>When her sister graduated from
Harvard University in 1981, Kathy Matsui''s father gave her a
choice: Get accepted, or get ready for a lifetime of labor
raising roses. </p>
<p>From the farm in Salinas, California, to Harvard and
Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. in Tokyo, the family work ethic has
underpinned a career that lifted Matsui to the top of her
profession. Now, 14 years after publishing her ideas on how to
upend gender roles in the Japanese workforce under a doctrine
known as womenomics, Matsui has the ear of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who made her research into a plank of his growth plan. </p>
<p>''Warmness alone doesn''t make flowers bloom,'' Andy Matsui,
whose daughter later became Goldman Sachs'' first female partner
in his native Japan, said in a telephone interview last month.
''You never hear a success story for a spoiled child.'' </p>
<p>Kathy Matsui arrived 24 years ago at her first brokerage
job in Tokyo at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities speaking
conversational Japanese. The mother of two, now 48 and fluent,
joined Goldman Sachs as chief Japan equity strategist in 1994
and was ranked the No. 1 stock market forecaster for Japan in
2000, 2001 and 2006 by Institutional Investor magazine. </p>
<p>Matsui''s interest in gender issues was piqued by her own
climb. She published the first womenomics report in August 1999,
arguing that equalizing roles in the workforce was a better
solution to Japan''s shrinking labor pool than loosening
immigration laws or raising the birth rate. Back then, the
proportion of working-age women with jobs was 56.7 percent,
according to the Statistics Bureau. In 2012, it was 60.7
percent, a record, though still not high enough, she says. In
the U.S., 69 percent of women between 25 and 54 had jobs in
2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>
<h2>Change Needed </h2>
<p>Japan''s aging population and a debt burden twice as big as
its economy mean more must be done fast, according to Matsui. By
2035, one third of all Japanese will be 65 or older, up from 23
percent in 2010, according to the National Institute of
Population and Social Security Research. Japan could expand its
workforce by 8 million and increase its gross domestic product
as much as 14 percent by raising women in employment to about 80
percent, the same level as men, Matsui wrote in an April report. </p>
<p>''We have to convince the Japanese people that running a
marathon with one leg is going to take a very long time,''
Matsui said in an interview last month. ''It''s still an alien
concept that women might be working full-time.'' </p>
<h2>Work Ethic </h2>
<p>Matsui attributes her own work ethic to growing up in
Salinas. She attended Japanese language school on Saturdays,
went to church on Sundays and cut flowers by hand after classes
the rest of the week. Her mother, Mary, toiled in the family
nursery every day and learned English at night while raising
four children. </p>
<p>''Despite wearing four layers of gloves, you still ended up
with thorns in your hands,'' Kathy Matsui said. ''But we got
used to it, that was our life. In my family, money didn''t just
fall from the sky.'' </p>
<p>With degrees in social studies from Harvard in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and international affairs from Baltimore-based
Johns Hopkins University, Matsui visited Japan for the first
time in 1986 on a Rotary scholarship. She moved to Tokyo to be
with Jesper Koll, now her husband, whom she met during an
internship at Mitsui Bank. </p>
<h2>''Vital Component'' </h2>
<p>Invoking Matsui by name in a Sept. 25 essay for the Wall
Street Journal, Japan''s Abe said womenomics is a ''vital
component'' of his growth strategy. The premier has said he
wants a society where ''women can shine'' by eliminating waiting
lists for childcare and training mothers returning to work. He
has encouraged publicly-traded companies in Japan to have at
least one female executive and set a goal of women holding 30
percent of leadership positions in all areas of society by 2020,
when Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics. </p>
<p>''Since he elevated this issue and made it a core part of
his growth strategy agenda, people started waking up,'' Matsui
said. ''The fact that he is even mentioning it is massive
progress compared to any of his predecessors.'' </p>
<p>Promoting women''s rights in Japan has long been a losing
battle. The World Economic Forum ranked the Asian nation 105th
out of 136 nations in its 2013 Global Gender Gap Report, which
measures economic, political, education and health differences
between men and women. Iceland was No. 1, followed by Finland
and Norway. The U.S. was 23rd and China 69th. </p>
<h2>Female Managers </h2>
<p>In Japan, female executives make up about 11 percent of
managerial jobs in the private sector, according to 2012 data
from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Women are paid
about 71 percent as much as men, according to the ministry.
About 62 percent of Japanese women quit their jobs after their
first child is born, according to the IPSS. </p>
<p>Many of Matsui''s friends did. She thought about what would
happen if they kept working and it prompted her to write the
first report on gender in the workplace. </p>
<p>''Very few of my Japanese clients reacted to it at the
time, though that wasn''t surprising since 99.9 percent of them
were male,'' she said. ''Since I had ''three strikes'' against me
as an inexperienced, foreign, female strategist, I knew the only
way I could succeed was to write differentiated research.'' </p>
<p>Competitors noticed a report that went past stock picking. </p>
<p>''The female labor participation had risen in the 1990s,
but I found it interesting how she shed light on it,'' said
Chisato Haganuma, chief equity strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co., who has been Matsui''s competitor
for about 20 years. ''It was a very good report and strategy in
that it highlighted a change in our society rather than just
talking about which stocks would rise and fall.'' </p>
<h2>Stock-Picking </h2>
<p>In a study released on Oct. 1, 2010, Matsui listed 44
public companies in industries from daycare to nursing and food
preparation that she said reflected women''s values. They rose 86
percent through Dec. 27, compared with a 55 percent increase for
the Topix index, according to Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Her broader forecasts for Japanese equities have usually
been bullish, a stance that paid off last year when the Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY) beat every developed-market index. In
November, she raised her 12-month projection for the Topix to
1,450, about 11 percent higher than the gauge''s 2013 close and a
level unseen since 2007. The measure rose 0.2 percent to
1,295.95 yesterday. </p>
<p>Logic, intuition and contacts inform the calls, said Hiromi
Suzuki, a Tokyo-based analyst at Goldman Sachs who has worked
with Matsui since 1994, when they started the firm''s strategy
team for Japanese stocks. She described Matsui, who was named
managing director in 1998 and partner in 2000, as a serious,
energetic and honest person who doesn''t micromanage. </p>
<h2>Long Hours </h2>
<p>''She''s tough mentally and physically and sticks to her
schedule,'' Suzuki said in an interview on Jan. 10. ''She always
tries her best to fulfill what she intends to do. Even if she
has five minutes to the deadline, she focuses on what she can do
within that time.'' </p>
<p>A nanny has enabled Matsui to work long hours and travel,
while her husband, Koll, runs Japanese equity research at
JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. The biggest challenge came in
2001, after her second child was born, when she was diagnosed
with breast cancer. </p>
<p>''Just when I thought nothing could go wrong, everything
went wrong,'' she said. ''You just don''t know what twists and
turns life brings. I was naturally shocked when I received my
diagnosis, but facing my mortality at the age of 36 was actually
a giant wake-up call.'' </p>
<p>She took eight months off to recuperate in California with
her parents and received chemotherapy. She returned to Goldman
Sachs wearing a wig, deciding that staying at home all the time
would be more stressful. </p>
<h2>''Demonstrating Womenomics'' </h2>
<p>''I saw how hard she worked when she faced difficulties and
I learned what it''s like to be a strategist,'' said Naoki Kamiyama, who worked for Matsui from 2000 to 2002 and is now
chief equity strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co.
''In a way, she''s demonstrating womenomics by herself. It''s
perfectionism. She embodies it.'' </p>
<p>Matsui''s travel usually keeps her away from her family for
two to three months a year, triggering ''maternal guilt,'' she
said. ''While it may be a sign that you''re really busy, I always
feel guilty about spending so much time away from my husband and
children.'' </p>
<p>Yoga at 8 a.m. on Saturdays helps her body, and Nutella, a
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, warms her spirit. When times are
toughest, though, Matsui said she thinks about her mother. </p>
<p>''I learned a tremendous amount from my mother and
developed a newfound respect for her the minute I became a
mother myself,'' she said. ''Whenever I have those moments when
I''m really stressed out, I just think about what my mom had to
go through and it puts everything in perspective.'' </p>

cost and the Alberta government and the other partner in the
venture, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ), have committed to
further financing through the purchase of C$600 million of

<p>Alberta''s government, which has the top AAA rating from
Moody''s Investors Service, Standard  Poor''s and DBRS,
has agreed to pay down three-quarters of the debt over 30 years

<p>Nickel, the best-performing
industrial metal this year, may extend its rally as Indonesia''s
ban on unprocessed ore exports crimps supply, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman raised its 12-month price target on the metal used
in stainless steel to $16,000 a metric ton from $15,000,
analysts including Christian Lelong said in a report today. That
would mean a 10 percent gain from now. Goldman also listed zinc
and palladium among its top picks on tightening supplies, while
iron ore and copper have ''the greatest downside'' risks, it
said. </p>
<p>Nickel climbed 4.8 percent this year, the most among the
six major metals on the London Metal Exchange as Indonesia
restricted shipments starting Jan. 12. The global nickel market
may swing into a deficit next year, Barclays Plc and Macquarie
Group Ltd. estimate, while Citigroup Inc. forecasts the price at
$17,000 a ton this quarter. </p>
<p>''We are increasingly bullish on nickel on a 12-month
horizon,'' Lelong and other analysts said in the report. ''The
marginal cost of nickel supply will rise sharply as a result of
the recent ban on unprocessed ore exports from Indonesia, with
the potential for a shortage of nickel ore in late 2014.'' </p>
<p>Goldman''s base case scenario is for a balanced nickel
market in 2014 and a moderate deficit in 2015, which assumes
some relaxation of the export ban by Indonesia, the top producer
of mined nickel. Prices will ''substantially overshoot'' the
bank''s projections if the country doesn''t relax the ban,
according to the report. </p>
<p>Nickel for delivery in three months on the LME touched
$14,750 a ton on Jan. 17, the highest since Oct. 30, and traded
at $14,560 a ton at 1:33 p.m. in Hong Kong. Copper was little
changed at $7,318 a ton and is down 0.6 percent this year. </p>
<p>Iron ore and copper may decline 21 percent and 15 percent,
respectively, amid forecast surpluses this year, according to
the bank''s report. Its 12-month estimate for copper was
unchanged $6,200 a ton, it said. The outlook for the next 12
months for zinc was also remained the same at $2,100 a ton. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s co-head
of investment banking in Brazil, Fabio Bicudo, will leave the
company 10 months after taking the job. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs confirmed his departure yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The firm declined to say whether it will
replace Bicudo, who has led Brazil investment banking since
March with co-head Antonio Pereira. </p>
<p>Bicudo said in a separate statement he had been invited to
lead a Brazilian company he declined to name. Reuters reported
that Bicudo will become chief executive officer of Eneva SA, the
utility controlled by EON SE and former billionaire Eike
Batista, citing a person familiar with the matter. Eneva
declined to comment. </p>
<p>At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
Sachs''s revenue from investment banking had been falling in
Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
people familiar with the matter said last year. </p>
<p>About a quarter of Goldman Sachs''s roughly 45-person Brazil
investment-banking division have departed, four people with
knowledge of the moves said in November. </p>
<p>''Our headcount in Brazil is going to be steady at around
300 people, though it may go up 5 percent or down 5 percent,''
Stephen Scherr, Goldman Sachs''s chief for Latin America and
global head of the investment bank''s financing group, said in an
interview in New York in October. ''The composition of the
people is going to change -- and that is by design,'' Scherr
said, declining to comment on specific departures. </p>
<p>Bicudo and Pereira were named co-heads of investment
banking for the country after Daniel Wainstein, one of only two
Goldman Sachs partners who are Brazilian, left the company in
June after 13 years. Wainstein joined New York-based Greenhill 
Co. in October. </p>

<p>Most U.S. stocks rose as investors assessed earnings from companies including Norfolk Southern Corp., Coach (COH) Inc., International Business Machines Corp. </p> <p>Norfolk Southern, the second-largest U.S. eastern railroad, climbed 4.8 percent after posting a fourth-quarter profit that exceeded analysts'' estimates. BlackBerry Ltd. rose 8.6 percent as the smartphone maker said it plans to sell most of its Canadian real estate to raise cash for its turnaround plan. Coach, the largest U.S. luxury handbag maker, slumped 6 percent after sales missed analysts'' estimates. IBM slid 3.3 percent as revenue declined for a seventh consecutive quarter amid weaker demand for servers. </p> <p>Three stocks rose for every two that declined in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. (SPX) The U.S. equity benchmark added less than 0.1 percent to 1,844.86 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 41.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 16,373.34 for a second day of declines. About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 3 percent above the three-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>''Earnings are all that matters,'' Dan Morris, who helps oversee about $564 billion as global investment strategist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management in New York, said in a phone interview. ''To see the justification for meaningful higher prices, we just need to wait for earnings to catch up and accelerate a bit and that may take a quarter or two.'' </p> <h2>Quarterly Results </h2> <p>Twenty-five companies in the SP 500 including Northern Trust Corp., Netflix Inc. and EBay Inc. report earnings today. Of the 86 index members that have posted results so far this season, 70 percent have beaten estimates for profit and 65 percent have exceeded sales projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Per-share profit for companies in the benchmark probably climbed 6 percent in the fourth quarter, while sales increased 2.2 percent, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p> <p>A five-year rally that lifted the SP 500 up more than 170 percent from a bear-market low has boosted equity valuations to near the highest level since 2009. The index trades at 15.6 times the estimated earnings of its members, more than the five-year average multiple of 14.1, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p> <h2>Mixed Earnings </h2> <p>The Dow is diverging from the SP 500 by the most in more than two years amid weaker results from companies such as Johnson  Johnson and IBM. The average difference between their performance in the past three days has been 0.5 percentage point, the most since October 2011. </p> <p>''Earnings have been mixed,'' David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis, said in a phone interview. His firm manages about $120 billion. ''If we as a country, we as a world, stay in the muted economic growth we''ve experienced in the past two years, the market probably can''t support the valuations here. We need better economic numbers and we need earnings to follow that.'' </p> <p>Traders are buying record amounts of options that pay off if the calm that is blanketing markets proves temporary. Outstanding call options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) has reached a record 8.4 million, exceeding the previous high of 7.7 million in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>The contracts, which expire today, are used by investors as insurance against losses because the VIX usually climbs when equities fall. Investors are positioning for stock swings with more than 180 companies in the SP 500 getting ready to release quarterly results by the end of next week. The VIX slid 0.2 percent today to 12.84, bringing its decline for 2014 to 6.4 percent. </p> <h2>Norfolk Southern </h2> <p>Energy, consumer-discretionary and industrial stocks rose the most among 10 main industries in the SP 500, climbing more than 0.2 percent. Telephone and raw-materials companies dropped at least 0.7 percent for the worst performance. </p> <p>Norfolk Southern jumped 4.8 percent to $92.94. The company''s profit exceeded analysts'' forecast amid higher shipments of chemicals, automotive and agricultural products. </p> <p>BlackBerry rose 8.6 percent to $10.78. The company said in a statement that it will work with CBRE Group Inc. to sell vacant properties as well as occupied space it will then lease back from the new owners. </p> <p>Textron (TXT) Inc. advanced 5.3 percent to $38. The manufacturer of Cessna aircraft said it earned 60 cents a share in the fourth quarter. That beat the average analyst estimate by 1 cent. </p> <p>Brinker International Inc. (EAT), which owns Chili''s Grill  Bar restaurants, climbed 6.5 percent to $49.72. The restaurant chain reported second-quarter profit and sales above analysts'' estimates. </p> <h2>Nuance, Coach </h2> <p>Nuance Communications Inc. jumped 7.8 percent to $16.05. The provider of voice applications to corporate customers said first-quarter preliminary adjusted earnings per share probably amounted to 23 cents to 24 cents, more than the 20-cent average estimate of analysts. The company predicted profit of 18 cents to 21 cents a share in November. </p> <p>Coach slid 6 percent to $49.38. Revenue for the quarter through Dec. 28 amounted to $1.42 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.48 billion. The maker of luxury accessories posted earnings per share of $1.06, falling short of the $1.11 that analysts had projected. </p> <h2>IBM, Motorola </h2> <p>IBM (IBM) dropped 3.3 percent to $182.25 for the biggest retreat in the Dow. The world''s biggest computer-services provider said revenue declined to $27.7 billion in the three months through December. Profit dropped at the company''s hardware unit partly because of its x86 server business, according to Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter. </p> <p>Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) slumped 12 percent to $3.67 for the biggest drop since October. The maker of processors for personal computers predicted that revenue will be from $1.29 billion to $1.38 billion in the first quarter. The average analyst projection had called for sales of $1.37 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey. </p> <p>Motorola Solutions Inc. fell 3.9 percent to $64.51.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s solar

India for the first time, enticed by government grants. </p>
<p>ReNew Solar Power Ltd. bid for 50 megawatts, according to a
list from state-run Solar Energy Corporation of India. The
company is a unit of ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a developer
backed by a $385 million investment from Goldman Sachs, Sumant
Sinha, chief executive officer of ReNew Power, said by e-mail. </p>
<p>First Solar, the world''s biggest maker of thin-film modules
and a top panel supplier in India, bid for 30 megawatts. The
Tempe, Arizona-based company is diversifying into building
plants and selling power, betting that''s a better way to make
money than competing with Chinese rivals on panel sales. </p>
<p>The tender is the most attractive yet in a market expected
to draw $11.7 billion of investment by 2017 as the cost of solar
power drops to equal that of other sources, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. For the first time, India is
offering grants that will improve plants'' revenue security by
allowing them to produce power more cheaply rather than relying
on cash-strapped state utilities to pay above-market tariffs. </p>
<p>World Bank-backed Azure Power India Pvt. and Welspun Energy
Ltd., a unit of Leon Black''s Apollo Global Management LLC-backed
Welspun Group, entered bids for the most capacity, 200 megawatts
and 160 megawatts respectively. </p>
<p>Solar Energy Corp. will evaluate technical bids first and
open the financial offers by the end of February, Managing
Director Rajendra Nimje said this week. Previous tenders in the
country drove rates for solar power down to record lows. </p>

in panel prices from a three-year slide and the rupee''s
volatility raise project costs, Gaurav Sood, managing director
of French developer Solairedirect SA''s local unit, said in an e-mail. Solairedirect, which bid for 30 megawatts of capacity, won

average at the time. </p>

<p>It wasn''t long after Ericsson AB Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg was identified as a contender for the top job at Microsoft Corp. before phones were ringing off the hook at the telecom supplier''s Stockholm offices. </p> <p>The Jan. 15 revelation was the main topic in at least one hastily convened meeting the next morning, according to a person who attended and isn''t allowed to speak publicly on the matter.

The candidacy is likely to be discussed at an Ericsson board meeting before the end of the month, another person said. </p> <p>Vestberg joins a growing list of executives whose staff were jolted by news that their boss is being wooed by another company -- in this case, to succeed Microsoft''s Steve Ballmer.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Westpac
Banking Corp. pushed back their forecasts for when Australia''s
central bank will lower interest rates, with the strongest
inflation in two years offsetting rising joblessness. </p>
<p>They join Bank of America Corp. and Royal Bank of Canada,
which shifted their predictions in the past three months. The
estimates for delayed easing come as reports paint a mixed
picture of the economy''s transition to new growth sources amid
the ebbing of a mining boom. Having priced in a 26 percent
chance of a first-quarter rate cut after the weak jobs report on
Jan. 16, swaps traders slashed the odds to 11 percent after Jan.
22 data showed inflation was accelerating. </p>
<p>''There are some fundamental problems in the economy,''
said Stephen Walters, JPMorgan''s chief economist in Australia,
citing below-trend growth and rising unemployment in a phone
interview yesterday. ''Yet, an inflation number like that makes
it difficult for the Reserve Bank to do anything about those
issues in the near term.'' </p>
<p>A report this week showed the trimmed mean gauge of core
prices unexpectedly rose 2.6 percent in the last three months of
2013 from a year earlier, climbing above the mid-point of the
central bank''s target range and the strongest reading since
2011. That followed data showing the worst annual drop in full-time jobs in more than two decades. Australia''s Treasury
predicts the unemployment rate will increase to 6 percent by
July 1, the highest since 2003, from 5.8 percent in December. </p>
<p>The pickup in the pace of consumer-price gains is ''almost
exclusively'' due to a decline in the Australian dollar last
year, Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. The acceleration will prove short-lived
and policy rates will be cut once the data confirms this
outlook, he wrote. </p>
<h2>''Secondary Impact'' </h2>
<p>''Weakness in domestic demand will contain the secondary
impact on inflation from the weaker currency,'' Evans wrote.
''The Reserve Bank is likely to require convincing evidence of
our assessment of inflation risks before it opts for lower
interest rates.'' </p>
<p>Australia''s cash rate stands at a record-low 2.5 percent.
Westpac now sees it at 2 percent by the end of 2014, after two
0.25 percentage point reductions in the second half. That
compares with a previous call for cuts in the second and third
quarters. </p>
<p>Bank of America said in a Jan. 10 note that the RBA will
trim its benchmark to 2.25 percent by mid-year, from an earlier
prediction for February. RBC pushed its call for a quarter-point
cut to the three months through June, from December 2013
previously, according to an Oct. 14 report. </p>
<p>The median forecast of 29 economists is for the cash rate
to remain unchanged through 2014, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. </p>
<h2>Lower Aussie </h2>
<p>The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent this week to 87.68
U.S. cents as of 9 a.m. in Sydney and yesterday touched 87.32,
the lowest level since July 2010. </p>
<p>Further declines may be limited by prospects inflation
pressures will keep the central bank from lowering its key rate
further after slashing it 2.25 percentage points over two years. </p>
<p>The RBA has indicated it would prefer a lower exchange rate
to stimulate the economy. Governor Glenn Stevens said last month
in an Australian Financial Review interview that a level of 85
U.S. cents would be ''closer to the mark.'' The Aussie won''t
fall to that level until the final quarter of this year,
according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Policy makers will probably keep trying to verbally drive
the local currency lower, according to JPMorgan''s Walters. </p>
<p>Even so, ''it''s very difficult, seemingly, for the Aussie
to break meaningfully to the downside,'' said Walters, who sees
the currency at 87 by Dec. 31. ''The onus is going to be on the
cash rate to do the work.'' </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) agreed to sell its low-end server business for $2.3 billion to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), decreasing its reliance on computer hardware as sales of the products plunge. </p> <p>The deal price includes about $2 billion of cash, with the rest coming in shares of Beijing-based Lenovo, the two companies said today in a statement today. The transaction now faces regulatory scrutiny, including a likely national-security review that could slow or scuttle the purchase. </p> <p>Related: IBM Predicts Success in U.S. Review of Levono Deal</p><p>IBM reported its seventh straight quarter of declining revenue this week, hurt by a shrinking computer-hardware business. While the company will continue to sell a range of higher-end servers and mainframes, offloading the x86 division removes a low-margin business from its books. Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is focusing more on software and services in a bid to reignite sales and meet an ambitious goal of $20 a share in earnings by next year. </p> <p>''We were no longer in a position to get the kinds of returns that we wanted,'' Steve Mills, senior vice president of software and systems at Armonk, New York-based IBM, said in an interview. ''We wouldn''t do this if we didn''t see the obvious taking place in the market.'' </p> <h2>Share Slide </h2> <p>Today''s announcement followed on-again, off-again negotiations between the two sides. Talks had broken down last year over the price of the asset, then valued at $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The negotiations resumed in November, according to Lenovo Chief Financial Officer Wong Wai Ming. Lenovo disclosed earlier this week that it was in preliminary discussions about an unnamed acquisition, spurring speculation that the agreement was finally close to being reached. </p> <p>IBM shares gained less than 1 percent to $182.73 at the close in New York. The hardware slump has taken a toll on the stock over the past year: It slid 2.1 percent in 2013, making IBM the only decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Trading of Lenovo''s shares, meanwhile, was halted today because of the agreement. </p> <p>As part of the deal, Lenovo will get IBM servers that use x86 processors, an industry-standard technology developed by Intel Corp. The transaction also includes BladeCenter and Flex System blade-style servers -- slim devices that slide into racks -- along with switches that run corporate computer networks. IBM will keep its System z mainframes, Power servers, storage systems and other higher-end hardware. </p> <p>The x86 division''s more than 7,000 employees are expected to move to Lenovo, Mills said. He declined to comment on whether there would be job cuts. </p> <h2>Value Versus Volume </h2> <p>The idea is to stick to products where IBM can add value. The x86 server business has become an industry of large volumes and slim margins -- where one competitor''s products are hard to distinguish from another''s. </p> <p>''Value is something that we are very good at selling,'' Mills said. ''Volume is a challenge.'' </p> <p>Revenue at IBM''s systems and technology business, which sells mainframes, servers and other hardware, declined 26 percent last quarter. The segment''s gross margin -- the percentage of sales remaining after taking out production costs -- also is getting squeezed. It fell 3.5 percentage points to 36 percent last year. That compares with an 89 percent margin for its software business. </p> <p>''They continue to divest their lower-margin hardware business line and this is just continuing down that path,'' Brian Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group in New York, said in an interview. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the shares. </p> <h2>PC Expansion </h2> <p>Lenovo comes to the deal from the opposite perspective. As the world''s largest maker of personal computers, it already sells millions of relatively low-margin products. The x86 servers run on the same technology as PCs, and the transaction will help Lenovo escalate competition with current rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Dell Inc. </p> <p>Today''s agreement also builds on Lenovo''s 2005 purchase of IBM''s PC unit for $1.25 billion, excluding debt. That acquisition gave Lenovo a foothold in the U.S. and put it on the path to ultimately unseating Hewlett-Packard as the top PC maker last year. As part of the legacy of that agreement, Lenovo operates a U.S. base in Morrisville, North Carolina, potentially mitigating concerns that a Chinese company is taking over IBM''s server business. </p> <p>Though the PC industry is suffering its worst-ever decline, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing has maintained growth by adding mobile devices and pushing ThinkPad notebooks into markets across Europe and South America. Along the way, Lenovo''s shares have climbed for five straight years. The stock hit a 52-week high in the past week, making Yang''s 7.7 percent stake worth $1.06 billion. The 49-year-old has a net worth of $1.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. </p> <h2>Biggest Acquisition </h2> <p>Buying the x86 server division -- the biggest acquisition in Lenovo''s history -- will give it more insulation against the PC slump. While IBM has struggled with the business, the products have higher margins than laptops and they''ll add about $4.6 billion in annual revenue. </p> <p>''This deal is relatively transformational for Lenovo,'' said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in Hong Kong. ''If Lenovo can control expenses and enjoy some of the higher gross margins in this business, which are above Lenovo''s PC margins, then this could be a very good deal for them.'' </p> <p>Yang had been seeking to increase Lenovo''s share of the global server business to between 5 percent and 10 percent within three years. Today''s deal beats that goal by itself. Lenovo will have about 14 percent of the market when the transaction is completed, up from less than 2 percent now, Senior Vice President Peter Hortensius said in an interview. </p> <h2>Corporate Equipment </h2> <p>Lenovo''s 2005 deal with IBM vaulted Lenovo from the No. 8 PC maker to third. The company later bought control of Germany''s Medion AG and NEC Corp.''s PC division in Japan. The acquisitions helped Lenovo reach the top spot in PC shipments in the second quarter of last year. Lenovo kept that position in the latest quarter, helped by a 6.6 percent increase in shipments, according to research firm Gartner Inc. </p> <p>The overall PC industry is hurting, though, with shipments shrinking 10 percent in 2013, according to Gartner. Yang wants to build future growth on mobile devices and information technology, supplying equipment and services to corporate and government customers. </p> <p>''For the past 20 years, PCs were our core business,'' he said in an interview. ''This deal will meet our strategy and give us a good foundation for the enterprise business. We hope we quickly can build it into $10 billion in annual sales, from $4.6 billion now.'' </p> <h2>Enterprise Services </h2> <p>IBM was the third-largest seller of x86 servers in the third quarter, trailing Hewlett-Packard and Dell, according to IDC. It sold $1.21 billion worth of the machines in the period, accounting for 13 percent of the industry''s $9.52 billion total. Lenovo didn''t rank among the top 10. </p> <p>''Due to the strong IBM client base, Lenovo can enter the top-tier enterprise services market,'' Tony Yang, an analyst at BOCI Research Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a report. ''The service business will be Lenovo''s major driver in the future.'' </p> <p>Even so, selling servers to Internet companies has become more challenging. Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and other online services are increasingly building their own data centers with custom machines that use Intel technology. That cuts server sellers out of the loop. </p> <h2>Deal Funding </h2> <p>To pay for the purchase, Lenovo can draw on a cash hoard that was worth $2.46 billion as of Sept. 30. The company said in October that it could also finance a large purchase by issuing equity. </p> <p>Since selling the PC division to Lenovo, IBM has divested other units, including printers and retail-store systems. The recent performance of the server business made it logical to offload it as well, Mills said. </p> <p>''Our business model is to seek out areas of the IT industry where we could get both growth and profits,'' he said. ''If one of those things falls away, then we obviously move to other approaches.'' </p> <p>Still, the Lenovo deal isn''t certain to close. The transaction may trigger a U.S. security review -- especially since it involves a Chinese buyer. Proposed transactions by Chinese companies accounted for about 20 percent of reviews in 2012 by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. </p> <p>The panel consists of the heads of federal agencies, including the departments of Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and State, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Amid concerns about hacking and cyber espionage by China, the country has become the committee''s most highly scrutinized nation, supplanting the U.K. </p> <h2>Submitting Information </h2> <p>Lenovo''s Hortensius said the company wouldn''t have done the deal if they didn''t think it would pass U.S. regulators. To move the process along, IBM will soon submit information to regulators, said Chris Padilla, the company''s vice president for governmental programs. </p> <p>Even if the deal clears those hurdles, Lenovo could still lose some IBM customers in the U.S., though that may be offset by gains in its home market of China, said Stephen Yang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial. </p> <p>''Lenovo may still face some headwinds selling servers to American institutions and corporates due to worries over counterintelligence,'' Yang said. ''Lenovo would likely focus on growing its China market first, like they''ve always done with any business.'' </p> <p>', 'Lenovo to Buy IBM Server Unit for $2.3 Billion Amid Slump', 'By Alex Barinka', 'Jan 23, 2014  4:23 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-23/lenovo-to-buy-ibm-server-unit-for-2-3-billion-amid-pc-slump.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Bond investors are losing their
aversion to difficult-to-trade corporate debt that handed them
some of the biggest losses in the credit crisis. </p>
<p>The extra yield note buyers demand to own older, smaller
junk bonds that trade infrequently has shrunk to an average 0.25
percentage point this month from more than 1 percentage point a
year ago, according to Barclays Plc data. JPMorgan Chase  Co.
money manager Jim Shanahan said he''s preferring ''good credit
quality and less liquidity'' when picking bonds, while Howard Marks, the head of distressed debt investor Oaktree Capital
Group LLC (OAK), said he''s finding bigger potential gains in private,
less-traded debt. </p>
<p>The evaporating premium for illiquid assets is showing the
depths to which money managers are reaching to boost returns
after a five-year rally that pushed relative yields on junk
bonds to the least since August 2007. With Federal Reserve
monetary policies suppressing interest-rate benchmarks for a
sixth year, credit buyers are showing more concern that they''ll
miss out on a continued rally than get stuck with debt that lost
26 percent during the market seizure in 2008. </p>
<p>''For the past several years, people have been concerned
about liquidity,'' said Eric Gross, a credit strategist at
Barclays in New York. ''Now we''re hearing more about people
seeking out illiquid bonds.'' </p>
<h2>Fragile Market </h2>
<p>Such debt tends to be more vulnerable to price swings when
market sentiment deteriorates, because there are fewer buyers to
bid on it when investor withdrawals force money managers to
sell. Those risks intensified after stricter banking rules
accelerated a pullback by Wall Street dealers that used their
own money to facilitate trading. </p>
<p>Primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed cut their
holdings of corporate bonds by 76 percent to $56 billion after
peaking at $235 billion in 2007, Fed data through March show.
After the central bank changed the way it reported the holdings
in April, net speculative-grade bond holdings fell as much as 24
percent to a low of $5.63 billion in May before rising to $7.7
billion on Jan. 8. </p>
<p>Investors are demanding an average yield of 5.94 percent to
own bonds sold at least 18 months ago in batches of less than
$250 million, Barclays data show. That compares with an average
5.7 percent for newer debt offerings of at least $500 million.
The gap, which averaged 0.5 percentage point last year and 0.92
percentage point in 2012, reached as much as 1.95 percentage
points at the peak of the financial crisis in March 2009. </p>
<h2>''Classic'' Cycle </h2>
<p>The yield on MGM Resort International''s $238 million of
6.875 percent notes, which were issued in 2006 and mature in
April 2016, has dropped 2.4 percentage points during the past
year to 1.85 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
That compares with a decline of 0.5 percentage point to 5.4
percent on the casino owner''s $1.25 billion offering of nine-year, 6.625 percent securities in December 2012. </p>
<p>''As people continue to look for yield and performance,
they''re willing to move into less-liquid areas of the market,''
said Shanahan, who manages high-yield credit investments for
JPMorgan''s $1.5 trillion asset management unit. ''You''re seeing
a classic market cycle of people looking for pockets of value.'' </p>
<h2>''Intoxicating Brew'' </h2>
<p>With corporate borrowers selling record volumes of debt to
lock in all-time low yields amid global central bank stimulus,
''there is a tremendous and potentially unsustainable amount of
paper in investors'' hands, and this harsh reality is causing
much angst,'' according to a McKinsey  Co. and Greenwich
Associates report in August. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher, a
former managing partner of a fund that bought distressed debt,
said in a speech last week that he''d ''have to hire Sherlock
Holmes to find a single distressed company priced attractively
enough to buy.'' </p>
<p>Five years after the Fed started holding benchmark rates at
about zero and pumping more than $3 trillion into the financial
system to ignite growth, Fisher warned in the Jan. 14 remarks to
the National Association of Corporate Directors that signs are
emerging that Fed stimulus has made for ''an intoxicating
brew.'' </p>
<h2>Economic Boost </h2>
<p>Even as the central bank starts slowing monthly bond
purchases to $75 billion from $85 billion, yields on dollar-denominated speculative-grade bonds have fallen to 6.21 percent,
0.22 percentage point from the record low in May 2013, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>The securities, which provide bigger cushions of extra
yield over benchmark rates than higher-rated debt, are governed
by idiosyncratic deal documents and aren''t as frequently traded.
While trading in speculative-grade bonds has risen, volumes have
failed to keep pace with a market that''s expanded 71 percent
since 2008 as Wall Street''s biggest banks reduce their holdings
of riskier assets in the face of new regulations. </p>
<p>Speculative-grade, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by
Moody''s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard 
Poor''s. </p>
<p>Investors are emboldened by a U.S. economy that will
probably expand by 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent in 2015
from 1.9 percent in last year, according to a Bloomberg survey
of 83 economists. High-yield bond funds have received $3.85
billion of deposits since the end of September, according to
data compiled by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, as investors
gained conviction that the U.S. economic recovery was
strengthening. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.7 percent by
Dec. 31 from 10 percent in October 2009. </p>
<h2>More Homework </h2>
<p>''Money has found it very easy to flow into public,
mainstream things,'' said Marks, Oaktree''s chairman, in a Dec.
10 presentation for investors. ''The best credit opportunities
are in niche markets.'' </p>
<p>He said the firm is earning about 11.5 percent to extend
loans to smaller companies, about twice as much as the yield on
a junk bond of comparable quality. </p>
<p>These deals are small and ''entirely illiquid,'' he said.
''It requires a lot of due diligence.'' </p>
<p>Publicly traded business-development corporations, which
lend to the smallest and riskiest companies, attracted $4.1
billion last year, the most since 2007, as the firms known as
BDCs gained an average 16.4 percent. The firms are juicing
returns by borrowing about 50 cents for every dollar raised from
equity investors, up from 36 cents in 2011, according to data
compiled by Keefe, Bruyette  Woods analysts. </p>
<h2>Filling Gap </h2>
<p>BDCs and other alternative asset managers that lend to
small and mid-sized companies are filling a role traditionally
dominated by banks, J.P. Morgan Asset Management''s Shanahan said
in a telephone interview. Holding smaller, less-traded
securities can boost investor returns while maintaining a higher
level of credit quality, he said. </p>
<p>''Credit is good and likely to be good over the horizon,''
he said. ''People become less concerned about liquidity as
you''re less likely to need it in the near term.'' </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost to protect against
losses on U.S. and European corporate bonds jumped to the
highest in five weeks. La Banque Postale SA is turning to the
covered bond market to fund its mortgage business that has grown
by about 50 percent over the past four years and can no longer
be financed solely by customer deposits. </p>
<h2>Credit Benchmarks </h2>
<p>The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, rose 1.5 basis points to 67
basis points as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index
of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings increased 2.6 to

<p>Both gauges, which typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves, are trading at the highest
intraday levels since Dec. 19. Credit swaps pay the buyer face

<p>The banking unit of France''s postal service, which has a
home loan portfolio of 50 billion euros ($67.8 billion), will
now fund 20 percent of that business with covered securities,

management at the bank in Paris. </p>
<p>The lender is now the sixth-biggest mortgage lender in
France, having taken market share from Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and

<p>Goldman Sachs International Chairman
Peter Sutherland said curbs on migration are ''ridiculous'' as
employers struggle to find skilled workers. </p>
<p>''It is ridiculous to stop migration when the demographic
profile of so many countries demands it,'' including the U.K.,
he said after a panel discussion today at the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </p>
<p>Access to sufficient skilled workers is ''getting worse''
in many developed countries, while immigrants'' role in society
is ''overwhelmingly positive,'' he said. </p>
<p>Immigration has become a growing issue in British politics
in recent years as opponents of U.K. membership of the European
Union, which allows free movement of workers from across the
bloc into Britain, have become more vocal. Prime Minister David Cameron''s Conservatives say they want to see net annual
migration from outside the EU cut to below 100,000, and a leaked
Home Office document last month suggested an annual cap on
migration from within the bloc. </p>
<p>Some politicians, including Business Secretary Vince Cable
from Cameron''s Liberal Democrat coalition partners and
Conservative London Mayor Boris Johnson, have expressed
skepticism about immigration controls, warning they could hamper
British businesses. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the right investor for Dong Energy A/S, a top official of Denmark''s ruling Social Democrats said, defending the Wall Street firm against criticism from other parliament members. </p> <p>Goldman''s European merchant banking unit is seeking to buy an 18 percent stake in state-controlled Dong, a utility in need of new equity after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Some Danish lawmakers want to block the 8 billion-krone ($1.5 billion) purchase, saying Goldman Sachs bears responsibility for the global financial crisis and that the government is giving the New York-based company too much control. </p> <p>''If we were to not deal with banks until we had bashed all those who deserved to get bashed, we would never get anywhere, and we have to move on,'' Benny Engelbrecht, the Social Democrats'' business spokesman, said in an interview in Copenhagen. ''Applying that kind of logic would leave us without any banks to work with.'' </p> <p>According to the government''s Dec. 3 proposal, Goldman Sachs will be able to veto a possible sale of new shares or hybrid capital, any change in Dong''s senior management or acquisitions before a possible 2018 initial public offering. The state will retain a 57.3 percent stake in Skaerbaek-based Dong, which also operates offshore wind parks and explores for oil and gas. </p> <h2>''Fascinated'' </h2> <p>Other minority owners are ATP and PFA, the country''s two largest pension funds, as well as five local energy companies. Neither will get the same veto powers. </p> <p>The Red-Green Alliance, which has 12 of 179 seats in parliament, says the state, not Goldman Sachs, should inject the money that Dong needs. The alliance, which includes former members of Denmark''s communist party, has filed more than 100 questions to the finance ministry regarding the sales process and the privileges given to Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>''We would have liked if the government had considered who Goldman are and what they want,'' Stine Brix, the deputy financial speaker for the party, said in an interview. ''Goldman has a very doubled-faced story. On one hand, everybody is fascinated with how good they are, but they also act without guilt or remorse.'' </p> <h2>''Abusive'' </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs in July 2010 agreed to pay $550 million and change its business practices to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission''s claims that the firm misled investors in a 2007 product linked to subprime mortgages. The firm didn''t admit or deny wrongdoing. </p> <p>A U.S. Senate subcommittee''s report in 2011 said Goldman Sachs relied on ''abusive'' sales practices and was rife with conflicts of interest that encouraged putting profits ahead of clients. While Goldman Sachs said it disagreed with many of the Senate report''s finding, the firm also noted that it undertook a review of its business practices and released a 63-page report on its findings. </p> <p>''This is a long-term investment and we support the management team''s current strategy across the company''s activities, including the significant renewable energy investments,'' Sophie Ramsay, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. ''This strategy, supported by the Danish State and other minority shareholders, will create value for all shareholders in the years to come.'' </p> <h2>Morally Wrong </h2> <p>Selling to Goldman Sachs is morally wrong, jeopardizes Denmark''s green agenda and will prove to be a financial mistake, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, was quoted as saying in an interview published by newspaper Politiken today. Nyrup Rasmussen, a Social Democrat, has also served as leader of the Europe-wide socialist group in the European Union. </p> <p>Bjarne Corydon, Denmark''s current finance minister and also a Social Democrat, defended the sale in an interview broadcast by TV2 News. </p> <p>''I can understand that there''s a debate about banks'' behavior in the wake of the financial crisis,'' Corydon said in response to Nyrup Rasmussen''s comment. ''Dong was in a situation where money was needed. We have chosen a proactive answer, the green answer, by going with the investment strategy.'' </p> <h2>Opposition Growing </h2> <p>The Danish People''s Party, which has 22 seats in Denmark''s assembly, initially backed the government''s plan to find private investors for Dong. Now the party has threatened to withdraw its support. </p> <p>''We don''t understand why Goldman should be able to hire and fire the management or why they need to be able to veto the strategy when it''s already in place,'' said Rene Christensen, financial spokesman for party. ''The government says there''s no need to worry about the clauses, but that only made us more curious as to why they had to make them in the first place.'' </p> <p>Even as opposition to the Goldman Sachs deal is growing, the government will probably be able to pass the proposal with the support of the Conservative Party and the Liberals Party, Engelbrecht of the Social Democrats said. The Liberals are Denmark''s biggest opposition party. </p> <p>Engelbrecht last year led lawmakers'' push for rules that require Denmark''s biggest lenders, including Danske Bank A/S to hold additional capital reserves to prevent a future banking crisis. While Goldman played a role in the financial crisis, the bank is no worse than others, Engelbrecht said. </p> <p>''Goldman is getting bashed for the same reason Danske Bank got bashed. It''s the icon of capitalism and greed, though at a whole different level than Danske Bank,'' he said. ''The critics forget that this investment is being made by the division in Goldman that actually specializes in renewables, and with the level of professionalism displayed by Goldman, that''s not a bad thing.'' </p> <p>', 'Goldman Defended by Danish Lawmaker in Dong Buyout Dispute', 'By Peter Levring', 'Jan 23, 2014  3:08 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-23/goldman-defended-by-danish-lawmaker-in-dong-buyout-dispute.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) gave Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon a 74 percent raise to $20 million last year, bringing his pay closer to where it stood before he was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets. </p> <p>The board''s compensation package for Dimon, 57, who also serves as chairman, included $18.5 million in restricted stock, the New York-based lender said today in a regulatory filing. His salary was unchanged at $1.5 million and he got no cash bonus, according to the filing. </p> <p>Board members decided to keep Dimon''s pay below previous peak levels after criminal and regulatory probes cost JPMorgan more than $23 billion in settlements during 2013. The directors cut his 2012 package in half last January to $11.5 million, saying he bore ''ultimate responsibility'' for failures that led to derivatives trading losses in the London Whale episode. </p> <p>In raising Dimon''s pay, the board of directors cited ''sustained long-term performance; gains in market share and customer satisfaction; and the regulatory issues the company has faced and the steps the company has taken to resolve those issues,'' according to the filing. </p> <p>The restricted stock vests 50 percent after two years and 50 percent after three years, the bank said. Awarding Dimon''s total bonus in shares ties his pay ''to the company''s future performance, including continued progress on the company''s regulatory agenda,'' the firm said. </p> <h2>Performance Priority </h2> <p>The board''s compensation committee is led by Lee Raymond, 75, Exxon Mobil Corp.''s former chairman and CEO. JPMorgan''s stock climbed 33 percent last year, matching the 81-company Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index. </p> <p>''Obviously they paid more attention to the operational performance and stock-price performance and less to the litigation issues,'' said Joseph Sorrentino, a managing director at Steven Hall  Partners, a New York-based compensation consulting firm. ''Maybe there''s an argument that settling those items at those levels and removing the uncertainty there, maybe that''s worth something as well, but hard to know.'' </p> <p>Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, 44, received 80,346 shares, worth $4.65 million at the price of $57.875, the level at which Dimon''s shares were valued. Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, 43, received stock valued at $9.75 million, as did Mike Cavanagh, 48, co-head of the firm''s corporate and investment bank. </p> <h2>Shareholder Support </h2> <p>Daniel Pinto, 51, the other co-head, received the same total pay as Cavanagh, and it was structured differently because of compensation rules in the U.K. where Pinto is based, according to a person briefed on the awards. </p> <p>Any cash awards for named executives will be disclosed in the firm''s proxy statement later this year. </p> <p>Dimon became CEO at the end of 2005 and added the title of chairman a year later. His reputation as a top manager, along with his pay, has fluctuated since then. While JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as the only large U.S. bank to avoid quarterly losses, the trading debacle in 2012 prompted some investors to call for splitting his dual roles. Shareholders rejected that proposal at a meeting in May. </p> <p>Dimon was paid $49.9 million for 2007, including special stock awards. During the financial crisis a year later, he took only a $1 million salary. He got $15.2 million for 2009, and $23 million for each of the two years that followed. </p> <h2>Settlement Costs </h2> <p>In last year''s third quarter, the bank posted its first loss on Dimon''s watch after taking a $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. The deficit ended the firm''s streak of three record annual profits. Full-year net income fell 16 percent to $17.9 billion. </p> <p>Dimon pushed last year to resolve government investigations, including at least eight Justice Department probes listed in the firm''s quarterly report in October. </p> <p>Settlements since then have included a record $13 billion deal to resolve inquiries into mortgage-bond sales. The bank paid $2.6 billion and avoided criminal prosecution while settling claims it failed to stop Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. The firm also paid more than $1 billion last year tied to the botched derivatives bets, which lost more than $6.2 billion in 2012. In that case, U.S. and U.K. regulators faulted its oversight of a trader known as the London Whale because his positions were so large. </p> <p>Dimon told journalists earlier this month that he couldn''t predict whether he might be able to put the legal disputes behind the bank this year. </p> <p>', 'JPMorgan Gives CEO Dimon 74% Raise to $20 Million in 2013', 'By Michael J.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is working
for EBay Inc. (EBAY) as it faces calls from Carl Icahn to split off its
PayPal unit, people with knowledge of the matter said, the
investment bank''s latest assignment with a technology company
facing an activist investor. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is a long-time adviser to EBay on a number of
issues, Amanda Miller, spokeswoman for the online marketplace,
said while declining to discuss the specifics of the bank''s current
role regarding Icahn''s efforts. ''We did not engage them specifically 
for this matter,'' she said. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank also has advised Apple (AAPL) Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the people said, asking not to be identified
discussing private information. Apple faces calls for a bigger
stock buyback from Icahn, and Microsoft recently said it will
allow ValueAct Capital Management LLC President Mason Morfit to
join its board. </p>
<p>Investment banks are building up practices that advise
companies on how to deter and respond to activists, as the
investors garner more money and institutional backing. Funds
managed by activists have almost tripled over five years, to $93
billion at the end of last year from about $32 billion in 2008,
according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research. </p>
<p>At Goldman Sachs, the activist defense practice has been
spearheaded by partner Bill Anderson, who joined the bank in
2000. Anderson was previously an MA lawyer at Simpson Thacher 
Bartlett LLP. </p>
<h2>Engaging Activists </h2>
<p>Icahn informed EBay last week he had begun purchasing the
online marketplace''s shares and was nominating two directors to
its board, the company said. Icahn called a separation of PayPal
-- one of EBay''s faster-growing businesses -- from the company a
''no-brainer'' in an interview on Bloomberg TV. </p>
<p>Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment, as did Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Lately, companies have been more proactively engaging
activists before their efforts become public. Icahn''s demands
for for the PayPal split were disclosed by the San Jose,
California-based company in its quarterly earnings report. </p>
<p>EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe spoke with Icahn
last week and said on a conference call the company should stay
together, citing how the intertwined entity helps fund PayPal''s
expansion into areas such as mobile. The payments unit boosted
sales 19 percent last quarter, outpacing 12 percent sales growth
at EBay''s marketplace unit, which faces stiff competition from
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) </p>
<h2>Technology Targets </h2>
<p>Icahn''s EBay investment follows a string of actions by
activists taking on Silicon Valley technology firms, especially
as some of the companies'' rapid growth rates slow. Icahn has
this week tweeted that he increased his stake in Apple. </p>
<p>He is proposing that the company commit to buying back at
least $50 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2014, something that
Apple is recomending investors vote against. Goldman Sachs
advised Apple''s board as it weighed an earlier push from
Greenlight Capital Inc.''s David Einhorn to issue more preferred
stock which would pay a higher dividend than common stock. </p>
<p>Microsoft signed a pact to cooperate with ValueAct in
August, four months after the activist fund disclosed a stake of
about $1.9 billion in the software maker and at the deadline for
proxy contests ahead of a November annual meeting. ValueAct, the
San Francisco-based firm headed by Jeffrey Ubben, has since
increased its stake. </p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Microsoft said it would allow
Morfit to join the board and hold regular meetings with Morfit,
directors and select management. </p>
<p>Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co., Juniper Networks
Inc. and Riverbed Technology Inc. are also facing activist
pressure. </p>

<p>This week''s decline in financial
markets isn''t surprising because the value of those assets has
risen sharply during the past year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said. </p>
<p>''It would be very abnormal if we didn''t have consolidating
moves in the assets that have gone up so much,'' Blankfein, 59,
said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland. </p>
<p>The MSCI World Index fell 1.5 percent, the most since
August, as of 11:18 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average headed toward its biggest weekly drop since 2012 and the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 2.1 percent today, the most since
June. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid 1.5 percent,
extending its loss for the year to 5.3 percent. </p>
<p>The market is working through ''jitters'' amid a repricing
of emerging-market assets, Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn
said in a separate interview. While the recent moves are ''not
extraordinary,'' investors should expect larger swings than in
the past as banks that serve as market-makers pull back amid new
restrictions and capital rules, Cohn said. </p>
<p>''As we continue to regulate markets and continue to
increase capital charges, you''ve seen all of the banks'' reduce
capital they commit to trading, Cohn said. ''We need to get used
to seeing more and more moves like this. This is just a natural
evolution of where markets are headed.'' </p>

World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ''I''m thinking about

<p>When asked if he had seen any hiring that appeared to be a

<p>AMP Capital Australian Corporate
Bond Fund (AMPACBA), which outperformed its peers over the past decade,
prefers U.S. and European banks to the South Pacific nation''s
lenders on improving economic prospects in those two regions. </p>
<p>Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), 2013''s best-performing corporate
bond, is the fund''s biggest holding, the AMP website shows. BNP
Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase  Co. are among the top 10, which
include Westpac Banking Corp. as the only Australia-based
lender. The AMP fund returned 6.2 percent in 2013, beating 21 of
its peers, according to Morningstar Australia Pty. It topped the
ranks of funds that invest mainly in Australian bonds over the
past decade with an average return of 7.4 percent. </p>
<p>Australia''s growth will trail the U.S. for the first time
in four years as a mining boom cools, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists. The cost premium for protecting debt of
the Big Four Australian banks over U.S. counterparts touched the
most in almost six years this month. </p>
<p>''The kind of banks that we''ve identified in places like
the U.S., in parts of Europe and the U.K., and to a lesser
extent in Australia, were all going to benefit from economies
that were improving,'' said Mark Beardow, 46, who runs the A$2
billion ($1.75 billion) fund in Sydney. ''Many parts of the
global corporate bond market are continuing to meaningfully
deleverage, particularly financials.'' </p>
<h2>Six-Year High </h2>
<p>The average cost of credit-default swaps on Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, Westpac and the country''s next two biggest
lenders versus the seven biggest U.S. banks widened to 17.4
basis points on Jan. 3, the most since March 2008. It was 12.4
basis points as of yesterday. </p>
<p>Beardow, who talked by telephone yesterday, manages the
fund in Sydney with Jeff Brunton and David Carruthers. </p>
<p>U.S. economic growth will quicken by 0.9 percentage point
this year to 2.8 percent, based on Bloomberg News surveys of
economists. The euro area''s economy will go to a 1 percent
expansion from a 0.4 percent contraction. In Australia, the pace
will pick up by 0.35 percentage point to 2.75 percent. </p>
<p>The bonds of London-based Lloyds returned about 8 percent
on average last year, the most among the biggest 50 corporate
issuers in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s Global Corporate
 High Yield Index. The bank''s debt issued in Australia returned
4.95 percent in 2013, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. </p>
<h2>Big Four </h2>
<p>The returns beat the bonds of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac,
Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and National
Australia Bank Ltd., the nation''s four biggest lenders. The
latter topped the list with a 4.71 percent gain, the data show. </p>
<p>Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens cut the
benchmark interest rate to a record low of 2.5 percent last year
to maintain economic growth as the economy struggles to
diversify amid a drop-off in mining investment. </p>
<p>Beardow said he favors shorter-term securities in case
yields rise. The fund''s duration was 1.39 years in December,
versus 2.76 years for the benchmark it uses to gauge
performance, according to the AMP website. Duration is a measure
of a portfolio''s sensitivity to changes in bond yields, and a
smaller figure offers more protection should borrowing costs
increase. </p>
<p>U.S. 10-year yields will be 3 percent to 3.5 percent by
year-end, he said, from 2.76 percent as of 1:31 p.m. today in
Sydney. </p>
<p>Australian 10-year yields will climb to 4.25-4.75 percent,
according to Beardow, from 4.05 percent today. Yields on U.S.
and Australian government securities due in 10 years and longer
have a correlation of 0.948. A figure of 1 means they move in
lock-step. </p>
<h2>''Fair Value'' </h2>
<p>''Now we think rates are largely fair value,'' he said.
''We see fair value continuing to edge up.'' The RBA will keep
its benchmark at 2.5 percent this year, he said. </p>
<p>Bill Evans, the top-ranked chief economist at Westpac, says
Stevens will need to cut the benchmark rate to 2 percent. Evans
is the most accurate forecaster on Australia''s economy,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''I would expect to see yields down in this country,''
Evans said in a Jan. 24 interview. ''That would suggest that you
should be buying bonds. We''re not concerned about any credit
risks associated with the banking sector. Bank bonds would
similarly track the capital appreciation that we''re expecting in
government bonds.'' </p>
<p>Ten-year yields will fall to 4 percent by year-end, Evans
said in a Bloomberg survey of banks conducted Jan. 16 to Jan.
21. It was the lowest forecast among 15 responses. An investor
who bought today would earn about 4 percent if the forecast is
correct, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The AMP Australian Corporate fund can invest up to 30
percent of its assets in global corporate bonds, Beardow said.
The challenge is to generate income with company notes and
protect returns against higher borrowing costs, he said. </p>
<p>''We''re pretty positive about the economy,'' he said. ''We
want to be particularly active around the possibility that
yields do rise very sharply, and we''re keeping duration pretty
short.'' </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, who got a 74 percent raise for his work in

<p>The bank''s board of directors, having delayed a decision

collect 2 million stock options originally granted in 2008 and

<p>Japanese leaders are unlikely to
roll out major new economic policies to boost growth this year,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Officials who fought deflation last year through measures
including quantitative easing, monetary stimulus and increased
government spending will opt for policy stability, said Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at the New York-based bank. </p>
<p>''This year, I don''t think you are going to get major
bazooka-type policy announcements,'' Matsui said in an interview
to Bloomberg Radio today. ''I think it is more a question of
looking for the fundamental improvement both in the macro
economy and corporate level.'' </p>
<p>Japan has pledged to forge ahead with structural reforms
designed to open business opportunities in industries from
health care to agriculture as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe leads
efforts to break the legacy of 15 years of deflation. The
administration''s attempts helped propel Japan''s Topix index of
shares up 51 percent last year, its best performance since 1999. </p>
<p>Abe''s stimulus program caused an 18 percent weakening in
the yen against the dollar last year, helping exporters. The
Japanese currency fell 0.1 percent to 102.79 per greenback as of
9:45 p.m. in Tokyo today, while the benchmark 10-year yield was
at 0.63 percent compared with 0.745 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Matsui said the depreciation in yen is not completely
beneficial to Japan as it increased the cost of growing fossil-fuel imports in the wake of nuclear-plant shutdowns. Japan
reported a record annual trade deficit for 2013. </p>
<p>''The weaker the yen becomes the more expensive that fuel
becomes, so it is not a unanimous positive for everybody,'' she
said. ''Therefore, I think the currency at this kind of level
anywhere from 100 or around 100 yen to a dollar is actually not
too bad for most companies be they exporters or importers.'' </p>

percent in Copenhagen at the end of last week, the highest since
Nov. 7. It yielded 5.67 percent on Jan. 9 before the criticism
intensified over New York-based Goldman''s investment. That was

<p>A measure of U.S. corporate credit
risk dropped the most in seven weeks as data showed consumer
confidence firming and emerging market stocks snapped three days
of losses. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $3.2 billion of bonds. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 2.7 basis points to
69.9 basis points at 4:21 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The measure fell the most since Dec. 6. </p>
<p>Investors pushed the gauge lower as emerging markets rose
and the Conference Board''s index of U.S. consumer confidence
climbed to 80.7 in January from a revised 77.5 the prior month,
according to the private research group. An increase in consumer
activity would bolster companies'' ability to repay debts. </p>
<p>''It''s an overall improved tone in the global markets with
emerging markets doing much better today than they have in the
last three sessions,'' Adrian Miller, director of fixed-income
strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New York, said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Emerging-market equities advanced as a surprise rate
increase in India bolstered bets central banks will shore up
their currencies. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.3
percent to 934.81 at 4:11 p.m. in New York. </p>
<h2>Apple Risk </h2>
<p>The credit swaps measure typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. </p>
<p>The cost to protect the debt of Apple Inc. (AAPL) for five years
jumped 9 basis points to 35 basis points as of 3:18 p.m. in New
York, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw
Hill Financial Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. That''s the biggest rise since Nov.
25. </p>
<p>Apple reported iPhone sales for the holiday season that
missed analysts'' estimates. For its fiscal first quarter ended
Dec. 28, Apple said it sold a record 51 million iPhones, below
analysts'' forecast of 54.7 million handsets. The company also
projected revenue in the current period may fall from a year
earlier, in what would be the first quarterly sales decline
since 2003. </p>
<h2>Goldman Offering </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs issued $2.5 billion of 2.625 percent, five-year notes to yield 112.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The securities may be rated Baa1 by Moody''s Investors Service,
the data show. </p>
<p>The Wall Street bank with the highest return on equity also
sold $700 million of additional securities to its existing $1
billion of 1.34 percent floating-rate notes that come due in
November 2018. The debt pays 110 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Bonds of Goldman Sachs were the most actively traded
dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
accounting for 5.3 percent of the volume of dealer trades of $1
million or more as of 4:47 p.m. in New York, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. </p>
<h2>Distress Ratio </h2>
<p>The U.S. distress ratio decreased to 5.2 percent in January
from 5.3 percent in December, analysts led by Diane Vazza at
Standard  Poor''s said in a statement. The ratio has remained
within the 5 percent to 6 percent range over the past 10 months,
which is close to its 2004-2006 average of 5.7 percent. </p>
<p>SP''s ratio is the number of distressed securities divided
by the total number of speculative-grade issues. </p>
<p>The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, tied to the debt of 100 speculative-grade
companies, narrowed 12.2 basis points to 337.4, Bloomberg prices
show. Junk or high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s
and less than BBB- at SP. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. </p>

corporate bonds rather than government debt was little changed

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s push to export U.S. oil overseas is facing a new obstacle: falling gasoline prices. </p> <p>A flood of new oil from Texas to the Great Plains has swamped refineries, driving down prices at the pump 10 percent since March, while global oil prices have hovered at about $107 a barrel. That suggests the world crude market is having waning influence on U.S. gasoline, which instead is beginning to track lower-priced domestic oil. </p> <p>U.S. supplies are having a greater impact because they''re making up a bigger part of the gasoline market, supplying about 53 percent today, compared with 34 percent less than three years ago. </p> <p>As cheaper oil translates to cheaper gasoline, Exxon and ConocoPhillips will have a tougher time convincing legislators that ending export restrictions that date back to 1970s oil shortages would benefit the nation, said Sandy Fielden, director of energy analytics at consultant RBN Energy LLC. </p> <p>If more exports are allowed, ''The most obvious thing that''s going to happen is that crude prices will go up and so will gasoline,'' Fielden said. </p> <p>Investors are betting the trend will continue, and that West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for oil, will drop about 17 percent by December 2016. A contract for delivery in that month trades at about $80 a barrel, compared with about $97 today. </p>

Senator Lisa Murkowski, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has joined Exxon, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in calling for an end to crude export restrictions that were put in place after the Arab oil embargo in 1973 triggered gasoline shortages in the U.S. Close

<p>A rate cut is the European Central
Bank''s best option to respond to rising borrowing costs in euro-area money markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note. </p>
<p>Overnight interbank rates were above the central bank''s
benchmark interest rate this month for the longest stretch since
2011. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Jan. 9 that officials
are ready to ''act as needed'' in response to ''unwarranted
tightening of the short-term money markets.'' </p>
<p>''It is only a matter of time before the ECB will have to
address the issue,'' Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman
Sachs in Frankfurt, said in the e-mailed note. A cut in the key
rate ''seems in principle the best option if the ECB wants to
guarantee short-term money market rates close to zero.'' </p>
<p>Policy makers gathering in Frankfurt on Feb. 6 for their
monthly rate-setting meeting have to assess whether the tighter
financing conditions show a resurgence of tensions that justify
a policy response or simply increased confidence in the region''s
economic recovery. The bank cut its benchmark rate to a record-low 0.25 percent in November. </p>
<p>The overnight unsecured lending rate for banks in euros was
above that level for the four days through Jan. 21 and climbed
as high as 0.359 percent on Jan. 20. It fell for a fifth day
yesterday, declining to 0.188 percent. </p>
<h2>Liquidity Drop </h2>
<p>Excess liquidity in the euro area, the surplus cash in the
financial system that isn''t immediately needed by banks to meet
their obligations, was at 170.3 billion euros ($232.3 billion)
yesterday after dropping last week to 125.5 billion euros, the
least since December 2011. </p>
<p>The ECB failed for a second week to sterilize government
bond purchases conducted under the now-terminated Securities
Markets Program. That may be a signal that banks are reluctant
to part with liquidity. </p>
<p>The central bank''s key rate will fall to 0.1 percent and
the deposit rate, which is currently at zero, to minus 0.1
percent by March, according to Barclays Plc and Commerzbank AG
in reports this month. Royal Bank of Canada said the main rate
will be reduced while the deposit rate stays at zero. Alessandro
Giansanti, a rates strategist at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam, said
the benchmark will be cut within three months. </p>
<p>Schumacher said that while the ECB will probably keep rates
unchanged at the February meeting, an eventual cut in the
benchmark rate to 0.1 percent would be the ''most effective''
measure. He said that one ''negative side-effect'' of a
reduction may be that a narrowing of spreads between official
rates could curb the incentive of banks to lend to each other. </p>

<p>Bernard Madoff victims who withdrew
more money from the con man''s firm than they invested -- and
were slated for no recovery -- asked to be excluded from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $543 million settlement of lawsuits over the fraud
so they can sue the bank on their own. </p>
<p>A group of 193 investors said in a filing yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that the accord between JPMorgan
and Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Madoff''s defunct
company, doesn''t cover ''net winners.'' They asked for court
permission to not be part of the settlement. </p>
<p>The group''s lawyer, Helen Davis Chaitman of Becker 
Poliakoff LLP in New York, said she intends to file a new
lawsuit on behalf of these and other victims who say they were
harmed in Madoff''s $17 billion Ponzi scheme, even though they
didn''t lose their principal. </p>
<p>The existing settlement is ''inherently unfair,'' Chaitman
said in the filing. </p>
<p>The Ponzi scheme''s net winners have been fighting for their
rights almost since Madoff''s 2008 arrest. Their argument is that
they are entitled to rely on the brokerage statements received
from the con man''s firm and should be compensated accordingly. </p>
<h2>Fictitious Statements </h2>
<p>Critics, ranging from trustee Picard and appeals court
judges to investigators, say that Madoff clients received
fictitious statements incorporating profits from trades that
never happened, and those who lost money should be compensated
first. </p>
<p>As a measure, Madoff customers'' assets were originally
estimated at $65 billion, including profits -- almost four times
as much as Picard''s current calculation of the $17 billion
invested and lost when the Ponzi scheme collapsed. </p>
<p>Those who profited from the Ponzi scheme -- though without
getting all the money reflected on their brokerage statements --
also have battled for their right to sue investors who allegedly
knew about the fraud. Picard and the courts have mostly opposed
them. </p>
<p>Mark Kornblau, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment on
the group''s position on the settlement. </p>
<h2>Warning Signs </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking to
move on from allegations it helped prolong Madoff''s fraud by
ignoring warning signs and reaping profit from the con man''s
business. The bank agreed Jan. 7 to pay $1.7 billion to the U.S.
to resolve criminal allegations and $350 million in a case by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. </p>
<p>The bank simultaneously agreed to pay Picard $325 million
to settle his civil lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims,
and another $218 million to resolve two related class-action
lawsuits that were filed with Picard''s assistance. </p>
<p>A hearing on the proposed accord is scheduled for Feb. 4. </p>
<p>Chaitman said in yesterday''s filing that victims who
invested with Madoff for years, and believed the trading in
their accounts was real, are entitled to some of their fake
profit because Madoff deprived them of legitimate investment
opportunities. </p>
<p>Picard has estimated there are about 2,500 net winners who
want to recover some or all of the fake profit they saw on their
customer account statements. ''Net losers'' withdrew less money
from Madoff''s firm than they put in. </p>
<h2>Parallel Efforts </h2>
<p>In the class-action lawsuits, JPMorgan is accused of aiding
and abetting embezzlement, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust
enrichment and gross negligence in relation to Madoff''s fraud. </p>
<p>The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal
investigators have resulted in a total recovery for victims of
almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard
has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions
more held in reserve until legal issues are resolved. </p>
<p>Chaitman and Picard''s spokeswoman, Amanda Remus, both
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving
a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina.
Others including his brother Peter Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term, have pleaded guilty. </p>
<p>Five members of Madoff''s inner circle, who worked for the
con man for decades, are on trial in Manhattan federal court on
charges of helping perpetuate the fraud to get rich. The five
have pleaded not guilty. </p>

Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-bk-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York

<p>Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. bankers
Michael Scherb and Verne Grinstead raised $375 million from
investors to target acquisitions of mining assets through their
Appian Natural Resources Fund LP. </p>
<p>''The whole thesis was really created when I was at
JPMorgan, when I could see that traditional sources of capital
were going to dry up to the industry,'' Scherb, who founded
Appian two years ago after leaving the bank, said in a phone
interview from London yesterday. ''I thought that private equity
made sense. I thought it made sense to match long-term capital
to a long-term industry.'' </p>
<p>Declining prices and a tapering in demand for commodities
has dried up financing for new mining projects as investors
retreat from the industry. Appian started raising funds a year
ago and got commitments of $1 billion from investors, Scherb
said. </p>
<p>''We think are real firepower is probably actually double
what our fund size is, so we want to deploy around $750 million
in the space,'' he said. ''We have a very strong co-investment
component, a lot of that from investors who didn''t make it into
the fund, or overflow from investors who did make it into the
fund but wanted to invest more.'' </p>
<p>Appian joins a swathe new private equity funds focused on
the mining industry that are betting on a resurgence in demand
for key commodities like copper, coal and zinc. X2 Resources,
led by former Xstrata Plc (GLEN) Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis, is
seeking to raise at least $3 billion from investors before it
starts buying mines, people with knowledge of the plan said last
week. </p>
<h2>Mining Executives </h2>
<p>Jersey-based Appian is run by a six-member management team
including founder Scherb, Grinstead and managing partner Vincent Jacheet, who was part of setting up Bain Capital LLC in Europe.
The team also includes three former mining industry executives
to provide operational experience to the fund, Scherb, who
advised mining firms while at JPMorgan, said. </p>
<p>Appian has completed three deals, including an acquisition
in Red Eagle Mining Corp. in September which boosted the fund''s
stake in the company to 15.3 percent, and has invested just
under $100 million so far, he said. Two more acquisitions, one
in Latin America and one in Africa, will be announced by the end
of March, he said. </p>
<p>''We really want to deploy our capital over the next two
years, our pipeline is pretty robust,'' he said. </p>
<p>BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO), the two largest
mining companies, are among mineral producers making or planning
mine disposals that may total a combined $35 billion, Deutsche
Bank AG has estimated. </p>
<h2>Africa, Europe </h2>
<p>The fund is actively bidding on assets being disposed of by
major mining companies, Scherb said. Appian is seeking
acquisitions in North America, Latin America, Africa and Europe
with an investment size of about $10 million to $100 million and
targeting those where first production can be realized within
three years, he said. </p>
<p>Appian is looking at five to seven projects or companies
every week and declining about 90 percent of them, he said. </p>
<p>''We see a lot of value out there, we see valuations having
dropped off tremendously and it allows us good entry
opportunities,'' Scherb said. ''There are good assets out there
that are just unloved by the market or undiscovered by the
market.'' </p>

building boom in Brazil as mobile-phone providers need companies
to construct towers costing $320 million to $820 million. </p>
<p>Goldman, Patria and at least six other private-equity firms
are backing five local tower builders as phone operators from
Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) to Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4) shift from
constructing their own towers to contracting the work out.
Operators will seek bids to build about 3,900 towers, more than
half the 6,680 new towers needed in 2014 to improve networks,
according to forecasts from one of the builders, who asked not
to be identified because the estimates aren''t public. </p>
<p>Brazil is trying to boost services and reduce dropped calls
as surging demand for high-speed Internet strains the current
network. The country has about 61,000 towers installed today --
slightly more than in the U.K., which is 1/20th the size and has
a third of the population, said Chahram Zolfaghari, chief
executive officer of builder Brazil Tower Co., the builder
that''s backed by investment firm 1848 Capital Partners LLC. </p>
<p>''We''re not talking about 10 percent or 20 percent growth -
- it''s like 100 percent,'' Zolfaghari said in an interview at
Bloomberg''s Sao Paulo office about the number of towers needed
in Brazil. ''They need to be doubled to properly attend to
current needs.'' </p>
<h2>Blackstone, Fishman </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the Brazilian
hedge-fund firm founded by former central bank president Arminio Fraga, last year unveiled tower-investment fund Cell Site
Solutions, while Patria Investimentos SA, a firm that includes
Blackstone Group LP (BX) among its investors, has allocated 300
million reais ($123 million) of capital to its Highline do
Brasil. </p>
<p>Other companies planning to build towers in Brazil are T4U
Tower Management, which is backed by Israel''s Fishman Group; QMC
Telecom International Holdings, whose investors include Peterson
Partners LP and Housatonic Partners; and Brazil Tower. </p>
<p>An outside spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on
behalf of the company, as did an outside spokesman for Patria.
Representatives from Peterson, Fishman and QMC didn''t respond to
requests for comment. </p>
<p>More Brazilians are buying smartphones, while providers
like Telefonica''s Vivo brand and America Movil SAB (AMX)''s Claro unit
are pushing data services to boost revenue, according to the
companies'' financial reports. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Crackdown </h2>
<p>Tim was among the companies forced by regulatory agency
Anatel to stop selling new lines for about 10 days in 2012 to
address complaints about dropped calls. The crackdown, along
with millions of reais in fines in the past several years, is
putting pressure on companies to improve customer satisfaction. </p>
<p>Vivo needs 10,000 new towers in the next two years to meet
traffic growth and government quality mandates, Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Carlos Valente said in an interview. </p>
<p>''We are starting to feel difficulties in the availability
of steel and labor,'' Valente said about challenges in building
new towers. </p>
<p>Anatel doesn''t regulate the tower market and sees demand
increasing significantly in coming years. </p>
<p>''This is a good business for tower builders,'' said Anatel
Superintendent Carlos Baigorri. ''Third-party tower builders
will allow operators to focus on their core business.'' </p>
<p>Of the 6,680 new sites needed in Brazil, about 2,780 will
be towers built by the operators themselves or shared towers in
which companies install equipment alongside competitors. </p>
<h2>Profitable Sites </h2>
<p>Brazil Tower builds towers for 200,000 reais to 500,000
reais apiece, its CEO says. That values the 3,900 to be built by
third parties at 780 million to 2 billion reais, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil Tower then expects to sell
the sites in bulk for as much as $300,000 each, he said. </p>
<p>Tower operating companies including SBA Communications
Corp. (SBAC) and American Tower Corp. (AMT) have been expanding in the past
two years as wireless providers prefer to lease towers rather
than maintain them internally to preserve cash and limit
investments. SBA agreed last month to pay 1.53 billion reais for
2,007 Oi towers, or about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than
twice the rate it paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi
towers, according to Wells Fargo  Co. </p>
<p>''We have a long-term view of the market,'' Kurt Bagwell,
SBA''s international president, said in a phone interview. ''We
basically try to predict the growth of the revenue of these
sites over time and we feel that the price we paid for these
works for our business, no problem.'' </p>
<p>SBA rose 1.9 percent to $92.29 at the close in New York,
while American Tower rose 2 percent to $81.18. </p>
<h2>Open Door </h2>
<p>Cell Site, Brazil Tower, Highline do Brasil, T4U and QMC --
the five largest builders in Brazil -- have the capacity to
construct only as many as 1,600 towers a year, opening the door
for other companies to step in to help build towers, according
to the investor analysis obtained by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''Everybody wants to do business in Brazil -- the problem
is that to do business in Brazil is so difficult,'' Brazil
Tower''s Zolfaghari said. ''Just in the state of Florida, you
have 60 companies like us. Why do you think I''m in Brazil? Over
there I would be one guy among hundreds.'' </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest oil producer by market value, said fourth-quarter profit
dropped the most in four years as it pumped less natural gas
from wells and energy prices stagnated. </p>
<p>Net income fell 16 percent to $8.35 billion, or $1.91 a
share, from $9.95 billion, or $2.20, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon was
expected to post per-share profit of $1.91, based on the average
of 18 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon''s global output dropped for the ninth time in 10
quarters, disappointing investors who had been encouraged when
the company snapped its losing streak during the July-to-September period, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward
Jones  Co. Exxon hasn''t sustained output growth for two
consecutive quarters since the first half of 2011. </p>
<p>''Production fell again so the question becomes,''Have they
already lost the momentum they gained in the last quarter,''''
Youngberg said in a telephone interview from St. Louis today. </p>
<p>Sales declined 3.3 percent to $110.86 billion. Exxon''s
shares fell 1.2 percent to $93.99 at the close in New York. </p>
<p>Exxon pumped the equivalent of 4.216 million barrels of
crude a day during the final three months of 2013, the lowest
fourth-quarter output since 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Gas Declines </h2>
<p>A 1.5 percent rise in crude production, led by new wells in
the Western Hemisphere, was more than canceled out by a 5.2
percent decline in gas output, the company said. Gas supplies
fell in every region of the world where Exxon does business
except for Canada and South America, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world''s
oil, declined 0.7 percent to an average of $109.35 a barrel
during the final three months of last year. U.S. natural gas
rose 8.8 percent to $3.85 per million British thermal units.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the bellwether U.S. oil, climbed
11 percent to $97.61 a barrel. </p>
<p>Refining and marketing profit tumbled 48 percent to $916
million. Exxon''s chemical earnings dropped 5 percent to $910
million, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Exxon earns about three-quarters of its global net income
outside the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is
seeking to revive production growth and limit costs amid
shrinking access to the world''s remaining untapped petroleum
reservoirs. </p>
<p>Exxon''s majority-owned Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil
Ltd. (IMO), said profit declined to C$1.056 billion ($946 million), or
C$1.24 a share, from C$1.076 billion, or C$1.26, a year earlier.
Record earnings from processing crude into fuels were more than
offset by slumping prices received for Imperial''s western
Canadian crude, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today. </p>
<p>Imperial fell 0.6 percent to C$45.52 in Toronto. </p>

<p>The National Football League is
creating a personalized video service to take advantage of what
one of its executives called a ''borderline insatiable''
appetite for its content. </p>
<p>NFL Now will begin this summer, said Brian Rolapp, the
league''s executive vice president of Media. </p>
<p>''The appetite for NFL content is borderline insatiable,''
Rolapp said during a press conference in New York, across the
Hudson River from where the league will stage its first outdoor,
cold-weather Super Bowl on Feb. 2 in East Rutherford, New
Jersey. ''Mobile advertising is not the biggest revenue stream,
but it certainly is the fastest growing.'' </p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO),
and Proctor  Gamble Co. (PG)''s Gillette are initial launch partners
for the digital service. </p>
<p>''The NFL has always focused on reaching as many fans as
possible -- wherever they are,'' Commissioner Roger Goodell
said. </p>
<p>The NFL is the most-watched U.S. sports league, generating
about $10 billion in annual revenue last season. According to
the league, 205 million people tuned into games this past
season, and 34 of the 35 most-watched shows in the fall season
were NFL games. </p>
<p>''Our fans can''t get enough of our content,'' said Jonathan Kraft, part owner of the New England Patriots and co-chair of
the league''s Digital Media Committee. ''More and more they are
living their lives on a tablet, on a phone.'' </p>
<p>The league said that 60 percent of digital consumption
occurs from Tuesday-Saturday with the remaining 40 percent
Sunday and Monday, when a majority of games are played. </p>
<h2>Dual Revenue </h2>
<p>The venture will be supported by a dual revenue stream,
including advertising, Rolapp said. Additionally, while much of
the content will be free, there will be a subscription component
for premium content. </p>
<p>''What we hear from advertisers -- we want mobile, we want
video,'' Rolapp said. </p>
<p>Users can indicate their favorite team or fantasy players
and the content stream will personalize each user''s feed. The
content will be created by the NFL specifically for mobile
devices instead of repackaged video from television broadcasts,
Rolapp said. </p>

<p>Banks led by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc. say commodities are heading for losses
in 2014 as rising supplies and slowing demand compound slumps
that led to bear markets last year in gold, copper and corn. </p>
<p>Open interest measuring holdings across the 24 commodities
tracked by the Standard  Poor''s GSCI Spot Index (BUSY) fell for three
straight quarters through December, the longest slump since the
global recession in 2008. The super cycle that led commodities
to almost quadruple since 2001 is reversing, with prices set to
drop 3 percent in 12 months, Goldman said. The asset class will
be a ''wallflower'' compared with equities, Citigroup said. </p>
<p>Raw materials from copper and corn to sugar and coffee will
be in surplus this year after a decade-long bull market spurred
producers to build new mines, drill more wells and expand
planting of crops. Investors pulled a record $43.3 billion last
year from commodity funds tracked by EPFR Global, and hedge
funds cut bullish bets across 18 U.S. futures by 53 percent from
an all-time high in September 2010. </p>
<p>''Supply growth is still formidable across most
commodities,'' said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior
investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which
oversees $115 billion. ''It will take some time for actual
demand trends to start to overwhelm that increasing supply.'' </p>
<p>The SP GSCI dropped 0.8 percent this month and 2.2 percent
last year, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
slid 3.5 percent, after surging 20 percent in 2013. The
Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading
partners, has climbed 1.1 percent since the end of December. The
Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index advanced 1.6 percent. </p>
<h2>Lagging Equities </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, which measures
investor returns after some rolling positions are taken into
account, will drop 3 percent in the next 12 months, Goldman said
in a Jan. 12 report. Precious metals will lose 15 percent, while
agriculture will decline 11 percent, the bank said. Industrial
metals will decrease 5 percent, livestock 3 percent, and energy
will fall 1 percent, Jeffrey Currie, the bank''s head of
commodities research, said in the report. </p>
<p>''We are still at below-trend GDP growth, and typically in
this environment you see weak commodity returns and low
volatility,'' Currie said by e-mail Jan. 22. ''The expectations
are the U.S. grows near trend, but Europe won''t, and the
emerging markets won''t. If the growth was above trend
everywhere, we''d be jumping into commodities.'' </p>
<h2>More Supply </h2>
<p>While the 18 euro-area nations emerged from the longest
recession since they began using the currency 15 years ago,
economic growth this year will be just 1 percent, below the
annual average of 1.5 percent since 1997, according to 56
economists in a Bloomberg survey. China, the top user of
everything from zinc to cotton, will expand 7.5 percent, the
slowest pace since 1990, a Bloomberg survey showed. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI gauge surged 170 percent from the end of 1999
to Dec. 31, 2009, the most of any decade since the data begins
in 1971. Higher commodity prices encouraged investment in new
production technology and expanded development of farms, oil
reserves and mines. </p>
<p>Global refined-copper output this year will jump to 22.2
million metric tons, or 55 percent more than in 1999, according
to New York-based researcher CPM Group. Last year''s record corn
harvest of 13.925 billion bushels in the U.S., the world''s
largest grower and exporter, was 48 percent bigger than the
harvest 15 years earlier, government data show. World crude-oil
output has expanded by 19 percent since 1999, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration. </p>
<h2>''Back Seat'' </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI lagged behind the MSCI equity index for two
straight years, the first time that''s occurred since 1998.
Commodities will continue to take a ''back seat'' to other
assets because raw-material gains from 2009 to 2011 were ''built
on unsustainable factors,'' Citigroup analysts including Jon Bergtheil and David Wilson said in a Jan. 6 report. Metals have
''little encouragement'' from the balance of supply and demand
this year, they said. </p>
<p>The ''super cycle'' has ended because supply has caught up
with demand, Citigroup said in November 2012. A year later,
analysts led by Ed Morse said the bank ''remains neutral to
bearish commodities'' with muted demand expected in 2014. </p>
<p>Producers expanded output, after tight supplies led to a
tripling of the SP GSCI since the end of 1999, with record
prices for commodities including oil, gold and copper. More
supply led to a divergence of commodity and equity markets that
had rallied together since the recession, Goldman''s Currie said. </p>
<h2>Bullish Case </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. says commodity bears are ''overly
confident on the reliability of supply'' and underestimate
demand. All but eight of the 65 commodity indices the bank
tracks will gain over the next two years, with five of them
posting double-digit annual returns, analysts led by Colin Fenton wrote in a Dec. 30 report. The ''super cycle'' is ''just
beyond its midpoint,'' and the markets are still in the ''bull
phases,'' JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund raised this year''s global
growth forecast to 3.7 percent, from an October estimate of 3.6
percent. The jobless rate in the U.S. fell to a five-year low
last month, and Euro-area factory output grew faster than
economists forecast in January, according to Markit Economics.
The U.S. is the top consumer of corn and crude oil. Europe
accounts for about 18 percent of copper demand and 14 percent of
global energy use, Barclays and BP Plc data show. </p>
<p>Caterpillar Inc., the largest maker of mining and
construction equipment, sees global growth this year at 3
percent, up from 2 percent in 2013, the Peoria, Illinois-based
company said in a Jan. 27 statement. That will boost demand for
mined commodities and energy, keeping most prices high enough
''to make investments attractive,'' the company said. </p>
<h2>Demand Continues </h2>
<p>''Even if we don''t see a sharp rebound in China, emerging
markets in general, they are still growing, and that economic
growth would bode well for continued demand for food,'' said
Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio manager who helps manage
about $4.7 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati.
''As the population becomes more affluent, even in slower
growth, diets continue to improve, and demand for higher volumes
of food and better quality, that should continue.'' </p>
<p>Gold and silver, after plunging last year by the most since
1981, should see ''a decent rebound coming'' as mines cut back
on output, Sorrentino said. ''It''s just purely based on physical
volumes.'' </p>
<h2>Bearish Bets </h2>
<p>Hedge funds and other large speculators have reduced their
net-long holdings to 735,217 futures and options across 18 U.S.-
traded commodities as of Jan. 21, compared to the all-time high
of 1.56 million, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. Only eight of the 139 funds, including ETFs, in the Lipper
Global Commodity group made money last year, according to fund
data. </p>
<p>There are ''shades of bearishness'' across commodities,
Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Jan. 17 report. The stronger
dollar in 2014 will be a ''major problem,'' Julien Garran, a
London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in a Jan. 20 report. Supply
growth also puts prices ''at risk,'' Deutsche Bank said in a
Jan. 14 report. </p>
<p>Investors should stay underweight agriculture, gold and
silver this year, Societe Generale SA said in a Jan. 10 report. </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude oil will drop 8.1 percent to
$90 a barrel in 12 months, Goldman forecasts. The U.S. is
extracting the most oil since 1989 as producers tap shale-rock
formations, cutting costs for refiners and driving fuel prices
at the pump down 9.8 percent since March. </p>
<p>Total domestic petroleum consumption averaged 18.8 million
barrels a day in the four weeks ended Jan. 17, the lowest since
Oct. 18., government data show. Global output will rise faster
than demand this year and next, the EIA estimates. </p>
<h2>Precious Metals </h2>
<p>For gold investors, there''s ''more pain to come'' after
prices tumbled 28 percent last year, the most since 1981, Morgan
Stanley analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a
report Jan. 22. The bank cut its 2014 target 12 percent to
$1,160 an ounce. Goldman sees prices at $1,050 in the next 12
months. Investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value
amid a rally in equities and muted inflation. Holdings through
exchange-traded products fell 33 percent in the past year,
erasing $68.8 billion from the value of the funds. </p>
<p>Copper prices will slump 13 percent to $6,200 a metric ton,
Goldman projects. Supplies will top demand by 385,000 tons this
year, up from a surplus of 45,000 tons in 2013, the bank said in
a Jan. 21 report. </p>
<h2>Agriculture Prices </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI Agricultural Index of eight crops fell 22
percent last year, the biggest slump since 1981, as record
harvests from India to the U.S. expanded supplies. Corn futures
have tumbled 50 percent from a record $8.49 a bushel in August
2012. Worldwide wheat output will be at an all-time high for the
fourth time in six years, U.S. government data show. </p>
<p>Global food costs tracked by the United Nations dropped 14
percent from an all-time high in February 2011. J.M. Smucker
Co., the Orrville, Ohio-based maker of Folgers coffee, is
passing along savings from the lower cost of beans via
promotions, Chief Executive Officer Richard Smucker said on a
Nov. 20 earnings conference call. </p>
<p>Cost inflation peaked in the six months through Nov. 24 at
General Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios cereal, and the rate
will ''ease in the second half'' of the fiscal year that ends
May 31, Chief Executive Officer Kendall J. Powell said on an
earnings call Dec. 18. </p>
<p>''There''s adequate inventories in grains and in copper,''
said Donald Selkin, who helps manage about $3 billion of assets
as chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New
York. ''Crude-oil inventories are going to return to excess once
cold weather is done. Commodities should drift lower in an
overall sense, absolutely.'' </p>

<p>Australia refused to give a A$25
million ($21.8 million) grant to local fruit processor SPC
Ardmona Ltd. saying parent Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL) was capable of
restructuring the company without government support. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Amatil is a ''very, very strong business,'' Prime
Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in Canberra today after his
Cabinet decided to turn down the request for aid. ''This is a
business which well and truly has the resources to ensure that
SPC Ardmona is in a strong position to restructure.'' </p>
<p>Abbott''s government, elected in September vowing to cut
taxes and ease red tape for businesses, has said it doesn''t
believe in ''corporate welfare'' to prop up ailing companies.
Coca-Cola Amatil had applied for temporary tariff protection to
stop imported packaged fruit being dumped into Australia and
sought a government grant to support a restructuring of the
unit''s operations. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Amatil, which had pledged to invest A$90 million
in the unit contingent on the grant being approved, said the
decision meant a further A$25 million in aid from Victoria state
wouldn''t go ahead. </p>
<p>The company will undertake a review of the unit''s carrying
value and a write down of its assets, with details to be
announced at its full-year results on Feb. 18, it said in a
regulatory statement today. </p>
<p>Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil declined 11 percent last year,
compared with a 15 percent gain for the benchmark SP/ASX 200
Index. The announcement came after the market closed in Sydney,
and the stock ended down 0.9 percent at A$11.79. </p>
<p>The Sydney-based company said in a November trading update
it expected earnings before interest and tax in the year ending
Dec. 31 to be as much as 7 percent lower than the previous year,
before significant items. Net income fell 12 percent to A$216
million in the six months through June, Coca-Cola Amatil
reported Aug. 20. </p>
<p>SPC Ardmona has produced and canned tomatoes, stone fruit

<p>Even if the Seattle Seahawks lose to the Denver Broncos in Sunday''s Super Bowl, the team has rewarded owner Paul Allen -- by beating his old company, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), as an investment. </p> <p>Allen bought the pro football team as a favor to his native city in 1997, when his heart was in basketball and his investing firepower was focused on a heady concept he called the ''wired world.'' The too-early bet on the convergence of television and the Internet flopped, losing him more than $8 billion. </p> <p>Now, with Microsoft searching for direction, Allen''s investments have recovered from that rocky stretch thanks in part to the football team he once said he purchased out of ''civic duty.'' The Seahawks, buoyed by TV broadcast fees, are worth about six times what Allen paid. In the same period, Microsoft shares have a little more than doubled as the Redmond, Washington-based company struggled to make its software relevant to mobile phones and tablets. </p> <p>The team''s success has rewarded Allen, 61, in other ways, showering the programmer and librarian''s son with affection in a city mad for the Seahawks. Pike Place Market florists sell roses dyed in team colors of blue and green. The ''12th Man'' flags honoring the city''s famously loud fans adorn lawns, offices and the Space Needle. The crowd cheered Allen at a Jan. 19 playoff game when he raised one of the pennants. </p> <p>''This 12th Man thing is everywhere,'' Bill Gates, the Seattle high school friend who co-founded Microsoft with Allen in 1975, said after appearing on Bloomberg TV in New York last week. ''The whole city is pretty energized.'' </p> <h2>Microsoft Stake </h2> <p>Of course, by measures other than the simple change in value, Microsoft performs better. While a sports franchise isn''t a liquid investment, Allen has been able to whittle his 28 percent Microsoft stake to less than 2 percent, collecting more than $20 billion along the way. He still holds about 100 million shares, which have earned him $800 million in dividends after taxes in the past decade, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. </p> <p>Sometimes called Microsoft''s ''other'' founder, Allen published a 2011 memoir, ''Idea Man,'' detailing his productive and at times contentious relationship with Gates. Money hasn''t been everything to him, post-Microsoft. After a brush with Hodgkin''s disease led him to leave in 1983, he started using his wealth for ''a life of adventure and discovery,'' as a website promoting the book put it. </p> <h2>Electric Guitar </h2> <p>He travels on his helipad-equipped yacht to Antarctica, plays electric guitar in all-star bands with famous friends including Dan Aykroyd and collects Impressionist art. The Seahawks aren''t his only pro team; he acquired what he called his ''first love,'' the Portland Trail Blazers basketball franchise, in 1988. </p> <p>When his failed investments in cable and technology businesses helped shrink a $36 billion fortune by more than half, Allen a decade ago brought in a new team of professional money managers who diversified into such areas as real estate, insurance and energy. </p> <p>For one of the technology visionaries of the 20th century, low-tech investments led a turnaround. </p> <p>Vulcan Inc., Allen''s Seattle investment firm, has remade a onetime warehouse district north of downtown into a destination neighborhood of shops, restaurants and offices anchored by Amazon.com Inc. The online retailer agreed to pay Vulcan $1.16 billion for an 11-building campus in the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2012. </p> <h2>Bakken Investment </h2> <p>In 2011, Allen, through Vulcan, was the only individual investor in a KKR  Co.-led syndicate that paid $7.2 billion for most of Samson Investment Co., an oil and natural gas producer with interests in more than 7,600 wells, including North Dakota''s Bakken region. </p> <p>That same year, Vulcan scored a $1 billion gain on an investment in Plains All American Pipeline LP, a Houston-based pipeline operator. Vulcan also has an investment in Driven Brands Inc., a Charlotte, North Carolina company that includes the Maaco collision-repair chain, Meineke Car Care Centers and Econo Lube N'' Tune  Brakes. </p> <p>Allen declined to comment for this article. </p> <p>The billionaire also uses his fortune to back research in fields that fascinate him. In September he founded the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which will try to develop machines that can field user questions and discuss them in natural language -- something like Captain Kirk''s computer in the ''Star Trek'' TV show. He''s already committed $500 million to another Seattle lab called the Allen Institute for Brain Science, where researchers are trying to determine which genes are most important for the workings of the brain. </p> <h2>Net Worth </h2> <p>''There''s a real passion for understanding how intelligence works, from the biological perspective as well as the computer perspective,'' said Matt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that has invested alongside Vulcan. </p> <p>Allen''s net worth, which was $12.4 billion in 2003, has recovered to $15.7 billion, ranking him among the world''s 60 wealthiest, according to the Bloomberg ranking. </p> <p>He didn''t set out to buy the Seahawks, considered by odds makers a slight underdog to the Broncos in the Feb. 2 Super Bowl. Local politicians approached Allen to buy the team when it threatened to move to California. He paid $194 million for the franchise and contributed another $130 million toward construction of a new stadium in Seattle. The team is now worth $1.25 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <h2>Asset a ''Jewel'' </h2> <p>''It''s a jewel of an asset,'' said Steve Patterson, athletic director at the University of Texas and previously a sports business consultant to National Football League owners, including Allen. Patterson was also general manager of the Trail Blazers from 2003 to 2007. While Seattle is only the 13th-largest media market, the Seahawks draw fan support from Portland and other Pacific Northwest cities, making it more like No. 4, Patterson said. They''ve even drawn the loyalty of fans across the border in Vancouver. </p> <p>For all of Allen''s Seahawks success, pro football isn''t a sure-fire bet, especially because of growing awareness of the dangers of concussions, said New York sports media consultant Chris Bevilacqua. A federal judge this month denied approval of the NFL''s $914 million settlement of a lawsuit brought by more than 5,000 former players, saying it may be insufficient to cover all future concussion claims. </p> <p>''There are risks and rewards across the marketplace, and that''s one of the risks,'' Bevilacqua said. </p> <p>The connection hasn''t escaped Allen, whose family foundation said in November that it''s spending $2.4 million for researchers at his brain lab and the University of Washington to study how blows to the head can damage the brain. </p> <p>', 'Paul Allen''s Seahawks Beat Microsoft as an Investment', 'By Peter Robison and Brendan Coffey', 'Jan 30, 2014 12:00 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-30/paul-allen-s-seahawks-beat-microsoft-as-an-investment.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the third-largest oil
company by market value, said production this year will rise
less than 1 percent as fourth-quarter profit tumbled 32 percent
amid slumping prices. </p>
<p>Crude and natural gas output will average the equivalent of
2.61 million barrels a day this year, a 0.5 percent increase
from 2013, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a
slide presentation today. For the final three months of last
year, net income dropped to $4.93 billion, or $2.57 a share,
from $7.25 billion, or $3.70, a year earlier, Chevron said in a
separate statement. </p>
<p>Costs have ballooned at Chevron''s flagship $54 billion
Gorgon liquefied natural gas development in Australia, which is
almost 75 percent complete, as the company looks to deep fields
in Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico to add supplies. Chevron is
the latest major international energy producer to disclose
production shortfalls while facing surging costs and unplanned
project delays. </p>
<p>''Production growth is going to be modest this year,'' said
Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc.
in Houston. ''In the absence of large project startups,
production growth beyond the very low single digits is just not
realistic.'' </p>
<h2>Worst Performing </h2>
<p>Chevron slid 4.1 percent, the most since October 2012, to
$111.63 at the close in New York. It was the day''s worst-performing energy producer in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>Both Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the top
two oil companies by market value, reported lower quarterly
earnings this week compared with 2012. Chevron''s stock
underperformed Exxon and ConocoPhillips last year and lagged the
industry average. </p>
<p>Brent crude, the global benchmark oil price, averaged
$109.35 a barrel in the last three months of 2013, a 78-cent
drop from the prior fourth quarter. </p>
<p>''Global crude oil prices and refining margins were
generally lower in 2013 than 2012,'' Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said in today''s statement. ''These
conditions, as well as lower gains on asset sales and higher
expenses, resulted in lower earnings.'' </p>
<p>Per-share results at Chevron matched the average estimate
of 18 analysts. Sales fell 7.3 percent to $56.2 billion. </p>
<p>Chevron said its fourth-quarter production fell 3.4 percent
to an average of 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in
the quarter, from 2.67 million barrels a year earlier. Earnings
from oil and gas sales dropped 29 percent to $4.85 billion. </p>
<p>Watson has said he plans to spend $39.8 billion this year
on gas-export facilities, offshore crude platforms and
exploratory drilling as part of a plan to increase global
production 20 percent by the end of 2017. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is close to a
programming agreement that would settle litigation over Dish
Network Corp. (DISH)''s ad-skipping technology, according to two people
with knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, could
receive compensation for technology, known as AutoHop, that lets
Dish subscribers skip commercials in broadcast shows they have
recorded, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. </p>
<p>Resolution of the dispute with Dish, the second-largest
U.S. satellite TV service, could make ad-skipping a regular
feature of TV viewing, and ease the tension between Dish and
other programmers. The company is also involved in litigation
with CBS Corp., Comcast Corp.''s NBC and 21st Century Fox Inc.''s
Fox over the feature, which threatens to undermine the
effectiveness of network ads. </p>
<p>Discussions to settle the ad-skipping litigation are part
of wider contract talks between Burbank, California-based Disney
and Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, for future rights to
programming from ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel. An existing
accord between the parties expired in September. </p>
<p>By agreeing to let Dish customers skip ads on ABC network
programs they have recorded, Disney could receive higher monthly
subscriber fees, the people said. Broadcast networks have been
asking pay-TV providers for compensation for their over-the-air
programming, similar to what they get for their cable networks. </p>
<h2>Retransmission Fees </h2>
<p>Disney has said such fees could bring in as much as $500
million annually by 2015. </p>
<p>The AutoHop technology, introduced by Dish in May 2012,
lets the company''s satellite-TV customers skip commercials on
recorded broadcast TV shows. The company had 14 million U.S.
subscribers as of the third quarter. </p>
<p>Dish is working with TV networks to deliver more targeted
ads based on consumer information collected by set-top boxes,

<p>Twitter Inc. (TWTR), the microblogging
service that went public last year, agreed to buy 900 patents
from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to gain access to new
technology and build a defense against infringement suits. </p>
<p>The agreement, signed last month and announced today, also
resolves a dispute that prompted IBM to write to Twitter last
year about possible infringement of at least three patents.
Financial terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>The purchase ''provides us with greater intellectual
property protection and gives us freedom of action to innovate
on behalf of all those who use our service,'' Ben Lee, legal
director for Twitter, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Twitter had nine patents and 95 pending applications before
its initial public offering in November, far fewer than other
leading technology companies. It said in a regulatory filing
that the lack of intellectual property could make the company a
target for litigation and limit its ability to fight back by
asserting its own patents. </p>
<p>Patent battles are an ''increasing distraction'' for
technology companies, even if Twitter itself wasn''t facing much
of an immediate threat,  said Richard Doherty, research director
of Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment consulting firm
in Seaford, New York. ''At some point it becomes just a
balancing function to take advantage of warehouses of
intellectual property, like at IBM.'' </p>
<h2>Video Delivery </h2>
<p>In its letter to Twitter, IBM cited patents relating to a
networking technique based on common contacts, a way to show
advertisements without interfering with an interactive site, and
using interconnected computers to reduce Web traffic. San
Francisco-based Twitter also will probably gain IBM inventions
related to things like video compression, Doherty said. </p>
<p>''As Twitter expands and starts delivering video, they need
to increase their intellectual property portfolio,'' he said.
''We believe some know-how is going along with the patent
transfer, not just patent numbers.'' </p>
<p>The patents include some that directly relate to Twitter''s
business plan. One covers a way to enable compliance with
international shipping requirements. Twitter is seeking to get
more revenue from retailers and is trying to make it easier for
users to shop via its 140-character messages. </p>
<h2>Messaging Technology </h2>
<p>Another of the patents is for improved messaging, according
to information posted on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
website. Others are less clearly connected, such as a way to
prevent damage to semiconductor chips. </p>
<p>For Twitter, the deal marks its first patent acquisition,
not counting intellectual property it gained by purchasing other
companies. The companies also entered a cross-licensing
agreement. Of the three patents cited by IBM in its initial
letter to Twitter, only one -- for interconnected computers --
has been assigned to Twitter, according to the patent office. </p>
<p>Shares of Twitter gained 1.4 percent to $64.35 at 11:52
a.m. in New York. IBM''s stock was little changed at $176.37. </p>
<p>IBM, which has received the most U.S. patents of any
company for 21 straight years, has made deals with patent-light
technology firms before. The Armonk, New York-based company has
sold patents to Google Inc. (GOOG) to aid the Android software maker''s
battle with rivals over smartphone technology. A sale of 750
patents to Facebook Inc. helped the social-networking site
settle a lawsuit with Yahoo! Inc. </p>
<p>''It illustrates the value of patented IBM inventions and
demonstrates our commitment to licensing access to our broad
patent portfolio,'' Ken King, general manager of intellectual
property for IBM, said in a statement. ''We look forward to a
productive relationship with Twitter in the future.'' </p>
<p>The licensing and sales deals mean IBM has agreements with
almost every technology company in business. Its patents
generate approximately $1 billion a year in licensing income,
about 1 percent of its sales last year. </p>

<p>The ruble''s plunge in this week''s
emerging-market selloff holds the promise of more competitive
Russian exports and higher budget revenue, JPMorgan Chase 
Co.''s asset-management unit and Capital Economics Ltd. said. </p>
<p>''There has been limited official rhetoric about the need
to prevent the ruble from weakening,'' Liza Ermolenko, an
emerging-markets economist at Capital Economics, said by phone
from London. ''A weaker ruble improves competitiveness in
international markets and boosts government revenue from oil.'' </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry canceled a scheduled bond auction amid
the developing-nation rout after selling less than 25 percent of
the securities on offer this month. Russia should abstain from
following Turkey and South Africa in raising interest rates to
bolster the ruble, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Jan. 29. </p>
<p>The ruble tumbled to the lowest on record against the
central bank''s basket of dollars and euros this week as Chinese
manufacturing contracted and the Federal Reserve pushed ahead
with stimulus cuts. That slide helped drive the yield on
Russia''s February 2027 bond 14 basis points higher on Jan. 29,
the most since June. That compares with a 10 basis-point advance
for similarly dated debt from Mexico, which carries the same
rating at Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<h2>Commodity Dependence </h2>
<p>Crude oil and natural gas exports account for about 50
percent of Russia''s budget revenue and President Vladimir Putin
has urged officials to diversify the economy and reduce its
dependence on commodities. Brent was steady yesterday at $107.95
a barrel in London, compared with $36.61 in December 2008,
before the currency reached its previous low. </p>
<p>''I''m sure the government is happy seeing the currency
weaken a bit,'' Matias Silvani, who helps manage $35 billion of
emerging-market debt at JPMorgan Asset Management in New York,
said by e-mail yesterday. Russia is facing a ''weaker economy,
exposure to commodities'' and is ''trying to gain
competitiveness,'' he said. ''A weaker currency, managed, helps
on all three fronts.'' </p>
<p>Elvira Nabiullina, the economic aide to Putin who took
charge of Bank Rossii in June, resisted cutting rates last year
to boost economic growth as inflation remained above target. The
economy expanded 1.2 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, matching the weakest pace since a 2009 contraction. </p>
<h2>Auction Axed </h2>
<p>The Finance Ministry axed its auction on Jan. 29, citing
market conditions, after issuing 750 million rubles out of 10
billion rubles of 2019 bonds offered at a sale the previous
week. While the ministry plans to sell bonds next week, it''s not
a problem if the first-quarter borrowing plan isn''t met,
Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of Finance Ministry''s debt
department, told reporters in Moscow yesterday. </p>
<p>When the local currency depreciates, Russia''s budget
receives more rubles from taxes and duties paid by energy
companies whose export revenue is priced in dollars. </p>
<p>Russia''s budget deficit may be equal to 0.6 percent to 0.7
percent of gross domestic product this year, the Interfax news
service said Jan. 23, citing Siluanov. </p>
<p>The yield on Russia''s 2027 OFZ bond has increased 50 basis
points this year to 8.4 percent, the highest since July 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on Mexico''s debt is
up 26 basis points this year at 7 percent. </p>
<h2>Third Worst </h2>
<p>The ruble climbed for the first day in six yesterday,
adding 1 percent to 40.5092 against the basket after 6 p.m. in
Moscow when the central bank ends its market operations. The
ruble lost 6.5 percent against the dollar this year, the worst
performer among the 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, behind Argentina''s peso and South Africa''s rand. The
currency retreated 0.3 percent to 40.6059 by 12:18 p.m. in
Moscow today versus the basket. </p>
<p>''Many investors are saying that it would be good for the
central bank to raise rates,'' Evgeny Kochemazov, head of fixed
income at Alfa Capital in Moscow, said by phone yesterday.
''That''s probably the only way to stabilize the situation in the
currency market, to prevent the growth of OFZ yields.'' </p>
<p>Russia is rated Baa1 at Moody''s Investors Service, the
third-lowest investment-grade category. The yield on the
government''s April 2020 dollar bonds was steady at 3.83 percent
today. The extra yield investors demand to hold the nation''s
dollar debt over Treasuries dropped one basis point to 246. </p>
<p>Russian policy makers are scheduled to discuss borrowing
costs on Feb. 14. Bank Rossii will leave the key one-week rate
at 5.5 percent in the first and second quarter, according to the
median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The economy stands to gain from the ruble''s drop, according
to Alexei Kudrin, a former Finance Minister. </p>
<p>''Overall it''s positive,'' he said in Moscow yesterday.
''It will support industry.'' </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired Cathrin Petty from U.K. private-equity firm Vitruvian Partners LLP as
co-head of its health-care investment banking team in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa amid rising activity in the sector. </p>
<p>Petty, who has almost 20 years of experience in health

according a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. She will start next
week and report to Laurence Hollingworth. The contents of the

decade at buyout firm Apax Partners LLP, eight of those years as
a partner in the global health-care team, in charge of private-equity investments, the memo shows. Petty, who interned at

<p>When asked last month what kinds of gadget gifts he would be getting for Christmas, Microsoft Corp.''s Satya Nadella, said to be the board''s pick for chief executive officer, had an easy answer: Microsoft devices. </p> <p>Nadella, 46, in an interview at a technology conference in Paris, said he had already gotten a new Xbox One game console for his children that he uses to watch movies through Netflix Inc.

<p>Billionaires Alice Walton, George Soros and Marc Benioff are helping to finance a super-political
action committee encouraging former U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton to run for president, according to a report
filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission. </p>
<p>Each gave $25,000 to Ready for Hillary PAC, organized a
year ago to provide Clinton outside support if she chooses to
seek the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. </p>
<p>The super-PAC earlier reported raising about $4 million
last year from 30,000 donors, most of them giving small amounts,
such as $20.16. Walton, Soros and Benioff were among 33 people
or companies that gave $25,000 in the second half of 2013, the
FEC report shows. New Yorkers who chipped in to help their
former senator include Roger Altman, the chairman and founder of
New York-based Evercore Partners Inc. </p>
<p>The super-PAC can''t coordinate with Clinton if she becomes
a candidate. It can, however, sell her campaign its data --
almost 2 million supporters have signed up for the group so far
-- or mobilize voters and advertise for her on its own. The
group, based in Arlington, Virginia, is limiting contributions
to $25,000 even though it is permitted to accept donations in
unlimited amounts. </p>
<p>Its early fundraising success, still more than two years
before Election Day, could give Clinton a competitive advantage;
there''s no comparable candidate-specific super-PAC for any of
the prospective Republican candidates, who include Kentucky
Senator Rand Paul, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and New
Jersey Governor Chris Christie. </p>
<h2>Leading Polls </h2>
<p>Clinton, 66, dominates other Democrats in voter preference
polls and has said she''ll make a decision about a White House
campaign sometime this year. A Jan. 30 Washington Post-ABC News
poll found her with 73 percent of support from Democrats and
Democratic-leaning independents, a 6-to-1 lead over her rivals. </p>
<p>''I''ll think about it in the future sometime,'' Clinton
said Jan. 27 at the National Automobile Dealers Association
convention in New Orleans. </p>
<p>Walton, the daughter of Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Walton, is the world''s 13th-richest
person with a fortune of $33.9 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index. </p>
<p>Alice Walton''s donation underscores the Clintons''
longstanding ties to business leaders in Arkansas, where Bill Clinton was governor for 12 years prior to becoming president in
1993. The pro-Clinton group also received $25,000 from John Tyson, chairman of Springdale-based Tyson Foods Inc. </p>
<h2>Obama Backers </h2>
<p>Benioff, the chief executive officer of San Francisco-based
Salesforce.com, was a top fundraiser for President Barack Obama''s 2012 re-election campaign and hosted the president for a
Democratic fundraiser at his residence last November. His wife,
Lynne Benioff, also contributed $25,000. </p>
<p>Soros, who''s given millions of dollars to Democratic
causes, funded the super-PAC, as did his son Robert Soros,
managing partner of Soros Fund Management LLC. </p>
<p>Former advisers to Bill Clinton donating to Ready for
Hillary included Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary, who
gave $5,000. William Galston, a Washington-based Brookings
Institution senior fellow and a former White House domestic
policy adviser, gave $1,000. </p>
<h2>New York Donors </h2>
<p>The super-PAC for Clinton, a U.S. senator from New York
from 2001 to 2009, received $25,000 each from developer William Rudin, chief executive officer of Rudin Management Co. in New
York, and Jon Stryker, a New York architect who gave about $2
million to Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC that helped re-elect Obama and is now converting to a pro-Clinton effort. </p>
<p>Silda Wall, a principal at NewWorld Capital Group LLC, who
is divorcing former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, gave
$5,000. </p>
<p>The pro-Clinton super-PAC received $25,000 from the Houston
law firm of Steve and Amber Mostyn, who gave about $5 million to
Democratic groups and candidates in the 2012 election. </p>
<p>Ready for Hillary is led by Adam Parkhomenko, a 28-year-old
college student who has advocated for a Clinton presidential
campaign for more than a decade. The super-PAC''s advisers
include Jeremy Bird, Obama''s former national field director, and
Harold Ickes and James Carville, who have longstanding ties to
the Clintons. </p>
<p>The super-PAC said in an e-mail to supporters that it had
amassed another 7,119 donations last month. </p>
<p>By limiting its donations to $25,000 per individual, Ready
for Hillary is focusing on grassroots support, Parkhomenko said,
while Priorities USA Action can seek bigger donations.
Parkhomenko said Ready for Hillary doesn''t plan to run any
television advertising campaigns, leaving that task to other
groups such as Priorities. </p>
<p>Priorities, which raised more than $79 million in the 2012
election, will have Obama campaign manager Jim Messina as a co-chairman for the 2016 election, its executive director, Buffy Wicks, said in a statement Jan. 23. </p>

<p>Alain Grisay, a former JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) managing director who later oversaw a series of mergers as
chief executive officer at FC Asset Management Plc, operator of
the U.K.''s oldest investment fund, has died. He was 59. </p>
<p>He died over the weekend, according to a statement from
Darty Plc, a London-based home-appliance retailer of which
Grisay was a nonexecutive director. No cause was given. He lived
in London for almost three decades. </p>
<p>The Belgian-born fund manager who spent 22 years at
JPMorgan and raced a 1931 Invicta sports car as a hobby, moved
through the ranks of the New York-based investment bank,
eventually heading its European fixed-income division, according
to a 2010 article in the Financial Times. In 2001, he joined FC
as head of its European institutional business in London and was
CEO from 2006 to 2012. </p>
<p>Last week, Bank of Montreal agreed to buy the company for
708 million pounds ($1.2 billion). </p>
<p>FC traces its roots to 1868, when Foreign  Colonial
Investment Trust became the world''s first publicly listed pooled
investment vehicle, according to FC''s website. FC Management
became a stand-alone asset manager in 1972 to oversee the
portfolio of Foreign  Colonial Investment Trust. The parent
company gained its stock listing in 2004. </p>
<p>''Alain was a visionary executive and business leader,''
the company said in an e-mailed statement. ''Alain will be sadly
missed by all of us who had the privilege of both knowing him
and of working together.'' </p>
<h2>FC Years </h2>
<p>After Grisay''s appointment as CEO, he presided over FC''s
merger with real-estate investment firm REIT Asset Management in
2008; its breakup the following year with U.K. life insurer
Friends Provident Plc, which distributed its 52 percent stake in
FC to shareholders; and the purchase of Thames River Capital in
2010. He also supervised FC''s agreement to start a joint-venture in China with Hua Xia Bank. </p>
<p>Grisay stepped down in 2012, handing over management duties
to Edward Bramson, founder of activist shareholding company,
Sherborne Investors LLC, who replaced Nick MacAndrew as FC
chairman in 2011. Bramson had criticized FC''s costs, levels of
debt and acquisitions. Grisay had urged investors to reject
Sherborne''s plans to develop a new strategy for the company. </p>
<p>In a statement on Grisay''s departure, Bramson said the
former CEO had ''achieved the successful acquisition of Thames
River and steered the company through the most tumultuous period
of market upheaval for 60 years.'' </p>
<h2>Johns Hopkins </h2>
<p>A self-described Anglophile, Grisay shook up FC by
removing six layers of management, reduced the number of
investment committees and transferred some of the powers of the
chief investment officer to the fund managers themselves,
according to a 2006 profile in the U.K.''s Independent newspaper. </p>
<p>Alain Leopold Grisay was born on April 5, 1954, according
to Who''s Who of Company Directors. He earned a master''s in law
from the University of Louvain in Belgium, and a Master of Arts
degree in international affairs from Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, the Independent said. </p>
<p>Grisay joined J.P. Morgan  Co. in 1979 as a financial
analyst in New York. In 2000, the bank merged with Chase
Manhattan Corp. to become JPMorgan Chase. </p>
<p>After moving to FC, Grisay became deputy CEO and chairman
of the company''s Dutch unit, where he remained until 2004, when
FC merged with the U.K. asset-management company Isis. </p>
<p>''It required some reasonably tough management to sort that
out,'' Grisay said of the Isis merger, according to the
Financial Times. ''I was asked to run the business in 2006 with
a clear view to clean up the damage.'' </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. has reduced its tax rate to a two-decade low with help from a tax strategy that sends profits through a Dutch subsidiary. </p> <p>The approach, which involves routing almost all sales in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and some of the Americas through the Netherlands unit, helped IBM as it gradually reduced its tax rate over 20 years at the same time pretax income quadrupled. Then last year, the rate slid to the lowest level since at least 1994, lifting earnings above analysts'' estimates. </p> <p>IBM is aiming for $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015, up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a goal made more difficult as the company posted seven straight quarters of declining revenue. To stay on target, IBM has bought back shares, sold assets, and fired and furloughed workers. A less prominent though vital role is played by its subsidiary in the Netherlands, one of the most important havens for multinational companies looking for ways to legally reduce their tax rates. </p> <p>''They''ve got a lot of ways to beat earnings and they definitely take advantage of it,'' said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. ''It''s part of how IBM operates.'' </p> <p>IBM ended 2013 with a tax provision $1.84 billion lower than it initially projected, thanks to a tax rate of 15.6 percent -- compared with its forecast of 25 percent. Without the lower rate, the company''s earnings per share would have fallen from the previous year instead of rising, and net income would have missed analysts'' estimates by about 14 percent instead of 2.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

Bill Gates, the company''s first CEO, will step aside as chairman, devote more time to product development as a director and continue running his philanthropic foundation.

<p>The new CEO, who was born in India and joined Microsoft in 1992, takes over at a critical juncture. Consumers and businesses are shunning PCs in favor of handheld devices made by rivals, sapping demand for Microsoft''s flagship products. Besides playing catchup to the likes of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG), Nadella will be tasked with completing strategy changes, begun by Ballmer last year, that include integrating the $7.2 billion integration of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit and turning Microsoft into a provider of services and hardware. </p>

Foursquare''s valuation has been stagnant since 2011. </p> <p>Bloomberg News reported in August that Microsoft and American Express Co. were both vying for a stake in Foursquare.

<p>With Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s appointment of John Thompson as chairman to replace co-founder Bill Gates, the world''s largest software maker is looking to the veteran technology executive as the main outside voice in its new leadership structure. </p> <p>Thompson was the lead independent director heading the board''s search for a new chief executive officer, resulting in the appointment of Microsoft insider Satya Nadella to replace Steve Ballmer, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement today. While the naming of Thompson and Nadella, who were already involved in Microsoft''s transition, signal continuity, it''s also the biggest break in the company''s history as the Gates-Ballmer duo who have been in charge for more than three decades step aside. </p> <p>Related:</p>

<p>The former CEO of Symantec Corp. (SYMC), Thompson, 64, is stepping in at a crucial point as Microsoft remakes itself to better compete with rivals including Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) In picking Thompson, the board is betting that he''ll be able to use his experience running a security-software company to help turn around Microsoft. </p> <p>''Thompson''s going to be a major voice for the company,'' James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research, said in an interview. ''They wouldn''t have made him chairman, if he didn''t have strong opinions about how to drive the company forward. And Satya is looking for strong partners on the board.'' </p> <h2>Board Responsibilities </h2> <p>In a video that Microsoft posted online, Thompson said he was ''looking forward to working closely with Satya and other members of the board. The board is always focused on long-term success of this great company and takes seriously its responsibilities to shareholders to ensure long-term success.'' </p> <p>As Microsoft''s key products face decline, Thompson and Nadella will oversee a transition to a new organizational structure and integrate the $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit. The management transition at Microsoft follows the worst decline on record for personal computers in 2013, when shipments dropped 10 percent and are projected to languish through 2017. </p> <p>Thompson knows what it''s like to be at the head of a struggling incumbent. While at Symantec in 2005, he orchestrated the ill-fated $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software Corp., in an effort to push into data storage. When Thompson stepped down as CEO four years later, Symantec was contending with slowing growth amid an economic downturn and rising competition. Thompson joined Microsoft as a director in 2012 as part of an expansion of the board. </p> <h2>Florida Roots </h2> <p>The son of a Florida postal worker and a teacher, Thompson joined International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) straight out of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in 1971. The IBM interviewer said he was interested in a stereo, so Thompson spent the session trying to sell him one, Thompson wrote in a New York Times column in 2012. He wound up with a job as a sales representative for IBM in Tampa, Florida. </p> <p>Thompson likes to tell people he spent ''27 years, 9 months and 13 days at IBM'' before joining technology security company Symantec as CEO in 1999. He took the company from $600 million to $6 billion in sales over his decade-long tenure, before stepping down in 2009. </p> <p>Microsoft''s new chairman also currently runs Virtual Instruments Inc., a San Jose, California-based maker of software that tracks application and hardware performance. In an interview late last year, Thompson said he was determined to take the company public, something he has never done in his career. </p> <h2>Performance Management </h2> <p>After joining Microsoft''s board in February 2012, Thompson was involved in discussions about the company''s performance under Ballmer, regulatory filings show. The board, in annual reviews, rebuked the CEO for poor results in Windows and tablets machines, even as it lauded areas such as server software and expense cutting. </p> <p>Thompson helped to create an environment that sped Ballmer''s decision to retire, according to people with knowledge of the matter, and the director led the board in pressing the CEO on his strategy. Thompson listened to each board member and made sure Ballmer heard them, improving lines of communication and making strategy talks more productive, the people said. </p> <h2>Board Moves </h2> <p>The new chairman is only Microsoft''s second since the company was founded by Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. Some external candidates who discussed the CEO job with Microsoft expressed concerns they would lack independence if both Ballmer and Gates stayed on as directors, people familiar with their thinking have said. Gates and Ballmer together own 8.3 percent of the stock; Gates is Microsoft''s largest individual shareholder with a 4.3 percent stake. </p> <p>A new director set to join the board next month is Mason Morfit, president of activist shareholder ValueAct Holdings LP. He''s eager to see Microsoft emphasize its business software and Internet-based cloud services rather than consumer technology, people familiar with the situation have said. </p> <p>The board, which is expanding to 10 members with the addition of Nadella, includes seven independent directors. Three of the seven have been on the board for more than eight years, including 33 years for David Marquardt, an early investor in the software maker. </p> <p>', 'Microsoft Signals New Era With Thompson as Chairman', 'By Dina Bass and Peter Burrows', 'Feb 04, 2014 12:43 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-04/thompson-replacing-gates-as-microsoft-chairman-in-revamp.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) and
eight other large drugmakers will partner with the U.S.
government in a $230 million effort to identify new approaches
to treat Alzheimer''s, diabetes, lupus and arthritis. </p>
<p>Data generated from the work will be made public for other
scientists to use, a move the U.S. National Institutes of Health
called groundbreaking. The targeted diseases are some of the
most prevalent conditions among Americans, costing the nation
billions of dollars in treatment and lost productivity. </p>
<p>The venture may be particularly important in Alzheimer''s
research. Since 1998, there have been more than 100 attempts to
develop a treatment, and all have failed. The last two years
have featured setbacks by Pfizer and Johnson  Johnson. Sanofi (SAN)
Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher has said his company
won''t pursue therapies there because the science isn''t advanced
enough to justify the risks and cost to develop a drug. </p>
<p>''We are going to try to increase the odds of picking the
right targets to go after for the next generation of drug
development,'''' Francis Collins, the NIH director, said today at
a press conference in Washington. ''We want to pick them at the
very beginning of the development process and thus avoid wasting
precious time and money chasing down drugs.'' </p>
<p>The companies and the NIH will split the $230 million cost
about equally, Collins said. </p>
<p>More than 5 million Americans suffer with Alzheimer''s
disease, and the number is expected to triple by 2050. The only
drugs approved for the condition ease symptoms for a few months
while the debilitating brain disease rampages on. Still, the
treatments generate more than $5 billion annually. </p>
<h2>Biomarker Research </h2>
<p>Research coordinated by the NIH will include collecting
tissue samples from thousands of patients to look for common
''biomarkers'' that might be good targets for new drugs, the
agency said in a statement. The first projects are expected to
last three to five years, and may lead to collaborations on
other diseases if the research is successful, NIH said. </p>
<p>The coordinated effort ''rallies scientific key players of
the innovation ecosystem in a more unified way,'' Mikael Dolsten, president of worldwide research and development for New
York-based Pfizer, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Rupert Vessey, senior vice president at Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey-based Merck  Co. (MRK), identified new, innovative ways to
develop drugs as the most critical health challenge facing the
industry. The collaboration ''will be important to unraveling
the mysteries of the diseases that cause suffering for
individuals and are a burden to our society,'' he said in an e-mail. </p>
<h2>AbbVie, Biogen </h2>
<p>Other companies involved are AbbVie Inc., Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB),
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), JJ (JNJ), Sanofi and
Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
will also participate, as well as nonprofit advocacy groups
representing patients suffering from the diseases, the
government said. </p>
<p>''We exited mental illness and largely Alzheimer''s about
four years ago, but not because we weren''t interested in it, but
because we thought it was so difficult alone,'' said Lon Cardon,
senior vice president of alternative discovery and development
at London-based Glaxo. ''Now we''re interested in the Alzheimer''s
space because we can join forces.'' </p>
<p>The NIH is the largest source of funding for biomedical
research in the world, with an annual budget of more than $30
billion. Much of that money is consumed by basic research into
human biology and the study of the major causes of death,
including cancer and infectious diseases. </p>
<p>The agency expects to spend about $1.1 billion on diabetes
this year; $562 million on Alzheimer''s; $260 million on
arthritis and $109 million on lupus. The agency will spend $3.1
billion researching HIV and AIDS, by comparison, the most of any
single disease. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $543 million settlement with the trustee for Bernard Madoff''s defunct firm was approved by the judge overseeing its liquidation, ending a case in which thousands of investors accused the bank of turning a blind eye to the U.S.''s biggest Ponzi scheme. </p> <p>The accord, reached Jan. 7, was approved today by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in New York. The deal resolves a lawsuit by the trustee, Irving Picard, and two related class-action cases filed by Madoff victims who accused the bank of negligence. </p> <p>''The settlements are fair, reasonable and in the best interest of the Madoff estate,'' Bernstein said. The deals provide ''substantial benefit'' to victims, he said. </p> <p>Related: Madoff Ex-Aides Seen Facing Hurdle With ''Duped'' Defense</p><p>With the JPMorgan deal, Picard''s recoveries for victims topped $10 billion, or 59 percent of the $17 billion in principal lost by thousands of customers in Madoff''s investment advisory business. Picard alleged the bank helped perpetuate Madoff''s scam for years by ignoring signs of fraud. </p> <p>Madoff deposited money from new customers into the account instead of investing it in securities, and made withdrawals to pay back earlier investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed after Madoff''s confession and arrest in December 2008. </p> <p>Picard said New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, ignored signs of wrongdoing to benefit financially from the con man''s business. </p> <h2>Class Actions </h2> <p>JPMorgan agreed to pay Picard $325 million to settle his lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims, and another $218 million to resolve two related class-action lawsuits that were filed with Picard''s assistance after an appeals court barred him from bringing common-law claims against the bank. </p> <p>Picard had appealed the JPMorgan decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which hasn''t decided whether it will hear the case. </p> <p>The amount of the accord ''indicated there was a value to the claims and the compromise made good sense,'' David Sheehan, a lawyer for Picard, said at today''s hearing. There is no guarantee Picard will win at the Supreme Court, Sheehan said. </p> <p>A group of about 200 Madoff victims who are ''net winners'' -- customers who withdrew more money from the scam than they deposited -- get nothing under the deal and have said in court filings they will sue the bank. They advised Bernstein in court papers that they were declining to be part of the JPMorgan accord. </p> <h2>Opting Out </h2> <p>''You''re opting out of a class you''re not a member of -- sounds like a Groucho Marx joke,'' Bernstein said to a lawyer for the group at today''s hearing. </p> <p>Picard is pursuing claims totaling about $3.5 billion from UBS AG (UBSN), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and UniCredit SpA (UCG), which the trustee has also accused of benefiting from Madoff''s fraud. The banks have denied the claims. </p> <p>At the same time Picard reached the deal with JPMorgan, the bank agreed to pay $1.7 billion to the U.S. to resolve related criminal allegations, and $350 million in a case by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. </p> <p>The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal investigators have resulted in a total recovery for victims of almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions more held in reserve until legal issues are resolved. </p> <p>Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina. At least seven others pleaded guilty, including his brother Peter Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term. </p> <h2>Picower Estate </h2> <p>Before the JPMorgan accord, Picard''s team had recovered $9.5 billion through lawsuits and out-of-court settlements, including $5 billion from the estate of Jeffry Picower, who began investing with Madoff in the 1970s. Picower, whom Picard called the biggest beneficiary of Madoff''s scheme, had a heart attack and drowned in a pool in Florida in October 2009. </p> <p>U.S. investigators had recovered about $2.3 billion for Madoff investors before reaching their deal with JPMorgan, including $2.2 billion from Picower''s estate and $100 million from Madoff''s Midtown Manhattan penthouse apartment and other belongings. The JPMorgan deal brings total U.S. recoveries to $4 billion -- a sum it will distribute through a separate process from the one used by Picard. </p> <p>The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.

financing,'' Andrade said. ''Of the investment banks, the one
that''s been most attentive, and has put in time coming up with
ideas, is Goldman Sachs.'' The New York-based firm is talking
directly with builders, he said. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn''t
respond to an e-mailed request for comment. </p>
<p>While Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has promised
the road projects as a way to stimulate economic growth,
builders have struggled to line up financing. Last week, ANI
extended the bid-submission deadline for the first project by a
month to March 7, after the country''s banking association said
project bidders needed more time to complete their proposals. </p>
<p>Under the new program, builders must finance projects
themselves and recoup their investments later through toll-road
collections and government payments. The country previously had
made upfront payments to builders, a practice that led to
allegations of corruption and inefficiency. </p>
<h2>Extra Month </h2>
<p>Some of the 10 approved bidders for the first project -- a
road from Puerto Salgar to Girardot in central Colombia -- were
ready to submit proposals by the original Feb. 7 deadline,
according to Andrade. </p>
<p>''A couple of the firms told us they were ready and even
that they were interested in going ahead because they knew that
others weren''t,'' Andrade said. ''We want ample participation
and of good quality, and if we see that because of timing we
won''t get it, then we''ll give a little bit more time.'' </p>
<p>The ANI will use the extra month to make ''small
adjustments'' to the contracts on the concessions, and the
government is studying whether to increase the fraction it pays
builders in dollars instead of the local currency, he said. </p>
<p>''We''re considering offering to pay more of it in dollars,
so that they can take on more debt from outside sources,''
Andrade said. ''It varies from project to project. We''re seeing
how we can get it higher so that more or less 30 percent of the
project can be financed in dollars.'' </p>
<h2>World Bank </h2>
<p>Colombia''s development bank, Fondo de Desarrollo Nacional,
is also planning to announce by Feb. 14 the prices and
conditions under which it will lend to the projects, Andrade
said. </p>
<p>Colombia is expecting banks and institutional investors to
finance a combined 28 trillion pesos, Andrade said, with the
government willing to fund 6 trillion pesos through its
development bank. Another 4 trillion pesos would come from
multilateral agencies such as the World Bank''s International
Finance Corp., he said. </p>
<p>The Colombian development bank may provide subordinated
loans to the projects for as much as 15 percent of the total
cost, Clemente del Valle, the bank''s president, said last week
in an interview. </p>

<p>Eleven Indian regional parties said
they were forming a bloc to coordinate positions in the current
session of parliament, a precursor to a possible coalition in
national elections due by May. </p>
<p>''The bloc has been set up primarily to raise issues
affecting the people in parliament,'' Sitaram Yechury, a leader
of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), told reporters in New
Delhi yesterday after a meeting of regional-party leaders. ''A
joint program will be launched later'' on campaigning together
in the general election, he said. </p>
<p>The regional parties seek to emerge as an alternative to
the ruling Congress party and the main opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party, with polls indicating no single group will be able
to form a majority. Rahul Gandhi''s Congress and Narendra Modi''s
BJP are wooing smaller parties to try to ensure victory. </p>
<p>''This is the first step toward a formal non-Congress, non-BJP national coalition, and it will emerge in some form closer
to the elections,'' said A.S. Narang, professor of political
science at the New Delhi-based Indira Gandhi National Open
University. ''There are parties that sense there won''t be a
clear mandate, and such a scenario serves as a chance for
regional chieftains to grab power at the federal level.'' </p>
<p>The regional parties are modeling themselves on the United
Front, which ran India''s government from 1996 to 1998 after
neither of the two main parties was able to form a coalition. A
similar alliance took power in 1989. </p>
<h2>Third Front </h2>
<p>Neither of these so-called third-front governments survived
a full five-year term. </p>
<p>The 11 parties in the new formation hold 92 seats in the
545-member lower house of the Indian parliament. </p>
<p>The regional parties that banded together yesterday
included the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist
Party of India, Janata Dal (United), Samajwadi Party, Biju
Janata Dal and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham. </p>
<p>Taking aim at the new bloc in remarks in West Bengal state
today, Modi said yesterday that politically left parties had
''destroyed'' the eastern region of India and that voters must
''banish them forever,'' Press Trust of India reported. </p>
<p>The BJP is set to win 188 seats in the 545-member lower
house, surpassing the 182 seats it won in 1999, according to a
C-Voter poll for India Today published Jan. 23. Congress may get
as few as 91 seats versus 210 now, dropping to its lowest on
record, the poll indicated. A separate survey on Jan. 24 showed
the BJP winning as many as 210 seats, with a maximum of 108 for
Congress. </p>
<p>The BJP and its allies would win 212 seats, more than the
159 seats they took in the 2009 elections, while the Congress-led alliance would get 103 seats, the C-Voter poll found. </p>
<p>Yechury said the future program of the regional parties
will contain issues related to the livelihood of the people,
upholding federalism and combating corruption. </p>
<p>The two houses of parliament yesterday faced repeated
disruption over a bill to create a new southern Indian state. </p>

<p>Right from the start, new Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is showing that he will operate differently from predecessor Steve Ballmer. </p> <p>On his first day leading the world''s largest software maker, Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran who was yesterday named CEO, exuded an understated calm during a less than 20-minute webcast for customers and employees. Rather than the customary press conference, the 46-year-old used the event to introduce himself and take questions from Microsoft Vice President Susan Hauser. The first line in his memo to employees started with ''today is a very humbling day for me.'' </p> <p>That contrasts with Ballmer, who for 14 years as Microsoft CEO was famous for his oversized personality. Ballmer, 57, once jumped out of a cake at Microsoft''s 25th anniversary party at Seattle''s Safeco Field and ran through the crowd giving high-fives as if he''d won the Super Bowl. In a memo to employees yesterday, Ballmer said he was ''pumped.'' </p> <p>If jarring, the change in style will be one of the advantages of choosing Nadella as Microsoft''s third CEO, said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. Ballmer''s aggressive salesmanship during the boom days of the personal-computer industry exemplified how Microsoft became the world''s most valuable company. Now the software maker needs a new approach as it plays catch-up in areas including tablets, smartphones and cloud services. </p> <p>''Nadella''s obviously a deep technologist, and he''s going to bring that back to a Microsoft that hasn''t had it in the CEO office for years,'' Yoffie said. </p> <h2>Changing Guard </h2> <p>Nadella''s low-key manner is also a sign of a changing of the guard in technology, as larger-than-life founders and near-founders such as Ballmer leave the scene. As part of yesterday''s changes, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also stepped aside as chairman and was replaced by lead independent director John Thompson. </p> <p>Microsoft isn''t the only technology company that has hired a product-focused CEO in recent years. Yahoo! Inc. recruited engineer Marissa Mayer from Google Inc. in 2012 to be CEO, while networking-equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. recently appointed Shaygan Kheradpir, who had built networks for Verizon Communications Inc. and others, as CEO. </p> <p>Opinion: Why Microsoft and Everyone Else Loves Indian CEOs</p><p>''This industry goes through cycles, and we''re in a cycle where customers are looking for new products,'' Kheradpir said in an interview yesterday. ''It''s not a sales or a marketing thing right now.'' </p> <p>Microsoft''s decision to forgo a press conference on Nadella''s ascension may also be an effort to show that ''the business isn''t about one person or personality,'' said Carol Blymire, a communications consultant. ''Maybe we''ve come to the end of the era of the rock star technology CEO.'' </p> <p>Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment. </p> <h2>Employee Rally </h2> <p>At a rally with employees yesterday at the atrium in Studio D, one of the newer buildings at Microsoft''s corporate campus in Redmond, Washington, Nadella demonstrated some continuity with the Ballmer-Gates era. Amid a standing-room-only crowd, Nadella appeared with Gates and Ballmer, who have been Microsoft''s only other two CEOs. Nadella emphasized the importance of software and talked about how the company is moving into devices and cloud services, according to a person who attended. </p> <p>Yet Nadella also delivered a message that it was time for a change. In his e-mail to employees, he wrote, ''Our industry does not respect tradition -- it only respects innovation. Make no mistake, we are headed for greater places.'' </p> <h2>Basketball, Cricket </h2> <p>The differences between Ballmer and Nadella begin with their backgrounds. Nadella is an engineer with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, as well as an MBA that he earned by taking weekend classes after he had started at Microsoft. Ballmer is an Ivy League-educated businessman who specialized in sales and marketing. </p> <p>The dissimilarities extend into the two men''s personal lives. Ballmer is known as a ferocious defender and rebounder on the basketball court. Nadella lists poetry as an interest and one of his favorite sports is cricket, which features scheduled tea breaks. </p> <p>''He''s a thoughtful, quiet leader who rallies people around him,'' former Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors said of Nadella. ''He works harder than anybody. He''ll make the tough calls but he''s very urbane and civil.'' </p> <h2>Ballmer''s Changes </h2> <p>Ballmer has made some changes in the past year that will help Nadella, said Will Poole, a former Microsoft vice president who left in 2008 and remains in close touch with the company. Last year, Ballmer discontinued a review system he had implemented that ranked each person in every work group on a bell curve, an approach that forced some employees to behave more politically. </p> <p>Ballmer also pushed through a major reorganization in July to break down walls at Microsoft. Rather than run their own discrete businesses, top executives now oversee functional areas, such as software and hardware engineering. </p> <p>Ballmer''s strained relationship with Wall Street also leaves Nadella plenty of room for improvement, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. </p> <p>''Ballmer wasn''t hands on with the Street,'' said Ives, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. ''I expect Nadella to be a lot more front and center, because it''s needed. He needs to prove that his vision is right.'' </p> <p>Nadella will still work with Ballmer in the boardroom, where both are directors. Having Ballmer there may make it complicated for Nadella to undo major initiatives from his predecessor, Yoffie said. </p> <p>''Communicating with his board will be as challenging in some ways as all the other challenges he''ll face with the external world,'' Yoffie said of Nadella. </p> <p>', 'Microsoft Gets Style Shift With Nadella Replacing Ballmer', 'By Peter Burrows and Dina Bass', 'Feb 05, 2014 12:01 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-05/microsoft-gets-style-shift-with-nadella-replacing-ballmer.html') LIMIT 1;

compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has fallen from a more-than
three-month high of 74.5 basis points on Feb. 3. </p>
<p>A stronger employment outlook may bolster investor
confidence in a strengthening economy, which would help
companies repay their obligations. Jobless claims dropped by
20,000 to 331,000 in the period ended Feb. 1, the Labor
Department reported today in Washington, signaling employers are
confident demand for goods and services will hold up at the same
time fiscal restraints ease. The median forecast of economists

to a report yesterday by the ADP Research Institute in Roseland,
New Jersey. </p>
<p>The credit swaps measure typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point

debt. </p>
<p>IBM sold $1 billion of two-year floating-rate notes to

<p>The world''s biggest computer-services provider also issued
$750 million of 1.95 percent, five-year debt to yield 48 basis

billion in the period ended Aug. 7. </p>
<p>Commercial paper sold by non-U.S. financial institutions
fell $13.3 billion to $239 billion, the lowest level since the
period ended July 17, while the amount issued by U.S.-based
banks decreased $6.6 billion to $267.6 billion, the lowest level
since the period ended Sept. 4. Corporations sell commercial

<p>Einhorn, who runs $10 billion hedge-fund firm Greenlight
Capital Inc., first criticized Green Mountain at an Oct. 17,
2011 conference saying that the company should improve its
disclosure and that it has a ''litany of accounting questions.''
Shares of Green Mountain, which were trading at about $92 before
Einhorn''s 2011 comments, have advanced more than 10 percent
since then. </p>
<p>Einhorn is also chairman of Greenlight Capital Re Ltd. and
has been discussing Green Mountain on the Cayman Islands-based
reinsurer''s conference calls for at least a year-and-a-half. The
bet helped Greenlight in the second quarter of 2012, when Green
Mountain dropped 54 percent to $21.78. Einhorn hasn''t disclosed
the size of his wager against Green Mountain, or if he is still
sticking to it. </p>

<p>The appeal centered on a single aspect of a patent covering
the active ingredient, pregabalin. The generic-drug makers

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is raising its bet on Africa by spending $100 million to bring
its Watson technology to the continent. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest computer-services provider plans to
introduce Watson, an artificial-intelligence system best known
for beating humans on the ''Jeopardy!'' game show, to government
agencies, universities, scientists and other partners in Africa
to process socioeconomic information, the company said in a
statement. It will also establish a research center to help
advance a 10-year IBM initiative to spur development. </p>
<p>The moves are part of an effort by Chief Executive Officer
Ginni Rometty to make the continent into a growth engine for
IBM, which has reported seven consecutive quarters of falling
revenue. Last year''s 5 percent sales decline in its traditional
growth markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China helped drag
down total revenue. </p>
<p>In Africa, ''we''re getting more partners and we''re helping
the economic development,'' Solomon Assefa, an IBM researcher,
said in an interview. ''Africa is really moving forward. We
believe that this investment reflects that it''s also a very good
business decision.'' </p>
<p>IBM will be expanding its investment in Watson as the
Armonk, New York-based company looks to data analytics to boost
growth. IBM said last month that it will spend $1 billion to
create a new division around Watson, which analyzes troves of
data and can answer questions in conversational language. </p>
<h2>Research Center </h2>
<p>Last year, the company opened a research laboratory in
Nairobi, Kenya, its 12th in the world. In 2013, IBM had
operations in more than 20 African countries, up from four in
2006. </p>
<p>Watson can analyze large amounts of data after the
information is uploaded to the tool. Assefa said IBM''s new
research center, the Center of Excellence for Data-Driven
Development, will serve as a central point for universities,
government agencies and other partners to upload data. Assefa
declined to comment on partners for the project. </p>
<p>Health care and education will be two initial focus areas
for which IBM intends to deploy the Watson technology, he said. </p>

Henry Paulson, have helped Republican Neel Kashkari raise almost
$1 million in his bid for California''s governorship. </p>
<p>Kashkari, a former Goldman vice president who as a Treasury
official managed the $700 billion rescue of the U.S. banking
system, reported $976,000 in contributions since announcing his
candidacy on Jan. 21. The donations included $79,400 from

according to a filing yesterday with the California Secretary of

weeks underscores Neel''s strength as a candidate, and it will
help ensure that we have the resources necessary to share with
voters his vision for turning California around,'' Pat Melton,
Kashkari''s campaign manager, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Kashkari, 40, is running in California''s June 3 primary,
where the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advance to
the November general election. Also running for governor is
Republican state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, 47, who raised
$374,000 last year. </p>
<p>Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat who hasn''t said whether
he''ll seek another term, has $17 million in campaign funds from

from Menlo Park, California, who donated $27,200; and Andrew Gordon, an investment banker from Los Angeles, who gave $5,000. </p>

Kentfield, California, gave $9,000 and O''Malley Miller, a
partner at the law firm Munger, Tolles  Olson LLP, who has
represented Goldman Sachs, gave $10,000, according to the

billion of 3.625 percent, 10-year notes to yield 95 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The
Armonk, New York-based company also issued $1.5 billion of five-year notes in fixed- and floating-rate portions and $1 billion
of two-year floaters. </p>
<p>BP, Europe''s second-largest oil company, issued $2.5
billion of bonds in three parts through its BP Capital Markets
unit, Bloomberg data show. The largest portion, $1.25 billion of
3.81 percent, 10-year securities, priced with a relative yield
of 115 basis points. </p>
<p>Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $17
billion, compared with $13.2 billion last week and a weekly

<p>JPMorgan put the pool of debt, a portion of which is tied

<p>Sales of the debt are accelerating amid financial
regulations that force banks to pledge more capital for some
assets they hold, including non-performing loans, or NPLs. The
government also is adding to the supply as it auctions the debt
to help prevent foreclosures and stem losses at the Federal
Housing Administration. </p>

borrower is not a core customer,''Ashish Pandey, chief

<p>''The selloff in emerging markets has much more to do with
China than with Fed tapering,'' Moffitt said yesterday in an

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and General
Electric Co. (GE)''s finance arm had their smallest Samurai-bond sales
in more than nine years as a global stock rout damped investor
demand for debt that offered investors record-low yields. </p>
<p>General Electric Capital Corp. sold 55 billion yen ($536
million) in three-year fixed-rate, yen-denominated notes that
pay 0.313 percent on Feb. 6, while JPMorgan offered 48.5 billion
yen in a two-tranche deal, including three-year fixed-rate notes
offering 0.373 percent. Those rates are the lowest ever paid by
the companies on the yen-denominated debt, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Japanese investors are wary of buying overseas debt
offering such low yields after concerns that the Chinese economy
is slowing and the impact from U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus
cuts triggered a selloff in emerging-market currencies and
global stocks. JPMorgan joined Morgan Stanley last week in
agreeing to pay $1.86 billion to settle U.S. accusations of
misconduct in their handling of home loans and related
securities that left taxpayers shouldering losses after the
global financial crisis. </p>
<p>''Compared with notes from local issuers, Samurai bonds are
more exposed to overseas risk,'' said Yoshihiro Nakatani, a
Tokyo-based senior fund manager who oversees about 100 billion
yen of bonds at Asahi Life Asset Management Co. ''Spreads on
Samurai have fallen to unattractive levels, and it will be
difficult for Japanese investors to buy at the kind of rates
offered by JPMorgan and GE in future.'' </p>
<h2>Spread ''Unattractive'' </h2>
<p>Nakatani, who has invested in GE Capital''s debt in the
past, said he didn''t buy the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
company''s notes this time because the spread was
''unattractive.'' He doesn''t invest in U.S. banks like JPMorgan
as they can be affected more by financial regulation, he said. </p>
<p>Tom Steiner, a London-based spokesman for GE Capital,
declined to comment on the company''s sale. Yukako Yoshino, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Tokyo, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last had a Samurai sale smaller than last week''s
in September 2004, when it issued 25 billion yen in notes,
following two bigger sales the same year, according to
Bloomberg-compiled data. General Electric hasn''t had a smaller
sale, according to the data going back to 1999. </p>
<p>GE Capital sold 95 billion yen of Samurai notes in
September, including 72.1 billion yen in debt also 10 basis
points over yen swaps. The spread on securities of the same
length offered last week declined to 4 basis points. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>JPMorgan issued 105.6 billion yen of Samurai bonds in June,
including 51.5 billion yen in three-year notes at 10 basis
points over swaps, the same level as last week. </p>
<h2>Falling Spread </h2>
<p>The average spread on Samurais was at 41 basis points on
Feb. 6, the least since November 2007, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>GE is rated AA+ by Standard  Poor''s, its second-highest
ranking, and four levels above the A grade it gives JPMorgan.
SP lowered its outlook on JPMorgan to negative from stable in
June, saying that the likelihood of ''extraordinary'' government
support for the U.S. bank is waning. </p>
<p>The Topix index of Japanese shares has fallen 8.7 percent
this year after a 52 percent gain in 2013. The gauge rose on
Feb. 7 to pare a fifth straight week of losses. </p>
<p>''Stock prices are falling and investors are worried, so
they aren''t going after credit investments,'' said Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo, in a
telephone interview. ''There''s very little incentive to make
investments at such low levels at a difficult time to assess
risk.'' </p>
<h2>Biggest Seller </h2>
<p>JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. seller of Samurai bonds since
the global financial crisis, issuing 426.7 billion yen of the
notes from 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
General Electric is the second largest, at 370.7 billion yen. </p>
<p>Issuers from Australia to Norway have raised about 370
billion yen via Samurai sales this year, up from 60 billion for
the entire first quarter of last year. National Australia Bank
Ltd. is the biggest issuer of the securities this year, having
sold 123.8 billion yen last month. Norway''s DNB Bank ASA sold
81.6 billion yen also in January. </p>
<p>''Following the emerging-market shock, and possibility of
spreads widening for overseas names, there appears to have been
a feeling that there wasn''t a need to rush to buy GE Capital''s
Samurai this time,'' said Yusuke Ueda, a Tokyo-based credit
analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For JPMorgan, ''the
tone seems to have been a little different'' and the bank had
less of a need to sell Samurai debt, he said. </p>
<h2>Mortgage Settlement </h2>
<p>JPMorgan will pay $614 million after admitting it submitted
ineligible loans for Federal Housing Administration and Veterans
Affairs insurance, according to a statement on Feb. 4 by the
U.S. Justice Department. </p>
<p>The company said in a statement the same day that the
''settlement represents another significant step in the firm''s
efforts to put historical mortgage-related issues behind it.''
The bank separately agreed last year to pay $4 billion to settle
Federal Housing Finance Agency claims related to about $33
billion in mortgage bonds. </p>
<p>''Under normal circumstances, JPMorgan probably would have
liked to sell a lot, lot more bonds'' at a premium of as little
as 10 basis points, said BNP''s Nakazora said. ''It''s litigation
risk has been very big.'' </p>

<p>Greenhill  Co. (GHL) hired Rodrigo Mello,
a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment-banking executive,
as a managing director to help build its new business in Brazil. </p>
<p>Mello, 39, will work in the Sao Paulo office for the New
York-based merger-and-acquisition advisory firm, according to
Daniel Wainstein, a former partner and chairman of Goldman
Sachs''s Brazil investment-banking business who joined Greenhill
in October. Mello left Goldman Sachs''s investment-banking
division in November after two stints totaling 14 years. </p>
<p>''Rodrigo Mello is one of the most experienced MA
executives in Brazil and a banker trusted by our clients,''
Wainstein said in an interview. ''We are very happy he decided
to join us.'' </p>
<p>Greenhill, founded by former Morgan Stanley President
Robert F. Greenhill, hired Wainstein, 43, to be the country head
for its first South American branch. The firm is growing in
Brazil as some international banks pull back. Goldman Sachs
halted an expansion there last year, and London-based Barclays
Plc has been reducing staff in Brazil as competition with local
lenders intensifies. </p>
<p>''If a region is going through some cyclical economic
challenges, it can be an even more opportune time for us to
recruit,'' Greenhill Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok said in a
statement in October. ''Brazil will certainly have its ups and
downs, just like the U.S. market does, but Brazil is clearly a
large market that will see significant economic growth over the
long term.'' </p>
<h2>Hiring Plans </h2>
<p>Wainstein is building a team to advise Brazilian companies
on global transactions. The short-term plan is to hire a senior
vice president, a vice president and three bankers at the
associate analyst level, he said in the interview. The office
already employs five executives, including Wainstein. </p>
<p>''Our goal is to build one of the most important MA
advisory platforms in Brazil using Greenhill''s international
relationship network,'' Wainstein said. </p>
<p>Announced mergers and acquisitions involving companies in
Brazil increased more than 18 percent to $78.8 billion last year
from 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Before Goldman Sachs, Mello was a private-equity executive
at Banco Santander SA. He also worked from 2005 to 2007 as chief
financial officer at Monte Cristalina SA, a holding company
owned by Joao Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder and the biggest
shareholder of Hypermarcas SA, the Sao Paulo-based consumer-goods maker. </p>

<p>Gilt Groupe Inc., an online retailer
of discounted luxury goods, picked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
manage its initial public offering, according to people with
knowledge of the deal. </p>
<p>Timing for the IPO has still not been decided, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement
hasn''t been made public. </p>
<p>E-commerce IPOs have been rare in recent years as
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) expanded its dominance by focusing on growth --
building warehouses and lowering prices -- while forgoing
profit. Zulily Inc., which runs a shopping site targeted at
moms, was an exception last year. After its share sale, Zulily
is now valued at $4.76 billion, making it the third-biggest U.S.
e-commerce company by market value, behind Amazon and EBay Inc. </p>
<p>Gilt, founded in 2007, was forced to cut divisions and
eliminate jobs after competition emerged for its flash sale
model, which involves offering limited-time deals at steep
discounts. The company named former Citigroup Inc. marketing
head Michelle Peluso as chief executive officer last year,
replacing co-founder Kevin Ryan. </p>
<p>In an interview in September with Bloomberg Radio, Peluso
said that an IPO is ''a likely path for us but we''re not in a
rush.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is an investor in Gilt and was part of a $138
million financing round in 2011, valuing the company at about $1
billion, that included Japan''s Softbank Corp. and venture
investors General Atlantic and Matrix Partners. The company has
raised a total of at least $240 million. </p>
<h2>Rising Revenue </h2>
<p>In 2012, Gilt generated $550 million in revenue, excluding
businesses it discontinued, up from $450 million the prior year.
The company was expected to generate cash from operations by the
end of last year, Peluso said in September. </p>
<p>Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for New York-based Gilt,
declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The U.S. e-commerce market is expected to climb 15 percent
this year to $300.6 billion, according to researcher EMarketer
Inc. Revenue at Seattle-based Amazon is projected to rise 21
percent to $90 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Gilt''s current deals include a pair of Elizabeth  James
womens'' sandals for $129, down from $198, and a $449 Hickey
mens'' pinstripe sports coat, down from $895. </p>
<h2>Leaving Flash </h2>
<p>Some Gilt rivals have moved away from flash sales and
others are stumbling. Fab.com Inc. stopped its flash technique
last year, opting instead to let customers track departments and
products they like, and has cut jobs. Rue La La and Lot18 laid
off employees and scaled back. Totsy, a flash site aimed at
moms, liquidated its assets last year. </p>
<p>Ventee-Privee.com, a French e-retailer that competes with
Gilt, plans to more than quadruple revenue in the next decade by
extending the flash model, founder Jacques-Antoine Granjon said
this month. </p>
<p>Peluso was CEO of Sabre Corp.''s online flight reservations
unit, Travelocity, which she helped modernize starting in 2003.
In 2009, the year she joined the board of Gilt, she began
working for Citigroup and became chief marketing and Internet
officer, aiming to make banking technology more consumer-friendly. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $13 billion
fraud settlement with the U.S. government should be blocked
until a court is able to review it, a Wall Street watchdog group
founded by an Atlanta hedge fund manager said. </p>
<p>Better Markets Inc. is seeking judicial scrutiny of the
accord because it''s the largest settlement ''with a single
entity in the 237-year history of the U.S.,'' according to a
complaint filed today in Washington federal court. ''No one has
any ability to determine if the $13 billion agreement is fair''
or ''if it is a sweetheart deal,'' the group said in the filing. </p>
<p>The accord, announced in November, settled allegations that
the biggest U.S. lender by assets misled investors and the
public when it sold bonds backed by faulty residential
mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed JPMorgan''s actions
for helping to cause the credit crisis, and said the agreement
didn''t shield JPMorgan or its employees from possible charges. </p>
<p>The Justice Department ''acted as investigator, prosecutor,
judge, juror, sentencer and collector,'' Dennis Kelleher, chief
executive officer of Better Markets, said at a press conference
in Washington. The agreement was ''mostly designed to conceal,
not reveal.'' </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the complaint. </p>
<p>''The department is confident that the settlement reached
with JPMorgan Chase complies with the law,'' Ellen Canale, a
Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>''Financial Reform'' </h2>
<p>Better Markets describes itself as ''a nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization that promotes the public interest in
financial reform.'' It was founded by Michael Masters, founder
and managing member of Atlanta-based Masters Capital Management. </p>
<p>The group expects that its standing to bring the complaint
will be challenged, Kelleher said. </p>
<p>''It will be hotly contested but I believe we have a solid
foundation to prove and demonstrate concrete and demonstrable
harm that give us ample standing to assert both the
constitutional claims and the statutory claims,'' Kelleher said. </p>
<p>''If we do not, what that means is that no one in the
United States can ever challenge a backroom deal like this cut
by any attorney general,'' he said. </p>
<p>Better Markets'' standing derives from its public interest
purpose being thwarted by a lack of transparency in the
settlement process and the lack of a ''judicial forum in which
it could seek to participate to influence'' the outcome, the
group said in its complaint. </p>
<h2>''Novel Claim'' </h2>
<p>The complaint doesn''t cite any precedents for challenges to
similar Justice Department settlements with banks. </p>
<p>''I think it''s fair to call it a novel claim,'' driven by
uniquely damaging and far-reaching circumstances, Kelleher said
in a phone interview following his press conference. </p>
<p>At least one portion of the settlement, a $2 billion civil
penalty obtained under the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA, explicitly
required a court to levy the sanction, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>Better Markets also alleged that the Justice Department and
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ''have an apparent conflict of
interest'' because they have been criticized for failing to be
tough enough on large Wall Street firms and ''have aggressively
used the $13 billion agreement to try to restore their
reputations.'' </p>
<p>The settlement is ''a mere contract'' whereby JPMorgan
agreed to pay ''in exchange for complete civil immunity from DOJ
for years of pervasive, egregious and knowing alleged fraud and
other illegal conduct related to the worst financial crash in
the U.S. since 1929,'' according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Better Markets Inc. v. U.S. Department of
Justice, 14-cv-00190, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the U.S.
bank most reliant on trading, named Ashok Varadhan as the third
co-head of that division. </p>
<p>Varadhan, the 41-year-old chief of macro trading, joins
Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet in running the securities
division, according to an internal memo obtained today by
Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed the memo''s contents. </p>
<p>Varadhan will help run the business that generates the most
revenue and profit among Goldman Sachs''s segments and that has
produced many of its top officers. He takes over as the trading
unit faces constraints from new capital rules and has seen
declines in revenue in three of the past four years. </p>
<p>He joined Goldman Sachs in swap trading in 1998, and was
named a partner at age 30 four years later. He was chosen to run
North American interest-rate products in 2001 and became head of
foreign exchange in 2007. </p>

Ashok has demonstrated dedication to our clients and a deep

equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13 percent from a

giants JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. </p>

<p>Russian stocks fell for the first
time in four days, erasing earlier gains, as investors awaited
Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen''s first report on monetary
policy and oil declined. </p>
<p>The Micex Index (INDEXCF) dropped 0.2 percent to 1,476.28 by the
close in Moscow after risen as much as 0.5 percent in the
session. Food retailer OAO Magnit fell 2.1 percent, the most
since Jan. 21, while OAO Sberbank, the nation''s biggest lender,
sank 1.2 percent to 95.49 rubles. </p>
<p>The Micex followed U.S. stocks lower before Yellen speaks
on policy and the outlook for the economy tomorrow for the first
time after being sworn in as the central bank''s head on Feb. 3.
Crude oil, Russia''s chief export earner, snapped three days of
gains in London, sinking as much as 0.6 percent to $108.87 a
barrel after the biggest gain in three months on Feb. 7. </p>
<p>''Without a boost to the risk appetite, Russia is hardly
going to rise, despite the high oil price,'' Evgeny Loktyukhov,
an analyst at OAO Promsvyazbank, said by e-mail.  ''The nearest
risk is tomorrow''s speech by the new head of the Federal Reserve
Yellen, which can shed some light on the Fed''s plans regarding
stimulus tapering and spur a re-evaluation of the risks behind
emerging markets.'' </p>
<p>The Fed pressed ahead with scaling back stimulus in
January, cutting its monthly bond buying by $10 billion to $65
billion. The Micex Index advanced an average 77 percent during
the Fed''s first two rounds of debt purchases, and fell 0.6
percent in periods of no stimulus, the biggest difference of 46
emerging and developed markets tracked by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Ruble Depreciation </h2>
<p>The dollar-denominated RTS Index (RTSI$) fell 0.4 percent to
1,336.02. Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
developing-nation economies monitored by Bloomberg. Shares on
the Micex trade at 3.2 times projected 12-month earnings,
compared with a multiple of 9.1 for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index. </p>
<p>The ruble has slumped 5.6 percent against the dollar in
2014, the fourth-worst performer among 24 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, amid Fed tapering. A weaker
ruble encourages Russians to withdraw and convert local-currency
deposits, while hurting retailers by making imports more
expensive. </p>
<h2>Banks, Magnit </h2>
<p>Sberbank snapped three days of gains in Moscow, while its
depositary receipts retreated 0.9 percent in London to $11.03.
VTB Group, the nation''s second-biggest lender, tumbled 1.1
percent to 4.55 kopeks and dropped 0.2 percent in the U.K.
capital to $2.58. </p>
<p>Magnit, Russia''s biggest grocer, fell to 8,279.90 rubles.
The company''s net retail sales increased 25 percent in January
to 51.7 billion rubles ($1.5 billion), the company based in
Krasnodar, southern Russia, said today. </p>
<p>''Magnit posted good results but people always have
inflated expectations for them,'' Sergey Vakhrameev, an analyst
in Moscow at AnkorInvest LLC, said by phone. ''Ruble devaluation
is negative for banks.'' </p>
<p>The ruble depreciation should help ''provide a constructive
outlook for Russian energy names in 2014,'' according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., which raised its coverage view on the nation''s
oil industry to attractive from neutral. </p>
<p>OAO Rosneft (ROSN), which was lifted to buy at Goldman analysts
including Geydar Mamedov in a report today, advanced 0.6 percent
to 247.41 rubles in Moscow, while OAO Lukoil, Russia''s biggest
non-state crude producer, added 0.6 percent to 1,987.50 rubles.
OAO Bashneft jumped 4 percent to 2,163 rubles. </p>
<p>Rosneft, the nation''s largest crude producer, should
benefit from improving capital spending control this year and
strengthening cash-flow generation, as well as the ruble''s
decline against the dollar, Goldman said. </p>
<p>''Unlike banks, oil companies benefit from the ruble
devaluation,'' AnkorInvest''s Vakhrameev said. </p>

<p>The forint declined the most in a
week as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said further interest-rate cuts
will make Hungary vulnerable amid a global sell-off in riskier
assets. </p>
<p>The forint weakened 1.3 percent to 311.83 per euro by 4:55
p.m. in Budapest, the biggest decline among 24 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on the government''s
benchmark three-year bonds rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.91 percent. </p>
<p>The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which in January reduced the
benchmark rate to a record 2.85 percent in its 18th month of
cuts, said there was room for further easing after government-imposed energy price cuts sent inflation to the lowest in more
than 40 years. Policy makers are moving out of step with peers
in Turkey, India and South Africa, which increased interest
rates to help stem outflows. </p>
<p>''The erosion in real rates has been the strongest,
Hungary-specific factor differentiating Hungary from other
countries in the region in this latest sell-off,'' Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at Goldman, wrote in an e-mailed
report dated Feb. 7. The policy stance diverging from peers
leaves Hungary ''exposed,'' Polan wrote. </p>
<p>Policy makers will reduce the main rate by 10 basis points
to 2.75 percent on Feb. 18, according to the median of 10
economists in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The central bank will probably deliver a ''small,
symbolic'' rate cut next week before adopting a ''very
cautious'' stance, Polan wrote. Further depreciation beyond
about 320 to 325 per euro would make an increase in the
benchmark rate more likely, Polan said. </p>
<p>Hungary''s slow price growth will probably make the central
bank ''dangerously comfortable with the ultra-dovish stance,''
Luis Costa, a London-based strategist at Citigroup Inc., wrote
by e-mail today. ''The forint looks quite vulnerable, and it is
the best/most liquid way to express the glaring monetary policy
risks in Hungary at this juncture.'' </p>
<p>Data on Feb. 14 will probably show Hungary''s inflation rate
slowed to 0.2 percent in January from 0.4 percent in the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>''Investors say the forint''s weakness is connected to the
central bank''s commitment to monetary easing,'' Gergely Tardos,
Budapest-based head of research at OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary''s
largest lender, wrote in an e-mailed report today. ''If euro-forint doesn''t rise substantially above 315 and the pressure to
tighten subsides, the Monetary Council will probably cut rates
again this month.'' </p>

of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s macro trading team in the Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan, plans to start his own Hong

<p>The new company aims to start an Asia-focused global macro

mainly currency and interest-rate instruments, they said. </p>
<p>It joins other Asia-focused macro hedge funds that have

investment opportunities. The Eurekahedge Asia Macro Hedge Fund
Index gained 9 percent last year, the largest annual gain in
four years, and outperformed the 8 percent return by the index
that tracks global hedge funds across all strategies. </p>
<p>''Asia-based macro hedge funds have a natural advantage in
taking information gained from their front-row seats and turning
that information into trade and investment ideas,''said Ed Rogers, chief executive officer of Tokyo-based Rogers Investment
Advisors.  ''Asian economies remain the ones to watch as many
transition from emerging markets to developed markets.'' </p>

<p>''Asia offers a large diversity of instruments to express a

Singapore-based Lotus Peak Capital Pte. </p>
<p>A skilled manager will be able to benefit from
opportunities including the Japanese quantitative easing;
China''s liberalization and internationalization of its financial
markets, and the controlled appreciation of its currency; and
the various monetary and fiscal policies from governments in
Southeast Asia and India, Pizzo added. </p>
<p>The HFRI Macro Index dropped 1.1 percent in January, hurt
by declining emerging markets, and losses for trend-following
funds and those that trade with computer models, Chicago-based
Hedge Fund Research Inc. said in a statement dated Feb. 7. </p>
<h2>Leaving Goldman </h2>
<p>Lim left Goldman Sachs on Jan. 24, according to his
licensing record with Hong Kong''s Securities and Futures
Commission. He decided to retire from Goldman Sachs after 17
years with the New York-based bank, according to an internal
memo. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, confirmed today the content of the memo dated Jan. 21,
declining to comment further. </p>
<p>Lim, 37, joined Goldman Sachs in New York in 1997 on its
foreign-exchange options desk and moved to Asia in 1999 to work
on such instruments in Hong Kong and Tokyo, according to the
internal memo. He managed foreign exchange and interest-rate
derivatives trading in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan
before his appointment to the latest position in 2012, it added. </p>
<p>He was promoted to managing director in 2006 and made
partner in 2010, according to the memo from the bank''s co-heads
of sales and trading Isabelle Ealet and Pablo J. Salame. </p>
<h2>''Politicized Regulation'' </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs named Hidehiro Imatsu to co-head Asia-Pacific
macro trading, including interest-rate and exchange products,
with Stuart Riley, according to a separate internal memo also
dated Jan. 21. Imatsu was head of macro trading in Japan. </p>
<p>Lim''s departure was not related to regulatory
investigations in possible rate-rigging at various banks, said
the people. He will lead investments at his own company, said
the people said, without naming the firm. </p>
<p>Traders have been leaving various banks to set up their own
hedge funds amid tighter regulation, said Peter Douglas,
principal of Singapore-based GFIA Pte. </p>
<p>''Because of increasingly politicized regulation, it makes
sense for traders to establish non-banking pools of capital and
continue to trade, but in a more flexible environment and
sourced from third parties rather than their banks,'' Douglas
said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s New Zealand unit
isn''t liable for the cost of cleaning up waterfront land it
leased in Auckland partly because the country has no laws to
deal with the issue, a judge ruled. </p>
<p>The Auckland Waterfront Development Agency, which is
undertaking New Zealand''s biggest urban revitalization project,
sought NZ$10 million ($8.3 million) from Mobil Oil New Zealand
Ltd. to pay for the cost of the clean up in the area known as
Wynyard Quarter, according to the ruling. </p>
<p>Mobil Oil operated a bulk fuel storage and distribution
center at the site since the 1950s, leaving the properties
''heavily contaminated'' when it ceased operations in 2011, the
judge said. The contamination was caused by Mobil''s own
operations as well as what was left by previous oil company
tenants and what had spread from neighbors, such as a 1.8
million liter spill of jet fuel by a Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) unit
in 1986, the judge said. </p>
<p>''Unlike a number of other countries, New Zealand has no
specific legislation dealing with liability for historic
contaminated sites,'' High Court Justice Sarah Katz wrote in the
Feb. 7 decision, posted on the court''s website today. </p>
<p>Mobil acted reasonably, leaving the property in a condition
suitable to be taken over by another industrial tenant, Katz
said. </p>
<p>When it signed the last lease in 1985, ''there was no
realistic possibility of the land being used for commercial or
residential purposes,'' the judge wrote. ''It was not until a
further plan change became operative in 2010 that there were
concrete provisions to develop the Wynyard Quarter.'' </p>
<p>The area is now being developed to include a mix of
residential, retail and commercial uses, while retaining
existing marine and fishing industry uses, the judge said. </p>

ranks of the BJP. The U.K., Australia and the European Union
have resumed ties with Modi over the past few years. </p>
<p>Modi has trumpeted his transformation of Gujarat into one
of India''s most business-friendly states, luring investors with
faster approval process for developments, a network of roads and
ports and uninterrupted power supply, a rarity in India.
Political opponents and rights groups had earlier accused him of
allowing the 2002 violence to continue. </p>
<p>The riots saw Hindu mobs rape and kill Muslims after a fire
on a train claimed 58 lives, among them Hindu pilgrims. Modi
allegedly instructed police to stand down and allow the violence
to go on, according to findings by a Concerned Citizens
Tribunal, a group with no legal standing comprised of former
judges, professors and a retired police officer. </p>
<h2>Opinion Polls </h2>
<p>Modi denies any wrongdoing and a Supreme Court-appointed
panel investigating one documented incident found no evidence
that he made decisions that prevented victims from receiving
assistance. He said he did his best to maintain law and order,
and his administration later won re-election in the state. </p>
<p>The BJP is set to win 188 seats in the 545-member lower
house, surpassing the 182 seats it won in 1999, according to a
C-Voter poll for India Today published on Jan. 23. Congress may
get as few as 91 seats versus 210 now, dropping to its lowest on
record, the poll indicated, without giving a margin of error. </p>
<p>Tensions between the U.S. and India increased in December
after diplomat Devyani Khobragade was arrested in New York,
strip-searched and charged with visa fraud for allegedly
underpaying her babysitter. Khobragade returned to India on Jan.
10 after she was indicted. </p>

<p>Gilt Groupe Inc., an e-retailer, and
MobileIron Inc., whose software protects smartphones, are
working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on their initial public
offerings, said people with knowledge of the deals. </p>
<p>Gilt''s timing is still being decided, while MobileIron has
enlisted other banks including Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG
and Barclays Plc, said people familiar with the companies, who
asked not to be identified because the deals haven''t been
announced. </p>
<p>The coming IPOs are part of a revival in technology
offerings that includes the debut of Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc.
and dozens of other Internet and software companies in the past
two years. The 14 U.S. companies that raised the most money in
offerings since mid-February of 2012 are all trading above their
IPO price, a stretch during which the Nasdaq Composite Index has
jumped 41 percent. </p>
<p>''When you have companies consistently coming to market and
performing well in the after market, more and more companies
keep coming,'' said Sharon Wienbar, a partner at venture-capital
firm Scale Venture Partners in Foster City, California. ''There
are a number of substantial technology disruptions favoring
startups.'' </p>
<p>Even with the surging popularity of technology deals, e-commerce IPOs have been rare as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) expanded its
dominance by focusing on growth at the expense of profit. Zulily
Inc., which runs a shopping site targeted at moms, was an
exception last year. After its share sale, Zulily is now valued
at $4.76 billion, making it the third-biggest U.S. e-commerce
company by market value, behind Amazon and EBay Inc. </p>
<h2>New CEO </h2>
<p>Gilt is trying to follow Zulily''s lead after new Chief
Executive Officer Michelle Peluso revamped the company. Founded
in 2007, Gilt was forced to cut divisions and eliminate jobs as
competition emerged for its flash sale model, which involves
offering limited-time deals at steep discounts. The company
named the former Citigroup Inc. marketing head as chief
executive officer last year, replacing co-founder Kevin Ryan. </p>
<p>In an interview in September with Bloomberg Radio, Peluso
said that an IPO is ''a likely path for us but we''re not in a
rush.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is an investor in Gilt and was part of a $138
million financing round in 2011, valuing the company at about $1
billion, that included Japan''s Softbank Corp. and venture
investors General Atlantic and Matrix Partners. The company has
raised a total of at least $240 million. </p>
<p>Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for New York-based Gilt,
declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to
comment. </p>
<h2>Devices Galore </h2>
<p>MobileIron, also founded in 2007, has raised about $150
million from venture investors including Sequoia Capital,
Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital and Institutional
Venture Partners. </p>
<p>Demand for software that manages data on a variety of
mobile devices is growing as employees bring smartphones and
tablets from Apple Inc. to Google Inc. into the workplace,
instead of relying on company-issued devices made by BlackBerry
Ltd. MobileIron''s biggest competitor, AirWatch LLC, agreed to be
acquired last month by VMware Inc. for $1.54 billion. </p>
<p>Sales of mobile-device management, or MDM, software could
reach $1.6 billion this year, compared with $784 million in
2012, according to forecasts by researcher Gartner Inc. </p>
<p>''We don''t have anything to share at this time,'' Clarissa
Horowitz, senior director of communications at Mountain View,
California-based MobileIron, said by e-mail about plans for an
IPO. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank
and Barclays declined to comment on the MobileIron IPO. </p>
<h2>Rising Revenue </h2>
<p>In 2012, Gilt generated $550 million in revenue, excluding
businesses it discontinued, up from $450 million the prior year.
The company was expected to generate cash from operations by the
end of last year, Peluso said in September. </p>
<p>The U.S. e-commerce market is expected to climb 15 percent
this year to $300.6 billion, according to researcher EMarketer
Inc. Revenue at Seattle-based Amazon is projected to rise 21
percent to $90 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Gilt''s current deals include a pair of Elizabeth  James
womens'' sandals for $129, down from $198, and a $449 Hickey
mens'' pinstripe sports coat, down from $895. </p>
<p>Some Gilt rivals have moved away from flash sales and
others are stumbling. Fab.com Inc. stopped its flash technique
last year, opting instead to let customers track departments and
products they like, and has cut jobs. Rue La La and Lot18 laid
off employees and scaled back. Totsy, a flash site aimed at
moms, liquidated its assets last year. </p>
<h2>French Contrast </h2>
<p>Ventee-Privee.com, a French e-retailer that competes with
Gilt, plans to more than quadruple revenue in the next decade by
extending the flash model, founder Jacques-Antoine Granjon said
this month. </p>
<p>Gilt''s offering could boost the New York startup scene,
which has lacked marquee technology offerings. Video-ad provider
Tremor Video Inc. (TRMR) has lost more than half its value since going
public last year, while startups Fab, Foursquare Labs Inc. and
Etsy Inc. have struggled as private companies. Photo and video
marketplace Shutterstock Inc. has been the outlier, more than
quadrupling since its 2012 IPO. </p>

<p>Iraq is considering additional
measures against Exxon Mobil Corp. over deals the company signed
with the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, Deputy Prime Minister
for Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani said. </p>
<p>The Oil Ministry is ''studying other measures'' against
Exxon after requiring the company to reduce its involvement in
the West Qurna-1 field last year. Authorities in Baghdad have
received a reply from the Kurdistan Regional Government, or KRG,
on proposals for ending an impasse over oil exports from the
region, al-Shahristani told reporters today in Baghdad. </p>
<p>''Exxon violated Iraqi law, they were informed about that,
and Iraq started to take measures regarding it,'' Shahristani
said. Now, the ''ministry is studying other measures for
violating Iraqi laws,'' he said. </p>
<p>Iraq''s Kurds have halted crude flows via the national
export pipeline to Turkey amid a dispute with authorities in
Baghdad on the legality of deals the Kurds signed with
international companies, such as Exxon and Total SA. The KRG has
announced plans to sell crude it has pumped through its own new
pipeline to Turkey. </p>
<p>Shahristani didn''t give details of the KRG''s response to
the central government''s proposals for settling the dispute. </p>
<p>National oil production is also being constrained by
insufficient storage space in the south, Shahristani said. Iraq
will be unable to maintain production levels at full capacity of
3.5 million barrels a day unless it increases handling capacity
at the southern port of al-Faw, Shahristani said. </p>
<p>Iraq pumped as much as 3.524 million barrels on one day in
January, he said. Monthly production in January was 3.05 million
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
nation said it pumped an average 2.85 million barrels in direct
submissions to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
in a report that was released today. </p>

<p>Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto
will challenge a judge''s ruling that the country''s
telecommunications regulator lacks the standing to force
broadcasters including Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) to let cable and
satellite companies carry their content for free. </p>
<p>The government will file an appeal with the Supreme Court
on behalf of the Federal Telecommunications Institute to
overturn the lower court''s decision, presidential spokesman
Eduardo Sanchez said today at an event in Mexico City. The
agency, known as IFT, earlier said in an e-mailed statement that
the judge''s ruling on Feb. 10 interferes with its ability to
regulate the industry. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, started by Televisa, undermines an initiative
passed by Mexican lawmakers in June that requires broadcasters
to offer their over-the-air programming to carriers without
charging a fee or packaging them with other channels. </p>
<p>Citing the June law, Dish Mexico, the nation''s second-largest satellite-TV company, and phone carrier Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO) added
signals from Televisa and TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP), Mexico''s two largest
broadcasters, to their channel lineups in September for no extra
charge. Previously, cable and satellite providers had to pay for
the broadcast networks as part of a bundle of channels. </p>
<p>Televisa and Azteca, both based in Mexico City, had
disputed Dish''s move to go ahead with the retransmissions,
arguing that it hadn''t yet been properly authorized by the
regulatory agency, which itself was created by the June law. </p>
<h2>Retransmission Fees </h2>
<p>Billionaire Charlie Ergen, who co-owns Dish Mexico through
EchoStar Corp. (SATS), pressed the telecommunications institute this
week in a statement to let the satellite company keep
retransmitting the broadcasters'' programming for free. </p>
<p>In an e-mailed statement after the government announcement
today, Televisa said Dish Mexico was ''disqualifying the
judicial process to benefit its own interests.'' The lawsuit
seeks to protect Televisa''s right to control its intellectual
property, the company said. </p>
<p>Televisa shares fell 2.6 percent to 76.41 pesos at the
close in Mexico City, while TV Azteca declined 2.3 percent to
8.23 pesos. Axtel dropped 1.4 percent to 5.08 pesos. Echostar
fell 1.3 percent to $47.87 at the close in New York. </p>

<p>Ryan Crane, a JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co.
employee who in a 14-year career at the New York-based bank rose
to executive director of a unit that trades blocks of stocks for

<p>He died on Feb. 3 at his Stamford, Connecticut, home,
according to the website of Leo P. Gallagher  Son Funeral Home
in Greenwich, Connecticut. The cause of death will be determined
when a toxicology report is completed in about six weeks, said a

<p>India will award permits this month
to build solar power plants in the first national auction since
2011 as a trade spat with the U.S. over import curbs deepens. </p>
<p>ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a company backed by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., the Tata group, whose businesses span software
to automobiles, and First Solar Inc. (FSLR), the biggest U.S. maker of
solar panels, are among 68 bidders vying for projects as India
seeks clean alternatives to fossil fuels. The winners for the
750 megawatts of capacity will be announced by the end of this
month. </p>
<p>India plans a sixfold increase in solar capacity that may
draw $11.7 billion of investment by 2017 as the technology sheds
perceptions that risks are high. In contrast, banks are slowing
lending to coal and gas-fired projects hamstrung by a fuel
squeeze. Rising demand for equipment is also prompting panel
makers to seek a bigger share of the trade as the U.S. lodged a
complaint with the World Trade Organization this week against
India''s barriers. </p>
<p>''The advantage of renewables is that you know that the
cost is going to be forever,'' said Sumant Sinha, chief
executive officer of ReNew Power, which is backed by a $385
million investment from Goldman Sachs. ''You lock in the price
today. You''re not impacted by the rupee''s depreciation. There''s
no fuel risk.'' </p>
<h2>Yarn Maker </h2>
<p>Three years ago, India''s first national solar auction drew
skepticism with record-low bids from a woolen yarn maker and
animation company. Tata Power Co. shunned that tender, saying
banks wouldn''t loan to projects deemed too risky. </p>
<p>The current tender received bids for more than double the
capacity available. The offers include 100 megawatts by ReNew,
150 megawatts by a unit of India''s Infrastructure Leasing 
Financial Services Ltd. and 40 megawatts by Tata Power. </p>
<p>The growth of the industry has boosted inbound shipment of
photovoltaic gear, with the value of the purchases reaching $2.4
billion since 2010 when India started its solar program,
according to data from the Ministry of Commerce. </p>
<p>In order to help local makers of solar modules including
Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI), India is requiring half of the capacity
being auctioned to be built with locally made equipment. That''s
375 megawatts or about 10 percent of the total capacity India
has offered in the past year. The U.S. said this rule unlawfully
restricts access to American manufacturers such as First Solar. </p>
<p>India said it will dispute the complaint lodged by the U.S.
with the WTO against the ''unfair barrier to U.S. exports.'' </p>
<h2>Offsetting Costs </h2>
<p>India is offering as much as 18.75 billion rupees ($302
million) in grants for the first time to solar developers to
offset project costs. That will enable the plants to reduce the
electricity tariff to 5.5 rupees a kilowatt-hour, equal to the
cost of grid power. </p>
<p>That eliminates one of the main investment hurdles the
industry faced: the risk that cash-strapped state utilities
buying the power would default, leaving plants unable to sell
their output elsewhere. At 5.5 rupees, the plants could find
alternate buyers, including industrial and commercial consumers
who pay the highest rates for power. </p>
<p>''Renewables are attracting a different class of investors
who want stable yields,'' said Sunil Wadhwa, chief executive of
ILFS Energy Development Co., a developer of gas, coal and
clean-energy projects. ''These are stable cash flows. For the
investor, the costs are highest in the beginning, but it''s more
predictable.'' </p>
<h2>Stable Returns </h2>
<p>Clean energy projects in Europe are luring institutional
cash as retirement and insurance funds, including Allianz SE,
Aviva Plc (AV/) and PensionDanmark A/S seek stable returns to match
their long-term liabilities. Copenhagen-based PensionDanmark has
invested about $1.8 billion in renewable energy, while Allianz
Capital Partners, a unit of Europe''s largest insurer, invested
more than 400 million euros ($545 million) last year. </p>
<p>In India, investors from Goldman to Morgan Stanley (MS) have led
about $2 billion of private-equity buyouts, project and company
acquisitions in the renewable industry since 2010, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In the past year, the Government
of Singapore Investment Corp. invested 100 million pounds ($166
million) in Greenko Group Plc (GKO), a developer of Indian wind farms.
GE Energy Financial Services invested 2.57 billion rupees in a
hydropower plant in northern Sikkim state under development by
Gati Infrastructure Pvt. </p>
<p>Photovoltaic plants in India are likely to earn a 16
percent return, according to calculations by the central
electricity regulator to set tariffs. That compares with a yield
of 8.87 percent offered by India''s benchmark 10-year bond. </p>
<h2>Thermal Power </h2>
<p>Foreign direct investment in India''s thermal power sector
has collapsed to less than one-third its level two years ago as
fuel risks, regulatory uncertainties and environmental delays
hold up projects, according to government data. </p>
<p>More than 60 percent of power stations owned by NTPC Ltd.,
the nation''s biggest generator, are running below capacity due
to a lack of coal supply, NTPC Director A.K. Jha said this week.
India plans to raise local gas prices by as much as 90 percent
to $8 per million British thermal units, a level that will be
unviable for power plants, Oil Secretary Vivek Rae said on Jan.
12. </p>
<p>With coal and gas prices rising and an increasing share to
be imported, a clean-energy project may already be able to
supply electricity about 3 percent cheaper over the long term,
said Wadhwa of ILFS Energy, which is building a 750-megawatt
gas power plant and is India''s second-biggest owner of wind
farms. </p>
<p>Indonesia, the biggest coal supplier to India, banned
exports of raw ores last month. ''Tomorrow it might be coal,''
said Wadhwa. ''In thermal, you''re never sure.'' </p>

<p>Emeterra, an agribusiness company
founded by a former managing director of global sweeteners at
Coca-Cola Co. (KO), is investing in agriculture processing assets
through new projects and acquisitions. </p>
<p>The Singapore-based company started by Jacob Robbins, who
left Coca-Cola last year, has been operating since Nov. 1 and is
looking at processing assets, Robbins said in a Feb. 10
interview in Dubai. Potential projects probably will be in
Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, excluding
Brazil for now, he said. </p>
<p>''Our first assets should come on stream within 18 to 24
months, to be in physical production, which is not only the time
that it takes to build a facility, but also all the lead time to
get clearances and approvals and everything else,'' Robbins
said. ''We are looking at domestic assets in a number of
countries right now, some green fields, some brown fields.'' </p>
<p>Emeterra will focus on trading and supplying sweeteners
including new sugar products and non-nutritive zero-calorie
offerings other than stevia, a sugar substitute, Robbins said.
The company will also trade dairy and juices other than orange.
The world will need to produce 60 percent more food by 2050 to
feed a growing population, the United Nations'' Food 
Agriculture Organization estimates. Chinese imports of whole-milk powder surged 14-fold since 2008, data from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture showed. </p>
<p>''Dairy is an amazing opportunity because of the intrinsic
deficit for China and Asia Pacific,'' Robbins said. ''There''s
such a huge gap between what''s being produced and what is needed
and more importantly what will be needed.'' </p>
<h2>Sustainable Development </h2>
<p>Emeterra will also invest in technologies to boost
sustainable agricultural development as well as reduce costs,
Robbins said. The company''s first venture will involve rapid
multiplication of sugar-cane seedlings, which is the biggest
cost in growing the crop after fertilizers, according to a study
from the London-based International Sugar Organization. The ISO
seed cane price index rose 95 percent from 2005 to 2010. </p>
<p>''If you look at the evolution of the whole sugar industry
in the last 20, 30, 40 years, what can you call as really
radical innovation?'' Robbins said. ''I think the time is here
for radical innovations because today, with all the pressure
that there is on prices, there''s only so much you can do for
price realization, so you have to look at costs.'' </p>
<p>Raw sugar futures traded in New York fell in the past three
years as supplies outpaced demand. That was the longest slump in
more than two decades. A fourth year of price declines would be
the longest losing streak since at least 1965, exchange data on
Bloomberg showed. Futures slid 1.4 percent this year. </p>
<h2>Cut Costs </h2>
<p>Sugar cane is traditionally planted by putting segments on
the ground, which allows pests and diseases to be perpetuated,
Robbins said. The rapid seedling multiplication process will cut
costs for growers, interrupt the cycle of pests and diseases and
require much less water, making businesses more sustainable. </p>
<p>''There''s more traction with the consumer when you have a
sustainable product provided you can do it at cost parity or
better cost,'' Robbins said. ''There''s no question in my mind
that there''s the need for sustainable food, especially in
emerging markets. That''s a given.'' </p>
<p>Emeterra is also advising Olympus Capital Asia, an
independent private equity firm investing in agribusiness, clean
energy and financial services, according to Robbins. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is poised
to become the first U.S. commercial bank to sell bonds in
Australia this year, while Westpac Banking Corp. is also
planning a new line of notes. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is marketing fixed- and floating-rate
Australian dollar bonds due August 2019 at a yield of about 135
basis points more than swap rates, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the issuer. Sydney-based Westpac,
Australia''s second-biggest lender by market value, plans to sell
five-year securities at a spread of around 95 basis points,
according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
be identified because the terms aren''t set. </p>
<p>Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
in Australia with the yield premium over the swap rate on bank
paper averaging 99 basis points yesterday and 94 on Feb. 7, a
low unseen since February 2008, according to a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds in
Australia since Goldman Sachs''s last transaction in July, when
it priced A$750 million ($670 million) of five-year fixed and
floating-rate notes at a 170-basis-point spread. </p>
<p>''Investment banks were one of the strongest performing
sectors in 2013 and I''d expect the Goldman Sachs deal to perform
well, although recent emerging-market ructions could damp demand
a bit,'' said Justin Davey, a money manager at BT Investment
Management Ltd. </p>
<h2>Rabobank, ABN Amro </h2>
<p>Dutch lenders Rabobank Groep and ABN Amro NV are the only
other foreign commercial banks to have come to the Australian
market so far this year, issuing A$600 million and A$500 million
of notes respectively last month. </p>
<p>The August 2018 fixed-rate bond that Goldman Sachs sold
last year yielded 106 basis points more than the swap rate
today, Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices show.
The American bank carries a credit rating of A- at Standard 
Poor''s, the seventh highest, and is ranked Baa1 at Moody''s
Investors Service, one level lower. </p>
<p>National Australia Bank Ltd. was the last of the so-called
four-pillar domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its
home market, pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures
in November at a spread of 88 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Both Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
ANZ priced five-year securities in October. The last new
benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac (WBC) was issued in
January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. </p>
<p>''There haven''t been many primary bank issues since the
latter part of 2013,'' BT''s Davey said. ''I''d expect there to be
solid interest for the Westpac transaction given the lack of
supply and the benign conditions for banks as evidenced by
recent results announcements from ANZ and CBA.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is managing its own offering along with CBA,
NAB and Royal Bank of Canada. Westpac is also managing its own
sale, the person familiar with that matter said. Both
transactions are expected to price by tomorrow. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Australian unit was
sued by the country''s competition regulator for misuse of market
power relating to sales of its generic version of the Lipitor
cholesterol drug. </p>
<p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it
filed the lawsuit today in federal court in Sydney claiming
Pfizer Australia Pty.''s deals with pharmacies in 2012 for the
sale of atorvastatin breached competition rules. A copy of the
filing wasn''t immediately available. </p>
<p>Patent protection on Lipitor, the biggest selling
prescription drug in Australia under the federal drug plan,
expired in May 2012. At the time Lipitor was prescribed to more
than 1 million Australians with annual sales exceeding A$700
million ($625 million), according to the ACCC. Prior to the
expiry Pfizer struck a deal with pharmacies, offering discounts
and rebates on the condition they bought a minimum 12 months''
supply of atorvastatin, the generic equivalent, the ACCC said. </p>
<p>''Pfizer engaged in this conduct for the purpose of
deterring or preventing competitors in the market for
atorvastatin from engaging in competitive conduct,'' ACCC
Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. ''This case also raises
an important public interest issue regarding the conduct of a
patent holder nearing the expiry of that patent.'' </p>
<p>Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement today it believes the
offers made to the pharmacies were competitive. Since the matter
is before the court, the company said it wouldn''t be appropriate
to comment further. </p>
<p>The ACCC said it''s seeking pecuniary penalties and
declarations, without specifying them. </p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is scheduled to be held on Mar. 18,

<p>Spain picked Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to advise on the sale of Bankia (BKIA), the lender whose collapse
in 2012 pushed Spain into a European bank bailout, and agreed to
pay the U.S. bank one euro ($1.37) in fees. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will analyze strategies for divesting the
government''s stake in Bankia, the state bank restructuring fund,
known as FROB, said in an e-mailed statement today. The
investment bank, which previously worked on the government''s
plan to recapitalize Bankia in 2012 and 2013, will charge 1
euro, said three people familiar with the information who asked
not to be identified because the terms aren''t public. </p>
<p>Real estate-linked losses at the Bankia group helped push
Spain into seeking a 41 billion-euro ($56.2 billion) bailout
from Europe in 2012 as concern mounted that the cost of
salvaging it and other former savings banks would overwhelm
government finances. Bankia''s Chairman Jose Ignacio
Goirigolzarri signaled earlier this month that the government
was preparing to sell off its stake in the lender that was
recapitalized with 22.4 billion euros of public funds and that
the process may take more than two years. </p>

be identified in line with company policy, declined to comment
on the fee structure for the transaction. </p>

targeted in Goirigolzarri''s turnaround plan, compared with a
loss of 21.2 billion euros in 2012. </p>
<p>Bankia also sold bonds last month in a sign of renewed
favor with investors and its shares have gained 20 percent this
year. The government owns about 68 percent of Bankia. </p>

<p>The Wall Street bankers behind
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC), a
surprise end-run around veteran media dealmaker John Malone,
drew from experience on some of the past decades'' biggest deals,
including the RJR-Nabisco buyout made famous in ''Barbarians at
the Gate.'' </p>
<p>Bankers James B. ''Jimmy'' Lee, Blair Effron, Paul Taubman
and Robert Kindler also have figured variously in Michael Dell''s
move to take his firm private and the sale of NBC by General
Electric Co. </p>
<p>In sealing the Time Warner Cable deal last night, the four
bankers helped Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts
trump a bid from Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR), advised by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and LionTree Advisors LLC. Charter''s
billionaire backer Malone had courted Time Warner Cable for
months before the Comcast bid -- the biggest cable deal since
Comcast bought ATT Inc.''s cable assets for $52 billion in 2002. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Vice Chairman Lee and Taubman, a
Morgan Stanley alumnus, will take a share of as much as $68
million for working with Comcast, according to New York-based
research firm Freeman  Co. Part of that fee will go to co-adviser Barclays Plc (BARC), according to Freeman. </p>
<p>Effron, a co-founder of Centerview Partners, and Morgan
Stanley''s Kindler may get as much as $75 million for advising
Time Warner Cable, Freeman said. Sharing in the fee will be
Citigroup Inc. and Allen  Co. </p>
<h2>Professional Links </h2>
<p>The four bankers have been professionally linked for years.
JPMorgan''s Lee and Centerview''s Effron both had roles in GE''s
$16.7 billion sale of its remaining stake in NBC Universal to
Comcast in early 2013. Kindler worked with Lee at JPMorgan as
head of global MA before Taubman recruited him to come work at
Morgan Stanley (MS) in 2006. </p>
<p>Lee, Taubman and Kindler have worked with and across the
table from each other on numerous deals. </p>
<p>Lee advised UAL Corp.''s United Airlines while Kindler
worked with Continental Airlines on their $3.1 billion merger in
2010. </p>
<p>Taubman and Effron, meanwhile, are both among the biggest
Wall Street fundraisers for President Barack Obama and other
Democratic Party candidates. This is the first deal they have
worked on together, said a person familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be identified because the talks were private. </p>
<h2>Secret Talks </h2>
<p>All four veteran bankers worked to keep the matter secret
from Malone, himself one of the biggest dealmakers in the cable
industry''s formative years. </p>
<p>In the 1980s, Malone won big with bets on startups like
Discovery Communications Inc. and Black Entertainment Television
and even by bailing out rival media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. Since
largely abandoning the U.S. cable market in 1999, Malone has
spent about $50 billion in Europe. His Liberty Global Inc. is on
track to report 2013 sales of almost $15 billion, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>This is just the latest high-profile deal involving
JPMorgan''s Lee. He led the bank''s effort in taking General
Motors Co. public in 2010 with a record IPO. He also worked with
Effron on News Corp.''s 2007 acquisition of Dow Jones  Co.,
owner of the Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>Effron, co-founder of the independent investment bank
Centerview with Robert Pruzan in 2006, is portrayed as a junior
banker arranging a secret meeting between KKR  Co. and a senior
Nabisco executive in the book ''Barbarians,'' by Bryan Burrough
and John Helyar, which described the $30 billion purchase of RJR
Nabisco in 1988, detailing the egos and back-room dealings that
went on at the time. </p>
<h2>ConAgra, InBev </h2>
<p>Effron worked on ConAgra Foods Inc.''s purchase of Ralcorp
Holdings for $5 billion, and advised H.J. Heinz Co. last year
when the food giant was sold to Brazil private-equity firm 3G
and Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Effron also advised
InBev when it acquired Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion. </p>
<p>The Time Warner Cable deal is another coup for Taubman, who
began PJT Capital LLC last year after leaving Morgan Stanley in
2013, following a 27-year career there. He had a role as an
individual adviser in Verizon Communication Inc.''s $130 billion
buyout of partner Vodafone Group Plc''s 45 percent stake in
Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile carrier. The
acquisition, the largest announced in the past five years,
pushed PJT into the top 20 deal advisers of 2013, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Kindler''s Client </h2>
<p>Kindler, Morgan Stanley''s vice chairman of investment
banking, has had Time Warner Cable as a client since he was a
lawyer at Cravath, Swaine  Moore, said a person familiar with
the matter, keeping them as a client in his next two roles. He
has worked before with Comcast, advising the cable company on
its acquisition of ATT Broadband, and was with Grupo Modelo SAB
when the Mexican brewer was sold to Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. </p>
<p>The fee pool for the financial advisers is projected to be
as much as $143 million for both sides, which would be the
third-largest payday since 2009, according to Freeman. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is the top adviser on mergers and
acquisitions this year including the Comcast-Time Warner Cable
transaction, with 21 deals valued at $115 billion, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The New York-based investment bank also
worked with Suntory Holdings Ltd., the closely held Japanese
whiskey and beer maker, on its $16 billion takeover of Beam Inc.
in January. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is ranked second, with 25 deals worth $113
billion, and Centerview is third with seven transactions valued
at $88 billion, the data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs led MA advising last year, working on 349
deals valued at $559 billion, the data show. </p>

<p>A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed against Hennes

<p>Estevan Oriol, a photographer and director, claimed that
HM had misappropriated his 1995 photograph of hands
demonstrating a symbol for Los Angeles. The photograph -- known
as ''LA Fingers'' or ''LA Hands'' was, according to Oriol''s
complaint, featured on the cover of several magazines and used
in his own line of clothing. </p>
<p>Oriol sued HM last year over the use of the image of hands
creating the Los Angeles symbol on their apparel. He claimed the
photo was similar to his in six ways -- the selection of film,
camera angle, lighting and background, as well as the placement
and size of rings on the model''s hands. Judge Manuel Real on
Feb. 10 found the alleged similarities were insufficient to
support the suit and dismissed the complaint. </p>
<p>Bradley Yourist, one of the attorneys representing Oriol,
said in an e-mail ''We disagree with the ruling, and Estevan
Oriol intends on appealing. The fight will go on against those

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Westpac (WBC)
Banking Corp. sold their largest Australian dollar-denominated
bonds in more than two years today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the first U.S. commercial bank to come to
the Australian market since July, issued A$950 million ($855
million) of notes maturing in August 2019 to yield 130 basis
points more than swap rates, a person familiar with the matter
said, asking not to be identified because the terms are private.
Westpac, the third-biggest issuer of bank debt in Australia last
year, priced A$3 billion of five-year securities at a 94-basis-point spread, according to an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
in the South Pacific nation with the average yield premium on
bank paper over the swap rate at 98 basis points yesterday and
94 on Feb. 7, a low unseen since February 2008, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. Today''s unsecured bond
sales, the largest in Australia this year, were also accompanied
by a A$2.5 billion securitized issue from Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. </p>
<p>''More than A$6 billion of issuance on one day is massive
for the Australian market,'' said Ken Hanton, a director in
National Australia Bank Ltd.''s debt markets group. ''The level
of demand we have seen is a clear demonstration of the health of
the market at the moment.'' </p>
<p>The Goldman transaction was split into a A$700 million
fixed-rate portion and a A$250 million floating-rate component,
the person familiar said. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds
in Australia since Goldman''s last deal in July, when it priced
A$750 million of five-year fixed and floating-rate notes at a
170-basis-point spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Goldman Offerings </h2>
<p>The New York-based company raised A$600 million in November
2012 and A$1.25 billion in May 2011, its first Australian
offering following a five-year hiatus. The American bank carries
a credit rating of A- at Standard  Poor''s, the seventh highest,
and is ranked Baa1 at Moody''s Investors Service, one level
lower. </p>
<p>Westpac''s sale was also a two-part deal, comprising A$1.1
billion of fixed-rate notes and A$1.9 billion of floaters. The
last transaction from the Sydney-based lender larger than that
was in January 2012, when Westpac borrowed A$3.1 billion via its
debut domestic covered bond, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It''s rated higher than Goldman Sachs, with scores of
Aa2 at Moody''s and AA- at SP. </p>
<h2>Domestic Sales </h2>
<p>NAB was the most recent of the so-called four-pillar
domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its home market,
pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures in November at

<p>Employers are squeezing their workers'' retirement savings, holding back on both the amount and the timing of 401(k) matching funds and dragging out vesting schedules.

<p>European swap-trading platforms won
a reprieve from Dodd-Frank Act rules in a deal that puts U.S.
and European authorities on a path toward sharing oversight of
most of the $693 trillion global market. </p>
<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and European
Union officials, in an agreement announced Feb. 12, granted the
trading facilities relief until March 24 from U.S. registration.
U.K. and European regulators also are implementing trading rules
designed to meet U.S. standards that could then be relied on to
substitute for Dodd-Frank oversight in the long-term, said Mark
P. Wetjen, acting CFTC chairman. </p>
<p>The CFTC said in a summary of the deal that it would revoke
the relief to trading platforms if they fail to meet U.S.
conditions for competition and transparency. </p>
<p>Many interest-rate swaps will be required to trade on swap
execution facilities, or Sefs, in the U.S. under CFTC rules
starting Feb. 15. Platforms owned by Tradeweb Markets LLC, ICAP
Plc (IAP), GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) and Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News,
have temporarily registered with the CFTC. The Sefs facilitate
transactions among banks and between banks and asset managers or
other clients. </p>
<p>The international reach of CFTC rules has been among the
most contentious issues between the Washington-based regulator
and financial firms that operate around the world. </p>
<p>Wetjen said the primary platforms affected are in London. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank most reliant on trading, lost market share in equities
revenue relative to the world''s top firms last year, according
to Tricumen Ltd., a financial research company. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s share of total operating revenue from
equities in 2013 dropped 4.1 percent from the previous year,
while sales by the bank''s peer group rose a combined 15 percent,
Tricumen said in a report published today. UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland''s
biggest bank, expanded its share by 1.4 percent, the largest
gain in the group, the data show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost ground in equity derivatives due to its
limited range of services and products compared with No. 1
competitor JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), said Darko Kapor, a partner at
London-based Tricumen. Goldman Sachs fell to sixth from the
second rank by revenue in equity derivatives last year, and to
third from second in servicing hedge funds, according to
Tricumen. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, reported $15.7 billion in
revenue from equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13
percent from a year earlier, hurt mostly by interest-rate and
currency trading. In stocks, it remained the leader for cash
equities last year and is also the No. 1 in proprietary trading
by revenue, Tricumen data show. </p>
<p>Tricumen uses corporate filings and its own industry data
to compile the rankings. </p>

<p>A rebound in Israeli exports is
signaling to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) that central bank Governor
Karnit Flug will resist manufacturers'' calls to cut interest
rates to weaken the shekel. </p>
<p>''We expect growth in total exports to pick up to around 4
percent in 2014,'' Kasper Lund-Jensen and Ahmet Akarli, London-based economists at Goldman Sachs, said in a report last week.
Imports will grow by a similar amount, making net impact on the
shekel ''fairly neutral'' and reducing ''the risks of a near-term rate cut,'' they said. </p>
<p>Manufacturers say the strength of the shekel, which
outperformed 30 other major currencies Bloomberg tracked last
year, was a major reason exports slipped 0.1 percent in 2013.
They kept their demand for a rate cut even after exports began
rebounding late last year and the shekel''s appreciation stalled. </p>
<p>Sales abroad rose to $4.2 billion in January from $4
billion in December, according to government data. The currency,
which gained 7.5 percent last year against the dollar, has
declined about 1 percent this year. </p>
<p>The Bank of Israel, which has held the rate at 1 percent
since October, is scheduled to announce its next decision on
Feb. 24. Sixteen of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
the bank will hold the rate again, with the rest predicting a
quarter-point cut. The shekel strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.5090
per dollar at 5:20 p.m. in Tel Aviv. </p>
<h2>Economic Upturn </h2>
<p>The bank''s monetary policy committee cited an economic
pickup and rising home prices when it kept the rate unchanged
last month. The Manufacturers Association of Israel called the
Jan. 27 decision ''disappointing'' and said borrowing costs
should be cut to 0.25 percent to weaken the shekel and make
goods sold abroad more competitive. The Israel Export 
International Cooperation Institute said on Dec. 10 that the
currency''s appreciation dealt exports a ''mortal blow.'' </p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Davos
last month that Israeli exporters must adjust to the stronger
shekel because policy makers have limited options to curb it. </p>
<p>The government today announced measures to aid exporters,
including raising the ceiling on export guarantees, expediting
approvals of export risk insurance and allocating 50 million
shekels ($14.2 million) to market goods abroad. </p>
<p>While exports have rallied in recent months, imports have
climbed more, widening the trade gap to $1.5 billion in January
from $1.2 billion a month earlier. </p>
<h2>Market Benefit </h2>
<p>The rise in exports, if maintained, will benefit equity and
bond markets, said Jonathan Katz, a Jerusalem-based economist at
HSBC Holdings Plc. ''The export figures were pretty broad-based
and varied, not limited to one sector like pharmaceuticals or
technology,'' Katz said. ''So although so far it''s just one
robust number, if exports and domestic demand continue trending
upwards, it will be good for companies and the whole economy and
eventually the markets.'' </p>
<p>The central bank has tried to weaken the shekel by stepping
up its purchase of foreign currency reserves. It bought $1.7
billion in January, after buying $630 million the previous
month, bringing its reserves to a record $83.2 billion. </p>
<p>The stabilization of the dollar-shekel rate in recent weeks
makes it probable the bank will pare its currency purchases this
month and hold the key rate, said Tal Zohar Avda, chief
executive officer of the Tel Aviv branch of FXCM Inc. (FXCM) U.S.
Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen''s Feb. 11 comment that she
intends to maintain the policy of gradually reducing bond
purchases, also support this view, Avda said. </p>
<h2>Less Pressure </h2>
<p>''If the dollar continues to strengthen globally, mainly
against the euro, it will get stronger in Israel, too,'' Avda
said. ''As long as the dollar continues to stabilize or
strengthen, there will be less pressure from the exporters on
the Bank of Israel to cut the rate.'' </p>
<p>Goldman forecasts the bank will hold the rate through the
first half of 2014, until a continued improvement in exports, a
gradual quickening of inflation and rising housing prices
trigger ''a hiking cycle'' in the third quarter. </p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund, in its annual report on
Israel''s economy released Feb. 12, urged the government to rein
in housing costs by limiting loan-to-value ratios on mortgages
and raising the property purchase tax for secondary homes. </p>
<p>''If global growth prospects improve sharply'' or
appreciation pressures on the shekel ease, ''the monetary policy
stance should be gradually normalized,'' the IMF said. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL) Managing
Director Terry Davis told investors he was sorry after a A$404
million ($367 million) writeoff at its packaged-foods unit SPC
Ardmona drove profit to its lowest level since 1992. </p>
<p>''I apologize to not be able to bring you a better
result,'' Davis, who''s leaving the job March 3, told investors
on a call today after announcing an 83 percent drop in net
income to A$79.9 million for the year ended Dec. 31. ''Hopefully
we''ve turned the tide'' with SPC, he said. </p>
<p>Sales volumes at Coca-Cola Amatil''s main Australian soft
drinks business fell 3.2 percent to 338 million cases last year,
cutting group revenue by 1.1 percent to A$5.08 billion, the
first decline since 2006, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Australia''s biggest beverage company fell 5.3 percent
to A$11.22 at the close in Sydney, its lowest price since August
2011. </p>
<p>Australian food companies have been hurt by currency swings
in recent years. The Australian dollar''s rise to a 29-year high
of $1.11 in July 2011 lowered the cost of competing imports, and
its subsequent decline to 90 cents has increased the price of
raw materials. </p>
<p>Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502)''s Schweppes Australia unit, which
sells Pepsi in the country, raised prices for the first time in
two years this month, Citigroup Inc. analyst Gino Rossi wrote in
a Feb. 7 note to clients, driven by an estimated 3.5 percent
increase in costs of imported ingredients. </p>
<p>That will lessen pricing pressure on Coca-Cola, which sells
at a premium of more than 50 percent to Pepsi, according to
Rossi. </p>
<p>''Aggressive competitor pricing'' was responsible for the
poor result from Coca-Cola Amatil''s Australian beverage unit,
the company said today. </p>
<h2>State Support </h2>
<p>The results were a negative for Coca-Cola Amatil''s credit,
Moody''s Investors Service senior vice president Ian Lewis wrote
in an opinion after the announcement. It wouldn''t affect the
company''s investment-grade ratings, which are stable at A3, he
wrote. </p>
<p>''The high Australian dollar has enabled a flood of cheap
imported product to be sold in Australia below the cost of
production here while decimating SPCA''s export markets,'' Coca-Cola Amatil said in a regulatory statement today. The company
will pursue anti-dumping measures, changes to import tariffs,
and enforcement of standards on ingredients, according to the
statement. </p>
<h2>''Corporate Welfare'' </h2>
<p>Australia''s federal government, which has said it doesn''t
believe in ''corporate welfare,'' on Jan. 30 turned down Coca-Cola Amatil''s request for a A$25 million grant to fund
efficiency savings at SPC Ardmona. The government of Victoria
state will instead provide A$22 million alongside A$78 million
from the company, the parent company said Feb. 13. </p>
<p>The remaining book value of SPC Ardmona is ''just north of
A$300 million,'' Alison Watkins, who will take over from Davis
next month, told investors on the call. The state''s investment
won''t eliminate Coca-Cola Amatil''s ability to exit the business
if it continues to underperform, Davis said, without giving
further details. </p>

<p>Warren Buffett, speaking last April at Coca-Cola Co. (KO)''s annual meeting, warned that the beverage giant shouldn''t get complacent about its success. Ten months later, those words could come back to haunt the company. </p> <p>The world''s largest soft-drink maker, facing sluggish growth overseas and concerns about the healthiness of its product at home, posted its fourth straight quarter of declining sales yesterday. The results sent the stock on its biggest one-day decline in more than two years -- bad news for both Coke and Buffett, the company''s largest shareholder. </p> <p>The slowdown has raised concerns about the long-term plan of Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent, who has promised big revenue gains by 2020.

<p>''There needs to be much more cost cutting,'' Dibadj, who is based in New York, said in an interview. ''There needs to be much faster innovation. There needs to be much more return of cash to shareholders.'' </p> <p>Coke''s fourth-quarter sales fell 3.6 percent to $11 billion, missing the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.

<p>Coca-Cola Co. is giving SodaStream
International Ltd. (SODA) a hand in scaring away short sellers. </p>
<p>Since Coca-Cola agreed Feb. 5 to buy a 10 percent stake in
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR), a company developing a
make-your-own, single-serve product similar to SodaStream''s,
short interest on the stock has fallen. It dropped to 22 percent

<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management and
William Blair Investment Management are buying the rupee as
India reins in a current-account deficit that drove the currency
to a record low in August. </p>
<p>The rupee, which slid 21 percent in the past two years,
looks ''cheap'' relative to India''s improving external finances,
according to Goldman Sachs Asset, which opened a ''small long''
position on the currency this year. William Blair has boosted
the currency to about 20 percent of its foreign-exchange
holdings for its higher yield and inexpensive valuation, said
Chicago-based fund manager Brian D. Singer. </p>
<p>The rupee has rebounded more than 10 percent from last
year''s all-time low of 68.845 per dollar as India curbed gold
imports to shore up the current account and the central bank
acted to spur dollar inflows. Only Indonesia''s rupiah has fallen
more than the rupee among Asian emerging markets. While India''s
finances have improved since last year, the nation needs a
coordinated plan to respond to volatility in global currency
markets as the U.S. reduces stimulus, the International Monetary
Fund said in a report. </p>
<p>The ''current-account numbers have been the key driver
because it''s a very transparent measure of whether the policy
prescriptions are having an impact,'' Philip Moffitt, Sydney-based head of fixed income for Asia-Pacific at Goldman Sachs
Asset, which oversaw more than $1 trillion on Dec. 31, said in 
an e-mail interview yesterday. ''If you can find something 
that''s relatively cheap and the fundamentals appear to be 
improving, it''s usually a good mix.'' </p>
<h2>''Principal Risk'' </h2>
<p>The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade will shrink
to $45 billion in the year through March from an unprecedented
$88 billion the previous period, the government said Feb. 17. </p>
<p>''The principal risk facing India is the inward spillover
from a tightening of global liquidity interacting with domestic
vulnerabilities,'' the IMF said in the report. Pressures
associated with India''s ''still-significant external financing
need'' could lead to higher borrowing costs, fund outflows and
''disorderly adjustments'' in the exchange rate, it said. </p>
<p>Any plan should make rupee flexibility the key defense and
include measures to raise the benchmark interest rate, impose
cash curbs, open foreign-exchange swap windows and raise diesel
prices, the Washington-based lender said in an annual review of
India''s economy. </p>
<h2>Current Account </h2>
<p>Dollar-based investors will earn 9 percent including
interest by holding the rupee until the end of 2014, the second-biggest return in Asia, according to Bloomberg data based on
appreciation estimates and deposit rates. Two-year government
bonds pay 8.67 percent in India, compared with 0.31 percent in
the U.S. and 3.70 percent in China. The rupee was at 62.23 per
dollar yesterday. </p>
<p>India''s current-account shortfall decreased to $5.2 billion
in the third quarter of 2013, from $21.8 billion in the previous
three months, after Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
raised tariffs on gold in the world''s largest bullion-consuming
nation. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan lured $34
billion of foreign-currency inflows by offering discounted swaps
for dollars raised by banks, one of his first steps on taking
office on Sept. 4. </p>
<p>Rajan has also raised interest rates three times so far,
helping curb consumer-price inflation to 8.79 percent last month
from as much as 11.2 percent in November. </p>
<h2>Rising Confidence </h2>
<p>Options are signaling increased confidence in the rupee as
external balances improve and price pressures cool. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, has eased to 8.17 percent from last
year''s peak of 22.4 percent in September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Carry traders, who borrow in currencies with lower yields
and buy those with higher rates, have earned 4.1 percent on
rupee investments using dollars since Sept. 30, the most among
23 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Favorable
policies will help the rupee and Indonesia''s rupiah perform
better than currencies of other nations with current-account
deficits such as Brazil, Turkey and South Africa, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. economist Fiona Lake wrote in a Feb. 19 report. </p>
<p>The appointment of Rajan, an economist credited with
presaging the 2008 global financial crisis, as the RBI''s head
encouraged William Blair, which oversaw more than $72 billion as
of Dec. 31, to boost bullish positions on the rupee, according
to portfolio manager Singer. </p>
<p>''The rupee is a cheap currency with significant carry,''
he said in an interview in Melbourne yesterday. It ''has
deviated from fundamentals and should not be included in the
fragile five,'' he added, referring to a description used by
Morgan Stanley last year to describe currencies most vulnerable
to capital flight. </p>

<p>Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the largest
Spanish-language TV producer, reported a gain in fourth-quarter
adjusted profit as cable and satellite subscriptions rose and
advertising spending climbed. </p>
<p>Operating-segment profit, which leaves out items such as
depreciation and amortization, rose 4.3 percent to 8.49 billion
pesos ($639 million), Mexico City-based Televisa said in a
statement. Sales rose 8.3 percent to 21.4 billion pesos,
compared with the 20.8 billion-peso average of 10 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>New cable and satellite customers are propelling sales for
Televisa, reducing the broadcaster''s reliance on over-the-air TV
advertising. The Sky satellite business added 136,550 users,
less than 245,000 average estimate of four analysts polled by
Bloomberg. Cable connections, including TV, Internet and phone
subscriptions, rose by more than 175,000 to 5.08 million. </p>
<p>The new customers are helping Televisa as it forgoes
another source of revenue. The company will miss out on about
1.4 billion pesos in sales this year because of a new law that
lets cable and satellite companies include its channels in their
lineups for free instead of paying, Executive Vice President
Alfonso de Angoitia said on a conference call with analysts
today. </p>
<p>Dish Mexico (DISH*) and Axtel SAB have been retransmitting
Televisa''s signals for free since September. Televisa is in a
legal battle challenging the authority of Mexico''s Federal
Telecommunications Institute to police the retransmissions of
its broadcasts. </p>
<h2>Iusacell Writedown </h2>
<p>The impact of the law cut retransmission revenue by 22
percent from a year earlier to 639 million pesos in the fourth
quarter, Televisa said. The company reported 8.32 billion pesos
in revenue from TV advertising, 7.8 percent higher than a year
earlier. </p>
<p>Televisa shares rose 2.3 percent to 76.31 pesos at the
close of trading in Mexico City. </p>
<p>While growth slows for its Mexican television business,
Televisa''s investment in U.S. Spanish-language TV is paying off.
The company reported finance income of 5.36 billion pesos in the
fourth quarter to reflect the increased value of its debt
holdings in Univision Communications Inc., the largest U.S.
Spanish-language broadcaster. </p>
<h2>Conservative Valuation </h2>
<p>Televisa calculated the value of the asset conservatively,
and it may be worth more, Angoitia said. A financial investor
acquired a 1.5 percent equity stake in Univision last month for
$125 million, which would value Televisa''s investment at $3
billion instead of the $2 billion the Mexican company calculated
itself, Angoitia said. </p>
<p>''It''s a valuable price discovery exercise,'' Richard Dineen, a New York-based analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a
phone interview. ''The tension here is that private-equity
investors are not lifetime holders. An exit is in the cards.'' </p>
<p>The 1.5 percent stake could later be sold to a strategic
buyer, which may include Televisa, Dineen said. </p>
<p>The company''s investment in Mexican mobile-phone operator
Grupo Iusacell SA hasn''t gone as well. Televisa recorded a
fourth-quarter loss from joint ventures of 4.74 billion pesos in
the quarter, mostly to write down the value of Iusacell. After
acquiring its 50 percent stake in the company for $1.6 billion
in 2012, Televisa invested 1.59 billion pesos in the mobile-phone carrier in 2013. </p>
<p>The wireless company is in talks to combine its operations
with Telefonica SA in Mexico, a person with knowledge of the
matter said earlier this month. </p>
<p>''Consolidation may be good for the market down the road,''
Angoitia said on the call today. Iusacell, which ended 2013 with
8 million subscribers, or 8 percent of the market, is focusing
on growth and waiting for more clarity on regulatory matters, he
said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is cutting the price of Windows 8.1 by 70 percent for makers of low-cost computers and tablets as they try to fend off cheaper rivals like Google Inc.

INSERT INTO collect_news (url, body, headline, author, datetime, current) SELECT * FROM ( SELECT 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-24/blackberry-shares-rise-as-ford-said-to-pick-qnx-over-microsoft.html', '
<p>BlackBerry Ltd. shares surged after
its QNX software was said to be favored by Ford Motor Co. for
its next-generation Sync system. </p>
<p>Ford (F), struggling with in-car technology flaws, will no
longer use Microsoft (MSFT) Corp.''s Windows for Sync, instead basing
the system on QNX, according to people briefed on the matter.
Using QNX will be less expensive than licensing Microsoft
technology and will improve the flexibility and speed of the
next Sync system, the people, who asked not to be identified
because the decision hasn''t been made public, said Feb. 22. </p>
<p>BlackBerry shares jumped 7.6 percent, the most since Jan.
22. Ford was little changed at $15.18, and Microsoft slid less
than 1 percent to $37.69. </p>
<p>Ford''s decision highlights the value of QNX for BlackBerry,
the smartphone maker that lost 95 percent of its value from
mid-2008 to November and saw the collapse of a proposed $4.7
billion buyout. Ford has more than 7 million vehicles on the
road with Sync using Microsoft voice-activated software to make
mobile-phone calls and play music. </p>
<p>The QNX operating system ''is the standard right now,''
said Matthew Stover, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners in
Boston. ''QNX is a well-known, understood OS. It''s proven.'' </p>
<p>BlackBerry is already a supplier of technology and
engineering to Ford, among other automakers, and QNX technology
is already in use in Ford vehicles on the road today, said Paul
Leroux, a QNX spokesman. He declined to confirm Ford''s decision
and wouldn''t say whether it would produce more revenue for
BlackBerry. Susannah Wesley, a Ford spokeswoman, and Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft who
works for Waggener Edstrom, also declined to comment. </p>
<h2>QNX Asset </h2>
<p>Since becoming BlackBerry''s CEO on Nov. 4, John Chen cited
software such as QNX and the BlackBerry Messenger service as
assets he will look to capitalize on. Predecessor Thorsten Heins
spoke often during his tenure for the potential of QNX to play a
role in machine-to-machine settings such as cars interacting
with parking meters. </p>
<p>''This is really the crown jewel in BlackBerry''s crown and
could make the rest of the company shine as well,'' Thilo
Koslowski, auto analyst for researcher Gartner Inc. in Santa
Clara, California, said yesterday. </p>
<p>The switch may help Ford, the second-largest U.S.
automaker, address customer complaints about malfunctioning
technology systems and touch screens that have hurt it in
surveys by J.D. Power  Associates and Consumer Reports. </p>
<p>Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford has said the quality of its
vehicles has been ''mixed'' each of the past three years and
fell short of its plan to improve those results in 2013. CEO
Alan Mulally was said to be a candidate to become Microsoft''s
chief until early this year, </p>
<h2>Connected Cars </h2>
<p>Improving Sync is crucial for Ford to draw car shoppers who
are increasingly looking to be connected at all times. In-vehicle technology is the top selling point for 39 percent of
auto buyers, more than twice the 14 percent who say their first
consideration is traditional performance measures such as power
and speed, according to a study by the consulting firm Accenture
released in December. </p>
<p>Ford and Lincoln ranked Nos. 26 and 27 out of 28 brands in
Consumer Reports'' annual auto-reliability survey released in
October. While the Lincoln luxury line matched the industry
average in J.D. Power''s Initial Quality study in June, the
namesake finished 27th out of 33 brands. </p>
<h2>QNX Users </h2>
<p>Technology companies are competing to win business from
automakers as in-car technology becomes an increasingly
important selling point. Google Inc. announced an alliance with
General Motors Co., Honda Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and
chipmaker Nvidia Corp. in January to bring the Android operating
system to cars. Apple Inc. is working with Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG, Daimler AG''s Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co. and
others to introduce its iOS operating system to cars with
devices such as the iPhone. </p>
<p>BlackBerry''s QNX Software Systems can be found in cars made
made by Volkswagen AG''s Audi unit and BMW, according to its
website. QNX and Microsoft are the main suppliers of automotive
operating system software, according to researcher IHS iSuppli. </p>
<p>BlackBerry, at the time named Research in Motion Ltd. (BB),
bought QNX Software Systems for $200 million in 2010. In
addition to its presence in cars, QNX technology is used to
manage nuclear-power plants and by the U.S. military for
unmanned aerial drones. Its customers include Cisco Systems
Inc., General Electric Co. and Caterpillar Inc. </p>
<h2>''Funeral Ceremony'' </h2>
<p>The switch would be a significant blow to Microsoft''s
automotive software business because Ford is by far its biggest
customer, said Gartner''s Koslowski. Microsoft also has software
in Kia Motors Corp., Fiat SpA models, Nissan and BMW models,
according to its website. Getting into the Ford system will
expand QNX''s industry leading position for automotive
entertainment operating systems, which Koslowski said he
estimates is as high as 70 percent. </p>
<p>''I look at this right now as a funeral ceremony for the
Microsoft automotive operating system, this is last rites in a
lot of ways,'' said Guggenheim''s Stover, who rates Ford the
equivalent of a hold. Microsoft struggled because the economics
of what they were trying to do with cars ''are totally
different''  than computers and smartphones, he said. </p>
<p>The operating system in the car entertainment system has
become more of a commodity, and now added functions are more
important, Koslowski said. QNX has done a better job of
integrating compatibility with other operating systems such as
those from Apple, Google and included emerging Internet
standards, he said. </p>
<p>''You have to look at it more from a perspective of how
much functionality do I get for what price and really move your
investment budgets to other areas that become much more
strategic for creating differentiation,'' Koslowski said. ''The
industry is realizing it has to do a better job to create a
unique experience for its customers.'' </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is expanding its cloud services to lure customers to its
SoftLayer Technologies Inc. business, which it''s counting on to
help reverse seven quarters of falling sales. </p>
<p>IBM is making it easier for developers to build and adjust
applications in the cloud, where information is delivered online
instead of stored on local servers, said Danny Sabbah, chief
technology officer of IBM''s Next Generation Platform. The
Armonk, New York-based company plans to spend more than $1
billion on cloud-software development through 2015, a double-digit percentage increase from the past two years. </p>
<p>The move increases IBM''s bet on SoftLayer after acquiring
the company for $2 billion last year and committing $1.2 billion
in January to add 15 new data centers. As customers rely on the
cloud rather than buying their own servers, a slump in hardware
demand has contributed to IBM''s declining revenue. </p>
<p>''This is crucial to expanding the potential audience and
helping them get benefit and value from using SoftLayer,''
Sabbah said in an interview. ''This is not just about IBM''s
conventional enterprise customers. There will be a lot of
emerging companies in different areas.'' </p>
<p>The move underscores SoftLayer''s position as one of IBM''s
biggest gambles as it faces off with competitors such as
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in cloud services. </p>
<h2>Big Bet </h2>
<p>The price IBM paid to acquire Dallas-based SoftLayer last
year was the biggest it has disclosed for a takeover since the
purchase of software company Lotus Development Corp. in 1995,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SoftLayer is becoming
the backbone for IBM''s cloud business as the company wound down
its legacy SmartCloud Enterprise product this year, Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of SoftLayer, said in an
interview last month. </p>
<p>IBM is making these new capabilities available for
SoftLayer in hopes of attracting customers in different
industries than the typical bank and insurance clients that use
its cloud products at the moment, Sabbah said. One new addition
is an open-source enterprise software portfolio called BlueMix,
a platform-as-a-service that aims to help developers build
applications on its cloud infrastructure. </p>
<p>The service would rival existing platform-as-a-service
products like Amazon''s AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku Inc.''s
development platform and Red Hat Inc.''s OpenShift. </p>
<p>IBM has agreed to acquire Cloudant Inc., a cloud-delivered
database company, whose services will be offered in the BlueMix
portfolio, the company said today in a statement. Financial
terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<h2>Watson Services </h2>
<p>SoftLayer will also gain middleware offerings, including
WebSphere, to let apps be installed on hybrid clouds, which can
access data both onsite and offsite. </p>
<p>IBM also said last month that it would create a new
business division around its Watson technology, which can
analyze large volumes of data and answer questions in
conversational language. IBM will invest more than $1 billion in
the unit and give it a headquarters in New York. Watson''s big-data services, which let customers mine vast troves of
information, will be run on SoftLayer''s cloud. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. says investors
should buy record-low yielding sukuk from Dubai-based port
operator DP World Ltd. (DPW) and Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority FZE
before credit ratings improve. </p>
<p>The yield on DP World''s $1.5 billion Islamic bonds due July
2017 slid 61 basis points this year to 2.6 percent at 2:22 p.m.
in Dubai, the lowest level since they were sold in 2007. The
yield on Jafza''s sukuk maturing two years later fell 32 basis
points. Moody''s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, which rate
DP World the lowest investment grade and business-park operator
Jafza junk, could raise both in 2014, JPMorgan said in a note
Feb. 18. </p>
<p>Dubai issuers are benefiting from an economic resurgence in
the Gulf business hub that''s boosting balance sheets, driving
funding costs lower and helping companies pay debt early. Emaar
Properties PJSC''s Islamic bond yields fell the most in more than
four months after the emirate''s biggest developer was raised by
Standard  Poor''s Feb. 5. </p>
<p>''We continue seeing tangible credit momentum in Dubai''
almost without exception, Zafar Nazim, a credit analyst at
JPMorgan Securities Ltd., said by phone Feb. 20. Companies are
paying off debt backed by ''strong cash flows,'' he said. </p>
<h2>Deep-Sea Port </h2>
<p>DP World lowered its net leverage by more than half since
its last upgrade three years ago, according to JPMorgan. At the
same time it invested in projects including London Gateway, a
new deep-sea port in the U.K. Jafza was raised to two steps
below investment grade by Moody''s in October after making
progress in reducing debt. </p>
<p>''Jafza may not get to investment grade but they''re on
course for an upgrade with Moody''s given their deleveraging
trajectory,'' Nazim said. ''DP World was last upgraded in 2011
using 2010 numbers. Back in 2010 the world was still going
through a tight spot.'' </p>
<p>Moody''s said yesterday it doesn''t comment on speculation
regarding future rating actions. </p>
<p>Sukuk were among securities caught up in a developing
markets selloff last year when the U.S. said it would reduce its
$85 billion per-month bond-purchasing program. The yield on
Jafza''s debt climbed to as high as 5.84 percent June 26, while
that on DP World''s notes rose to 4.9 percent a day earlier. </p>
<h2>''Another Bubble'' </h2>
<p>There are three main risks for the bonds, according to
Richard Segal, London-based head of international credit
strategy at Jeffries International Ltd. </p>
<p>Yields could rise if ''the U.S. Treasury (USGG10YR) market sells off
sharply again'' or if ''risk perceptions elsewhere in emerging
markets settle down and flight to quality flows reverse,'' he
said by e-mail Feb. 20. Segal sees a third risk if ''investors
begin to consider the possibility of another bubble in the
United Arab Emirates,'' he said. </p>
<p>Still, many feel equities are more expensive than fixed
income, so this is less of a near-term risk, Segal said. </p>
<p>Growing liquidity is another factor acting in DP World and
Jafza''s favor, Nazim said, as investors seek a place to put
their money. Sukuk sales from Dubai slowed this year, with $300
million raised compared with $750 million in the year-earlier
period. </p>
<p>Islamic bond sales in the emirate are expected to increase
as Dubai invests more than $8 billion preparing to host the
World Expo in 2020 and as $30 billion of debt comes due this
year. The sheikhdom, one of seven that make up the U.A.E., has a
stated ambition to become capital of the world''s Islamic economy
within three years. </p>
<p>Dubai expects economic growth to average 4.6 percent,
between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the pace as in the prior
four years. Amid the growth, property prices and trade are
soaring, helping Emaar, the operator of the world''s largest
mall, to regain the investment grade rating lost in 2009. </p>
<p>Upgrades will ensure that ''regional investors will get
more comfortable,'' Nazim said. ''You don''t need too many to
push the bonds tighter.'' </p>

<p>When Enrique Pena Nieto ran for
president in 2012, opponents nicknamed him the Televisa
candidate for what they described as favorable coverage from
Mexico''s largest broadcaster. Now as president he''s pushing for
more competition that will hurt Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO)''s revenue
growth. </p>
<p>In a move that surprised the industry for its speed and

revoke a lower court''s injunction suspending regulatory measures
against Televisa. </p>
<p>Pena Nieto''s action may signal that a Mexican business
tactic of delaying regulatory decisions with court injunctions
is losing its effectiveness. At stake for Televisa is the

current situation aids Dish Mexico, which competes with
Televisa''s own Sky satellite unit. </p>
<p>''This was a wake-up call for Televisa, for the regulator
to say, ''We count with the backing of the presidential

<p>Mike Mayo, the analyst who sparred
at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s 2013 investor day with Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, challenged the bank at today''s event about
the logic of holding an asset-management business. </p>
<p>Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., asked Mary Erdoes, CEO of
JPMorgan''s asset manager, how it feels to be ''trapped'' in a
bank that he estimates is valued at about 40 percent less than
companies in her business, based on price-to-earnings ratios. </p>
<p>''You would probably be worth a lot more as a standalone,''
Mayo said. ''How does it feel to be a 17 P-E business trapped in
a 10 P-E company?'' </p>
<p>Dimon has said clients benefit from the array of services
provided by his New York-based company. JPMorgan is the largest
U.S. bank, and today''s session featured presentations by
commercial, retail and investment bankers, along with Erdoes,
who oversees more than $2 trillion. She said her unit helps
JPMorgan meet ''holistic needs'' of customers, and that the
valuation hasn''t hurt compensation of top money managers. </p>
<p>''We work very hard to deliver the whole company to the
clients,'' Erdoes said today. ''Someday we believe that all the
value of this part of the business will be reflected in the
stock price.'' </p>
<p>JPMorgan has advanced 20 percent in the past 12 months,
beating the 14 percent gain of T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW), while
trailing BlackRock Inc. (BLK)''s 27 percent rally. JPMorgan trades for
about 8.6 times reported earnings, less than half the ratio at
BlackRock, the world''s largest money manager, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''The stock has done fine as a competitive matter, against
most major competitors,'' Dimon told Mayo today. ''More than
fine, which you''ve noted yourself in some of your analyst
reports.'' </p>
<h2>Morgan Stanley </h2>
<p>In July 2012, Mayo said Morgan Stanley (MS) would be worth as
much as $32 if the firm were broken up. The bank, which didn''t
heed his call, has since more than doubled to $29.71 at 4 p.m.
in New York. The gain was fueled by improved profitability at
its brokerage unit. </p>
<p>Mayo asked Dimon at last year''s gathering if clients might
shift to banks with the highest capital ratios, citing UBS AG as
one company that could seek to win business from JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Dimon countered, ''so you would go to UBS'' rather than
JPMorgan? ''I didn''t say that,'' Mayo responded. ''I said that
was their argument.'' </p>
<p>''That''s why I''m richer than you,'' Dimon said, drawing
laughter from the audience. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the lender
whose legal and regulatory battles led to more than $23 billion
in settlements in 2013, said Chief Compliance Officer Cindy Armine left to join another firm after a year on the job. </p>
<p>Lou Rauchenberger, the chief administrative officer of the
corporate and investment bank, was named as interim replacement,
according to a staff memo from Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The departure was reported earlier today by the Wall Street
Journal, which said Armine is moving to First Data Corp., the
payment processor run by former JPMorgan executive Frank Bisignano. He left JPMorgan last year when Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon named Zames sole chief operating officer at
the bank. Bisignano hired JPMorgan''s former Chief Information
Officer Guy Chiarello as president last year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has clashed with regulators and law enforcement
officials over accusations that it misled buyers of mortgage
bonds, rigged markets and overlooked suspicious activity by
clients. The company agreed last month to pay $2.6 billion to
settle allegations that it ignored signs of wrongdoing in
Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>''As Jamie and our leadership team have said, controls and
compliance are our most important priority,'' Zames wrote. ''We
have made great progress over the past few years on our controls
agenda, and we will continue to focus on it relentlessly.'' </p>
<p>Managers will seek to ''ensure a fortress compliance and
control environment,'' according to a slide show today at an
annual presentation for investors. </p>
<p>Armine joined the firm in May 2011 as chief control officer
of home lending after 31 years at Citigroup Inc., where she was
chief compliance officer. She was promoted to JPMorgan''s head of
compliance in January 2013. Attempts to reach Armine for comment
weren''t immediately successful. </p>

should set up a new ''premium'' route for wealthy investors,
with 100 visas a year auctioned off at a reserve price of 2.5
million pounds ($4.2 million), an advisory panel recommended. </p>
<p>The Migration Advisory Committee, which is made up of five
independent economists and a representative of the Commission
for Employment and Skills, proposed replacing the current so-called ''higher investor routes'' that require investments of 5
million pounds and 10 million pounds as they are ''hugely
underused.'' </p>

gain from this migration route; we express some healthy
skepticism regarding the value to U.K. residents of high net
worth individuals coming to the U.K.,'' the panel''s chairman,
David Metcalf, told reporters in London today. ''When people
say: ''Isn''t it awful to sell visas?'' -- it''s better than giving
them away, which is what we are doing now.'' </p>
<p>The committee also recommended the government improves
incentives for foreign investors to buy into financial
instruments other than government bonds. Options include
infrastructure bonds to improve roads or other amenities,
Metcalf said. Venture capital projects should also be
considered, he said. </p>
<p>The new premium route would benefit from relaxed residency
requirements, halving to 90 days a year the amount of time an
individual has to remain resident in the U.K. It would lead to
the settlement of individuals, not U.K. citizenship. </p>
<p>The auction of premium route visas would be conducted via
sealed offers, with a bid of 2.5 million pounds comprised of an
investment of 2 million pounds by the applicant plus a gift of
500,000 pounds donated to the government, designed to be given
to philanthropic causes such as charities ''or basketball
courts,'' Metcalf said. The market may settle on a higher price
for the visas, he said. </p>
<p>The panel also recommended doubling the minimum threshold
for investors on ''standard route'' visas to 2 million pounds,
uprating a price that has not changed since 1994. </p>
<p>May would need to accept the panel''s advice before the
changes could be introduced. The Home Office did not have an

<p>Investors who have been pouring
money into funds that purchase leveraged loans need to be wary
of a reversal in demand, according to Justin Gmelich, the head
of credit trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>''It''s been a bit of a one-way freight train,'' Gmelich
said in a question and answer session, posted on the company''s
website yesterday. ''I would just caution those that are
involved in the loan space to be mindful of the fact that
they''ve been beneficiaries of inflows for 88 straight weeks and
the tide can turn.'' </p>
<p>The floating-rate debt, which offers a shield for investors
from rising rates, has seen unprecedented demand with the funds
that purchase the debt receiving deposits every single week
since the summer of 2012. That enabled speculative-grade
companies to raise $676 billion last year of bank debt, with
more than 80 percent of that used to escape maturing debt
deadlines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Leveraged loans in the U.S. have returned 1.2 percent this
year, after gains of 5.3 percent in 2013, according to the
Standard  Poor''s/LSTA Leveraged Loan index. Loans, which are
ranked higher up in the capital structure than junk bonds in
case of a bankruptcy, are better protected from rising interest
rates since they are generally pegged to floating-rate
benchmarks. The value of a fixed-rate security diminishes with
an increase in rates. </p>
<h2>Rate Protection </h2>
<p>''Folks have been shrewd enough to try to protect against
some of the rate shock,'' Gmelich said. ''When you see fund
flows reverse, irrespective of whether or not the credit quality
is good, you see a risk retracement.'' </p>
<p>Retail inflow into loan mutual funds exceeded $63 billion
last year and have already netted $4.6 billion this year,
according to a Feb. 20 report from Bank of America Corp.
Companies have been able to find willing lenders as the assets
managed by mutual funds investing in the debt swelled to more
than $150 billion from about $70 billion at the start of last
year, according to data from the bank. </p>
<p>Leveraged loans and high-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds
are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service and lower than
BBB- at SP. </p>

Corp. (IBM) is encouraging software developers to build applications
on its artificial-intelligence system Watson, looking to data
analytics to help reverse falling revenue. </p>
<p>IBM will host a mobile developer challenge that urges
programmers to create consumer and business apps powered by
Watson, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty said in a speech
today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. In three
months, the company will choose three prototypes to receive
design consulting and support to develop commercial apps. </p>
<p>IBM has been increasing its investment in Watson as the
Armonk, New York-based company works to show clients the value
of the technology, which analyzes troves of data and can answer
questions in conversational language. The company said in
January that it will spend $1 billion to create a new division
around Watson to help spur growth after seven consecutive
quarters of declining revenue. </p>
<p>''You run a business today and you reinvent it for the
future at the same time,'' Rometty said. ''You go through these
transitions. If you try to compare today to the past, today the
speed is much faster.'' </p>
<p>As sluggish demand for computer hardware has hurt sales,
IBM has focused on more profitable, faster-growing areas such as
data analytics and cloud computing, and the company has also
sold hardware businesses. Watson and other big-data services
were the company''s primary focus in 2013, Rometty said in March.
Last year, IBM boosted its expected sales from the data-analysis
business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with an earlier
forecast of $16 billion. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. lender, is moving about 2,000 employees to offices in Brooklyn''s MetroTech Center after a review of its real estate holdings, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. </p> <p>The biggest single source of employees heading to Brooklyn by year-end is 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, the 60-story lower Manhattan skyscraper the bank sold to Shanghai-based Fosun International Ltd. (656) in 2013, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the move isn''t public. The employees are from several of the bank''s business lines, the person said. </p> <p>JPMorgan is consolidating its real estate as it pushes to trim expenses and simplify itself by exiting businesses including student lending and private equity. Offices in and near downtown Brooklyn, where MetroTech Center is located, are among the most in demand in the city, in particular drawing young technology and social-media companies. </p> <p>If JPMorgan follows through with its plans, it will show that the market also can appeal to traditional financial firms while it tries to attract and retain young talent, said Tucker Reed, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a group representing local businesses. </p> <p>''Were they to come, it would be a validation of our office market here,'' Reed said in a telephone interview. ''The only drawback, if you can call it that, would be the challenge it creates. It means there would be even less office space for us to grow into. It makes our space dilemma a little more acute, but that''s a good problem to have.'' </p> <h2>Tightest Market </h2> <p>Brooklyn''s 15.5 million square feet (1.4 million square meters) of offices are more than 96 percent occupied, data from CBRE Group Inc. show. By comparison, Manhattan''s tightest office market -- the area roughly from 30th to Canal streets, known as midtown south -- has a 93 percent occupancy rate, according to the real estate services firm. </p> <p>MetroTech Center is a 3.7 million-square-foot office campus close to the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. JPMorgan owns two buildings at the complex. </p> <p>Another group of Chase Plaza-based staff members is bound for the bank''s offices at the Newport office complex on Washington Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, the person said. The transfers started in December and will continue throughout 2014, according to the person. </p> <p>The lender intends to keep about 300,000 to 400,000 square feet of offices at Chase Plaza, the person said. JPMorgan occupied about half the space in the 2.2 million-square-foot tower, according to data from CoStar Group Inc. </p> <p>''We''re continually looking at ways to ensure that our space and occupancy strategy aligns with the ever-evolving needs of our business,'' Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an e-mail. </p> <h2>MetroTech Space </h2> <p>As recently as 2012, JPMorgan considered giving up at least some of its offices at MetroTech, listing about 700,000 square feet for rent, according to the person. After floods from Hurricane Sandy damaged bank offices at 4 New York Plaza, another downtown Manhattan tower, displaced workers were moved temporarily into the Brooklyn space. </p> <p>JPMorgan owns 4 MetroTech Center, with about 1.35 million square feet, and 3 MetroTech Center, according to Mrofficespace.com, a website that tracks New York office buildings. The other six buildings at the office park are owned by Forest City Ratner Cos., which started building MetroTech in the late 1980s. </p> <p>The 16-acre (6.5-hectare) campus was Brooklyn''s first modern office development, built in partnership with the New York City government. Many of its earlier tenants have been financial firms, including Bank of New York and Bear Stearns Cos., which used the properties for back-office operations. </p> <p>In recent years, the complex has attracted technology and media companies such as MakerBot Industries LLC, a developer of three-dimensional printers; and ImpreMedia LLC, which publishes Hispanic newspapers including New York''s El Diario La Prensa. </p> <p>''Downtown Brooklyn has now become a very diverse ecosystem of varied companies that are more reflective of all of Brooklyn and all of New York City,'' said Ali Esmaeilzadeh, vice president of commercial development and leasing at Forest City Ratner. ''There''s still the presence of government and back-office, there''s also a surge in technology-based firms, entrepreneurial-type companies.'' </p> <p>', 'JPMorgan Said to Plan Move of 2,000 Workers to Brooklyn', 'By David M.

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will film a live-action series for Netflix Inc. (NFLX) with Marvel superheroes in New
York City, the biggest production commitment in state history,
Governor Andrew Cuomo said. </p>
<p>Cuomo, who announced the deal today in Manhattan, is
providing incentives valued at about $4 million, said an aide,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details
aren''t public. In November, Disney agreed to create four
television series for Netflix using Marvel characters such as
Daredevil, adding to the online-streaming video service''s
growing lineup of orginal content. </p>

this unprecedented commitment from Disney and Marvel is further

before,'' Cuomo said in an e-mailed statement. ''The competition
for these projects is fierce.'' </p>
<p>Disney''s Marvel TV will start bringing the shows to Netflix
in 2015, according to a November statement. They will focus on
heroes battling villains in New York''s Hell''s Kitchen. Netflix
committed to a minimum of four 13-episode series, culminating in
the miniseries ''The Defenders.'' </p>
<p>Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, is gaining more
Disney content following an agreement in 2012 for rights to show
movies including Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm titles. </p>

<p>Jamie Dimon, who built JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) into the world''s biggest investment bank, said
threats to its dominance may come from Beijing, Silicon Valley
and a San Francisco-based rival with a stage-coach logo. </p>
<p>''We know there are going to be attacks everywhere,'' Dimon
told investors at an annual meeting yesterday at the firm''s New
York headquarters. Asked about challengers, the chief executive
officer cited companies from Industrial  Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. (601398) to Google Inc. Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), founded in 1852 to
serve California''s Gold Rush pioneers, will be ''a major
investment bank'' within five years, he said. </p>
<p>Dimon, 57, guided JPMorgan through the financial crisis
without posting a quarterly loss and expanded the firm by
acquiring rivals that faltered. As the company grappled with
costs from government probes last year, its profit was surpassed
by Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. lender, which relies
most on retail banking and mortgages. </p>
<p>''My operating assumption has always been and always will
be that we are going to have huge, tough competition from
Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo to some new entrants,'' Dimon
said. ''Wells Fargo will be in our business. I have enormous
respect for them.'' </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, led by CEO John Stumpf, 60, has been expanding
its securities unit. The lender opened trading floors in 2012 in
Charlotte, North Carolina, bolstering a securities business
acquired with the purchase of Wachovia Corp. four years earlier. </p>
<h2>''They''re Huge'' </h2>
<p>ICBC (1398), based in Beijing, is seeking to triple earnings from
outside its home country by 2016. China''s biggest financial
firms are ''ambitious'' and have ''strategic reason to win,''
Dimon said. </p>
<p>''They''re huge, their clients are huge,'' he said. ''I
expect very large, tough Chinese competitors all around the
world.'' </p>
<p>JPMorgan generated $26.6 billion of revenue from corporate
advisory, underwriting and trading in 2013, the most of any
global investment bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the major U.S. bank most reliant on
trading, had $34.2 billion in total revenue, including other
businesses such as asset management. </p>
<p>California technology companies are delving into electronic
payments. Google (GOOG), based in Mountain View, created Wallet, a
program that lets users make transactions in stores and online
with their smartphones. Cupertino-based Apple Inc., which has
more than 400 million credit cards on file with its iTunes
Store, is exploring an expansion of its mobile-payments system,
a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. </p>
<h2>EBay''s PayPal </h2>
<p>EBay Inc.''s PayPal unit is a leading online payments
system, which accounts for 40 percent of the San Jose-based
company''s revenue and has 143 million active users. </p>
<p>Technology companies ''all want to eat our lunch,'' Dimon
said. ''I mean every single one of them, and they''re going to
try.'' </p>
<p>Dimon may be overstating his firm''s vulnerability to blunt
criticism of its size, said Erik Gordon, a business professor at
the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. JPMorgan is the biggest
U.S. bank by assets and the country''s largest credit-card
lender. It counts 80 percent of the Fortune 500 as clients,
according to presentations at yesterday''s meeting. </p>
<p>''He''s downplaying the fact that at the end of the day,
JPMorgan is probably as powerful as any financial institution,
including going back to the original JPMorgan,'' Gordon said in
a telephone interview. ''It''s his way of saying, ''Don''t be
afraid of us and how big we are.'' My guess is that he doesn''t
really go home at night and worry about Wells Fargo.'' </p>
<h2>Cutting Jobs </h2>
<p>Dimon''s comments on long-term threats came near the end of
his company''s annual investor meeting. The bank can increase
profit by 50 percent to $27 billion in four to five years as
higher rates boost interest margins and legal costs subside,
according to presentations posted yesterday. </p>
<p>The bank also said it would eliminate about 8,000 jobs in
consumer and mortgage banking this year, while hiring in areas
such as compliance and risk management. Dimon said he will stick
with home lending, after calling mortgages ''the most painful
business ever.'' The loans fill a key need for consumers, he
said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan slipped 0.6 percent to $56.67 at 9:44 a.m. in New
York after dropping 1.7 percent yesterday. It has gained 19
percent in the past 12 months, trailing the 24 percent advance
of the Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index. </p>
<p>Trading revenue dropped about 15 percent so far this year
compared with the same period in 2013, Dimon said yesterday.
Lower levels of client activity, especially in fixed income,
pressured results, the bank said. </p>
<h2>''Dog Days'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s earnings last year were marred by clashes with
regulators and $23 billion in legal settlements that contributed
to the bank''s first quarterly loss under Dimon. The CEO is
selling or closing businesses he considers risky and dropping
non-U.S. clients who may invite regulatory scrutiny. He''s
fending off allegations the firm rigged markets and ignored
suspicious activity by clients. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s meeting concluded on an upbeat note, with a
song from English rock band Florence + the Machine. </p>
<p>''The dog days are over,'' the lyrics blared from speakers.
''The dog days are done.'' </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) began dismissing U.S. workers yesterday, part of a $1
billion restructuring to help the company meet profit goals as
it adapts to shifts in the technology industry. </p>
<p>Workers in New York, Vermont, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,
Oklahoma and North Carolina were fired yesterday, according to
Alliance@IBM, an employee group. The Armonk, New York-based
company had a headcount of 431,212 at the end of 2013, down 0.7
percent from a year earlier -- its first decline in a decade. </p>
<p>IBM is aiming for $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015,
up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a target made more difficult by seven
straight quarters of falling revenue. To get there, Chief
Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has fired and furloughed
workers, sold assets, cut IBM''s tax rate and bought back shares. </p>
<p>The company has already begun eliminating positions this
year in Europe, Asia and South America, according to
Alliance@IBM. Worldwide, this year''s job cuts could lead to the
elimination of at least 13,000 employees, Toni Sacconaghi, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said in a Feb. 3 report. </p>
<p>Rometty is seeking to transform IBM as clients shift to
storing their data and applications offsite, or in the cloud,
rather than buying their own servers. </p>
<p>''IBM continues to rebalance its workforce to meet the
changing requirements of its clients and to pioneer new, high-value segments of the IT industry,'' the company said in a
statement yesterday. At any given time, IBM has more than 3,000
job openings in its growth units, including its cloud business
and nanotechnology, the company said. </p>
<h2>Hudson Valley </h2>
<p>IBM had agreed to keep high-technology jobs in New York''s
Hudson Valley through 2016, increasing the number of positions
it has pledged to retain by 750 to 3,100, New York Governor
Andrew Cuomo said this week in a statement. That would restore
the 697 workers fired last year in Dutchess County, where the
company had about 8,000 employees as of 2012, according to the
county government. </p>
<p>Firings took place yesterday in Endicott and Poughkeepsie,
New York, Alliance@IBM said. </p>
<p>The job cuts in New York raise questions about the newly
brokered deal between the company and the state, said
Assemblyman Kieran Lalor, who represents Fishkill, New York.
Fishkill is a town in Dutchess County, where IBM has a
semiconductor chip manufacturing plant. </p>
<p>''Both the state and IBM have been short on details about
the agreement,'' Lalor said in a letter dated Feb. 27 to Cuomo,
requesting disclosure of how many people IBM employs in New York
and information on the 3,900 jobs not guaranteed under the plan. </p>
<h2>Chip Plants </h2>
<p>IBM also makes semiconductor chips at its plant in
Burlington, Vermont, and servers in Rochester, Minnesota,
according to its website. The company has a delivery center in
Dubuque, Iowa, that was to create as many as 1,300 jobs when it
opened in 2009. The facility provides services including
outsourcing-client support, server-systems operations, security
services, and maintenance of hardware and software, according to
the website. IBM dismissed workers in all three cities, in
addition to Columbia, Missouri; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and the
Raleigh, North Carolina, area, Alliance@IBM said. </p>
<p>The company has already begun eliminating positions this
year in Europe, Asia and South America, according to
Alliance@IBM. </p>
<h2>Global Restructuring </h2>
<p>As part of the shift in its focus to products like cloud
services and data analytics, the company agreed in January to
sell its low-end server division for $2.3 billion to Lenovo. IBM
said it expects to send more than 7,000 workers to the Chinese
computer maker in the transaction. </p>
<p>The company is focused on finding a joint-venture partner
for its chip-manufacturing business after failing to attract a
buyer for the division, two people with knowledge of the matter
said this month. </p>
<p>IBM was little changed at $185.17 at the close of trading
in New York. The shares are up less than 1 percent since the
start of Rometty''s tenure at the beginning of 2012, compared
with a 48 percent gain for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>

<p>A $300 million settlement by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and insurers with homeowners who accused
the bank of taking kickbacks in exchange for sticking them with
overpriced insurance policies was approved by a judge. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami today approved
the accord. It requires JPMorgan, Assurant Inc. (AIZ) and other
insurers to pay refunds valued at 12.5 percent of annual premium
costs to homeowners who had certain policies placed on their
properties by the bank starting in January 2008. JPMorgan and
Assurant didn''t admit wrongdoing. </p>
<p>The homeowners sued New York-based JPMorgan last year,
claiming the bank placed required hazard and wind coverage with
Assurant and other insurers at inflated rates. Some of the
excess costs were kicked back to a JPMorgan unit, the homeowners
alleged in their class-action, or group, lawsuit. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is among several large banks facing claims by
homeowners that they overcharged mortgage borrowers for lender-placed insurance. Last year, New York-based Assurant agreed to
pay $14 million to resolve similar allegations by the New York
State Department of Financial Services. </p>
<p>In his ruling, Moreno rejected objections to the settlement
and approved $20 million in fees to lawyers for the class. </p>

<p>Jonathan Egol, a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. trader whose desk produced the security that prompted the
Securities and Exchange Commission to sue the firm, has retired. </p>
<p>Egol, 44, left the New York-based bank earlier this year,
said Michael DuVally, a company spokesman. He joined the firm in
1998 and was named a managing director in 2007. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs paid a then-record $550 million in 2010 to
settle an SEC suit over the marketing of a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation dubbed Abacus 2007-AC1. The firm
created a committee that year to review its business standards
and practices. </p>
<p>The SEC sued Fabrice Tourre, 35, one of the employees under
Egol, after dropping a plan to file claims against Egol,
according to interviews with SEC enforcement staff conducted by
the agency''s inspector general. Tourre was found liable in a
jury trial last year in which the SEC claimed he intentionally
misled investors in the deal. </p>
<p>Egol testified in Tourre''s trial in July that he was ''not
aware of any'' disclosures to investors that Paulson  Co.,
which stood to make money from the failure of the transaction,
helped select the assets underlying it. Egol said Tourre did
tell a superior that the hedge-fund firm run by billionaire John Paulson helped pick the portfolio of 90 subprime mortgage-backed
securities. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the departure earlier
today. </p>

<p>Tesla Motor Inc. (TSLA)''s planned battery
factory may consume as much as 17 percent of current lithium
output, easing a forecast oversupply and benefiting producers
like Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>The battery plant that Tesla co-founder Elon Musk has
called a ''gigafactory'' could require the equivalent of 15,000
tons to 25,000 tons of lithium carbonate annually at full
capacity, Goldman analysts led by Robert Koort said in a report
today. That estimate exceeds a Feb. 26 Bank of America Corp.
prediction the facility would use 9,000 tons. </p>
<p>Tesla today sold $2 billion of convertible notes to fund
the factory intended to lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries
used in its vehicles and for power storage. The increasing
popularity of Tesla''s electric cars, which use larger battery
packs than competing models, should help narrow the coming
lithium oversupply, Koort wrote. </p>
<p>''We continue to see a near-term oversupply scenario as
likely,'' Koort, who rates Rockwood neutral, said in the note.
''An inflection in pure battery electric vehicles may help ease
oversupply of lithium around 2020.'' </p>
<p>Galaxy Resources Ltd. (GXY)''s decision not to resume production
in Mt. Cattlin, Australia, also contributes to the tighter
supply outlook, he said. </p>
<p>While companies like FMC Corp. don''t get a big portion of
earnings from lithium, Rockwood is ''positioning for an electric
vehicle inflection,'' Koort said. </p>
<p>Rockwood is divesting units to focus on lithium products
and surface treatments. The Princeton, New Jersey-based chemical
maker gained more access to lithium supplies with its December
agreement to form a joint venture with China''s Chengdu Tianqi
Industry Group Co. to get a stake in Talison Lithium Pty. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
employees restricted stock worth $2.3 billion for their 2013
performance, the smallest amount in two years as the firm cut
costs by lowering the portion of revenue it set aside for pay. </p>
<p>The firm granted 13.8 million restricted shares that vest
over several years, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in
its annual regulatory filing. The value, down from $2.4 billion
a year earlier, is based on the closing price on Jan. 28, when
senior executives were given their awards. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, cut
compensation to 37 percent of revenue last year, the second-lowest portion since the firm went public in 1999. That
contributed to a 6 percent increase in net income even as
revenue was little changed. </p>
<p>Banks have been seeking to balance regulatory pressure to
tie awards to long-term performance with shareholders'' desire
for flexibility to cut pay costs if needed. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz, 49, has said the firm is
reluctant to ramp up the amount of pay it defers because it is
''a bit of mortgaging the future.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said about 70 percent of the restricted stock
awards were recognized as expenses immediately. The cost
recorded by the firm is probably lower than the current value of
the shares because the bank accounts for the fact that employees
can''t immediately sell the shares. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s largest brokerage,
gave employees $2.72 billion in deferred awards for 2013
performance, including $1.25 billion of restricted stock and
$1.47 billion of deferred cash. About $100 million of the awards
were expensed in 2013. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs didn''t disclose any deferred cash awards, and
the firm hasn''t typically given such bonuses. </p>

<p>On Wall Street, $3,500 goes further than anyone dared imagine in the 1980s when the predecessor to JPMorgan Chase  Co. charged the fee to trade each non-investment grade loan it sold. </p> <p>That surcharge remains the same today and helps the biggest U.S. bank dominate the secretive $1.1 trillion junk-loan market while stifling profits for investors and rivals, which mostly stopped charging it years ago. The New York-based bank waives it for exclusive customers: trade with JPMorgan, no fee; trade one of its loans with anyone else, pay up. </p> <p>JPMorgan can dictate terms because of its size, according to 12 people with knowledge of the matter who are concerned they''d jeopardize their business if their identities were revealed. The bank brings more corporate debt to market than anyone, and competitors and investors say they might be shut out of future deals if they don''t play by JPMorgan''s rules. </p> <p>Related:</p>

<p>''This is one of the last frontiers of relatively unregulated, over-the-counter trading between financial giants,'' said Jose Gabilondo, a law professor at Florida International University in Miami who focuses on corporate finance. ''You''re dealing with a market that doesn''t have regulated disclosure requirements getting the information out in the market.'' </p> <h2>Riskier Investments </h2> <p>The issue goes beyond pinched profits for rivals and investors such as pension plans and hedge funds that buy the loans. It''s also about what may happen when riskier investments lose their appeal. Since the fees make it unprofitable for JPMorgan competitors to trade loans made by the bank, buying and selling the debt may become difficult and put at risk individual investors, who own more of the loans through mutual funds than ever before. </p> <p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, declined to comment on the bank''s practice of charging the trading fees or the way in which the charge affects how quickly investors can move in and out of the market. The bank has more than 1,200 predecessor institutions, according to its website, and became JPMorgan Chase in 2000 after J.P. Morgan  Co. merged with Chase Manhattan Corp., which had earlier combined with Chemical Banking Corp. </p> <p>JPMorgan is at the center of an unprecedented expansion in global corporate debt markets, which have become more popular with investors seeking alternatives to government securities as central banks hold interest rates at record lows to spur growth. </p> <h2>Biggest Underwriter </h2> <p>The market value of bonds in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate  High Yield Index has soared to $10.5 trillion from $5.15 trillion in 2008. The market for institutional junk-rated loans, given to the most indebted companies, increased to $688.3 billion last year, exceeding the 2007 peak of $596 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan was the biggest underwriter of corporate bonds last year, with a 6.8 percent share of the $3.27 trillion issued, compared with 6.1 percent for No. 2 Bank of America Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was also the top-ranked manager of U.S. syndicated loan sales, the data show. </p> <p>Since 2007, JPMorgan''s assets have grown 55 percent and its customer deposits have risen 74 percent. The bank ranks first in the U.S. in both categories. </p> <p>Junk loans, also called high-yield or leveraged loans, are a lucrative business for banks at a time when new regulations designed to make the financial system safer are forcing them to cut back on businesses such as trading for their own accounts. Banks have typically earned 1 percent to 5 percent selling pieces of the debt to institutional investors such as pension plans and mutual funds, according to Standard  Poor''s data. </p> <h2>Banking Behemoth </h2> <p>That compares with almost nothing to manage sales of investment-grade loans, given to companies with good credit, and an average 1.3 percent on sales of junk bonds last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Banks also earn an annual fee from borrowers to handle the paperwork, making sure everyone gets paid what they''re owed. </p> <p>The $3,500 add-on might seem like a mote of dust on the $2.4 trillion balance sheet of a banking behemoth such as JPMorgan. Still, the fees add up because trades often consist of multiple transactions and JPMorgan charges for each. </p> <p>For example, if an investment firm buys a $2 million slice of a loan administered by JPMorgan and then parcels it out to four of its funds, it would be forced to pay $14,000 if a dealer other than JPMorgan brokers the trade. </p> <h2>''Additional Inefficiencies'' </h2> <p>''It''s a nuisance and it creates additional inefficiencies,'' David Breazzano, the president and chief investment officer of Waltham, Massachusetts-based DDJ Capital Management LLC, said in an interview. DDJ manages more than $7 billion in high-yield assets. </p> <p>Rivals said they''re reluctant to trade many deals that JPMorgan helped to originally distribute because it''s too costly. Rather than finding ways to circumvent the biggest U.S. bank, investors usually give in and trade the debt only with JPMorgan, said the people who requested anonymity. </p> <p>The rivals said they''re also concerned that if they don''t comply, JPMorgan may not give them opportunities to buy new deals the bank brings to market. That would hurt their business because their customers are giving them more cash to invest in high-yield loans than ever before, the people said. Perras, the JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. </p> <p>The loans are widely traded. Last year''s $517 billion of transactions were within $3 billion of the all-time high in 2007, SP and Loan Syndications and Trading Association data show. </p> <h2>Financial Burden </h2> <p>More plentiful trading has ''dramatically increased the financial burden that assignment fees have imposed,'' said Barry Zamore, the head of U.S. non-distressed, leveraged-loan trading for Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. ''Assignment fees were meant for the manual processes in the year 1995, not 2014.'' </p> <p>After the 2008 financial crisis, international rules penalized financial institutions for keeping the loans on their books by requiring them to hold more capital in case the debt goes bad. Banks found ready buyers in an economy distorted by the Federal Reserve''s near-zero benchmark interest rate. </p> <p>Leveraged loans have returned 81 percent in the past five years through January, about five times the 16.6 percent return of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index. </p> <p>Junk loans differ from junk bonds even though many investors buy both. Finance laws drafted after the Great Depression of the 1930s didn''t consider junk loans to be securities because they were mostly private transactions between one bank and one borrower. Since the government already supervised banks, lawmakers saw no need to double up by regulating their loans, too. Today, banks sell most of the loans to institutions. </p> <h2>Relative Darkness </h2> <p>It''s impossible to estimate from public regulatory filings how much JPMorgan earns from the fees. Trading data isn''t available on a loan-specific level. Banks don''t disclose such detailed earnings, nor are they legally required to. </p> <p>The lack of transparency allows the trading of leveraged loans to go on in relative darkness, said Elisabeth de Fontenay, a Duke Law School professor in Durham, North Carolina, who previously worked as a corporate lawyer at Ropes  Gray LLP. </p> <p>''The leveraged-loan market is at once the most dynamic and the least visible capital market in the U.S., which is exactly how its participants like it,'' de Fontenay said in an academic article presented at the 2013 Law and Society Association conference. </p> <p>While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn''t tried to regulate the loans as securities, such oversight would lead to pressure to lower or eliminate fees, de Fontenay said in a telephone interview this month. </p> <h2>Lotus Spreadsheets </h2> <p>The market will be tested when sentiment deteriorates, she said. It''s happened before. Prices fell as low as 59.2 cents on the dollar during the 2008 credit crisis, SP and LSTA data show. They hit a high of 98.9 cents on Jan. 17. </p> <p>JPMorgan''s fee is a relic from a time when clerks used Lotus spreadsheets to track transactions and the market for junk loans was less than 2 percent the size it is now. </p> <p>Loan trades can still take weeks to settle, and until 2012 traders relied on fax machines to place orders. In contrast, junk bonds are increasingly traded electronically and have prices that are publicly reported through Trace, run by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p> <p>The bank''s dominance dates from 1982, when banker James B. Lee Jr. created a loan syndication unit to sell pieces of debt for JPMorgan predecessor Chemical Bank, according to a press release for a New York Public Library event honoring Lee in 2008. Lee is now a JPMorgan vice chairman. </p> <h2>Stopped Charging </h2> <p>By 1999, another JPMorgan predecessor, Chase Manhattan, handled 44 percent of the $22 billion of loans to the least creditworthy companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Last year, JPMorgan managed the distribution of $133.7 billion of junk-rated loans, the second-biggest share among banks. Bank of America has been the top underwriter since 2008 after combining with Merrill Lynch  Co. </p> <p>Bank of America charges the $3,500 fee to JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Canada and Jefferies Group LLC, according to two people familiar with the trades. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank waives the fee for most of its rivals. </p> <p>By 2005, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and 10 other banks agreed to mostly stop charging each other''s clients the standard $3,500 fee to trade loans. </p> <h2>Market Impediment </h2> <p>Investors are still protesting 10 years after an August 2004 LSTA survey in which market participants said the surcharges are ''an impediment for the loan market.'' The fee reduced competition, making it cost more to enter and exit the growing market, investors said at the time. </p> <p>''These fees are associated with froth,'' said Gabilondo of Florida International University. ''The bank probably feels that it can skim a little bit off because there''s some investor on the other side who''s so willing to hold these that they''re willing to pay a transaction fee.'' </p> <p>Mutual funds, whose investors are often quick to buy and sell, account for about 33 percent of the market, according to data from SP and the LSTA. They channeled a record $63 billion into the debt last year, compared with net withdrawals in 2007. Retirees and pensioners are turning to leveraged loans, which pay more when benchmark interest rates rise, instead of junk bonds, which are tied to fixed benchmark rates. </p> <p>Yields on junk loans issued this year are an average 5.03 percent, according to SP''s Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary  Data. That compares with the yield on 10-year Treasury bond of 2.64 percent. </p> <p>''It''s a surprisingly concentrated market,'' said de Fontenay of Duke Law School. ''Right now there''s so much artificial demand for loans. In the long run it will be an issue.'' </p> <p>', 'Wall Street Hates JPMorgan Fee for $1 Trillion Junk Loans', 'By Lisa Abramowicz', 'Feb 28, 2014 12:01 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-28/wall-street-hates-jpmorgan-fee-for-1-trillion-junk-loans.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s newly appointed
Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, in an effort to reignite
growth, is shuffling management and putting former political
operative Mark Penn in the new role of chief strategy officer. </p>
<p>Tony Bates, who was passed over for the CEO job, is leaving
the company, with Eric Rudder, the head of advanced strategy,
taking over his duties on an interim basis, Microsoft said today
in a memo to employees. Tami Reller, the executive vice
president in charge of marketing, is also leaving and being
replaced by Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela. </p>
<p>The shakeup is the most extensive yet for Nadella, who was
named CEO in February after a five-month search and is tasked
with speeding up a turnaround at the world''s biggest software
maker. He''ll be leaning on a former political strategist in
Penn, who worked on Hillary Clinton''s failed 2008 presidential
bid. More recently, Penn, 60, developed Microsoft''s ''Don''t Get
Scroogled'' advertising campaign, a political-style attack on
Google Inc. </p>
<p>''He''s aggressive,'' Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., said of Penn. ''Maybe this will add a little
testosterone to the organization to counter the fact that Satya
is more of a deep thinker.'' </p>
<p>Penn''s background is in public relations -- he spent six
years as CEO of Burson-Marsteller. His aggressive style puts him
at odds with some managers, who were uncomfortable with the
Scroogled campaign, said people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<h2>Super Bowl Ad </h2>
<p>He''s also helped develop less controversial ads like
Microsoft''s first national Super Bowl commercial this year. In
the ad, former football player Steve Gleason, who suffers from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and can''t speak, narrated
using Microsoft technology. </p>
<p>''His focus on using data to quickly evaluate and evolve
our campaigns has driven new insights and understanding,''
Nadella said in the memo. </p>
<p>Part of Penn''s job will involve helping the company decide
where to invest, and he will join the product leadership team,
said a person with knowledge of the change. </p>
<p>The overhaul follows last month''s announcement that
hardware group chief Julie Larson-Green will move to the
applications and services unit. Thom Gruhler, a vice president
who oversaw Windows and Windows Phone marketing, will lead
marketing for the applications and services group, people with
knowledge of the matter said. Reller notified employees of that
change in an e-mail, they said. </p>
<h2>Mobile Laggard </h2>
<p>Microsoft shares fell 1.4 percent to $37.78 at the close in
New York. The stock has risen 3.9 percent since Nadella''s
appointment on Feb. 4, and has trailed the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index in three of the past four years. </p>
<p>Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran, is the company''s
third CEO after Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. He''s charged with
accelerating expansion at a company that hasn''t seen sales
growth exceed 6 percent since 2011. Microsoft''s investments in
mobile haven''t put a dent in Google and Apple Inc.''s control of
the smartphone market, while cloud applications from competitors
pose an increasing threat to Microsoft''s flagship Windows
business. </p>
<p>''Nadella is trying things out,'' said Moerdler, who has
the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft. He said he expects
additional changes in senior leadership, including possible
outside hires. </p>
<h2>Job Split </h2>
<p>Bates was among the leading internal candidates for the top
job, along with Nadella and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner. Bates, a former Cisco Systems Inc. executive, ran
Microsoft''s Skype unit before becoming an executive vice
president in July. He doesn''t have another job lined up and
plans to take some time to figure out his next move, said a
person familiar with his plans. </p>
<p>Reller, who joined Microsoft in 2001, was also promoted to
executive vice president in July and led marketing for the
Windows 8 operating system. Capossela had been named chief
marketing officer back in 2011, though his role was reduced in
July when Ballmer split marketing between Reller and Penn, with
the latter taking on advertising strategy. </p>
<p>Penn''s ties to the Clintons date back to the 1990s and his
work in the re-election campaign for President Bill Clinton. He
worked on Hillary Clinton''s campaign until April 2008, when he
came under fire for his firm''s role in promoting trade with
Colombia. </p>
<p>At Microsoft, Penn has a longstanding relationship with
Ballmer and Gates and advised the company during its antitrust
case with the U.S. government. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is unveiling a new
Web-based Office application that uses search and social data to
display a user''s most important files and projects, seeking to
boost sales and fend off competition. </p>
<p>The app, code-named Oslo, has versions for Windows 8, the
Internet and mobile devices, including those based on Apple
Inc.''s and Google Inc.''s software for smartphones and tablets,
Jeff Teper, a Microsoft vice president, said in an interview.
The first Oslo programs, probably for Windows 8 and the Web,
will be available in the second half of 2014, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft wants to move more customers to cloud-based
versions of its Office productivity software, which are
delivered via the Internet, in order to boost growth and fend
off similar applications. Cloud programs are sold as
subscriptions, providing more regular sales compared with the
cycle of customers buying a version of Office every few years,
said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. </p>
<p>''On the corporate side, they have a belief they can
significantly differentiate the Microsoft offering from others
with search and social features,'' Moerdler said. ''They want to
make Office massively more interactive.'' </p>
<p>The product incorporates features from two Microsoft
acquisitions: The 2012 purchase of Yammer Inc., which provides
social-networking tools for companies, and the acquisition in
2008 of Norway''s Fast Search  Transfer ASA, a search technology
developer. The Oslo code name is a nod to the Norwegian unit''s
team. </p>
<h2>Office Graph </h2>
<p>Instead of opening Outlook, Word or Excel, users of the new
app will have a dashboard of projects and files they''re working
on, as well as topics they should know about and those popular
among co-workers. Oslo will also let users search by categories,
such as ''modified by me,'' ''shared with me'' and ''trending
around me.'' Clicking on a colleague brings up not just that
person''s manager, peers and direct reports, but others working
on projects across an entire company. </p>
<p>Underlying Oslo is what Microsoft is calling the Office
Graph, an idea similar to the social graph, a term popularized
by Facebook Inc. for the depiction of personal relationships,
said Adam Pisoni, the Yammer co-founder who is now a Microsoft
vice president. The Office graph would act as a repository of
data culled from a user''s social relationships and actions.
Microsoft will also open up the data so other business-software
developers can create apps that can exchange such information
between Office and their programs. </p>
<p>With the Office unit now part of the same business as
Microsoft''s Bing search, future versions of Oslo will integrate
Web-search data from Bing, said Teper. Microsoft is still
working on pricing and will begin testing the software with a
few chosen customers in the next month or so, Teper said. </p>
<p>''Don''t think of this as the version of Word you''ve got on
your machine,'' Teper said. ''It''s a really new experience for
how the office should work.'' </p>

<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) and Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930) joined Chinese mobile phone makers in expressing concern to
China that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s bid to take over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s phone
business may result in higher patent licensing fees, two
government officials familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Google and Samsung asked China''s Ministry of Commerce to
make sure that the 5.44 billion euro ($7.5 billion) bid doesn''t
result in higher fees on wireless technology patents that will
remain with Nokia, the two officials said, asking not to be
identified because the request wasn''t made public. They''re also
concerned Microsoft will gain more power over the smartphone
market and may abuse its patents, according to the people. </p>
<p>The two companies join domestic vendors including Huawei
Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. that asked China''s regulators to
set conditions on the deal, according to the officials.
Microsoft and Nokia announced the deal in September after the
Finnish company lost ground in the smartphone market to Apple
Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone and devices running Google''s Android platform. </p>
<p>Under the deal, Microsoft is buying the hardware business
while leaving most of the wireless patents in Nokia''s control.
Microsoft won European Union approval for the bid on Dec. 4,
while regulators said they would monitor Nokia''s licensing
practices after the close of the transaction. </p>
<p>China''s Ministry of Commerce is conducting an anti-monopoly
review and is likely to approve the deal, the officials said.
The question is whether the ministry will demand the companies
guarantee that the agreement doesn''t result in higher patent
fees, the officials said. </p>
<h2>Ministry Review </h2>
<p>Google spokesman Taj Meadows and Samsung spokeswoman Jini
Park declined to comment on whether their companies had raised
any such concerns with regulators in China. Two phone calls
today to the press office of the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing
went unanswered. </p>
<p>''This merger application is currently under MOFCOM''s
review and we have no further comment,'' Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>ZTE Corp. (763) plans to add Windows Phone devices to its
offerings, Microsoft said last month. Samsung Electronics Co.
and Huawei Technologies Co. already make Windows phones. </p>
<p>The portion of mobile phones running Windows is projected
to almost double to 7 percent in 2018, from 3.9 percent this
year, Framingham, Massachusetts-based market researcher
International Data Corp. reported in February. The share running
Google''s Android system will drop to 76 percent, from 78.9
percent in the same period, IDC reported. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) won a U.S. judge''s ruling that a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment issued in Ecuador was procured by fraud, making it less likely that plaintiffs will collect the $9.5 billion award. </p> <p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said today that the second-largest U.S. oil company provided enough evidence that a 2011 judgment on behalf of rain forest dwellers in the country''s Lago Agrio area was secured by bribing a judge and ghostwriting court documents. Kaplan oversaw a seven-week nonjury trial over Chevron''s allegations. </p> <p>''The decision in the Lago Agrio case was obtained by corrupt means,'' Kaplan said in an opinion that gave Chevron a sweeping victory. ''The defendants here may not be allowed to benefit from that in any way.'' </p> <p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, was ordered to pay $19 billion to a group of farmers and fishermen by the Ecuadorean court. The award was reduced to $9.5 billion on Nov. 12 by the Ecuadorean National Court of Justice, the nation''s highest tribunal. That''s almost half of its 2013 profit. </p> <p>The Ecuadorean villagers, and activists working on their behalf, argued the oil producer should be held financially responsible for pollution of the Amazon rainforest by Texaco Inc. from the 1960s through the early 1990s. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, claims the company already paid $40 million to clean up its share of the drilling contamination. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s former Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said he''s sorry he didn''t combine hardware and software development sooner after the company missed out on Apple Inc.''s smartphone success. </p> <p>''The thing I regret is that we didn''t put the hardware and the software together soon enough,'' Ballmer said in a talk at Oxford University''s Said Business School today. Still, ''if you really want to bring a vision to market, it is helpful to be able to conceive and deliver the hardware and the software. Our company is in the process of building new muscle.'' </p> <p>While the world''s largest software maker fell behind in mobile, Microsoft has had more success than most and is building up the capabilities to catch up, he said. Ballmer stepped down from the CEO role at Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft last month, replaced by the company''s head of enterprise and cloud services, Satya Nadella, after a five-month search. Ballmer remains on the board. </p> <p>''You''re pretty genius in our business if you''re a one-trick pony,'' Ballmer said. ''In our company, I''m very proud of the fact that we''ve done at least two tricks. Tricks are worth billions and billions of dollars.'' </p> <p>Those two tricks were the invention of the modern personal computer, with its Windows operating system and Office software, and bringing microprocessor technology into data centers, he said. For the next, Ballmer agreed to a $7.2 billion deal to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit in September, accelerating Microsoft''s expansion into hardware. </p> <p>Excessive Price? </p> <p>In a note today, credit-ratings company Fitch Ratings called the price Microsoft is paying for Nokia''s handset business ''excessive.'' The firm cited a deterioration in the user base for Windows-based phones and said Microsoft may incur significant future severance costs from the deal, though it also said the acquisition is ''a function of strategic necessity.'' </p> <p>Ballmer said it''s also tricky to measure success at new technology companies. He pointed to Facebook Inc.''s $19 billion deal for the messaging platform WhatsApp Inc. as an example of how difficult it can be to value increasingly cheap-to-build startups. </p> <p>''If your goal was to sell the company, they had the right goal set -- low cost to 450 million, or whatever the heck number of users, and sell for $19 billion,'' Ballmer said. ''Is it a fad? Well, probably not. I don''t know whether they''ll be successful or not, but you do have to really sit there and say, what''s my goal? Will that asset ever be worth anything?'' </p> <p>The cost of starting up companies for cloud-based services is becoming cheaper, and companies should look beyond user numbers to measure success. WhatsApp will ultimately be deemed successful when they convert their user base into something that generates ''enough revenue to pay off.'' </p> <p>', 'Ballmer Says Microsoft a ''Two-Trick Pony,'' Working on Third', 'By Amy Thomson', 'Mar 04, 2014  3:57 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-04/ballmer-says-microsoft-a-two-trick-pony-working-on-the-third.html') LIMIT 1;

11 a.m. Tokyo time, Naoya Takahashi, a spokesman for Japan
Exchange Group Inc., said by telephone. They resumed at about
11:30 a.m., he said. Nikkei 225 options also stopped trading,
according to a statement on the Osaka Securities Exchange
website. The bourse operator has confirmed the problem was
caused by human error, OSE spokesman Masahiro Yada said.
Takahashi earlier said it could have been due to a system issue. </p>

traders use Osaka, so during that period virtually nothing was
traded and not many people switched to Singapore.'' </p>

error forced a halt to trading of some derivatives on the Osaka

<p>Dish Network Corp. (DISH) reached a
groundbreaking agreement to carry Walt Disney Co. programming,
gaining rights to offer Disney, ABC and ESPN shows over the Web
in addition to its satellite pay-TV service. </p>
<p>The multiyear deal, which also ends legal standoff between
the companies over Dish''s AutoHop ad-skipping technology, is the
first between Disney and a pay-TV provider to include so-called
over-the-top program rights. It will allow Englewood, Colorado-based Dish to offer Disney shows as part of a future  Web-based
subscription-TV service. </p>
<p>''The creation of this agreement has really been about
predicting the future of television with a visionary and
forward-leaning partner,'' Joseph P. Clayton, Dish''s chief
executive officer, said in a statement yesterday. The deal
creates ''a model from which to deliver exciting new services
tomorrow.'' </p>
<p>In signing Disney, Dish and its chairman, Charlie Ergen,
gain a head start against other pay-TV providers contemplating
selling monthly programming packages over the Internet. Such
products would break cable-TV companies free of their geographic
boundaries, and allow satellite systems such as Dish to offer
interactive features their services now lack. </p>
<h2>Phones, Tablets </h2>
<p>With the Disney agreement, Dish customers will have access
to shows via televisions, smartphones, tablets, game consoles
and other connected devices. </p>
<p>Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV service, and
Disney, the largest entertainment company, reached the deal
after months of negotiations. As part of the accord, Dish will
delay the availability of its AutoHop feature, which lets
customers skip ads on recorded programs on the broadcast
networks. </p>
<p>AutoHop will now be available three days after the original
broadcast. Previously it was available after 24 hours. The
three-day window is important to broadcast networks because they
can sell advertising based on the extended viewing, Disney
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said in a
conference call last month. </p>
<p>''We knew early on we had a responsibility with this deal
to not only do what was best for our business, but to also
position our industry for future growth,'' Anne Sweeney, co-chairman of Disney''s Media Networks division, said in the
statement. </p>
<h2>AutoHop Lawsuit </h2>
<p>The deal is the first content renewal for Dish with a major
television network since it launched AutoHop, Drew Crum, an
analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus  Co., said in a research note. It
provides opportunities for incremental revenue at Disney and
removes the risk of a blackout, said the analyst, who recommends
buying Disney stock. </p>
<p>AutoHop, introduced in May 2012, embroiled Dish in
litigation with ABC, CBS Corp., Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s NBC and 21st
Century Fox Inc.''s Fox over the feature. The deal announced
yesterday dismisses the litigation between Disney and Dish. </p>
<p>Dish was little changed yesterday at $58.88 in New York
trading. Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 1.7 percent
to $79.46. </p>

resourcefulness, the intellect, the level of innovativeness in
the fraud sector is absolutely amazing.'' </p>
<p>Lenders and merchants are under pressure to convert from
magnetic strips to microchip technology that thwarts hackers
after millions of consumer records were breached at retailers
including Target Corp. One reason the conversion hasn''t happened
yet is because it''s expensive for merchants to upgrade their
systems and for lenders to issue new cards, said Pollitt, whose
company is the world''s biggest bank-card network. </p>
<p>''It''s high investment and in the absence of a Target
catalyst, I doubt that we would be on the track we are on
today,'' Pollitt said. The chip will address about 70 percent of
fraud, he said. Including a requirement that consumers enter
personal identification numbers, or PINs, would ''dramatically''
slow its implementation because about two-thirds of retailers
don''t have the necessary equipment, Pollitt said. </p>
<p>American Express Co., Foster City, California-based Visa
and MasterCard Inc. have given most U.S. merchants and issuers
until October 2015 to adopt chips -- named EMV for founders
EuroPay International, MasterCard and Visa. Those that refuse
would assume liability for counterfeit card transactions. </p>
<p>They are also pushing retailers to use ''tokenization,''
where some account information is replaced with a digital ID for
online and mobile purchases. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
generated one-third of its profit from trading last year, hired
Kayhan Mirza from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as global head of
foreign-exchange trading. </p>
<p>Mirza accepted a position as partner at Goldman Sachs,
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said
today by phone. DuVally declined to comment on reporting lines
in the business. Guy Saidenberg has held the role of global head
of foreign-exchange trading at Goldman Sachs. He declined to
comment when reached at his office. </p>
<p>Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
bank''s currency business had ''difficulty managing inventory''
in the third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income
trading revenue since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost at least two partners from its currency-trading business this year. Leland Lim, co-head of macro trading
for Asia ex-Japan, left to start a hedge fund. Steven Cho,
global head of spot and forward trading of G-10 currencies in
New York, also departed. </p>
<p>At least a dozen regulators are investigating allegations
first reported by Bloomberg News in June that traders colluded
to rig benchmarks in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market.
That is boosting demand from clients for greater transparency in
pricing and transaction charges, accelerating a longer-term
shift in trading onto electronic platforms. </p>
<h2>Electronic Trading </h2>
<p>Electronic dealing, which accounted for 66 percent of all
currency transactions in 2013 and 20 percent in 2001, will
increase to 76 percent within five years, according to Aite
Group LLC, a Boston-based consulting firm that reviewed Bank for
International Settlements data. </p>

<p>Richard A. Friedman, head of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s merchant banking division, said he sees
opportunities to invest in middle-sized companies as some other
private-equity firms sell their investments. </p>
<p>''My peers, I see them at conferences, and they talk about
how it''s the greatest selling environment -- I actually think
it''s a good investing environment,'' Friedman, 56, said today in
a CNBC interview. ''We have continued improvement in the
economy, we have very low interest rates and access to capital,
and also for the first time, I''d say, in years, our CEOs can
actually put business plans together with more confidence.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s merchant banking unit makes investments in
private-equity and real estate assets using client funds and the
company''s own money. The firm''s investments are included in its
investing and lending segment, which produced $4.33 billion of
pretax earnings in 2013, the most profit of any of Goldman
Sachs''s four business units. </p>
<p>The bank has said it''s cutting its own stakes in private-equity funds to comply with the Volcker Rule, which limits such
investments. Still, the firm can often make direct investments
in debt or equity securities with its own money outside of fund
structures. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s merchant banking division has raised more
than $82 billion for investment funds in corporate equity and
debt since 1986, according to its website. The bank is
considering a different strategy than buying large companies to
take them private, which was popular before the financial
crisis, Friedman said. </p>
<h2>''Not Happening'' </h2>
<p>''What we''re looking at is actually buying mid-sized
companies or making early-stage investments and growing
companies, as opposed to what happened in 2005 through 2007,
which was a buying spree of taking companies private,'' Friedman
said. ''That''s just not happening anymore.'' </p>
<p>Friedman said he doesn''t expect interest rates to rise in
the near future. When that happens, it will probably lower
valuation multiples on companies, he said. </p>
<p>Friedman has worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 30 years
and was named a partner in 1990. He and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein are the only two executives to sit on the
firm''s management committee since it was created in 1999. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp.''s (XOM) biggest
international exploration opportunity may be imperiled by
Russian President Vladimir Putin''s Ukrainian foray. </p>
<p>U.S.-based companies could face restrictions on doing
business in Russia if Putin''s regime is slapped with sanctions
by western governments or the United Nations for its
intervention in Ukraine''s Crimea region. </p>
<p>Exxon, under the terms of a 2011 contract with state-controlled OAO Rosneft, owns drilling rights across 11.4 million
acres of Russian land, its biggest exploration holding outside
the U.S. Sanctions could stall Exxon''s plans to begin drilling
in the Russian Arctic later this year in partnership with
Rosneft, and threaten the lucrative Sakhalin-1 oil license off
Russia''s Pacific Coast. </p>
<p>Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
agreed to invest billions of dollars and allow Rosneft to buy
stakes in premier North American projects in exchange for access
to Russia''s vast Arctic, deep-water and shale resources. </p>
<p>The 61-year-old University of Texas-trained engineer is
seeking to reverse sliding oil and natural gas output at the
world''s biggest energy producer by market value. Since assuming
the leadership post of Exxon in January 2006, the company''s
stock has increased 65 percent, lagging the 77 percent advance
in the price of crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Drilling Rights </h2>
<p>Exxon''s 11.4 million acres of Russian drilling rights are
eclipsed in size only by the company''s 15.1 million acres in its
home country, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Feb. 26. The next largest Exxon holdings
are in Canada, Germany and Indonesia, where the company owns
rights to 6.3 million acres, 5 million acres and 2.3 million
acres, respectively. </p>
<p>Exxon has repeatedly declined to comment on the impact the
Russian imbroglio in Ukraine may have on its operations or
investment decisions. Tillerson is scheduled to take questions
from analysts and the media later today at the company''s annual
strategy presentation at the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>Exxon''s interests in the region aren''t confined to Russian
oil fields. The company dispatched high-level executives to the
Ukraine''s capital of Kiev six weeks ago to discuss exploring the
country''s vast shale deposits, Interfax reported on Jan. 23,
citing the website of then-President Viktor Yanukovych. </p>
<p>Yanukovych was ousted amid violent streets protests in late
February and has since fled to Russia. The January meetings
included Exxon executives Stephen Greenlee and Kevin Biddle,
according to the Interfax report. </p>
<h2>Rising Costs </h2>
<p>The Russian turmoil comes at a time when Exxon''s
exploration effort have stalled worldwide and costs to pump oil
and gas from the ground are rising. </p>
<p>The company found commercial quantities of oil or gas in 67
percent of the exploratory wells it drilled in 2013, unchanged
from 2012, according to the Feb. 26 regulatory filing. At the
same time, Exxon''s costs to produce the equivalent of a barrel
of crude jumped to $11.48 last year from $9.91 in 2012. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Russian drilling rights include 11.3 million acres
in the Kara and Black seas under the agreement with Rosneft, and
another 85,000 offshore acres beneath the Sea of Okhotsk near
Sakhalin Island. Rosneft is a partner in the Sakhalin-1
development, which began producing crude in 2005. </p>

<p>A U.S. judge handed Chevron Corp. a key victory in the energy company''s long-fought battle against a multibillion-dollar pollution lawsuit in Ecuador, ruling the American lawyer leading the case resorted to bribery and fraud. </p> <p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan agreed with Chevron yesterday that attorney Steven Donziger had paid off a judge and engaged in money laundering to secure a $9.5 billion judgment from an Ecuadorean court against the global oil giant. The ruling leaves Donziger, who spent the past two decades fighting Chevron, with a slimmer chance of securing compensation for rain forest dwellers in the country''s Lago Agrio area who claimed their land was turned into a toxic dumping ground for foreign oil interests. </p> <p>The New York plaintiffs'' attorney went over ''to the dark side'' and made a ''bargain with the devil,'' to obtain the 2011 judgment from the court in Ecuador, Kaplan said in a 500-page opinion yesterday. He ruled U.S. courts can''t be used to collect the award, cut in half from an original $19 billion by Ecuador''s highest court on Nov. 12. </p> <p>''The defendants here may not be allowed to benefit from that in any way,'' the judge wrote. The ruling may also make it more difficult for Donziger and his clients to collect the Ecuador court''s award by seizing Chevron assets outside the U.S. </p> <p>Donziger would need to win a reversal of the decision on appeal in order to salvage a payday for himself and his clients after decades of litigation. Kaplan''s detailed findings will make winning an appeal more difficult, said Cassandra Burke Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who has followed the case. </p> <p>''The appellate court would have to conclude that the district court''s finding is clearly erroneous, which is a very hard standard to meet,'' Robertson said. ''Donziger definitely has an uphill battle to seek reversal.'' </p> <h2>Other Countries </h2> <p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company by market value, has waged a battle across multiple countries to prevent Donziger from collecting the award, which was almost half of its 2013 profit of $21.4 billion. Kaplan''s bar on profiting from the judgment ''applies anywhere in the world,'' even though it doesn''t stop Donziger from trying to make his case in foreign courts, Randy Mastro, a lead lawyer for Chevron, said yesterday in a conference call. </p> <p>Chevron claims Kaplan''s opinion should be respected by courts in other countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Canada, where Chevron has assets and where Donziger and his team have already sued to try to collect on the judgment. The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in December that the 47 villagers have the right to pursue Chevron''s Canada assets. The other cases are pending. </p> <h2>Brazil, Canada </h2> <p>Chevron General Counsel R. Hewitt Pate said yesterday that the company plans to share Kaplan''s ruling with judges overseeing proceedings in Brazil, Argentina and Canada. </p> <p>''In view of the findings here about what really went on in this case, we don''t think any serious court will entertain enforcement of the fraudulent judgment,'' Pate said. </p> <p>Ecuadorean villagers and activists working on their behalf had argued that Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, should be held financially responsible for pollution of the Amazon rainforest in the Lago Agrio area by Texaco Inc. from the 1960s through the early 1990s. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, claimed the company already paid $40 million to clean up its share of the drilling contamination. </p> <h2>Secret Account </h2> <p>The case in Ecuador included ''things that normally come only out of Hollywood -- coded e-mails among Donziger and his colleagues describing their private interactions with and machinations directed at judges and a court-appointed expert,'' Kaplan wrote. </p> <p>Donziger and his team paid off a supposedly neutral court expert from a secret account, promised $500,000 to a judge handling the case who was so inexperienced he used an 18-year-old typist to do legal research, and wrote the judgment themselves, Kaplan said. </p> <p>''Donziger began his involvement in this controversy with a desire to improve conditions in the area in which his Ecuadorean clients live,'' said Kaplan, who oversaw a seven-week non-jury trial on the judgment. ''In the end, however, he and the Ecuadorean lawyers he led corrupted the Lago Agrio case.'' </p> <p>''The length of the opinion gives the parties more ammunition to continue their fight,'' said Robertson, the Case Western professor. ''I would be surprised if the ruling were upheld in full, but I think the ruling prohibiting Donziger from benefiting financially from the case will likely stand.'' </p> <h2>''Helpful'' Ruling </h2> <p>John Watson, Chevron''s chairman and chief executive officer, told reporters yesterday at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference in Houston that ''having a judgment like this from a reputable court in the United States will certainly be helpful in preventing enforcement actions elsewhere.'' </p> <p>Chevron has also brought an arbitration case against Ecuador over its alleged failure to uphold agreements releasing predecessor Texaco from legal cases over the pollution. The arbitration in The Hague is pending. </p> <p>The Embassy of Ecuador said yesterday that Kaplan''s ruling ''explicitly does not exonerate Chevron from its own legal and moral responsibilities resulting from its decades of contamination of the rainforest that has endangered the lives, culture, and environment of countless poor, indigenous people.'' </p> <p>The embassy said Ecuador isn''t a party in Chevron''s case against Donziger. </p> <p>In a statement, Donziger called Kaplan''s ruling ''an appalling decision.'' </p> <h2>Wrong, Wrong </h2> <p>''We believe Judge Kaplan is wrong on the law and wrong on the facts and that he repeatedly let his implacable hostility toward me, my Ecuadorean clients, and their country infect his view of the case,'' he said. </p> <p>Donziger said he will pursue an ''immediate and expedited appeal.'' </p> <p>The lawyer has argued that he did nothing wrong in Ecuador and that any aggressive tactics he may have used were no worse than Chevron''s actions. He said that Kaplan ''made it clear he would rule against us'' well before the trial began by refusing a request to hold the proceeding before a jury. </p> <p>Appellate lawyer Deepak Gupta, who joined Donziger''s team after the trial concluded, said in a statement that Kaplan ''has taken the extraordinary and unprecedented step of appointing itself a worldwide fact-finding commission,'' issuing ''what is in effect a global anti-collection injunction.'' </p> <h2>Appalling Verdict </h2> <p>''This decision also effectively outlaws core activity protected by the First Amendment such as bringing lawsuits, holding protests, issuing press releases, and engaging public officials,'' he said, referencing tactics mentioned in Kaplan''s decision. ''This is particularly appalling given that this case is about holding a corporation accountable for refusing to clean up decades of toxic pollution in the Amazon.'' </p> <p>Donziger, a Harvard Law School graduate, joined the case in a junior role in the late 1990s and gradually rose to a position as a strategist and fundraiser. He contends that Ecuador-based lawyers are now in charge of the case. </p> <p>He is ''intelligent, resourceful, and a master of public and media relations,'' Kaplan said in the decision. </p> <p>Some celebrities supported the campaign against Chevron, including Trudie Styler, who founded the Rainforest Foundation with her husband, musician Sting, and helped to start a project to make clean water available to forest inhabitants in Ecuador. Styler attended some of the New York court proceedings, bringing her husband to watch Donziger testify. </p> <p>Actress Mia Farrow and actor Danny Glover also voiced support for the campaign, and the case was featured in a documentary, ''Crude,'' by filmmaker Joe Berlinger. Chevron won access to hundreds of hours of outtakes from the film, which it contended showed Donziger acting inappropriately. </p> <p>The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. v.

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is cutting 700 jobs,
a quarter of the employees at its interactive unit, in a
realignment of its video-game and Internet advertising
businesses. </p>
<p>Future games for consoles such as Sony Corp.''s PlayStation
and Microsoft Corp.''s Xbox will be licensed, James Pitaro,
president of Disney Interactive, said today in an interview.
Burbank, California-based Disney is also paring its online ad
sales team to focus on ''fewer and bigger partners.'' </p>
<p>The company will continue to invest in interactive,
including the Infinity game system and the upcoming ''Fantasia''
title, mobile game development in Japan and short-form videos on
the Web. It''s also extending the Club Penguin online virtual
world to iPhone and Android platforms. The cuts announced today
are part of an effort to make the division profitable on a
consistent basis. </p>
<p>The interactive division lost $87 million on sales of $1.06
billion in the year ended Sept. 28. While the unit made a profit
of $55 million in this year''s first quarter ended in December,
Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said in February results this
period would be comparable to the $54 million loss in the second
quarter of 2013. </p>
<p>The division had one of the top 10 video games of 2013 with
its Infinity system, according to researcher NPD Group Inc.
Mobile traffic on its websites has about doubled since a
redesign two years ago, according to data from ComScore Inc. </p>
<h2>Web Ads </h2>
<p>Selling ads based on the mobile traffic has been
challenging, Pitaro said, explaining why the company is shifting
to more extensive sponsorships from display ads. </p>
<p>Playdom, a maker of games for social media that Disney
acquired for $563 million in 2010, has also struggled to come up
with hits as the business shifted to mobile and customers balked
at paying even 99 cents for games, Pitaro said. </p>
<p>''The industry has shifted from social games to mobile
games,'' Pitaro said. ''Our focus is now mobile first.'' </p>
<p>Pitaro became sole president of interactive in November. He
previously shared that title with former Playdom Chief Executive
Officer John Pleasants, who left at that time. </p>
<p>Disney rose less than 1 percent to $83.34 at the close in
New York. The stock has advanced 9.1 percent this year. </p>

<p>UBS AG (UBSN) hired bank takeover
specialists Tannon Krumpelman and Doug Simons as Switzerland''s
biggest lender rebuilds its financial-services practice to cope
with a prolonged dealmaking slump in that industry. </p>
<p>Krumpelman joins Zurich-based UBS from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Simons comes to the firm from Credit Suisse Group AG,
according to Greg Kennedy and Steve Pierson, co-heads of UBS''s
financial-services group for the Americas. Krumpelman and Simons
are managing directors. </p>
<p>The hires are part of a broader overhaul of UBS''s
investment bank, which exited most of its fixed-income trading
to boost profits. UBS recruited Kennedy and Pierson, who
previously worked together at Credit Suisse, to oversee a
makeover of its financial-services coverage out of New York. In
the past year, the group has cut more than 20 junior people and
replaced about half of its dozen senior bankers. </p>
<p>''We want to be exactly the right size so all of the
business we are doing is profitable business,'' Kennedy said in
an interview. </p>
<p>There were $95 billion in announced deals for U.S. banks,
insurance companies, specialty lenders and other financial
services companies in 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That reflects a 6 percent drop from 2012, and is less
than half of the $217 billion in deals announced in 2007, before
the credit crisis suffocated financial-services MA. </p>
<p>The downturn requires a leaner group staffed with
rainmakers, Pierson said. The turnaround in UBS''s financial
performance has made recruiting easier, he said. </p>
<p>The investment bank''s profit before tax rose to $2.3
billion in 2013 from $267 million a year earlier on lower
expenses and higher income, according to a company investor
presentation. </p>
<p>Krumpelman spent nine years at Goldman Sachs and started
its small- to mid-sized bank merger practice, advising Bankia SA
last year on the $883 million sale of its U.S. susidiary, City
National Bank of Florida. Simons has more than 20 years of
experience advising large depositories such as BBT Corp. and
Wells Fargo  Co. </p>

<p>European Union governments halted
trade and visa negotiations with Russia and prepared sanctions
against selected Russian officials to protest the Kremlin''s
assertion of control over Ukraine''s southern Crimea region. </p>
<p>EU leaders sent the diplomatic signals at a summit in
Brussels today that pitted western European countries keen to
offer Russia more time to pull back its forces before imposing
sanctions against eastern countries demanding retribution now. </p>
<p>''We must consider measures that have far-reaching
consequences for the EU-Russia relationship,'' U.K. Prime
Minister David Cameron told reporters after the meeting. Cameron
cited the potential ''consequences'' of such action on the
U.K.''s banks or on France''s defense industry, saying they were
worth it ''if you are going to stand up to aggression.'' </p>
<p>Some western European leaders had sought to delay
sanctions, shifting to a tougher stance after the parliament of
Crimea voted today to hold a referendum on March 16 on becoming
part of Russia. The EU was also swayed by the presence of
Ukraine''s new pro-western prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who
accused the Kremlin of putting up a new Berlin Wall. </p>
<h2>''This Wall'' </h2>
<p>''Tear down this wall, the wall of intimidation, the wall
of military aggression,'' Yatsenyuk said. </p>
<p>The time-out on the commercial talks echoed the bloc''s
response to Russia''s invasion of another neighbor, Georgia, in
2008. Those contacts were resumed after two months and failed to
dislodge the Russian troops that remain on parts of Georgia''s
territory. </p>
<p>EU President Herman Van Rompuy said things will be
different this time, noting that Russia is keen on expanded
trade and improved European travel opportunities for its
citizens. Van Rompuy called today''s EU decisions a surprise for
the outside world and said the leaders ''were very determined.'' </p>
<p>Besides suspending talks on trade and the easing of travel
visas, the leaders ordered the EU foreign service to draw up a
list of Russian officials who could be targeted with asset
freezes in a future round of sanctions. </p>
<p>That decision followed yesterday''s freezing of European
bank accounts of 18 members of Ukraine''s former pro-Russian
regime, including the ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. The
U.S. targeted some unidentified Russians today in restricting
visas deemed a threat to Ukraine''s security. </p>
<p>Van Rompuy declined to say whether a future blacklisting
would cover Russian President Vladimir Putin or members of his
inner circle. </p>
<h2>Black Sea </h2>
<p>The summit had loomed as a deadline for Putin to withdraw
forces to bases which Russia leases in Crimea, where its Black
Sea Fleet is headquartered. On March 3, EU foreign ministers
demanded that Russia ''immediately'' take ''de-escalating
steps'' or face consequences. Putin says the Russian troops
stationed there have only been securing their bases. </p>
<p>EU leaders called again today for an immediate withdrawal
and demanded that Russia stop blocking access to Crimea by
monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. A statement urged Russia to enter roundtable talks over
Ukraine''s future, without setting a fixed deadline. </p>
<p>The Russia-Ukraine standoff plunged the EU back into the
emergency diplomacy that dominated the euro-area debt crisis.
The divide between the richer north and poorer south that marked
the economic crisis gave way today to a renewal of the east-west
divisions over ties with Russia that have plagued the bloc since
it absorbed former Soviet satellite countries a decade ago. </p>
<h2>''No Enthusiasm'' </h2>
<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said a pledge by
Ukraine''s Yatsenyuk to sign a European trade pact shifted the
mood among the 28 leaders. </p>
<p>''There''s no enthusiasm for tough steps like sanctions,''
Tusk said. ''But everybody understands that Russia''s stance
today, combined with Ukraine''s situation and the EU''s
obligations, requires such measures.'' </p>
<p>Europe''s fiscal crisis also cast an economic shadow over
the meeting, lessening the will to curb commercial ties with
Russia. Germany, Europe''s largest economy, relies on Russia for
35 percent of its gas and oil imports. </p>
<p>France, for example, won''t yet suspend military contracts
with Russia, President Francois Hollande said. Russia in 2011
bought two ''Mistral'' warships from France for more than $1
billion. </p>
<p>''We respect the contracts that we have signed,'' Hollande
said. ''We haven''t reached that level yet. And we want to avoid
getting there.'' </p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel held out the prospect of
additional steps against Russia including ''a broad palette of
economic measures'' if Crimea is further destabilized. She said
EU leaders might meet again before their regularly scheduled
March 20-21 gathering to decide on possible further sanctions. </p>
<p>European leaders also agreed to add 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion) to the 610 million euros in emergency aid that the EU
plans to disburse once Ukraine strikes a standby agreement with
the International Monetary Fund. Those cash injections to avert
a Ukrainian default would form the nucleus of a package of
grants and project loans that could top 11 billion euros over
seven years, the European Commission said yesterday. </p>

<p>Firms from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
to Deutsche Bank AG are putting their faith in India''s rupee as
the country looks forward to the biggest improvement in its
broadest measure of trade in a decade. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which ranked India as the most vulnerable
Asian market in September, now predicts the rupee will beat
peers from Brazil to South Africa and Turkey. Deutsche Bank, the
largest foreign-exchange trader, and Barclays Plc say it''s their
favorite emerging-market currency. The rupee has risen 6.8
percent against the dollar over the past six months, the most
among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Investors are seeking safe, high-yielding assets as the
U.S. Federal Reserve reduces stimulus and after a slowdown in
China contributed to the worst start to a year for emerging-market currencies since 2009. For many, India fits the bill, as
policy makers take steps to reverse a slump that sent the rupee
tumbling to a record last August. </p>
<p>''India looks in much better shape now than it did six
months back,'' Kim Jin Ha, a global fixed-income fund manager in
Seoul at Mirae Asset Management Co., which oversees about $59
billion, said by e-mail March 3. ''Capital flows can continue.'' </p>
<h2>Funds Return </h2>
<p>The rupee''s recovery bodes well for India''s efforts to curb
the fastest consumer-price inflation after Argentina among the
Group of 20 nations, and to boost inflows to help revive the
slowest economic growth in a decade. Less than three months into
2014, foreigners have already plowed back more than half of the
$8 billion they pulled from local bonds last year. </p>
<p>India''s rupee climbed as much as 1.1 percent today to
61.1050 per dollar, the strongest level since Dec. 10, and was
at 61.1150 as of 10:33 a.m. in New York. It has risen from an
all-time low of 68.845 on Aug. 28. The rupee weakened 13 percent
in the second and third quarters of last year amid a decline in
the country''s manufacturing industry and monetary tightening. </p>
<p>The rupee may get a boost after India''s current-account
deficit narrowed to a four-year low as the world''s second-largest bullion-consuming nation raised gold-import tariffs. </p>
<p>The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade, which
tracks goods, services and investment income, was $4.2 billion
last quarter, down from $5.2 billion in the prior three months,
the Reserve Bank of India said yesterday in Mumbai. </p>
<p>The deficit will shrink to $45 billion in the year ending
March 31, from $88 billion in the prior period, Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted last month. </p>
<h2>''Small Long'' </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs said in February that it saw the rupee at 62
in three months'' time, while its asset-management arm opened
this year what it called a ''small long'' position on the
currency. HSBC Holdings Plc advises buying the rupee and selling
Indonesia''s rupiah, while Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley
predict India''s currency will strengthen against the Brazilian
real, according to client notes last week. </p>
<p>Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. may buy Indian assets because
the economy is less exposed to China''s faltering growth than
nations including South Korea, Emmanuel Ng, a strategist at the
Singapore-based firm, said by e-mail on Feb. 26. </p>
<p>''I see the inflows continuing,'' said Rajeev De Mello, who
oversees $10 billion as the head of Asian fixed income at
Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore. </p>
<h2>''Big Doubts'' </h2>
<p>Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg lifted the median mid-year
forecast for the rupee to 62.6, from 63.25 three months ago. </p>
<p>While that''s a bigger increase than for any of its Asian
peers, it still signals a drop of more than 1 percent by June
30. Credit Agricole SA says the rupee will weaken to 70 per
dollar by mid-year as a clampdown on bullion shipments boosts
unofficial imports and India prepares for elections next month. </p>
<p>''India''s external position is not as good as it looks,''
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at France''s
third-biggest bank, said in an interview on March 4. ''India''s
imports of gold have actually increased. I have big doubts
whether the government that will come out of the elections will
be welcomed by the markets.'' </p>
<p>RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan lifted interest rates three
times since taking office in September, boosting returns to
rupee investors and helping slow inflation to 8.8 percent in
January, from 11.2 percent in November. </p>
<p>He boosted capital inflows by offering discounted foreign-exchange swaps for dollar deposits and debt raised by local
banks. That helped increase foreign-exchange reserves by $20
billion, from September''s three-year low of $247 billion. </p>
<p>Dollar-based investors can make a return of 6.5 percent,
including interest, by holding the rupee until the end of 2014,
the biggest gain in Asia, according to data based on
appreciation estimates and deposit rates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''Current-account numbers have been the key driver because
it''s a very transparent measure of whether the policy
prescriptions are having an impact,'' Philip Moffitt, the
Sydney-based head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, which oversees more than $1 trillion, said in
an interview. ''If you can find something that''s relatively
cheap and the fundamentals appear to be improving, it''s usually
a good mix.'' </p>

<p>Arqaam Capital Ltd., a Dubai-based
investment bank focusing on emerging markets, said it plans to
trade African bonds and derivatives after opening a brokerage in
Johannesburg in January. </p>
<p>Arqaam became the first broker to join Johannesburg''s stock
exchange in three years, pitting it against research teams from
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Renaissance Capital Holdings Ltd., Standard
Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>''We''re under no illusions that this is a tough market,''
Ross Abbott, head of Arqaam in South Africa, said in an
interview in Johannesburg yesterday. ''We believe we''ll be the
first Cape-to-Cairo broker. We started with cash equities and
we''re looking at the bond market, derivatives and maybe asset
management with an Africa fund.'' </p>
<p>Arqaam plans to extend its coverage to the mining industry
from the 49 African financial-services stocks it covers, before
building research on consumer, real estate, aviation and other
sectors, Abbott said. The firm plans to trade over-the-counter
bonds and is focusing on countries including Kenya, Ghana,
Nigeria, Morocco and Egypt, he said. </p>
<p>RenCap, the Russian investment bank controlled by
billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, said Feb. 24 it had hired Rupert Preece to head sub-Saharan fixed-income trading as demand for
African bonds increases. Last year Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
switched its coverage of fixed income in sub-Saharan Africa from
London to Johannesburg to boost emerging market revenue. </p>
<h2>Big Angle </h2>
<p>''Our Middle Eastern products are the big angle here; we''re
the only ones in South Africa offering that reach,'' Abbott
said. ''And we have North Africa. RenCap also wants to be there
-- we believe we''ll be first.'' </p>
<p>Zambia joins other African nations including Ghana and
Kenya in selling dollar-denominated debt this year. Countries in
the continent may sell as much as $5 billion in bonds by June,
according to Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics Ltd. </p>
<p>''There''s probably a space for someone with feet on the
ground in North Africa,'' said Arno Lawrenz, chief investment
officer at Cape Town''s Atlantic Asset Management. ''But taking
on North Africa credit risk right now -- that''s like going into
distressed debt. Do you need to go into that sort of environment
to get a decent return? My sense is no.'' </p>
<p>Arqaam, which offers trading and research services to
institutions, has been visiting exchanges across the continent
and there may be a ''strong push for sukuk,'' Abbott said,
commenting on Shariah-compliant bonds. </p>
<p>South Africa plans to sell a debut $500 million
international sukuk this year and introduce two long-term
domestic bonds as the nation diversifies its debt portfolio to
reduce refinancing risks, the National Treasury said on Feb. 26. </p>

Abbott said. </p>

<p>The GSCI gauge fell 2.2 percent last year, the first
decline since the global recession in 2008, as a decade of
higher prices spurred producers to build new mines, drill more
wells and expand crop planting. Increased supply combined with
slowing growth in China, the biggest user of everything from
soybeans to zinc and cotton, prompted New York-based Goldman and
Citigroup to declare an end to the commodity super cycle that
caused raw materials to almost quadruple since 2001. </p>
<p>While many investors ''threw in the towel'' after last
year''s slump, they shouldn''t give up on commodities, said
Michael Aronstein, who correctly predicted the plunge in raw
materials in 2008 and the 2009 rebound. </p>
<h2>Global Expansion </h2>
<p>''Commodities will just be normal cyclical participants in
an accelerating expansion globally,'' said Aronstein, the
president and chief investment officer of Marketfield Asset
Management LLC in New York. ''You''re returning to local supply-demand functions in commodities.'' Aronstein said he started
buying commodity-related equities at the end of 2013. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy will grow 2.9 percent this year,
accelerating from 1.9 percent in 2013, a Bloomberg survey shows.
The euro area will expand by 1.1 percent after a contraction of
0.5 percent last year. Eighteen of the 24 commodities in the
GSCI index climbed in 2014, and seven of them have posted gains
of 10 percent or more. </p>
<p>''It''s been a year full of surprises, no doubt about
that,'' said David Rosenberg, the Toronto-based chief economist
at Gluskin Sheff  Associates, which manages about $6.8 billion.
''There is a time-worn relationship between overall global
growth and the commodity complex. Between what the U.S. is going
to do this year and what Europe is going to do, global growth is
going to be accelerating.'' </p>
<h2>Bean Variety </h2>
<p>Arabica coffee, the bean variety favored by Seattle-based
Starbucks Corp., reached a two-year high this week amid the
driest summer since 1972 for Brazil, the biggest grower. Crude
oil jumped to the highest since September, reaching $105.22 a
barrel in New York on March 3 as tensions escalated between
Ukraine and Russia, the biggest energy exporter. Unusually
frigid weather in the U.S. boosted demand for heating fuel,
while supplies of natural gas and coal will decline to six-year
lows by the end of this month, government data show. </p>
<p>The supply-and-demand outlook for individual commodities,
rather than macroeconomics, is now driving prices, said Michael Haigh, the head of commodities research at Societe Generale SA
in New York. Raw materials don''t have ''much more downside''
because prices are near the cost of production, while the
outlook for slowing growth in China and emerging markets in
general has already been factored in, he said. </p>
<h2>''More Neutral'' </h2>
<p>Citigroup has turned ''more neutral,'' though the bank
still isn''t bullish, said Aakash Doshi, a vice president of
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in New York. Geopolitical risk and
weather spurred this year''s rally, and increased supplies will
mean prices probably will decline in the second half of the
year, especially for grains, he said. </p>
<p>Corn reserves in the U.S., the biggest grower, will jump 80
percent before this year''s harvest to 1.48 billion bushels after
farmers collected a record crop in 2013, the government said
Feb. 10. Global copper production will outpace consumption by
81,000 metric tons in 2014, after posting a deficit of 175,000
tons a year earlier, London-based Barclays Plc said in a report
Feb. 12. The U.S. is extracting the most oil since 1989 as
producers tap shale-rock formations. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, Goldman''s preferred
measure, will drop 4.3 percent in the next 12 months, analysts
led by Jeffrey Currie said in a report last month. Declines will
be led by a 14 percent drop for precious metals, while
agriculture products will fall 9 percent, the bank said in the
report. </p>
<h2>Goldman View </h2>
<p>The 2014 rebound is ''more of a transient weather shock as
opposed to something more persistent,'' Currie said in an
interview March 5. ''It would need to be persistent before we
would significantly change our view.'' </p>
<p>Gold prices, already down about 30 percent from a record in
2011, will slip toward $1,100 an ounce by the end of the year as
the U.S. recovery picks up momentum and the dollar gains,
according to Michael Lewis, the head of commodities research at
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG. Futures in New York settled at
$1,351.80 yesterday. Commodities may ''struggle to attract
financial flows'' as investors buy more equities, he said. </p>
<p>Bullion funds have attracted $522 million since the start
of the year as investors returned to the precious metal amid the
escalating turmoil in the Ukraine and slower-than-forecast
economic growth in the U.S., data from EPFR show. That compares
with a record outflow of $38.99 billion for 2013. </p>
<h2>Gold Buyers </h2>
<p>The price of gold jumped 11 percent since December,
rebounding from the 28 percent plunge last year that was the
biggest decline since 1981. Increasing demand from buyers of
coins, jewelry and bars will help to sustain bullion''s rally
this year, according to James Steel, chief precious metals
analyst at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>Palladium futures in New York reached a one-year high of
$785 an ounce yesterday as the U.S. and its allies considered
sanctions against Russia, the biggest supplier. Output of the
metal already has been disrupted by labor unrest in South
Africa, the second-biggest producer. Miners have vowed not to
back down from a strike that started in January. </p>
<h2>Coldest Start </h2>
<p>The coldest start to a year since 2011 means consumers
won''t see the normal seasonal drop in power prices. Natural gas
is up 29 percent compared with a year ago, adding to costs for
home heating and power generation. Nationwide, consumers may pay
an average of 12.28 cents per kilowatt hour from March to May,
2.5 percent more than a year earlier, according to U.S. Energy
Information Administration data. Prices will be highest in New
England. </p>
<p>Frigid weather may also limit meat supplies as low
temperatures force hogs and cattle to use more energy battling
the cold, slowing weight gains. A deadly pig virus is
compounding the outlook for shrinking U.S. pork supplies. Cattle
and hog futures reached records in Chicago on March 5,
increasing costs for retailers including Austin, Minnesota-based
Hormel Foods Corp., the maker of Spam meat spreads. </p>
<p>World food prices posted the biggest gain in 19 months in
February on concern that cold weather and drought in the U.S.,
the biggest exporter of wheat, and dryness in top-sugar producer
Brazil will harm crops. An index of 55 food items rose 2.6
percent to 208.1 from 202.9 in January, the United Nations'' Food
 Agriculture Organization in Rome said yesterday. The gauge is
still down 2.1 percent from a year earlier. </p>
<h2>Coffee Harvest </h2>
<p>Brazil''s coffee harvest will reach 47.7 million bags, down
10 percent from a previous estimate, Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based coffee importer Wolthers Douque, said March 5. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). </p>
<p>Coffee prices in New York tumbled 23 percent in 2013, the
third straight decline and the longest slump since 1993. The
driest January since 1954 for Brazil erased the outlook for a
record crop, prompting investors to more than triple their bets
on a rally last month, government data show. </p>
<p>''We''re in a period of rising unpredictability around
climate change,'' said Stephen Diggle, managing director and co-founder of Singapore-based Vulpes Investment Management, which
manages $250 million. ''We see it as a significant and rising
threat to food production. The planet is going to experience
more disruptions in food production in the coming years than it
has in the past. That means we expect to see more volatility in
prices.'' </p>

<p>Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR), the
largest U.S. producer of coal used to make steel, slumped the
most in seven months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
rating to sell and lowered price estimates for the commodity. </p>
<p>Alpha dropped 8.2 percent to $5.03 at 10:23 a.m. in New
York, after earlier falling as much as 9.9 percent, the most
intraday since Aug. 2. Other U.S. metallurgical-coal producers
also declined: Walter Energy Inc. slid as much as 9.2 percent,
Peabody Energy Corp. was down 4.4 percent and Arch Coal Inc.
fell 3.9 percent. </p>
<p>Goldman cut its metallurgical coal price estimate for this
year to $141 a metric ton from $150 and lowered projections for
next year and 2016. The move follows increased Australian
output, an expected slowdown in the growth of Chinese imports,
and ''limited U.S. supply rationalization,'' Neil Mehta and
Vinit Joshi, analysts at Goldman, said in a note yesterday. </p>
<p>''We expect this oversupply level will increase in the
coming years,'' they said. </p>
<p>Goldman previously had a hold recommendation on Bristol,
Virginia-based Alpha. It cut its price target for the stock to
$4 from $6. Goldman lowered its target price for Birmingham,
Alabama-based Walter to $10 from $12 while maintaining a hold

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
Officer Marianne Lake said the $27 billion profit outlook the
bank laid out at an investor conference last month wasn''t a
target and the firm can earn more than that. </p>
<p>''That''s not a forecast, that''s not a budget, it''s a
simulation, and it was really predicated only on those things
that we''re really certain of,'' Lake said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker.
''I think there''s every reason to believe that it''s biased to
the conservative.'' </p>
<p>The $27 billion outlook compares with net income of $17.9
billion last year and $21.3 billion in 2012. At the firm''s
investor day in 2013, JPMorgan presented a scenario in which
earnings could increase to $27.5 billion, while saying its
target was $24 billion. </p>
<p>This year''s outlook only factored in the impact of higher
interest rates and investments the firm has made in its business
over the past few years, Lake said. It didn''t include higher
trading revenue, even as the bank ''absolutely expects'' that
business to grow over the next five years, she said. </p>
<p>Lake also said that rising costs from regulation will be
''somewhat permanent.'' Still, JPMorgan holds the ''best hand''
among large banks and will continue to outperform rivals,
according to Lake. She declined to forecast the maximum the bank
could earn in the next few years. </p>

<p>Ginni Rometty, chief executive
officer of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), said the
company fell short of expectations last year and must address
its struggling hardware businesses. </p>
<p>''We must acknowledge that while 2013 was an important year
of transformation, our performance did not meet our
expectations,'' Rometty, who is also chairman, said over the
weekend in a letter to investors in the company''s annual report.
''While we continue to remix to higher value, we must also
address those parts of the business that are holding us back.'' </p>
<p>IBM has struggled in a shift to the cloud era, where data
and information are delivered online instead of being stored
onsite. Falling demand for hardware and weak sales in growth
markets have dragged down revenue for the last seven quarters,
prompting Rometty to sell assets, fire and furlough workers, buy
back shares and cut taxes to help meet profit goals. </p>
<p>The company announced today that Michael Eskew, the former
chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service Inc. who has been on
the IBM board since 2005, will become IBM''s first presiding
director on May 1. </p>
<p>In the newly created position, Eskew will serve as a
liaison between the chairman and independent directors and be
able to call meetings of independent directors, according to a
regulatory filing. The presiding director also will be available
to speak with major shareholders, if requested, after
discussions with Rometty. Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. is IBM''s largest shareholder. </p>
<h2>Leadership Structure </h2>
<p>Board members ''as a whole accepted the recommendation of
Mrs. Rometty and believe that this leadership structure will
provide the company with the continued benefits of combining the
leadership role of chairman and CEO, while also recognizing the
unique strengths and capabilities of IBM''s board members,'' the
company said in the filing. </p>
<p>IBM''s sales fell 5 percent last year, and the stock was the
only decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That led top
executives to forgo annual bonuses and shrink the company''s
headcount for the first time in a decade. </p>
<p>With no bonus, Rometty''s 2013 pay, calculated using U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission rules, fell 14 percent from a
year earlier to $14 million. On the recommendation of the
board''s compensation committee, IBM''s independent directors
approved a long-term incentive plan for Rometty of $12.75
million in performance-based stock awards for the period ending
in 2016. </p>
<p>''The committee believes Mrs. Rometty performed well in
shifting investments into key segments of the portfolio and
advancing innovative solutions, creating a strong foundation for
transformation in 2014,'' the company said. </p>
<h2>Maintaining Goal </h2>
<p>Even as revenue has tumbled, Rometty reaffirmed IBM''s goal
of $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015 -- up from $11.67 in
2010, the letter said. </p>
<p>IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $186.39 at the close
in New York. </p>
<p>The CEO said the company will continue shifting its focus
to cloud services and data analytics while making changes to its
hardware products. The company agreed in January to sell most of
its low-end server business for $2.3 billion to Lenovo Group
Ltd. (992) </p>
<p>After buying cloud provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc.
last year for $2 billion, IBM is integrating existing hardware
and data analytics with its services. </p>
<p>IBM will use its Power Systems servers to help deliver its
Watson tool through the cloud, the company said last month. The
company is spending $1 billion on building a new business group
around the technology, which analyzes troves of information and
answers questions in plain English. </p>
<p>This follows a $1.2 billion commitment to bolster
SoftLayer''s cloud offerings by adding new data centers and an
expansion of the services to lure new customers as it faces off
with competitors like Amazon.com Inc. </p>

<p>Australia''s dollar has tumbled 15
percent from its high last year and strategists forecast more

<p>Australia''s stable AAA credit rating makes it a haven and
encourages sovereign-wealth funds to allocate more money there,

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
sticking with its recommendation to buy Chinese stocks, the
biggest losers worldwide this year, after valuations fell to the
lowest level in a decade versus global peers. </p>
<p>''Given how share prices have corrected and given where the
valuations are, from a risk-reward standpoint we still think we
can make a positive case on Chinese equities,'' Kinger Lau, a
strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview in Hong Kong
on March 4. He predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)
will climb to 12,000 in the next 12 months, a 24 percent advance
from last week''s close, versus the brokerage''s December forecast
for the measure to reach 13,600 by the end of 2014. </p>
<p>The index of Chinese shares in Hong Kong lost 10 percent
this year through last week, the most among 93 global benchmark
indexes tracked by Bloomberg, as factory gauges pointed to a
slowdown in the economy and concern grew that more companies
will struggle to repay debt after the nation''s first onshore
corporate bond default on March 7. The gauge trades at a 45
percent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index, the most
in a decade. </p>
<p>China''s leaders are trying to balance clampdowns on the
shadow-banking industry and local-government debt with measures
to support growth in the world''s second-largest economy.
Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science  Technology Co. (002506) became the
first company to default in China after failing to pay full
interest due last week on onshore bonds. </p>
<h2>Relative Value </h2>
<p>The Hang Seng China index is valued at 1.1 times net
assets, the biggest discount since September 2003 to MSCI''s
global index, which has a multiple of 2. The H-share measure
slid 1.7 percent to 9,540.10 as of 1:41 p.m. in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc. today named Helen Zhu as head of China
equities, luring the New York bank''s chief China equity
strategist away from Goldman Sachs. The appointment takes effect
on April 7 and Zhu may start managing funds later this year,
BlackRock said in a statement. The New York-based firm is the
world''s largest money manager, overseeing about $4.3 trillion. </p>
<p>Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. all
trade at about the same level as their net assets, while Bank of
China Ltd. has a price-to-book ratio of 0.8. The four lenders
are the nation''s biggest by market value. </p>
<p>''Any clear and concrete policy measures in terms of
dealing with shadow banking loans and local government debt
would likely be positive catalysts for banks,'' Lau said.
''Valuations for Chinese banks have already priced in a very
significant crisis scenario.'' </p>
<h2>Regulated Borrowing </h2>
<p>Premier Li Keqiang told the National People''s Congress last
week that China will develop a regulated regional borrowing
mechanism, after local-government liabilities surged to 17.9
trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) as of June 2013 from 10.7 trillion
yuan at the end of 2010. Authorities have also started a cleanup
of the $6 trillion shadow-banking industry and identified
sectors of the economy in need of consolidation. </p>
<p>While Chinese banks'' non-performing loans rose by 28.5
billion yuan in the last quarter of 2013 to 592.1 billion yuan,
the highest since September 2008, bad loans only accounted for 1
percent of total lending, the China Banking Regulatory
Commission said Feb. 13. </p>
<p>Bank valuations currently imply a non-performing loan ratio
of about 7 percent, Lau said. </p>
<h2>Global Outlook </h2>
<p>An improving global economic outlook may also be a catalyst
for a rally in Chinese shares, Lau said, declining to name
specific stocks. </p>
<p>The World Bank raised its 2014 growth forecasts for
advanced nations in January to 2.2 percent from 2 percent, while
cutting its estimates for developing nations to 5.3 percent from
5.6 percent. China is the world''s biggest exporter. </p>
<p>China last week retained a target for 7.5 percent growth in
2014 for the $9 trillion economy. Gross domestic product
expanded 7.7 percent in 2013, the same pace as in 2012. </p>
<p>A purchasing managers'' index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics dropped to a seven-month low of 48.5, the
companies said March 3. A similar gauge from the government with
a larger sample size fell to 50.2, the lowest since June, a
report showed March 1. Numbers above 50 signal expansion. </p>
<p>Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in
February from a year earlier, customs data showed March 8,
compared with analysts'' median estimate for a 7.5 percent
increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July,
according to a statistics bureau report yesterday, extending the
longest decline since 1999. </p>
<h2>Share Slump </h2>
<p>The Hang Seng China gauge has tumbled 16 percent since Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, predicted
on Dec. 2 that the H-share measure would rally 18 percent by the
end of 2014. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s forecast formed part of a trade
recommendation in which the bank told investors to buy Chinese
stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities would lag
the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade its fourth
top recommendation for 2014. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s fourth-largest energy producer by market value, reduced its 2017
production estimate and said it will sell $10 billion in assets
during the next three years. </p>
<p>Chevron lowered its production forecast by 6.1 percent as
it slows U.S. natural gas drilling and higher crude prices
reduce its share of production in some nations, the company said
during a presentation to analysts in New York today. The company
now sees output equivalent to 3.1 million barrels of crude a day
from a previous estimate of 3.3 million. Last year Chevron
produced the equivalent of 2.6 million barrels. </p>
<p>Lower-than-expected U.S. gas prices prompted the company to
curtail some drilling in Pennsylvania''s Marcellus Shale gas
formation, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson. New discoveries and acquisitions only added enough oil
and gas to reserves to replace 85 percent of the company''s
production last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''Our growth strategy remains intact, though some things
have changed,'' Watson said. Higher crude prices will also have
a negative impact on output under production agreements in some
nations that curb a company''s share as prices escalate, he said. </p>
<h2>Rising Production </h2>
<p>Chevron is spending $39.8 billion this year on gas-export
terminals, offshore crude platforms and other capital projects
to reverse a three-year drop in production. Chevron is alone
among the world''s three-largest energy companies in forecasting
a production increase this year. </p>
<p>Chevron''s 2017 output target assumes crude prices will
average about $110 a barrel, the San Ramon, California-based
company said in a slide presentation prepared for today''s
meeting with analysts. That compares with the $79 price
assumption that underlaid the prior forecast from March 2013. </p>
<p>The company plans to increase drilling in the U.S. Permian
Basin by 8.6 percent this year to 505 wells, according to the
slides. The company''s production from the formation that
straddles the Texas-New Mexico border will double by the end of
2020. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. is the world''s largest energy producer,
followed by Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PetroChina. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. analysts
see Bitcoin as an innovative payments technology while doubting
that it will evolve into a true alternative currency, according
to a research report released today. </p>
<p>In the report, titled ''All About Bitcoin,'' the
researchers write that they examined multiple views of the
digital currency by people inside and outside of Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>''So where does that leave us? With the conclusion that
Bitcoin likely can''t work as a currency, but some sense that the
ledger-based technology that underlies it could hold promise,''
the report said. </p>
<p>Bitcoin emerged from source code written by an anonymous
developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto
in 2009, and attracted a following motivated in part by the
ability to escape the strictures of traditional currency,
notably government control. The report by Goldman Sachs lends
credibility to the virtual currency, said Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, a group of angel investors in early stage
Bitcoin startups. </p>
<p>''The tone overall is conservative and measured,'' Terpin
said of the report. ''People will read it and draw their own
conclusions. It''s nice they are paying attention to it, and
don''t have a Bitcoin-is-evil view.'' </p>
<h2>Biggest Hurdle </h2>
<p>Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua, the researchers at Goldman
Sachs who wrote the report, said that the ability to pay for
goods and services using Bitcoin is growing, saying that
''obstacles to Bitcoin being used more broadly in the payments
system are arguably not insurmountable.'' </p>
<p>Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering
information-technology services, said Bitcoin''s ''biggest
hurdle'' will be maintaining its cost advantage in the face of
greater regulation, higher operating costs, and competition from
entrenched players. </p>
<p>''While it is too early to tell how banks and payment
processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that
it is only a matter of time before major incumbents develop a
digital currency strategy,'' Leal wrote. </p>

<p>Thomas Lee, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who has called for gains in American
stocks (SPX) for six straight years and got them in four, is leaving
the firm. </p>
<p>Lee, 44, is stepping down tomorrow after holding the job
since 2007, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based
firm, said in a telephone interview. Lee wants to take time away
from work, according to a memo sent to employees. </p>
<p>Lee, who worked for JPMorgan for 15 years, is among almost
two dozen Wall Street strategists who try to predict the
direction of the stock market and advise investors on which
companies to buy and sell. He had one of the highest year-end
forecasts for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, telling investors
last week to stay bullish and buy health-care, technology and
financial stocks. </p>
<p>''He''s just one of the best strategists in the game,''
Philip Orlando, who helps oversee nearly $400 billion as chief
equity-market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., said in a
phone interview. ''I''m surprised and disappointed that a young
guy at the top of his game would be resigning.'' </p>
<p>Lee, a managing director at the largest U.S. bank, didn''t
respond to a telephone call seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Always Bullish </h2>
<p>He was bullish at the start of each of six full years as
chief equity strategist, forecasting an average annual rise of
14 percent in the SP 500 over the period. He was more accurate
than the average of strategist forecasts in four of the six
years, including 2012 and 2013. </p>
<p>Like every one of his competitors tracked by Bloomberg, Lee
failed to foresee the stock-market decline in 2008. He called
for an 8.3 percent increase in the SP 500 that year. The
benchmark gauge plummeted 38 percent in its worst annual
performance since the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Before taking the strategist job, he covered the wireless
and telecommunications industry from 1999 to 2007 and added
small-cap stocks in 2004, being recognized by Institutional
Investor magazine every year since 1998, according to the memo. </p>
<p>He held positions at Oppenheimer  Co., Kidder Peabody 
Co. and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. He received a bachelor''s
degree in economics in 1991 from the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania with dual concentrations in finance
and accounting. </p>
<h2>''Good Reputation'' </h2>
<p>''He has a good reputation,'' Hugh Johnson, who oversees $2
billion as chairman of Albany, New York-based Hugh Johnson
Advisors LLC. Strategists ''are helpful in thinking about
issues,'' he said. ''They can tell you what the issues are and
give you interesting ways to analyze the issues.'' </p>
<p>The SP 500 will probably end the year at 2,075, Lee said
in a March 7 report. Only Weeden  Co. and Canaccord Genuity
Securities LLC have higher estimates, according to a survey
compiled by Bloomberg of 21 strategists. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, Lee stuck to his bullish
stance even as the SP 500 slid as much as 5.8 percent in
February. He was ultimately proved correct as the equities
benchmark recovered the losses by the end of the month. </p>
<p>His predictions during the rebound were more accurate. His
target of 1,100 for the U.S. equity benchmark in 2009 was only
off by 15 points. </p>
<p>''His viewpoints have been very much on the money and he
will do well wherever he goes,'' John Manley, who helps oversee
about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo
Funds Management in New York, said in a phone interview.
''Hopefully, he reappears somewhere else.'' </p>

<p>ISS Holding A/S, the world''s
largest cleaning company, jumped as much as 13 percent in its
first day of trading in Denmark''s biggest initial public
offering in 20 years. </p>
<p>ISS''s new shares traded as high as 180 kroner in
Copenhagen, compared with the IPO price of 160 kroner. The
initial price range set during the offer was 140 kroner to 175
kroner. ISS said it raised gross proceeds of 8.04 billion kroner
($1.5 billion). </p>

since the 1994 listing of TDC A/S. Companies in Europe raised
$10 billion from listings so far this year, about three times
the amount in the same period in 2013, as investors bet on an
economic recovery. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, faces competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill
Celebrex in May after a federal judge invalidated a patent that
could have delayed generic versions of the medicine. </p>
<p>A patent expiring in December 2015 was invalid because it
wasn''t different enough from one ending in May, a federal judge
in Norfolk, Virginia, said yesterday in a victory for companies
including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and
Lupin Ltd. (LPC) Pfizer ''will pursue all available remedies,
including an immediate appeal of the court''s decision,'' the
company said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Celebrex, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2
inhibitors, helps arthritis patients reduce pain by blocking a
chemical reaction in the body that causes inflammation. The
medicine had been projected to generate $2.5 billion between May
and when the 2015 patent was slated to expire, according to
sales estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''It seems likely that odds are in favor of generics
launching early,'' said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. Pfizer''s earnings per share will be
cut by 4 percent this year and 8 percent in 2015 if copycats do
make it to market, he wrote in a note to clients. </p>
<p>''There would be little to no impact to EPS from 2016
onwards because we have already been modeling generics in late
2015,'' Anderson said. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 1.4 percent to $31.98 yesterday in New York. </p>
<h2>Reimburse Pfizer </h2>
<p>Actavis Plc (ACT) said it plans to begin selling a generic
Celebrex in May, as long as it gets regulatory approval. Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, said
the company is pleased with the decision. Officials with Mylan
didn''t immediately return messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>Should the generic-drug companies enter the market and
later lose the appeal, they could be ordered to reimburse Pfizer
for any profits it loses from the low-cost competition. </p>
<p>An appeals court in 2008 had invalidated the patent, saying
it just covers a method of administering a ''therapeutically
effective amount'' of the compounds covered by the patent that
ends in May. New York-based Pfizer asked the patent office to
reissue it with modifications to work around the appeals court
decision. </p>
<p>District Judge Arenda Wright Allen said that the
modification sought by Pfizer wasn''t allowed under the law, so
the Federal Circuit''s reasoning stands. </p>
<p>The case is G.D. Searle LLC v. Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
13cv121, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia (Norfolk). </p>

<p>The yen gained for a fifth day
versus the dollar, the longest stretch in 10 months, as
investors sought haven assets before a referendum this weekend
that may lead to Crimea''s secession from Ukraine. </p>
<p>The ruble dropped versus all except two of its 31 major
counterparts as Russia remained on a collision course with the
West after six hours of talks between the country''s top
diplomats failed to ease tensions. The euro jumped as much as
0.5 percent versus the dollar amid speculation technical signals
triggered automatic selling orders, known as stops. </p>
<p>''Definitely the market is very nervous on Russia, the
Ukraine situation and the Crimea vote this weekend -- it''s
driving all risk off,'' said Masafumi Takada, a New York-based
director at BNP Paribas SA. </p>
<p>The yen climbed 0.5 percent to 101.36 per dollar at 5 p.m.
in New York, extending this week''s gain to 1.9 percent, the most
since Jan. 24. It last ended a five-day winning streak on May 1.
Japan''s currency advanced 0.2 percent to 141.03 per euro. The
shared currency gained 0.3 percent to $1.3914 and touched
$1.3937. The Swiss franc appreciated 0.3 percent to 87.24
centimes per dollar. </p>
<p>''It looks like a few euro-dollar stops have been taken
out,'' Stephen Collins, global head of dealing at the money
manager London  Capital Group Ltd., said in a telephone
interview from London. </p>
<h2>Higher Volatility </h2>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG''s Currency Volatility Index, based on
three-month implied volatility on nine major currency pairs,
rose for a second day. It increased to 7.63 percent, the highest
since March 3, after falling to 7.14 percent on March 12, the
lowest level since December 2012. </p>
<p>The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent to 36.6326 per dollar and
touched 36.7037, the weakest level since March 3. </p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met in London with
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to press the nation to
halt a takeover of Ukraine''s Crimean peninsula. </p>
<p>The mostly Russian-speaking region is scheduled to vote on
secession on March 16. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
yesterday Russia is risking ''massive'' political and economic
damage. </p>
<p>Russia''s president, Vladimir Putin, ''is not prepared to
make any decision regarding Ukraine until after the referendum
on Sunday,'' Kerry told a news conference after the meeting.
Russia ''will respect the will of the Crimean peoples,'' Lavrov
told a separate news conference, saying there''s ''no common
vision'' on resolving the crisis. Russia has no plans to invade
the region, Lavrov said. </p>
<h2>''Position Defensively''   </h2>
<p>Ukraine has asked the U.S. for military assistance and
equipment, according to an American defense official, who asked
not to be identified discussing private communications. Pentagon
officials have indicated the focus at the moment should be on
diplomatic and economic aid, the person said. </p>
<p>''Markets will continue to position defensively ahead of
the Crimean referendum on Sunday, with investors wary of
potential further escalation of geopolitical risks,'' said
Valentin Marinov, head of European Group-of-10 currency strategy
at Citigroup Inc. in London. ''Liquid safe havens like the yen
and Swiss franc should do well. The market is turning short U.S.
dollars against the majors.'' A short position is a bet an asset
will fall. </p>
<h2>Net Longs </h2>
<p>Futures traders increased their bets the franc will gain
against the dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission show. The difference in the number of
wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on an advance
in the franc versus those on a drop -- so-called net longs --
was 8,957 on March 11, compared with net longs of 2,168 a week
earlier. </p>
<p>The difference in the number of wagers by large speculators
on a decline in the yen against the greenback versus those on a
gain -- so-called net shorts -- increased to 99,356, compared
with net shorts of 79,709 a week earlier. </p>
<p>The  dollar remained lower versus the yen as the Labor
Department reported the U.S. producer price index fell 0.1
percent after a 0.2 percent rise the prior month. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.2 percent
increase. Over the past 12 months, wholesale prices increased
0.9 percent. </p>
<p>''It was a fair bit lower than our expectation,'' Brian Daingerfield, a Stamford, Connecticut-based currency strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in a telephone
interview. ''The reaction has been fairly muted in the foreign-exchange space.'' </p>
<h2>Yen''s Advance </h2>
<p>The yen has risen 3.4 percent this year, the best performer
after New Zealand''s dollar of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 0.4 percent, while the U.S. dollar fell 0.9 percent. </p>
<p>The Bank of Japan maintained record stimulus this week,
keeping ammunition amid speculation a sales-tax increase in
April will hurt the economy. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
predict the economy will shrink 3.8 percent in the second
quarter, when an increase in the consumption tax is scheduled to
take effect. </p>
<p>South Africa''s rand was the biggest winner among the
dollar''s major counterparts, gaining 1.3 percent to 10.6711 to
the greenback. </p>
<p>South Korea''s won, the biggest loser, declined 0.3 percent
to 1,072.78 to the greenback. It had its largest weekly drop in
almost two months, 1.1 percent,  as slowing economic growth in
China, the nation''s biggest foreign market, prompted investors
to seek safer assets. </p>
<p>Overseas investors sold $1.2 billion more South Korean
stocks than they bought this week as official data showed
exports in China contracted the most since 2009 in February and
factory output rose less than forecast in the past two months. </p>
<p>The Canadian currency, the second-biggest loser, declined
0.3 percent to C$1.1105 per U.S. dollar. </p>

<p>The term ''patent troll'' is sometimes used to disparage
companies that don''t make the products covered by the patents
they own and instead sue others for infringement to force a cash

Overstock of infringing three patents. That case was dismissed

<p>Narendra Modi, the front-running
prime ministerial candidate of India''s opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party, will contest national elections that begin next
month from Hinduism''s holiest city to boost his party''s support. </p>
<p>Modi will contest from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, India''s
most populous state, in the north of the country, Ananth Kumar,
a senior BJP leader, said at a press conference in New Delhi
yesterday. Modi has previously only won elections from his home
state of Gujarat in western India. </p>
<p>''Modi is trying to project himself as a pan-Indian leader,
not just a Gujarat leader,'' said A.S. Narang, professor of
political science at the New Delhi-based Indira Gandhi National
Open University. ''By fighting from Uttar Pradesh, Modi is also
trying to mobilize rank and file in this critical state.'' </p>
<p>Modi is contesting from Uttar Pradesh to galvanize
supporters in a region that is critical to his chances of being
the country''s next leader. Uttar Pradesh, a 900-kilometer (560-mile) swath of India stretching southeast from New Delhi, is the
country''s biggest political prize, supplying a seventh of all
lawmakers in the lower house of the national parliament. </p>
<p>Polls show Modi''s party winning the most seats in the
election while falling short of a majority in the lower house of
parliament. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh''s ruling Congress
party has seen its popularity slump while overseeing the slowest
economic growth in a decade in the nation of 1.2 billion people. </p>
<h2>Opinion Poll </h2>
<p>The BJP is on course to be the largest party in Uttar
Pradesh. The party will win 40 of the 80 available seats, up
from 10 currently, according to an opinion poll published by ABP
News television channel and Nielsen last month. In the past 15
national elections, only four times has the ruling party formed
a government without winning the most seats in Uttar Pradesh. </p>
<p>At present, Varanasi is represented by former BJP president
Murli Manohar Joshi, who has indicated his reluctance to
relocate, according to the Indian Express newspaper. Joshi will
now contest from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Kumar said. The BJP
President Rajnath Singh will contest the elections from Lucknow
in Uttar Pradesh, a seat once held by former BJP prime minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee. </p>
<p>Varanasi is where many Indians believe that anyone dying on
the banks of the river Ganges attains instant enlightenment and
a dip in the water atones for all sins. </p>
<p>Tourists from across the world come to the city, attracted
by the more than 100 ghats, or a paved flight of stairs leading
to the river bank, where pilgrims offer prayers. </p>

credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, declined 2.7 basis points to
65 basis points at 5:37 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That''s the steepest intraday decline
since March 4. </p>
<p>Investors pushed the index lower as factory production in
the U.S. rose in February by the most in six months, boosting
confidence that a firming U.S. economy will bolster companies''
ability to repay debt. The U.S. and the European Union imposed
sanctions on Russia in their worst dispute since the Cold War
after a vote paved the way for President Vladimir Putin to annex
Crimea from Ukraine. </p>
<p>''We know the economy is going in the right direction,''
William Larkin, a fixed-income money manager who helps oversee
about $500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Salem, Massachusetts. Investors are
''focusing on the economic fundamentals right now,'' he said.
''This whole thing with Russia is going to have a pretty limited
impact unless sanctions really become powerful.'' </p>
<p>The 0.8 percent gain at U.S. manufacturers followed a
revised 0.9 percent slump the prior month, figures from the
Federal Reserve in Washington showed today. The median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.3 percent
advance. Total industrial production rose 0.6 percent, more than
projected. </p>
<h2>Exxon Bonds </h2>
<p>The swaps gauge typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>Exxon issued $750 million of three-year, floating-rate
notes that yield 4 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate and $500 million of five-year, floating-rate debt that yields 15 basis points more than Libor, according

points more than benchmarks and $1.5 billion of 0.921 percent,
three-year notes with a relative yield of 15 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<h2>Fed Meeting </h2>
<p>Proceeds may be used to finance capital spending, for
acquisitions and to refinance commercial paper borrowings,
according to a regulatory filing today from the Irving, Texas-based company. Corporations sell commercial paper, typically
maturing in 270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such
as rent and salaries. </p>

<p>BlackRock Inc. (BLK) hired JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM)''s Christopher Jones as chief investment officer for stocks
in the Americas as the world''s biggest money manager seeks to
bolster its active equity business. </p>
<p>Jones, who was CIO for JPMorgan Asset Management''s growth
and small-cap U.S. equity team, will join New York-based
BlackRock in a few months as head of the active stock unit in
the Americas, according to an internal memo provided by
BlackRock and sent today to the firm''s employees. Jones, 53,
replaces Chris Leavy, who went on medical leave in June of last
year. He will also serve as global co-head of fundamental
equity, alongside Nigel Bolton, head of BlackRock''s European
equity team. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, who built
BlackRock through a series of acquisitions to manage $4.3
trillion, is seeking to improve fund performance in the stock
unit to attract assets amid a five-year rally in equities. A
push by Leavy to replace managers and focus on returns helped
BlackRock''s active U.S. stock funds beat 54 percent of rivals
last year. </p>
<p>''We have a great opportunity to take market share in many
areas of the actively managed business over the next few
years,'' Quintin Price, global head of active strategies, said
in the memo. ''I am sure Chris Jones''s arrival will help us
maximize our impact,'' said Price, who had been filling in for
Leavy on an interim basis. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan Replacement </h2>
<p>Jones managed strategies including JPMorgan''s $15.5 billion
Large Cap Growth Fund (OLGAX) and $1.2 billion Small Cap Growth Fund.
The retail shares of the large cap fund returned an annual 23
percent a year over the past five years, ahead of 82 percent of
similarly managed funds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The small cap one delivered 29 percent annually over
the past five years, beating 83 percent of peers. </p>
<p>After graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in
history in 1982, Jones joined Robert Fleming  Co. which was was
bought by Chase Manhattan in 2000. </p>
<p>Eytan Shapiro, who has worked on JPMorgan''s small cap team
since 1992, will take over as head of the growth team, according
to Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan.
Shapiro will report to Paul Quinsee, head of U.S. equity at
JPMorgan. </p>
<h2>Improving Performance </h2>
<p>Leavy, 42, joined BlackRock in 2010 from OppenheimerFunds
Inc. and in 2012 added oversight of the large-capitalization
stock funds previously led by former equity chief investment
strategist Robert Doll. Tasked with improving performance he
brought in money managers such as Bartlett Geer from Putnam
Investments LLC and UBS AG''s Lawrence Kemp. During his tenure
Leavy replaced managers at strategies that represented about 40
percent of the division''s $115 billion at the time. </p>
<p>While performance has picked up, BlackRock''s active U.S.
stock funds still trail 62 percent of peers on an annualized
basis in the three years ended Dec. 31,  according to Chicago-based research firm Morningstar Inc. </p>
<p>Clients pulled $15.4 billion from BlackRock''s active stock
funds last year, while depositing $74 billion into its exchange-traded funds, according to a company filing. Industrywide,
investors put $161 billion into equity mutual funds in 2013,
based on data from the Investment Company Institute. </p>
<h2>Continue Overseeing </h2>
<p>Price said in the memo that Leavy, who left in June to
treat his diabetes and a related cardiovascular condition, won''t
be returning to BlackRock this year. Leavy has been aware and
supportive of the plan to identify a new CIO if he couldn''t
return to his role, Price said. </p>
<p>In January, BlackRock said Bolton, also the CIO of
international fundamental equity, was facing a civil proceeding
by an Italian securities regulator alleging he used nonpublic
information to avoid losses for clients last year. A BlackRock
spokesman at the time said the firm had fully cooperated with
the regulator and conducted its own investigation and found no
evidence to support the regulator''s allegations. </p>
<p>Peter Stournaras will continue to oversee BlackRock''s
large-cap funds, such as the $1.8 billion BlackRock Large Cap
Core Fund and the $864 million BlackRock Large Cap Value Fund,
which he had co-managed with Leavy. </p>
<h2>Replicate Success </h2>
<p>Fink has said he hopes the equity unit can replicate the
success of BlackRock''s bond unit in improving performance and
attracting deposits. In 2012, the firm reorganized its bond
business to give unit heads Rick Rieder and Kevin Holt greater
autonomy and accountability. In 2013, BlackRock''s active bonds
attracted $10.4 billion, as fixed-income rivals such as Pacific
Investment Management Co. faced redemptions amid investor fears
of rising interest rates. </p>
<p>''We see a huge market for us in the active equity space,''
Fink said during a conference call with analysts in January.
''You have to start with performance before you can get
involved.'' </p>

<p>Emerging-market investors from Europe have mixed views on
Asia, according to Goldman Sachs. Defaults in China, where
Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science  Technology Co. failed to
fully pay a debt coupon earlier this month, are contributing to
caution, the analysts wrote. China bond funds extended their
longest streak of outflows since early in the third quarter of
2013 in the week to March 12, EPFR Global said in an e-mailed

<p>Risk appetite weakened amid slowing Chinese industrial
output and emerging-market uncertainty, Goldman Sachs said.

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) reached a
compromise with shareholders, saying it will split the roles of
chairman and chief executive officer in the future under what
the company called ''normal'' circumstances. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, amended
governance guidelines that already say the chairman will be an
independent director, unless the board decides ''the best
interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,''
according to a regulatory filing today. The change outlines
steps to be taken when the chairman isn''t independent. </p>
<p>The move averted a showdown at Disney''s annual meeting,
held today in Portland, Oregon, and led by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger. A group of investors had sought a
shareholder vote on a measure to let owners of 3 percent or more
of the stock nominate board candidates. That plan was withdrawn
after talks with the company, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The proposal was submitted by Hermes Equity Ownership
Services, the California State Teachers Retirement System and
the Connecticut Retirement Plans  Trust Funds, according to a
January filing by Burbank, California-based Disney. They cited
the board''s decision to make Iger chairman and CEO. </p>
<p>Connecticut ''expressly reserves its rights to re-file the
resolution for the 2015 proxy season, if the engagement between
the co-filers and Disney does not continue to demonstrate
transparency on board leadership issues,'' state Treasurer
Denise L. Nappier said in a statement. </p>
<h2>Annual Review </h2>
<p>In its filing today, Disney said that, when the chairman
isn''t independent, it will evaluate the arrangement annually and
include a written explanation in proxy materials. </p>
<p>Iger, 63, has been CEO since 2005 and added the role of
chairman in 2012. The board has turned back calls to split the
positions in previous years. Disney appointed an independent
chairman in 2004 amid a shareholder revolt against then-CEO
Michael Eisner. </p>
<p>At today''s meeting, investors voted 80 percent in favor of
the company''s executive compensation plan, an increase from less
than 60 percent the past two years. They also rejected a
shareholder proposal to limit accelerated executive pay in the
event of a change in control. </p>
<p>Iger earned $34.3 million in total compensation in fiscal
2013, a 15 percent decline as Disney failed to beat its targets
as handily as in the prior year. The company posted record sales
and profit for the third straight year. </p>
<h2>Adviser''s Take </h2>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an advisory firm,
recommended that investors back the executive pay plan this year
after suggesting they reject it in 2013. </p>
<p>''CEO pay and company performance are reasonably aligned
for the year in review, and CEO total pay decreased, for the
first time since 2009,'' ISS said in a Feb. 25 report. ''The
company has engaged with shareholders to seek input following
notable investor dissent to the say-on-pay proposal last year.'' </p>
<p>So-called say-on-pay proposals, required by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, give shareholders a
nonbinding advisory vote on executive pay. </p>
<p>At the meeting, Iger said the company plans a pirate-themed
land in Shanghai Disneyland when it opens at the end of 2015. He
announced a third installment to ''Cars,'' the Pixar film
series, and said the ''Star Wars'' picture scheduled for 2015
will take place 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi.'' </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.7 percent to $81.99 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 7.3 percent this year. </p>

<p>Financing arrangments in China
using commodities from copper to rubber as collateral to obtain
credit may be unwound in 12 to 24 months, driven by increased
yuan volatility, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>As much as 1 million metric tons of copper and 30 million
tons of iron ore could be released if the deals unwind, the bank
said in a report today. The unwinding would be bearish ''given
relatively limited physical liquidity to absorb the shock,''
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote. For now, the deals remain
profitable and an ''abrupt government crackdown'' on them is
unlikely given the potential effect on the country''s economic
growth, they wrote. </p>
<p>''Our view is that Chinese commodity financing deals will
gradually unwind over the medium term, driven by an increase in
foreign exchange hedging costs, which would slowly erode
financing deal profitability and eventually close the interest
rate arbitrage,'' the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>The transactions using commodities as collateral made as
much as $160 billion, or 31 percent of China''s total short-term
foreign-exchange loans, the report showed. Gold, copper and iron
ore are most commonly used as collateral, followed by soybeans,
palm oil, rubber, nickel, zinc and aluminum, the bank said. </p>
<h2>''Hot Money'' </h2>
<p>''We believe Chinese commodity financing deals are ongoing
and facilitating ''hot money'' inflows into China by providing a
mechanism to import low-cost foreign financing,'' the analysts
wrote. The deals ''create excess physical demand and tighten the
physical markets artificially; in contrast, an unwind creates
excess supply and thus is bearish to prices.'' </p>
<p>With the exception of iron ore, profitability of most
hedged arrangements remains ''substantial'' because of positive
yuan- and dollar-based interest-rate differentials, limited
depreciation of the yuan last month and abundant commodity
supply, which limits hedging costs, the bank said. Continued
weakening of the yuan may spur some of the deals to unwind
sooner than expected, it said. </p>
<p>China''s yuan had the biggest three-day decline since at
least 2007 on concern rising financial risks will weaken growth
in the world''s second-largest economy. The yuan has dropped 2.4
percent from a 20-year high of 6.0406 per dollar reached on Jan.
14, after strengthening 2.9 percent in 2013. </p>
<h2>1 Million Tons </h2>
<p>Returns from using copper as collateral are still more than
10 percent and up to 1 million tons of the metal may be tied to
such arrangements, Goldman Sachs said. That''s up from 500,000
tons nine months ago, it said. </p>
<p>Imports of copper and iron ore into China rose to records
in January on financing demand, before sliding in February as
the currency weakened and the state moved to rein in shadow
banking. About 40 percent of iron-ore stockpiles at Chinese
ports are linked to finance deals, Mysteel Research estimates. </p>
<p>Financing arrangements probably lie behind a surge in
Chinese gold imports from Hong Kong, Goldman Sachs said. The
deals involve physical imports of gold and exports of semi-fabricated products to bring foreign exchange into China,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>The number of commodities used for financing increased
since mid-2013 as the government cut the amount of money that
could be borrowed per commodity unit, Goldman Sachs said. Copper
financing may account for about $23 billion worth of short-term
foreign exchange loans, iron ore for $10.4 billion and soybeans
for $7.7 billion in a base case, the bank said. </p>

<p>Javier Martin-Artajo, the former
JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  Co. banker fighting U.S. extradition from Spain
over trading losses that surpassed $6.2 billion, is challenging
the U.K. financial regulator in London. </p>
<p>Martin-Artajo, who oversaw synthetic credit trading at the
bank''s chief investment office in London, filed the case against
the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority at a tribunal last week,
according to the court''s website. No other details about the
claim were available. </p>
<p>He was indicted in Manhattan federal court in September for
allegedly helping to hide losses caused by Bruno Iksil, the
Frenchman who became known as the London Whale. The U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a parallel lawsuit
that Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for
him, engaged in a scheme to enhance the portfolio''s apparent
performance and thereby curry favor with their supervisors. </p>
<p>Achilles Macris, who led the international CIO at New York-based JPMorgan during the losses, filed a separate challenge
against the FCA in October. Macris was ''deprived of the
opportunity of responding'' to the regulator regarding its
findings in the case, his lawyers said at the time. The
documents in both cases aren''t public. </p>
<p>The FCA fined JPMorgan 138 million pounds ($228 million) in
September and found that the CIO''s London management
deliberately misled them. Neither Macris nor Martin-Artajo were
mentioned by name in the regulator''s report on the fine, and
neither were accused of wrongdoing by the agency. </p>
<h2>Finance Tribunal </h2>
<p>Martin-Artajo''s cases were filed at a finance tribunal
which is limited to reviewing disputes involving challenges to
decisions by U.K. regulators. </p>
<p>Lara Joseph, a spokeswoman for the FCA, declined to
comment. Lista Cannon, a lawyer for Martin-Artajo in London, and
William Leone, his attorney in New York, didn''t immediately
respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Martin-Artajo, a Spanish citizen, asked a court in Madrid
in November not to extradite him because the alleged events
happened in the U.K. rather than the U.S., and because he has
roots in Spain. </p>
<p>Leone told a court in New York earlier this year that his
client isn''t a fugitive. Grout and Martin-Artajo have denied
wrongdoing, while Iksil is cooperating in the investigation. </p>
<p>The cases are SEC v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-05677, and U.S.

<p>Colombia''s benchmark peso bonds

<p>The price of peso bonds, or TES, maturing in 2024 climbed
1.955 centavos to 122.484 centavos per peso at the close in
Bogota trading, according to data from the central bank. Yields
plunged 24 basis points, or 0.24 percentage point, to 6.88

percent to 2,009.60 per U.S. dollar. </p>

may have a reduced weighting, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>''Investors are anticipating more inflows into the TES
market,'' Juan David Ballen, an analyst at Alianza Valores

<p>Colombia''s TES bonds will probably rally further, according
to Kenneth Lam, a Latin America currency and rates strategist at

<p>JPMorgan is selling amid concern among regulators that
banks could control prices if they own commodities as well as

month to pay $410 million to settle claims that it manipulated

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.

The Standard  Poor''s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials dropped last year for the first time since 2008. The gauge''s 100-day historic volatility fell to as low as 10.5 percent in April, from as much as 23.8 percent in January 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve said in July it might force insured lenders to get out of physical commodities, and JPMorgan agreed later that month to pay $410 million to settle claims that it manipulated power markets, without admitting wrongdoing. </p> <p>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment on the Coalition report. </p> <h2>Mercuria Purchase </h2> <p>JPMorgan said yesterday it''s selling its physical commodities unit to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. for $3.5 billion.

<p>Colombia''s peso posted the biggest
weekly gain among all of the world''s currencies on speculation
inflows will rise after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said it planned to
raise the country''s weighting on two of its indexes. </p>
<p>The peso appreciated 2.4 percent to 1,994.51 per U.S.
dollar this week, the most since June 2012. The currency fell
0.1 percent at the close of trading in Bogota today after the
central bank held the target lending rate at 3.25 percent. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said March 19 that it will probably more than
double the weighting of Colombia''s peso bonds in its GBI-EM
Global Diversified Index to 8.05 percent from 3.24 percent
starting May 30, citing the government''s effort to increase
access to foreigners. The index is used as a benchmark by firms
that manage around $195.7 billion, JPMorgan strategists
including Holly Huffman wrote in a separate report that day. </p>
<p>''The possible amount of portfolio inflows that could
arrive to Colombia is significant,'' Credit Suisse analyst Juan Lorenzo Maldonado wrote today in a research report to clients. </p>
<p>Public Credit Director Michel Janna said in an interview
last week that the nation may reduce a tax on foreigners'' bond
profits to less than 5 percent or eliminate it entirely.
Colombia chopped foreigners'' taxes to 14 percent from 33 percent
in January 2013 to spur demand and cut borrowing costs. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said that it will add Colombian peso bonds, or
TES, due in June 2016, November 2018, May 2022, July 2024 and
April 2028 to its index in a ''phased approach'' starting May 30
and ending Sept. 30. The bank will also include the securities
in its GBI-EM Global index, probably boosting the weighting to
5.6 percent from 1.81 percent. </p>
<h2>Dollar Purchases </h2>
<p>Colombia''s central bank announced today it will extend its
dollar purchase program to as much as $1 billion from April to
June. Policy makers had said the bank will buy as much as $1
billion in the first quarter. It bought $11.5 million today and
has purchased $542.5 million this year. </p>
<p>Policy makers left the overnight lending rate unchanged
today at 3.25 percent for a 12th straight month, as expected by
all 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The decision was
unanimous, central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe told reporters
in Bogota after the meeting. </p>
<p>The weighting increase ''can compensate to some degree the
impact that the adjustment in global liquidity has on the
exchange rate and interest rates in the Colombian market,'' the
central bank said in the statement. </p>
<p>The price of benchmark peso bonds maturing in 2024 climbed
0.545 centavo to 124.375 centavos per peso today, according to
data from the central bank. Yields fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 6.66 percent. They were down 46 basis
points for the week. </p>

<p>Bloomberg BNA '' Exxon Mobil Corp. has agreed to publish a report describing its plans for a future in which market forces and stricter climate regulation may leave some of its carbon reserves unburnable.</p><p>Exxon Mobil is the first oil and gas producer in the U.S. to commit to reporting on its risks of stranded assets due to climate change.</p><p>The commitment came in response to a shareholder resolution filed in the fall of 2013 by wealth management firm Arjuna Capital and shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. The resolution was withdrawn after months of negotiations with Exxon Mobil.</p><p>Investors have increasingly raised concerns that stranded assets, also known as a ''carbon bubble,'' could occur if fossil fuel reserves are suddenly revalued under future government policies for climate change or greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>In its report, Exxon Mobil will let shareholders know what types of reserves it holds''from deep sea drilling, tar sands or elsewhere''so that ''investors have a better idea of where the risks lie and how well the company can withstand those risks,'' Danielle Fugere, As You Sow''s president, told Bloomberg BNA.</p><p>''That kind of differentiation is important to shareholders as they decide which company to invest in,'' Fugere said.</p><p>The report will also discuss how climate risks could affect Exxon Mobil''s capital expenditure plans. The report will be posted on Exxon Mobil''s website by the end of March.</p><h2>Exxon Mobil''s Response
</h2><p>Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, said she was ''very impressed'' by Exxon Mobil''s responsiveness to the shareholder resolution.</p><p>''In the past, they''ve been seen as a climate denier,'' Lamb told Bloomberg BNA. Exxon Mobil seems to be making more of an effort to engage with shareholders on climate change and related issues, ''in part because you can only hide under a rock for so long,'' she said.</p><p>Lamb said Exxon Mobil made a ''big move'' recently when it disclosed to CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, that it has included a carbon proxy cost in its long-term business plans since 2007. Exxon Mobil is one of about 30 companies in the U.S. that put an internal price on carbon pollution.</p><p>''Exxon Mobil invests billions of dollars in energy projects which take decades to plan and execute,'' Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers told Bloomberg BNA in December. ''Although climate policies remain uncertain today, for the purposes of our business planning we assume that governments will continue to gradually adopt a wide variety of more stringent policies to help stem greenhouse gas emissions.''</p><p>Exxon Mobil declined to comment on the shareholder resolution.</p><h2>Setting Standard
</h2><p>The agreement with Exxon Mobil has the potential to set a standard for other energy companies in terms of what kind of information is important to investors, Fugere said.</p><p>About 10 energy companies, including Chevron Corp., Hess Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., have received similar shareholder resolutions on carbon asset risk so far during the 2014 proxy season. Discussions with these companies are ''in various stages,'' with some proposals leaning toward withdrawals, while many of the other resolutions will likely go to a vote, Fugere said.</p><p>As You Sow filed the first shareholder resolution on carbon asset risk with CONSOL Energy last proxy season. The resolution went to a vote and received about 20 percent support, which is considered high among shareholder resolutions.</p><p>Since then, CONSOL has divested nearly half of its carbon-heavy coal holdings in favor of less carbon-intensive natural gas, which Fugere said is an indication of where the energy market is going.</p><p>''Companies need to acknowledge that preparing for a low-carbon future is a necessity, not a choice,'' she said.</p><p>For more about Bloomberg BNA, click here.</p><p>', 'Exxon Mobil Agrees to Report on Plans''For Low-Carbon Future, Carbon Risks', 'By Andrea Vittorio', 'Mar 21, 2014  1:23 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-21/exxon-mobil-agrees-to-report-on-plans-for-low-carbon-future-carbon-risks.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>The forint will probably drop to a
two-year low after Hungary''s central bank cut interest rates to
a record, pushing bond yields to a level that doesn''t compensate
investors for currency risk, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>The forint, which depreciated 5.1 percent this year to
313.21 per euro, will probably slide toward 320, which would be
the weakest since January 2012, New York- and London-based
analysts Themistoklis Fiotakis and Magdalena Polan wrote in an
e-mailed note yesterday. Hungarian policy makers will probably
signal an end to easing after a 10 basis-point cut next week and
won''t increase rates in the coming months, they wrote. </p>
<p>The forint''s slump was caused by a reduction in Federal
Reserve stimulus and the crisis in Ukraine and is beyond the
government''s control, Hungary''s Economy Minister Mihaly Varga
said in an interview with Gazdasagi Radio on March 18. Hungarian
bonds yield an average 286 basis points above U.S. Treasuries,
compared with an emerging-market average of 315, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. </p>
<p>''Recent statements by Hungarian officials argue that there
still may be some way to go before tolerance to currency
depreciation runs out,'' the analysts wrote. ''Dovish surprises
are likely to maintain the tightening pressure on local currency
premia and bring EUR/HUF to 320.'' </p>
<p>Derivatives trading shows there is a 38 percent chance the
forint will weaken past 320 per euro in the next year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The probability it will
strengthen to 300 is 30 percent. The forint decline this year is
the fourth-worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, following the Argentine peso, the Russian
ruble and Chile''s peso. </p>
<h2>Fed, Ukraine </h2>
<p>A gauge of 20 emerging-market currencies has fallen 1.5
percent in 2014. The Fed voted on March 19 to reduce its bond-purchase program to $55 billion a month. Russian President
Vladimir Putin signed legislation today to complete the process
of Crimea''s accession to Russia. The move is against the wishes
of Ukraine, last month ousted pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Yanukovych. </p>
<p>Magyar Nemzeti Bank cut its benchmark rate to a record 2.7
percent last month in 19 consecutive steps. The Monetary Policy
Council will probably cut the rate by 10 basis points next week,
in line with Goldman''s estimate, according to the median of 22
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The forint is vulnerable because the extra yield on
Hungary''s local-currency bonds over hard currency-denominated
assets offer little or no reward, the Goldman analysts wrote. </p>
<h2>Local Spread </h2>
<p>The yield on securities included in the Bloomberg Hungary
Local Sovereign Bond Index are 54 basis points below the
constituents of an index of Hungary''s dollar-denominated bonds.
That compares with a premium of as much as 200 basis points on
forint-denominated bonds before the monetary easing started in
2012. </p>
<p>Economic policy will have to adapt to a weak forint after
Hungary''s April 6 parliamentary election, said Varga, whose
Fidesz party is poised to win the vote according to all opinion
polls. The next administration should strengthen export-oriented
industries to exploit the currency''s weakness, rather than
trying to influence the exchange rate, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and directors
including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon were sued by an
investor for creating ''a culture of lawlessness'' that led to
billions of dollars in settlements tied to mortgage-backed
securities and Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Under Dimon''s leadership, the New York-based company sold
low-quality residential mortgage-backed securities, failed to
report questionable activity by Madoff, manipulated energy
markets and engaged in fraudulent credit-card billing
strategies, the Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund said in
papers filed March 17 in Delaware Chancery Court and partly
unsealed yesterday. </p>
<p>Dimon, CEO since December 2005 and chairman since December
2006, ''knowingly, recklessly, or with gross negligence created
a culture of lawlessness'' that resulted in fines, penalties
settlements and related costs totaling at least $20 billion last
year, the fund said. At the same time, Dimon received a
74 percent pay raise to $20 million. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, agreed in
November to a $13 billion settlement of government allegations
that it misled investors and public when it sold bonds backed by
faulty residential mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed
JPMorgan''s actions for helping to cause the credit crisis that
led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. </p>

<p>Analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are abandoning their
sell ratings on Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) as the stock
posts its best quarterly rally since 2005. </p>
<p>All three banks raised their recommendations on Teva, the
world''s biggest maker of generic drugs, to neutral from sell in
the past two weeks as the stock soared to a three-year high in
New York trading. The analysts said the company is making
progress in its push to maintain market share of its best-selling drug Copaxone while a boom in mergers and acquisitions
in the industry yields deals of as much as $21 billion. </p>
<p>Shares of Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva have rallied 23
percent this year. The stock, the biggest investment in
billionaire George Soros''s fund, is the third-best performer on
the Market Vectors U.S. Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Price Index
after trailing the 21 other companies in the measure in 2013.
Mounting concern about the company''s leadership and growth
outlook has sent Teva''s valuation to 11 times estimated
earnings, the second-lowest multiple among 15 global generic
drug makers tracked by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''The upgrades are not saying everything is great but, at
the valuation it got to'' investors are reconsidering their
positions, Jacob de Tusch-Lec, who helps oversee about $23
billion in equities at Artemis Investment Management LLP in
London, said by phone on March 20. ''Essentially things have not
gotten worse.'' </p>
<h2>Weekly Rally </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index rose 2.5 percent to
119.39 last week, the most since Feb. 14, extending its gain
this year to 7.3 percent. The TA-25 Index advanced 0.7 percent
at today''s close in Israel, extending its 2014 advance to 4.7
percent. </p>
<p>Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, Lauren Bellmare at Morgan Stanley, and Amanda Smith at JPMorgan
declined to comment on their analysts'' reports. Denise Bradley,
a spokeswoman for Teva in North Wales, Pennsylvania, didn''t
respond to an e-mailed request for comment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has been advising clients to buy Mylan Inc. (MYL), the
biggest U.S. generic-drug maker, since October 2007. The shares
have more than tripled since then. Morgan Stanley rated Perrigo
Co. (PRGO), a maker of generic over-the-counter medicines, the
equivalent of buy on Feb. 4, 2013, before a 50 percent rally. </p>
<p>Teva converted 8.7 percent of 20-milligram Copaxone
prescriptions to its 40-milligram version in the week ended Feb.
28, according to Bloomberg Industries. Leerink Partners and
Cowen  Co. analysts said the results mean the company may
deliver on its plan to get 30 percent to 50 percent of patients
on the three-times-weekly injection. </p>
<h2>$4 Billion </h2>
<p>Moving patients to the new version is key because the
remaining U.S. patent on the $4 billion-drug expires at the end
of May, while the new version will be protected from generic
competition until 2030. Teva''s next hurdle will be persuading
insurers in the U.S. to continue paying for the branded, three-times-a-week shot once a cheaper copycat of the daily version
becomes available. </p>
<p>Fifteen out of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg
recommend buying Teva''s shares, the highest level since
September. Thirteen analysts have a hold rating, while one says
sell, the data showed. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 172.60
shekels, or the equivalent of $49.54, today in Tel Aviv. </p>
<p>A wave of mergers and acquisitions among generic drug
companies has also triggered a rally in Teva''s shares, according
to Jason Kolbert, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC. </p>
<p>Actavis Plc (ACT) agreed to purchase Forest Laboratories Inc. for
$25 billion last month, and Mylan Inc. Chief Executive Heather Bresch said Feb. 27 that the generic-drug maker may make a large
acquisition this year. Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh said
March 4 that Teva is open for deals as the pace of industry
consolidation quickens. </p>
<h2>''Hot Topic'' </h2>
<p>''The acquisition of generic companies has now become a
very hot topic,'' Kolbert, who has a buy rating for Teva, said
in a March 20 phone interview from New York. Actavis'' purchase
was a ''gift'' for the Israeli drugmaker, he said. ''That was
the trigger that got people focusing on Teva.'' </p>
<p>Soros Fund Management LLC, the family office of billionaire
George Soros, boosted its stake in Teva in the last three months
of 2013, making the Israeli drugmaker its largest holding in the
fourth quarter. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy Maker
Studios, a supplier of online video content to YouTube, for $500
million, gaining technology and experience with short-form
entertainment. </p>
<p>Disney also agreed to pay as much as $450 million more if
Maker Studios meets ''strong'' performance targets, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. That could
boost the total to $950 million. </p>
<p>With Maker Studios, Disney is following DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) into an online video business with expanding
audiences and little profit. DreamWorks Animation, producer of
the ''Shrek'' movies, bought AwesomenessTV, a smaller competitor
of Maker Studios, for $33 million plus as much as $117 million
in incentives last year. The online outlets could help media
companies build awareness for films and TV shows. </p>
<p>''Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace
and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this
dynamic industry with an unmatched combination of advanced
technology and programming expertise and capabilities,''''Robert A. Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said in
the statement. </p>
<p>With more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and
5.5 billion views a month on Google Inc.''s YouTube, Culver City,
California-based Maker has established itself as one of the top
online video networks for young audiences, Disney said. </p>

networks,'' Mike Vorhaus, a technology consultant at Magid
Advisors, said in an interview. ''There are a ton of eyeballs
and the content isn''t expensive to produce. There just hasn''t
been a lot of meaningful profit yet.'' </p>
<p>The acquisition is one of the biggest for Disney, the
world''s largest entertainment company, since the $4 billion
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. In the online space, Maker
could potentially exceed the $563.2 million Disney spent in 2010
on mobile game maker Playdom. Disney paid $350 million in 2007
for Club Penguin online world. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.4 percent to $79.84 in extended trading at

fell 1.1 percent to $79.49 at the close and has gained 4 percent
this year. </p>

financial officer, according to the statement. The online
company was founded in 2009, according to a regulatory filing. </p>

<p>Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is

be responsible for the Disney channels, the ABC broadcast
network and the ABC Family cable channel. </p>
<p>''Ben is one of those unique executives who combine rich
creative experience with great business acumen,'' Iger said in
the statement. ''He''s also focused, strategic and competitive.'' </p>
<p>After being named ABC News president in December 2010,
Sherwood oversaw ''Good Morning America'' as it surpassed NBC''s
''Today'' show in viewers and narrowed the ratings gap between
ABC''s ''World News'' and NBC''s ''Nightly News'' in the evening. </p>
<p>An ABC News partnership with Yahoo! Inc. under Sherwood
boosted the news division''s online exposure and he helped
developed Fusion, a cable-TV channel joint venture with
Univision Communications Inc. that targets English-speaking
Latinos with news and lifestyle programming. </p>
<h2>Disney''s Largest </h2>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, fell 1.1
percent to $79.49 at the close in New York. The stock has risen
4 percent this year. </p>
<p>The media networks division, led by ESPN and the Disney-branded channels, is Disney''s largest, generating $6.82 billion
in operating income, 64 percent of the company''s total, in the
most recent fiscal year. </p>
<p>Sweeney, 56, announced plans on March 11 to leave Disney
before the contest heats up to replace Iger, who plans to retire
in June 2016. Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and parks
division head Thomas Staggs have been mentioned frequently by
analysts as leading contenders. </p>
<p>Under Sweeney''s direction, the Disney Channel quintupled
its subscriber base. She supervised the introduction of related
channels, including Disney XD, aimed at boys, and Disney Junior,
targeting preschoolers. In 2005, ABC became the first network to
make its shows available at Apple Inc.''s iTunes store. </p>
<p>Like other broadcast networks, ABC has struggled with
declining viewership of traditional television as consumers turn
to cable TV and Web-based options such as Netflix Inc. </p>
<p>For the television season that started in September, ABC is
averaging 7.42 million viewers in prime-time, a decline of 5.1

<p>A senior member of India''s main
opposition party said he''d run as an independent in next month''s
election after being passed over for a seat, underscoring leader
Narendra Modi''s challenge in keeping members unified. </p>
<p>Jaswant Singh, a former BJP finance and foreign affairs
minister, filed to contest as an independent candidate from
Barmer constituency in the western Indian state of Rajasthan.
Singh, 76, was a founding member of the party and represented it
in parliament for more than three decades. </p>
<p>''The BJP has humiliated some of the older, more educated,
and urbane members of the party,'' said Neera Chandhoke, a
retired professor of politics at Delhi University. ''What you
are left with is a more hardcore Hindu party that may turn up
some voters, particularly outside of northern India.'' </p>
<p>Singh''s departure exposes a generational divide within the
BJP that threatens to derail Modi''s efforts to attract allies to
form a stable government and pass measures to bolster India''s
economy. Opinion polls show the party winning the most seats
while falling short of a majority. </p>
<p>The BJP on March 21 fielded Sonaram Choudhary, who recently
defected from the ruling Congress party, as its candidate from
Barmer. Singh then urged party workers to differentiate between
the ''real BJP'' and ''fake BJP.'' </p>
<p>''They decided to go for somebody who jumped the styles and
walked into the party,'' Singh, who had helped draft the BJP''s
election manifesto, said yesterday. ''I feel greatly aggrieved
and that has forced me to take the step that I did.'' </p>
<h2>''Pained'' </h2>
<p>Sushma Swaraj, the party''s most senior leader in the lower
house of parliament, said she was ''pained'' at the decision to
deny Singh a ticket. </p>
<p>''It would have been better if this situation had not
arisen and he didn''t go to that extent,'' Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, a
BJP spokesman, said in New Delhi yesterday. ''If he goes, the
party cannot do anything.'' </p>
<p>The BJP is on course to win 195 of 543 seats up for grabs
in the lower house of parliament, according to an opinion poll
released March 14 by NDTV Television channel and Hansa Research.
The ruling Congress party, in power for a decade, may get 106
seats, its worst-ever performance, the poll indicated. </p>
<p>''They have been disrespectful and dishonorable to the
principles of the party,'' Singh said at a rally in Barmer
yesterday. ''The manner in which the decision was taken reeks of
plain dictatorship.'' </p>
<h2>BJP Veterans </h2>
<p>Other BJP veterans have also expressed displeasure during
the process to select candidates for the election. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lal Krishna Advani, a former home
minister and deputy prime minister, expressed anger after the
party slotted him to run in Modi''s state of Gujarat against his
wishes. Advani, who led the campaign of BJP in 2004 and 2009
elections, said on March 20 he was ''deeply touched'' when the
party said he could contest wherever he wanted. </p>
<p>Murli Manohar Joshi, a former BJP president, was also
unhappy that he had to give up his seat in Varanasi for Modi,
who wanted to contest from one of Hinduism''s holiest cities, the
Indian Express reported, citing unidentified sources. Joshi will
contest from Kanpur, another seat in Uttar Pradesh, the
country''s most populous state. </p>

<p>Fang Fang, JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co.''s
chief executive officer of investment banking for China, is
leaving after more than 12 years at the firm. </p>
<p>The 48-year-old banker told New York-based JPMorgan that he
wanted to retire, according to an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News today. Frank Gong was named chairman of China
investment banking in the message from Therese Esperdy, co-head
of Asia-Pacific banking at the firm. Marie Cheung, a spokeswoman

<p>The U.S. is protesting Saudi
Arabia''s denial of a visa to a Jerusalem Post journalist who
wants to cover President Barack Obama''s visit there this week. </p>
<p>A journalist''s employer shouldn''t ''count against their
ability to do their job,'' Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said at a briefing today. He said the U.S. reached out
through ''multiple channels'' to protest the denial. </p>
<p>Michael Wilner, White House correspondent for the Jerusalem
Post, was the only member of the White House press corps
traveling with Obama this week to be denied a visa by Saudi
Arabia, the White House Correspondents Association said today in
an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Wilner planned to cover only the Saudi Arabia part of
Obama''s six-day trip, which also includes stops in the
Netherlands, Belgium and the Vatican, the group said. In Saudi
Arabia, Obama plans to discuss Syria, Iran and the Mideast peace
talks. </p>
<p>''The denial is an affront not only to this journalist, but
to the entire White House press corps and to the principle of
freedom of the press that we hold so dear,'' Steve Thomma, the
group''s president, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Wilner is a U.S. citizen and is Jewish, according to an
article in the Jerusalem Post online today. </p>

<p>When former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
executive Mike Cavanagh arrives at Carlyle Group LP (CG) this summer,
he''ll be asked to expand a firm that''s fallen behind rivals even
as it delivers some of the best returns in private equity. </p>
<p>Carlyle, the second-largest manager of alternative
investments such as private-equity funds and real estate, has
increased its assets at a 13 percent annual rate in the past two
years, the slowest pace among peers, according to calculations
by Bloomberg. Blackstone Group LP (BX), the largest private-equity
manager, expanded at a 26 percent pace, the same as KKR  Co.
and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) grew at a 46 percent rate. </p>
<p>Cavanagh, 48, until today co-chief of investment banking at
JPMorgan and a close deputy to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, will need to find ways to further diversify Carlyle from
private equity and expand assets. He will share a co-president
role with Glenn Youngkin, a 19-year veteran of the firm,
Washington-based Carlyle said in a statement. </p>
<p>Youngkin, 47, who became chief operating officer in 2011,
has spent the past three years deciding which businesses Carlyle
should enter and which it shouldn''t, a role Cavanagh will share
as the firm''s founders seek ways to give more daily
responsibilities to deputies. The move puts two executives in
their late-40s in charge of running the buyout firm underneath
its three billionaire founders, Bill Conway, Dan D''Aniello and
David Rubenstein, who are in their mid-60s. </p>
<h2>''Fresh Perspectives'' </h2>
<p>Cavanagh ''will help ensure that Carlyle continues to
innovate and grow for another quarter-century,'' Conway and
Rubenstein, the firm''s co-CEOs, said in the statement. The
executives, who started Carlyle in 1987 with D''Aniello, expect
Cavanagh''s hire to ''enable fresh perspectives in an environment
that embraces change.'' </p>
<p>Carlyle fell 1 percent to close at $31.35 in New York as
JPMorgan declined 0.2 percent to $60.93. </p>
<p>Carlyle''s stock has trailed rivals, gaining 2.1 percent in
the past 12 months, compared with 67 percent at Blackstone, 42
percent at Apollo and 24 percent at KKR. Blackstone, Apollo and
KKR are all based in New York. </p>
<p>Adena Friedman, Carlyle''s chief financial officer, said on
a February call with investors that expenses have increased as
the firm hires for fundraising and makes strategic purchases to
boost revenue. Carlyle last year agreed to acquire Diversified
Global Asset Management Co. to broaden its hedge-fund offerings,
bought Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management LLC as a
property fund-of-funds operation, and added the remaining 40
percent of Dutch investment manager AlpInvest Partners NV. </p>
<h2>High Expenses </h2>
<p>''We should expect the fact that our expenses will grow,''
Friedman said on the Feb. 19 call. ''But so should our revenues.
When we make investments in new initiatives and new funds, we do
try to make sure that we do it properly, but it should result in
revenue growth for us.'' </p>
<p>Even with recent acquisitions, Carlyle relies more on
leveraged buyout profits, which are produced in lumpy intervals,
and less on predictable management fees than its peers,
according to Morgan Stanley analyst Matt Kelley in New York.
Public investors put a higher value on stable fees, which can
keep analysts and investors ''on the sidelines,'' he said in a
January note to clients. </p>
<p>As a result, Carlyle plans to start three new investment
strategies a year on average, Youngkin said in November at the
firm''s first investor day. Rapid expansion is ''part of the
game'' that Blackstone, Apollo and KKR are also engaged in, said
Youngkin, who until now has largely overseen the rollout of new
business lines. </p>
<h2>''Great Hire'' </h2>
<p>Cavanagh and Carlyle began talks over a potential role in
the second half of last year, according to a person familiar
with the discussions, who requested anonymity to discuss private
plans. </p>
<p>''It''s a great hire for Carlyle,'' Chris Kotowski, an
analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York, said of Cavanagh''s
move in a telephone interview. ''He''s an incredibly competent
and versatile manager.'' </p>
<p>Chris Ullman, a Carlyle spokesman, declined to comment on
Cavanagh''s role beyond the statement. </p>
<p>Carlyle said Cavanagh will be a member of its executive
group, currently a six-person committee that makes strategic
decisions for the firm. He joins the three founders, Youngkin,
Friedman and Jeff Ferguson, the company''s general counsel. </p>
<p>Carlyle earlier this month hired former General Motors Co.
CEO Dan Akerson as vice chairman of the board, under Chairman
D''Aniello. Akerson was head of global buyouts and co-head of
U.S. buyouts at the firm before joining GM in 2009 after its
rescue by the U.S. government. </p>
<h2>Lee, Chappuis </h2>
<p>In November, Carlyle looked outside the firm for a deputy
chief investment officer under Conway, hiring Kewsong Lee from
private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. Lee had been at New
York-based Warburg Pincus for 21 years and was instrumental in
dozens of deals, including the buyout of Neiman Marcus Group. </p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Jacques Chappuis left Morgan Stanley
to run Carlyle''s funds-of-funds business. Chappuis was hired to
expand the solutions group in the same way Mitch Petrick, who
joined the firm from Morgan Stanley in 2010, was asked to build
Carlyle''s Global Markets Strategies unit, which manages more
than $35 billion in hedge-fund and structured-credit
investments. </p>
<p>As of Dec. 31, the buyout firm had invested in more than
470 corporate transactions, returned an average of 30 percent
annually to investors, and oversaw almost $189 billion. </p>

Tiffany Galvin, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, said the New York-based firm has no comment beyond last week''s memo. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs has played kingmaker before in the exchange industry. It was an early investor in IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. and was among the firm''s largest shareholders when it went public in 2005. Atlanta-based ICE, which now owns the New York Stock Exchange, has grown to become the world''s second-biggest bourse owner by market value at $23 billion. Goldman Sachs was also a shareholder of Direct Edge Holdings LLC, which merged this year with Bats Global Markets Inc. to form an exchange operator with about 20 percent of American volume. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy Maker
Studios, a supplier of online video content to YouTube, for at
least $500 million, gaining technology and experience with
short-form entertainment. </p>
<p>Disney also agreed to pay as much as $450 million more if
Maker Studios meets ''strong'' performance targets, according to
a statement yesterday by the Burbank, California-based company.
That could boost the total to $950 million. </p>
<p>With Maker Studios, Disney is following DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) into an online video business with expanding
audiences and little profit. DreamWorks Animation, producer of
the ''Shrek'' movies, bought AwesomenessTV, a smaller competitor
of Maker Studios, for $33 million plus as much as $117 million
in incentives last year. The online outlets could help media
companies build awareness for films and TV shows. </p>
<p>''Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace
and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this
dynamic industry with an unmatched combination of advanced
technology and programming expertise and capabilities,''''Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
statement. </p>
<p>With more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and
5.5 billion views a month on Google Inc.''s YouTube, Culver City,
California-based Maker has established itself as one of the top
online-video networks for young audiences, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Online Space </h2>
<p>''There is a lot of good happening in digital video
networks,'' Mike Vorhaus, a technology consultant at Magid
Advisors, said in an interview. ''There are a ton of eyeballs
and the content isn''t expensive to produce. There just hasn''t
been a lot of meaningful profit yet.'' </p>
<p>The acquisition is one of the biggest for Disney, the
world''s largest entertainment company, since the $4 billion
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. In the online space, Maker
could potentially exceed the $563.2 million Disney spent in 2010
on mobile game maker Playdom. Disney paid $350 million in 2007
for the kids'' social network Club Penguin. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.4 percent to $79.84 in extended trading after
the deal was announced yesterday. The stock fell 1.1 percent to
$79.49 at the close in New York and has gained 4 percent this
year. </p>
<p>Maker Studios will report to Jay Rasulo, Disney''s chief
financial officer, according to the statement. The online
company was founded in 2009, according to a regulatory filing. </p>

<p>Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), Mexico''s
biggest broadcaster, rose to the highest since at least 1994 on

<p>Televisa shares rose 2.8 percent to 85.33 pesos at 11:16
a.m. in Mexico City, making it the best performer on Mexico''s

almost 70 percent of broadcast viewers, to benefit from rules
that would require America Movil''s Telmex subsidiary to wait at
least two years before applying for pay television licenses. </p>
<p>''If America Movil enters that sector it will be very
competitive,'' Valeria Romo, an analyst with Banco Monex SA,
said in a phone interview from Mexico City. ''In the short term,
Televisa can propel growth in television.'' </p>
<p>America Movil, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, has
fallen 5.2 percent since President Enrique Pena Nieto announced
the proposal March 24, the biggest two-day decline since August.
Mexico City-based Televisa rose 3.8 percent in that time. </p>
<p>The proposed restrictions on America Movil stem from the
government''s efforts to clamp down on its dominance in the
telecommunications industry, where it services 70 percent of
Mexico''s mobile-phone users and 80 percent of fixed lines. </p>
<p>The restriction on America Movil ''opens Televisa up to
participate in other sectors of telecommunications'' as it
maintains its TV strategy, Romo said. ''The regulation in media
is less aggressive than in telecommunications.'' </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he will ''hold nothing back'' to get the company''s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker''s longtime focus on its Windows operating system. </p> <p>At his first public speech since taking the CEO job last month, Nadella unveiled Office software for Apple Inc.''s iPad, the first time Microsoft is putting the popular productivity programs onto the tablet. Nadella also said the company''s goal is to get its Internet-based Office 365 service on any gadget, even if it reduces sales of Windows-based personal computers or other products. </p> <p>''It''s not a tradeoff, because it''s about going where customers are going,'' Nadella said after the company event in San Francisco. ''It''s not about today''s share position based on today''s form factors, because in the full arc of time there will be many new platforms that will require Office, from small screens to large screens.'' </p> <p>Nadella is presiding over Microsoft''s shift to a more open approach. While former CEO Steve Ballmer kept more of a focus on Windows, including pushing the operating system onto smartphones, Nadella is indicating that he proactively wants to get Microsoft software onto Apple''s iOS and Google Inc.''s Android-based gadgets. Since Apple and Android devices dominate in mobile, Microsoft risks having its software locked out if it can''t sell its programs for those platforms. </p> <h2>New Sheriff </h2> <p>''There is a new sheriff in town,'' Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note about Nadella''s presentation. ''We believe the Office for iPad was a major positive step in the right direction and signals a strategic change at Microsoft.'' Ives has the equivalent of a hold on the stock. </p> <p>Microsoft shares fell 1 percent to $39.36 at the close in New York. </p> <p>Office for iPad, which now includes Word, PowerPoint and Excel, also heralds a new business model for the software, which has been a paid product. Now users will be able to view their Office documents for free on their iPad, though to edit or create documents they will need to pay $99 a year for a subscription to Office 365. </p> <p>Last year, Microsoft released paid versions of Office apps for the iPhone, which required a subscription to Office 365. That product cost $99.99 a year for a home version that works on five devices and $69.99 for a version that works for just one computer and one tablet. </p> <p>''We''re excited that Office is coming to iPad '' now part of the more than 500,000 apps designed specifically for iPad,'' said Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple. </p> <h2>Mobile, Cloud </h2> <p>On his first day as CEO, Nadella emphasized the Redmond, Washington-based company''s focus on devices and Web-based cloud services and said those priorities would ''define Microsoft going forward.'' </p> <p>At the event today, Nadella reiterated that the intersection of mobile and cloud is the ''most critical,'' though he added that it was just ''one aspect of our overall strategy.'' </p> <p>He also rolled out technology to enable developers to create what he called a ''cloud for everyone on every device.'' </p> <p>Nadella said Windows remains ''a massive agenda for us'' and the company plans to innovate with the operating system. The CEO said Microsoft will unveil more of its strategy as soon as next week at its Build developer conference in San Francisco, where Windows will be front and center. </p> <h2>Bigger Opportunity </h2> <p>''Microsoft is in the process of migrating the lion''s share of its business to the cloud and subscription,'' Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients last week. </p> <p>The iPad version of Office, a suite of software that includes Microsoft''s Word, Excel, Outlook and other programs, may add $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue a year, Moerdler said. </p> <p>Microsoft is taking a risk by asking people to pay $99 a year to edit, rather than just look at, their documents, said Milind Gadekar, CEO of CloudOn Inc., which makes a free mobile application that lets users access and edit their Office documents on mobile devices. </p> <p>''Consumers expect editing to be free,'' he said. ''You have to find other advanced features to charge for.'' </p> <p>Milind said that while Microsoft is becoming more open, its new strategy still requires Office 365 users to use its OneDrive online storage system, rather than popular alternatives such as Dropbox, Box.net and Evernote. </p> <h2>Productivity Programs </h2> <p>Still, consumers are spending more than twice as much time using mobile productivity apps than they did a year ago, according to research measuring usage between January and March by Flurry, a mobile analytics firm which tracked usage on both phones and tablets. </p> <p>''Microsoft''s announcement of Office for iPad couldn''t be more timely,'' the company said in a blog post. ''In fact, it can define Microsoft and its newly appointed CEO''s tenure in the post-PC world.'' The study included phones and tablets with both iOS and Android. ''This growth rate eclipsed all other categories including Messaging, Games and News.'' </p> <p>Asked if selling Office on other devices would cause big changes in sales of Windows-based PCs, phones and tablets, Nadella said at the event, ''I would leave it to Wall Street to do the analysis, but we are going after huge opportunities that are ahead of us.'' </p> <p>', 'Microsoft CEO Unveils Office for IPad in Mobile-App Push', 'By Dina Bass and Peter Burrows', 'Mar 27, 2014  5:20 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-27/microsoft-ceo-unveils-office-for-ipad-in-mobile-app-push.html') LIMIT 1;

making acquisitions is emboldening management to execute deals,
spurring a mergers and acquisitions boom, according to Michael Carr, co-head of Americas MA at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Shareholders have been embracing the acquiring companies,
Carr said today at the 26th annual Tulane University Corporate
Law Institute in New Orleans, signaling faith in the lasting
value of transactions as well as challenging the conventional
wisdom that they should brace for a selloff. </p>
<p>Public U.S. companies worth more than $1 billion have risen
an average of 5.2 percent in 2014 the day after announcing they
are acquiring a target, a reversal from the 1.9 percent one-day
decline buyers experienced five years ago, according to data
from Goldman Sachs. Almost 75 percent of acquiring companies
have gone up following deal announcements in the fourth quarter
of 2013 and the first quarter this year. </p>
<p>''This is all about shareholder sentiment,'' Carr said.
''Shareholders are accepting the companies'' view of synergies
and cost savings, and they''re giving a lot more credit than they
did.'' </p>
<p>There have been more than 6,500 deals announced globally in
the year to date, valued at almost $650 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That''s the most volume in the first
three months of the year since the first quarter of 2007, when
volume reached $960 billion, the data show. </p>
<p>The first-quarter volume reflects a 28 percent jump from
the year-earlier quarter, and a 12 percent increase from the
fourth quarter of 2013. </p>
<h2>Strategic Shift </h2>
<p>More companies are shifting toward strategic MA in 2014
and away from financial engineering, such as share buybacks,
Carr said. </p>
<p>Comcast Corp.''s $45.2 billion agreement to buy Time Warner
Cable Inc. was the largest announced in the first three months
of the year, topping a failed hostile bid from Charter
Communications Inc. Actavis Plc''s $21 billion offer for
drugmaker Forest Laboratories Inc. and Facebook Inc.''s $19
billion takeover of mobile messaging service WhatsApp Inc.
followed the cable combination to round out the quarter''s top
three acquisitions. </p>
<p>This year''s deals have been motivated by ''expansion of
market presence and consolidation,'' rather than many of 2013''s
biggest takeovers, which were ''clean-up trades,'' Carr said. </p>
<p>Comcast Corp.''s buyout of the remainder of NBCUniversal
from General Electric Co., and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)''s
acquisition of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group Plc were two
2013 deals driven by financial concerns and cheap debt, rather
than ''building influence in their particular industries,'' Carr
said. </p>
<p>''The character of the market feels different than a good
part of 2013.'' </p>
<h2>Shareholder Sentiment </h2>
<p>While the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index has gained more than
65 percent since September 2011, earnings growth has risen just
14 percent in the same time period, indicating the market is
expecting profits to rise from deals, he said. This supports
deal advisers, who must count on shareholder sentiment to propel
future acquisitions, Carr said. It''s ''very, very hard for MA
activity to pick up'' without that optimism, he said. </p>
<p>Comcast''s Time Warner Cable acquisition, the largest U.S.
cable deal since Comcast''s $72 billion merger with ATT
Broadband in 2001, helped propel Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to the top rankings for fees for the quarter, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley advised Time Warner Cable and JPMorgan
advised Comcast, according to the press release announcing that
deal. Bankers earned about $143 million on that merger, the
third-largest payday for any deal since 2009, according to New
York-based research firm Freeman  Co. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has advised on 58 deals this year, valued at
more than $215 billion, followed by JPMorgan''s $162 billion for
59, the data show. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs landed in third place for advising on
$132 billion of deals, it worked on more transactions than
either bank, at 77. Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc rounded out
the top five. </p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin said
Russia must develop its own payments network, with companies
that blocked some transactions following U.S. sanctions on
Russian individuals and a bank at risk of losing market share. </p>
<p>''This wasn''t our decision,'' Putin said at a meeting with
lawmakers outside Moscow today, adding that developing a
domestic system will take time. ''We need to defend our
interests. And we''ll do that.'' </p>
<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) stopped processing cards for
Bank Rossiya after the U.S. placed the lender on its sanctions
list. SMP Bank, which also had its cards blocked by the two
biggest card networks, said March 23 that services would resume
soon. SMP Bank''s co-owners Arkady Rotenberg and brother Boris
were also hit with sanctions. </p>
<p>The sanctions prohibit U.S. firms or individuals from doing
business with Bank Rossiya, the U.S. Treasury said on its
website on March 20. Russia''s 17th biggest lender has about $10
billion in assets, ''numerous relationships'' with banks in the
U.S. and Europe, and was targeted because its owners are close
associates of President Vladimir Putin, the Treasury said. </p>
<p>Putin last week said he would open his personal account in
the bank targeted by the U.S. and have his salary payments

<p>Early this month, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stopped managing an investment account for a prominent client: the charitable foundation of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, one of the U.S.''s largest fraternities. </p> <p>The bank was concerned about SAE''s bad publicity, according to Anthony Alberico, a JPMorgan vice president who dealt with the foundation. SAE has had 10 deaths linked to drinking, drugs and hazing since 2006, more than any other fraternity. </p> <p>''If JPMorgan is going to turn us down, who''s next?'' said Bradley Cohen, SAE''s national president. ''What if universities start saying SAE''s not welcome?'' </p> <p>More from the Broken Pledges series:</p>
Fraternity Grapples With ''Historic'' Pledging Ban
U.S. Fraternity Abolishes Pledging for New Members
Frat''s Icy ''Torture'' of Pledges Evokes Tarantino Films
<p>The snub by the largest U.S. bank validated a startling decision that Cohen, seeking to protect future members, had already reached. On March 7, the same day JPMorgan formally cut ties with the fraternity, the 51-year-old Cohen announced an end to one of SAE''s defining traditions: pledging, the months-long initiation where recruits sometimes fall prey to brutal hazing. The move catapulted Cohen into national prominence and drew criticism from alumni such as Texas oilman-turned-investor T. Boone Pickens. SAE became one of only a handful of 75 national fraternities to eliminate pledging. </p> <p>''How much longer can we sustain these losses -- loss of life, loss of credibility to those who join and drop out because they were lied to, loss of valuable resources and loss of our reputation as leaders and as true gentlemen,'' Cohen told SAE brothers this month at the University of La Verne in California during his first public address since the announcement. </p> <h2>Secret Handshake </h2> <p>Cohen, who took office only nine months ago, faced intense pressure to change the culture of SAE, according to him and other top fraternity officials. Besides JPMorgan, Lloyd''s of London was threatening to cancel SAE''s insurance coverage because of injuries, deaths and lawsuits. </p> <p>Family considerations also motivated Cohen. He wanted to protect his older son, Devon, a high school freshman who is determined to join SAE in college. Devon wears bow ties in purple and gold -- SAE''s colors -- and knows its secret handshake. </p> <p>''I don''t want him to be scarred mentally from hazing,'' said Brad Cohen, relaxing with his family in their home near Los Angeles. ''I don''t want him to want to join SAE so badly that he''ll do anything he''s told.'' </p> <h2>Backlash Stirred </h2> <p>Cohen''s pledging ban has stirred a backlash from some student and alumni members of SAE, which was founded at the University of Alabama in 1856 and has more than 240 chapters and 14,000 college members. Cohen, who must step down at the end of his term next year, took the chance that traditionalists could unseat his allies on the board at the fraternity''s next convention in 2015, he said. </p> <p>Renowned as a Wall Street pipeline, SAE boasts prominent alumni such as hedge fund managers David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corp. Pickens, whom Cohen consulted before announcing the pledging ban, said through a spokesman that he has reservations about it. </p> <p>''Mr. Pickens believes pledgeship is a key part of fraternity life and helps those who go through it gain an appreciation for the rich history tied to each fraternity,'' spokesman Jay Rosser said in an e-mail. Pickens supports a ''greater focus'' on alcohol and drug awareness, Rosser said. </p> <p>''Either way, he appreciates the tough choice Brad Cohen has made,'' Rosser said. ''Time will tell if it was a good one.'' </p> <p>SAE chapters will still extend recruits a ''bid,'' or invitation to join. But students who accept will become full members almost immediately. They will be required to complete additional training, including alcohol education. </p> <h2>''Insta-Bros.'' </h2> <p>Angry student members are deriding those inducted immediately into the order as ''insta-bros.'' They also question whether the SAE board has authority under its bylaws, as Cohen maintains, to impose the ban on local chapters. Their posts warning that brotherly bonds will fade or pledging will go underground pack a Facebook page called ''SAE Cause for Change.'' </p> <p>''Doing away with the pledge program is like giving all the kids on a youth soccer team trophies at the end of the season for doing ''a good job,'''' one critic wrote. ''People need to face adversity in order to feel accomplished.'' </p> <p>E-mails and phone messages praising Cohen''s move poured in from administrators, fraternity members and families affected by hazing. </p> <h2>''Brave Leader'' </h2> <p>''We feel like he''s a strong, brave leader for taking this organization forward,'' said Scott Starkey, who called Cohen to applaud the decision. Starkey''s son, Carson, died of alcohol poisoning in 2008 as a freshman during an SAE hazing at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. </p> <p>The son of an Olympic athlete, the 6-foot-1-inch Cohen has a square jaw and a commanding presence. Owner and chief executive officer of a real estate company based in Newport Beach, California, he has spent almost 30 years in volunteer leadership roles at SAE. His brother and nephew belong to the order, and his father was an honorary member. Cohen counts his induction into SAE among the most meaningful ceremonies of his life, along with his wedding and the naming of his three children. SAE awards cover the walls in his study. </p> <p>He tries to live by SAE''s ''perfect'' creed, the ''True Gentleman,'' which all members must memorize, he said. It is a kind of golden rule of fraternity life, which begins: ''The true gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies.'' </p> <h2>Unusual Background </h2> <p>In many ways, Cohen has an unusual background for an SAE leader. He''s the first Jewish president of SAE, which used to limit membership to ''members of the Caucasian race'' without a parent who was a ''full-blooded Jew,'' according to a 1903 book of rituals. </p> <p>Holding the black volume aloft, Cohen read that passage to his audience at the University of La Verne. When SAE renounced racism and anti-Semitism in 1952, he reminded the crowd, it faced the same complaints that change would ruin the fraternity that traditionalists now make about the pledging ban. </p> <p>A Type 1 diabetic diagnosed at age 11, Cohen abhors forced drinking, which is often part of fraternity hazing. He worries that alcohol consumption, which can wreak havoc on a diabetic''s blood-sugar levels, endangers students with all kinds of health issues. Cohen, who wears an insulin pump, serves on the executive board of the University of California at Irvine diabetes research center. His son, Devon, also has the disease and held a diabetes fundraiser for his bar mitzvah in 2012. </p> <h2>South Africa </h2> <p>Cohen is also SAE''s first foreign-born leader, and speaks in the lilting accent of his native South Africa. His late father, Desmond Vernon Cohen, was an obstetrician-gynecologist, as well as a swimmer and water polo player on two South African Olympic teams. </p> <p>Fearing racial strife over the government''s apartheid policy, the family left South Africa in the late 1970s when Cohen was 16. When he announced the pledging ban, Cohen compared the treatment of new members as ''second-class citizens'' to the abuse of blacks under apartheid. </p> <p>Feeling lost and alone as a foreign student at the University of Arizona, Cohen helped alumni reopen the SAE chapter there. It had been shut down years before for hazing, including branding pledges on their buttocks with ''Phi Alpha,'' the SAE salutation and motto, Cohen said. </p> <h2>Leopard Print </h2> <p>While Cohen''s pledging didn''t include physical hazing, he was subjected to practical jokes, such as taking a fake national exam, he said. Once initiated, he made lifelong friends. In his study, he flips through old photos of himself with his fraternity buddies, including one at a party where he is dressed as a Zulu warrior, in a scanty leopard-print outfit. </p> <p>After graduating from Arizona with a bachelor''s in psychology and business administration in 1985, Cohen worked for two years at SAE''s headquarters in Evanston, Illinois. As director of expansion, he helped establish more than 20 new chapters, including one at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. </p> <p>Cohen moved to Southern California in 1988. After a stint at Xerox Corp. (XRX), he started working in the title insurance business. In 2009, he opened his own company, Granite Escrow Services Inc., which has annual revenue of more than $10 million, almost 100 employees and seven offices. </p> <h2>Hazing Tragedies </h2> <p>By then, Cohen had joined the Supreme Council, SAE''s governing board. He was also increasingly dismayed by hazing-related tragedies, including Starkey''s death after downing beer, rum and 151-proof liquor in an initiation ritual. </p> <p>His wife, Kim, a former singer and actress who is also from South Africa, shared his concerns. Devon and their younger son, Zachary, wouldn''t have been allowed to join certain SAE chapters before pledging was eliminated, she said. ''As a mother, I would have been scared to put them in an environment like that.'' </p> <p>As Cohen rose through SAE''s ranks, he pushed for a more comprehensive safety program, called ''Minerva''s Shield,'' which includes rules about alcohol and sexual consent, as well as a prohibition on hazing. It was adopted in 2004. </p> <p>Still, universities have disciplined more than 100 SAE chapters since 2007, some repeatedly, according to a list published on the organization''s website as a result of a legal settlement. Colleges suspended or closed at least 15 SAE chapters in the past three years. In 2011, a sophomore pre-medical student at Cornell University died from alcohol poisoning after being blindfolded by SAE pledges in an initiation ritual. </p> <h2>Supreme Archon </h2> <p>Last June, when Cohen became president -- or officially, Eminent Supreme Archon -- he signaled his commitment to significant change by backing a proposal to ban alcohol in chapter houses. At the convention in Chicago, it failed to get the two-thirds vote needed to pass. </p> <p>Cohen settled for a symbolic step. The council told chapters to stop using the word pledge and refer to recruits simply as ''new members.'' The goal was that they would be treated more humanely. </p> <p>Cohen should have continued to focus his fight on alcohol abuse, said Nicholas Syrett, an associate professor at the University of Northern Colorado and author of a book about the history of fraternities. Ending pledging ''doesn''t seem like it will change anything about the binge drinking at parties that doesn''t have anything to do with pledging,'' Syrett said. </p> <h2>Insurance Risk </h2> <p>As deaths and injuries mounted, Lloyd''s of London became increasingly concerned about the risk of insuring SAE. It threatened to drop coverage because the fraternity poses too great a risk, according to Gregory Brandt, a state judge in Iowa, and Steven Churchill, executive director of the American Medical Association, both SAE council members. Loss of coverage could shut down SAE, they said. </p> <p>The Lloyd''s warning was a turning point that ''changed the way'' SAE officials viewed the fraternity''s ''future viability,'' Churchill said. </p> <p>Members already pay a base fee of $340 a year for liability coverage, among the highest rates of any fraternity. The SAE national''s deductible is $1.5 million a year, Cohen said. </p> <p>SAE''s insurance broker, James R. Favor  Co., declined to comment, as did Lisa Hunter, a Lloyd''s spokeswoman. </p> <p>Media pressure on SAE also mounted. A December Bloomberg News article, which called SAE the ''deadliest fraternity,'' revealed previously unreported hazing at Salisbury University in Maryland. </p> <h2>German Rock </h2> <p>During an eight-week initiation in 2012, SAE brothers at Salisbury forced pledges to drink until they almost passed out and demanded they recite the True Gentleman pledge wearing only their underwear while standing in trash cans filled with ice, Bloomberg reported. </p> <p>Fraternity members confined recruits for as long as nine hours in a dark basement without food, water or a bathroom, while blasting the same German rock song at ear-splitting volume, according to two former pledges and the findings of the university''s disciplinary board. </p> <p>In the wake of the Bloomberg article, Cohen asked Dwight ''Duke'' Marshall, the volunteer alumni adviser for SAE''s Salisbury chapter, about what happened in the basement. Marshall said brothers had played the music only to prevent pledges from hearing secret SAE rituals taking place upstairs, according to Cohen. </p> <p>Cohen fired off an e-mail to Marshall and other alumni that likened confining students in the dark, amid deafening German music, to something out of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp. </p> <h2>Taking Offense </h2> <p>''I take offense to that as a Jew,'' he remembered saying in the e-mail. ''I take offense as a member of SAE.'' </p> <p>Marshall and others downplayed the seriousness of hazing at Salisbury to the national fraternity, Cohen said. On Feb. 2, SAE suspended the chapter''s charter and said brothers will lose membership privileges. The university has suspended the chapter through the summer of 2015. </p> <p>In an interview this week, Marshall said he didn''t mislead Cohen and found his e-mail offensive. Still, he said he respects Cohen''s opinion. ''He''s our leader,'' he said. </p> <p>Cohen and the rest of the Supreme Council began considering a pledging ban. At a Jan. 19 meeting in Tucson, Arizona, they debated the idea and alternatives such as shortening the initiation period. </p> <p>The final decision to stop pledging came on a Feb. 3 conference call. Cohen said the council kept its plan under wraps for fear that hazers would accelerate abuse of pledges before the program was eliminated. </p> <p>''How many more new members have to die before everyone is willing to change the way we operate?'' SAE Executive Director Blaine Ayers said in an e-mail. </p> <h2>Bank''s Rebuff </h2> <p>A rebuff from an unexpected quarter reaffirmed the council''s resolve. SAE''s charitable foundation had an investment account with New York-based JPMorgan containing about $500,000, which was primarily used to make payments on a loan and occasionally to sell stock gifts. The account dated back to the mid-2000''s, Cohen said. </p> <p>Then, in February, JPMorgan said that it was reconsidering the relationship to avoid tarnishing its reputation, according to Todd Buchanan, vice president of the foundation and one of Cohen''s predecessors as SAE''s leader. </p> <p>''It was shocking,'' Buchanan said. ''It really spoke to why we needed to make a stand. We''re better than this.'' </p> <p>The bank, which has said it would pay more than $23 billion to resolve regulatory and criminal investigations, has cut ties since last year with about 2,000 clients that could attract scrutiny, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Emily Sackett, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p> <h2>Terminated Ties </h2> <p>Cohen and Buchanan said they learned March 6 that JPMorgan had decided to quit doing business with SAE''s foundation. On March 7, the bank sent a letter terminating the relationship. That day, Cohen announced the pledging ban. </p> <p>''As an organization, we have been plagued with too much bad behavior, which has resulted in loss of lives, negative press and large lawsuits,'' he said in a video address. </p> <p>A week later, during a student leadership conference at the University of La Verne, Cohen milled around with undergraduates from chapters across Southern California. Some admired his purple and gold tie, adorned with tiny phoenixes. </p> <p>''We''re like the Phoenix,'' Cohen told them. ''We''re rising from the ashes.'' </p> <p>Filing into the arena under a huge American flag, SAE brothers wore khakis, blazers and crisp white shirts, and ties in the fraternity''s colors. Sorority women in high heels acted as hostesses. </p> <h2>''Guiding Light'' </h2> <p>The brothers shouted the SAE motto, ''Phi Alpha,'' before joining in a medley of fraternity songs, filling the arena with rich baritones: ''And to Phi Alpha with its guiding light, And to the lion who will fight, fight, fight.'' </p> <p>For half an hour, Cohen made his case that the Supreme Council had no choice but to ban pledging: </p> <p>''No parent should ever have to suffer the loss of a child because that child was simply trying to join a fraternity -- our beloved fraternity, where we claim to be true gentlemen.'' </p> <p>After the speech, Alexi Sciutto, who just graduated from California State University at Northridge, buttonholed Cohen to offer support. His SAE brothers helped him cope with his mother''s death from breast cancer, he said. </p> <p>''I''ll do whatever needs to be done to keep SAE alive,'' he told Cohen. ''And I''ll do it until I die.'' </p> <p>Christian Couch, 21, a junior from California State University at Long Beach who attended Cohen''s speech, said he disagreed with the new policy. </p> <h2>''Easy Out'' </h2> <p>''It doesn''t feel right. You just sign up and you''re automatically in,'' he said. ''It''s the easy way out.'' </p> <p>After the speech, Cohen joined other fraternity staff and volunteers in workshops about the revamped program for new members, called ''The True Gentleman Experience.'' </p> <p>Leaning against a wall in a classroom with 25 SAE members, Cohen said that brothers must still learn rituals, including the SAE creed. ''They don''t need to learn the True Gentleman standing in a tub of ice, half naked,'' he said. </p> <p>Back in Cohen''s family room, his 14-year-old son, Devon, said he''s pleased that SAE eliminated pledging. His parents support his ambition to join the fraternity. </p> <p>''The brothers I''ve met are so cool, so nice, so welcoming,'' Devon said. ''They really are true gentlemen.'' </p> <p>', 'Fraternity Chief Feared for Son as Hazings Spurred JPMorgan Snub', 'By John Hechinger and David Glovin', 'Mar 27, 2014 12:01 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-27/fraternity-chief-feared-for-son-as-hazings-spurred-jpmorgan-snub.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary Cohn said prices in global markets don''t reflect the risks
from geopolitical conflicts such as Russia''s annexation of
Crimea. </p>
<p>''For the last six to 12 months, markets for some reason
have been ignoring a lot of the geopolitical risk,'' Cohn, 53,
said in an interview with Canadian television network CBC.
''Russia, Crimea, Ukraine: this is not the first or newest
geopolitical risk we''ve had in the last year or so.'' </p>
<p>Cohn cited tensions between China and Japan as well as
continuing violence in the Middle East as risks that haven''t
halted a climb in global equities over the last 12 months.
Investors with a lot of cash have felt pressure to deploy it,
preventing a sustained downturn in prices, he said. </p>
<p>''Anytime we get any sell-off in the market, there''s new
investors coming into the market, so we haven''t seen that
repricing,'' Cohn said. Investors are saying, ''I''ve got to put
cash to work, and maybe these situations are going to be with us
for a long time, and I can''t sit on cash at the bank earning no
return forever,'' he said. </p>
<p>Still, Cohn said the U.S. stock market seems fairly valued,

<p>Ghana''s cedi, the worst-performing
African currency in the first quarter, could depreciate another
20 percent this year as foreign-exchange reserves recede and
inflation (GHCPALLY) accelerates, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>Increased risk of outflows from the ''heavily'' foreign-owned local bonds, uncertainty around commodity prices and fewer
signs of a ''real turnaround in the country''s fiscal situation''
add to the cedi''s weaker outlook, Giulia Pellegrini, sub-Saharan
Africa economist at JPMorgan, said in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>The U.S. investment bank, which cut Ghana''s gross domestic
product forecast for 2014, said lower growth will affect revenue
generation and widen the budget deficit to 10 percent of GDP
against the government''s target of 8.5 percent. Inflation
quickened to 14 percent in February, climbing for a sixth
consecutive month, as the government stopped utility subsidies
and the cedi weakened. It climbed from 13.8 percent in January,
above the central bank''s target of 9.5 percent plus or minus 2
percentage points. </p>
<p>''Bank of Ghana has revised up its inflation forecasts,''
Pellegrini said. ''It sees inflation staying above the target
band until 2015, with risks tilted to the upside on the
weakening cedi and slower-than-planned fiscal consolidation.'' </p>
<p>JPMorgan cut the economic growth forecast to 5.2 percent
given the West African nation''s erratic power supply and
uncertainty around commodity prices, Pellegrini said. The
government''s GDP estimate for this year is 8 percent. </p>
<p>Ghana''s gross foreign-exchange reserves dropped to $5.3
billion in January from $5.6 billion the previous month, the
central bank said March 19. </p>
<p>The currency of the world''s second-biggest cocoa producer
slumped 20 percent against the dollar last year. It is 12
percent weaker in the first quarter, the most among 24 African
currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The cedi slipped 0.1 percent
to 2.6925 per dollar by 4:40 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
declining for a second day. </p>

<p>Royal Bank of Canada (RY) joined Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in voicing support for IEX Group Inc.''s five-month-old U.S. stock market, which was designed to mitigate the
influence of computerized high-speed traders. </p>
<p>The bank''s RBC Capital Markets unit executed the first
trade on IEX in October, according to an internal memo from
RBC''s head of global equities, Greg Mills, and the U.S. equities
chief, Bobby Grubert. Royal Bank also supported the market''s
development while its founders were still employed at the bank,
according to the document. </p>
<p>Royal Bank has positioned itself as a champion of making
the stock market more fair. It built a software defense known as
THOR that tries to protect clients'' orders from the fastest
traders. Also, the Toronto-based bank doesn''t run a dark pool,
shunning a common practice among the world''s biggest brokerages.
On broker-owned dark pools, customers'' orders are executed
privately instead of being sent to public exchanges. </p>
<p>''We have always been strongly opposed to predatory trading
strategies,'' according to the memo. ''RBC and IEX are fully
aligned and have a shared philosophy of creating a fair and open
market structure for investors and all industry participants.'' </p>
<p>Kait Conetta, a Royal Bank spokeswoman, confirmed the
document is authentic and declined to comment further. The
company is Canada''s second-largest lender by assets. Neither
Royal Bank nor any other broker owns a stake in IEX. </p>
<h2>Attorney General </h2>
<p>The endorsements of IEX come amid heightened scrutiny of
the structure and vulnerabilities of the U.S. stock market,
where more than 50 electronic venues compete to match buyers
with sellers. ''Flash Boys'' by author Michael Lewis, scheduled
for release next week, in part tells the story of IEX Chief
Executive Officer Brad Katsuyama, according to excerpts from the
book. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said last week
that he''s investigating whether exchanges and other venues are
giving high-speed traders improper advantages. </p>
<p>So far, IEX has captured only a small slice of stock
trading. Average daily volume increased to 14.7 million shares
in February from 9.1 million in January, and is about 18 million
in March, according to IEX. That''s less than 1 percent of the
2014 daily average of 6.9 billion on all U.S. markets, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>IEX attempts to declaw high-speed traders by delaying
reports of order executions by 350 millionths of a second,
enough to curb the fastest firms. IEX also shuns the use of the
maker-taker business model, in which exchanges and other venues
pay rebates to market makers for providing bids and offers. </p>
<p>Royal Bank has urged regulators to consider alternatives to
that system, saying it creates a conflict of interest for
brokers who may pick a venue because of its rebates rather than
the best interests of clients. </p>
<h2>Normally Private </h2>
<p>In a challenge to other dark pools, IEX last year released
its normally private regulatory filing that explains how it
operates. While currently organized as a dark pool, IEX has
ambitions to officially become an exchange, Katsuyama said
during an interview with Bloomberg News last year. There are 13
stock exchanges in the U.S., including the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said in its memo last week that ''it would be
best for the overall market if IEX achieved critical mass, even
if that results in reduced volumes'' on Sigma X, the Goldman
Sachs dark pool. </p>
<p>The founders of IEX worked on their business plan for
months while still at RBC, according to the RBC memo. </p>
<p>''While it was hard to part with such strong talent, it was
the right thing to do for our clients,'' the memo said. </p>
<p>''We are at the forefront of significant market structure
reform,'' Royal Bank said. ''While we may see other industry
participants potentially amending their practices based on
recent developments, our approach as the client advocate has
been consistent from day one and we will continue to stand by
this philosophy in the months and years to come.'' </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
persuade a federal judge to again throw out a securities lawsuit
over residential mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2007
after an appeals court overturned an earlier decision. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in Manhattan,
who had dismissed the lawsuit by the Police and Fire Retirement
System of the City of Detroit twice before, ruled yesterday that
a 2012 appellate decision overturning her findings in a related
lawsuit had ''significantly changed the landscape.'' </p>
<p>In 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed
Cedarbaum''s ruling that the NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare Fund,
which had sued Goldman Sachs in 2008, had failed to claim a
sufficient loss from the investments. The appeals panel also
threw out her ruling that the fund couldn''t represent investors
in offerings of the securities it hadn''t bought itself. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s ruling follows a New York state appeals court
decision in January that Goldman Sachs must face fraud claims in
a $1 billion lawsuit filed by an Australian hedge fund, Basis
Capital Funds Management Ltd.''s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, over
collateralized debt obligations sold by the bank before the
financial crisis of 2008. In 2010, Goldman Sachs reached a $550
million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to resolve claims over the marketing of CDOs. </p>
<h2>Judge Reversed </h2>
<p>In the federal case, the Detroit pension fund filed a
separate lawsuit in 2010 on behalf of investors that bought
securities from the trust for which Cedarbaum had said NECA
couldn''t bring claims. The judge had dismissed the Detroit
fund''s lawsuit twice largely on her determination that it didn''t
adequately allege how Goldman Sachs''s purported
misrepresentations caused any loss. </p>
<p>After the higher court''s ruling, ''the fact that PFRS
received payments throughout the life of the certificates, and
was arguably aware of the risk that there would not be a
secondary market for its certificates, is immaterial,''
Cedarbaum said in yesterday''s ruling. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. </p>

<p>Former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) employee Alex
Kibkalo pleaded guilty to leaking company trade secrets to a
blogger in France and agreed to pay $22,500 in restitution and
spend three months in prison. </p>
<p>Kibkalo, a Russian national who worked for Microsoft in
Lebanon, admitted he uploaded pre-release updates for Windows 8
and a software development kit for guarding against copyright
infringement to his online backup storage in July and August
2012, according to a plea agreement filed yesterday in federal
court in Seattle. </p>
<p>Kibkalo provided the blogger with links to the files in his
account, encouraging him to share the development kit with
others who might be able to write ''fake activation'' codes
based on the software, according to the agreement. </p>
<p>The kit''s value ''is substantial to Microsoft because it
prevents software piracy across the line of Microsoft
products,'' according to the agreement, which is subject to a
judge''s approval. Sentencing is scheduled for July 1. </p>
<p>Microsoft was alerted to the theft in 2012 by an individual
who asked that his identity not be disclosed. He learned of
Kibkalo''s theft when the blogger contacted him for help
examining code for the Microsoft Activation Server Software
Development Kit, a product developed for internal Microsoft use
only, according to the criminal complaint. </p>
<h2>Internal Investigation </h2>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based company''s internal
investigation traced the leaked information to Kibkalo, a seven-year employee who was working as a software architect in
Lebanon, prosecutors said. He has worked for another U.S.
technology company since he returned to Russia, prosecutors
said. </p>
<p>As part of the company''s internal investigation, Microsoft
gained access to the blogger''s Hotmail account, which contained
e-mail messages from Kibkalo with pre-release ''hot fixes'' for
Windows 8 for mobile devices that weren''t publicly available,
according to the complaint. </p>
<p>''While Microsoft''s terms of service make clear our
permission for this type of review, this happens only in the
most exceptional circumstances,'' the company said in a March 20
statement. ''We apply a rigorous process before reviewing such
content.'' </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v Kibkalo, 14-00087, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Washington (Seattle). </p>

<p>Darden Restaurants (DRI) Inc., the owner
of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, said splitting off its real
estate holdings wouldn''t increase shareholder value, rejecting a
strategy pushed by activist investors. </p>
<p>Darden spurned the idea after consulting with financial
advisers Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), according
to a statement today. The company''s board also worked with law
firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz to assess the demands. </p>
<p>Darden is facing increased pressure from activists,
including Starboard Value LP and Barington Capital Group LP, to
spin off its restaurant properties and shake up company
management. The real estate is worth about $4 billion, Starboard
said this week. </p>
<p>''A real estate separation would not enhance long-term
shareholder value,'' Darden responded in today''s statement.
''The company will review the latest Starboard materials and
looks forward to addressing them in its ongoing conversations
with Darden shareholders.'' </p>
<p>Shares of the Orlando, Florida-based company have declined
5.3 percent this year. The stock gained 1.4 percent to $51.48 at
the close today in New York. </p>
<p>Last week, Barington asked Darden to consider replacing
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, saying the company has
underperformed during his tenure and that his restructuring plan
may destroy value. Otis, who became CEO in 2004 and chairman in
2005, is working to separate Darden''s Red Lobster seafood chain
through a tax-free spinoff or sale. Starboard has joined
Barington in opposing Otis''s plan. </p>

<p>Argentina''s effort to repair ties
with overseas investors is starting to yield results in the bond
market as the country tries to stem a plunge in foreign-currency
reserves. </p>
<p>Its dollar-denominated notes surged by the most of any
emerging market, adding to a 9.2 percent rally in March, after
the government said it received loan proposals from
international investment banks. The statement was in response to
a newspaper report on March 30 that said Argentina is close to
getting a two-year, $1 billion loan from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. at an interest rate of 6.5 percent, less than the nation''s
similar-maturity bonds that yield 11.28 percent. </p>
<p>The loan would provide Argentina, which hasn''t issued
overseas bonds since its $95 billion default in 2001, with a
crucial source of hard currency at a time when the reserves it
uses to pay debt are at a seven-year low. The financing would
also show President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is succeeding
in restoring investor confidence after settling creditor
disputes at the World Bank, agreeing to compensate Repsol SA for
its seizure of YPF SA and revamping its inflation index. </p>
<p>''The market has been optimistic about Argentina for a
while now due to the change in attitude toward more pragmatic
and orthodox policies,'' Diego Ferro, the co-chief investment
officer at Greylock Capital Management LLC in New York, said by
e-mail. ''In that context, regaining market access would be a
logical step.'' </p>
<h2>Budget Deficit </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment
on any proposals or talks with Argentina. </p>
<p>The central bank is negotiating the final details of the
loan with Goldman Sachs including guarantees, Buenos Aires-based
newspaper Pagina/12 reported, citing a government official it
didn''t identify. </p>
<p>The bond-market advance pushed down Argentina''s average
yields to 10.8 percent. As recently as Feb. 3, they were as high
as 13.61 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The Economy Ministry said in a statement on March 30 that
while the government isn''t planning any foreign currency debt
sales in the short term, it has received proposals from
investment banks it didn''t identify. </p>
<p>''Different financial entities have presented proposals to
obtain foreign financing at maturities and interest rates in
line with other countries in the region,'' the ministry said. </p>
<h2>Subsidy Cuts </h2>
<p>Fernandez, hamstrung by a growing fiscal deficit and a
shrinking trade surplus, has authorized her economic team led by
Economy Minister Axel Kicillof to settle decade-old investment
disputes to gain access to fresh financing before the end of her
term late next year. Argentina will begin to cut gas and water
subsidies by 20 percent beginning today. Utility rates have been
largely frozen since 2003 and an increase in gas imports have
drained reserves as domestic output declines. </p>
<p>''Given what they''ve been doing in recent days like changes
to subsidies, they''re cognizant of the need to maintain this
change in policy,'' Marco Santamaria, a money manager at
AllianceBernstein LP, which oversees $25 billion in emerging-market debt, said by phone from New York. </p>
<p>Robert Abad, who helps oversee about $53 billion of
emerging-market debt at Western Asset Management Co., said
Argentina''s legal dispute with creditors who rejected its debt
restructurings will continue to make it difficult for Argentina
to obtain the financing it needs. </p>
<h2>Holdout Litigation </h2>
<p>Creditors led by Elliott Management Corp.''s Paul Singer
have won lower court rulings to be paid in full at the same time
Argentina services its restructured debt. The effects of the
ruling are on hold pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
About 93 percent of creditors accepted losses of 70 percent in
the restructurings. Argentina has said paying holdouts in full
could expose it to $43 billion of claims that would lead it to
default again. </p>
<p>''They have a lot more work to do, a loan here and a loan
there won''t bring liquidity relief that makes the math
sustainable,'' Abad said in a telephone interview from Pasadena,
California. ''This legal issue can create a big dent to what
happens. It''s hard to set the parameters to how much they have
to set aside.'' </p>
<p>The government has $5.9 billion of bonds due in October
2015. </p>
<p>Argentina obtained $938 million in financing from the
Inter-American Development Bank during meetings on March 29,
Buenos Aires-based newspaper Ambito Financiero reported
yesterday. The government is also in ''advanced talks'' with the
World Bank for $3 billion of loans, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said yesterday. </p>
<h2>''High Probability'' </h2>
<p>Argentine bonds will continue to gain, according to
Barclays Plc. Average yields are still double the average in
emerging markets. </p>
<p>''Valuations are still attractive, and the market will
continue to rally,'' Donato Guarino, a strategist at Barclays,
said in a telephone interview from New York. ''There''s a high
probability that they will get back on the international
market.'' </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will manage
funds for a Bermuda-based reinsurer that raised $1.13 billion in
capital, concentrating the investments in junk bonds. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Highbridge Principal Strategies LLC will oversee
the assets for Watford Re Ltd., the reinsurer said yesterday in
a statement. Watford said it raised $907 million in common
equity, including a $100 million investment by Arch Capital
Group Ltd., and $226 million in preferred shares. The reinsurer
is targeting an initial public offering in two to three years,
Chief Executive Officer John Rathgeber said in an interview. </p>
<p>The reinsurer''s portfolio will be ''comprised primarily of
non-investment grade credit assets, which it believes will
generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders
over the long term,'' Watford said. </p>
<p>Money managers including Dan Loeb have started Bermuda-based reinsurers in recent years to raise funds that are less
subject to client withdrawals and can provide tax advantages.
Pine River Capital Management LP, the hedge-fund firm founded by
Brian Taylor, was seeking to raise $500 million to $750 million
for a reinsurance company, a person familiar with the matter
said in February. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, owns Highbridge
through its investment arm, JPMorgan Asset Management.
Highbridge Principal Strategies is led by Chief Executive
Officer Scott Kapnick, who came to the firm in 2007 after 21
years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was global co-head
of investment banking. HPS had about $19 billion of assets under
management as of March, Watford said. </p>
<h2>Casualty Coverage </h2>
<p>Rathgeber was vice chairman of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance
Group. Jon Levy was named chief risk officer and Roderick Romeo
will be chief financial officer. Reinsurers shoulder risk for
primary carriers. </p>
<p>Management is aiming for annualized returns of about 15
percent over time, Rathgeber said. He plans to focus on casualty
lines such as automobile liability, workers'' compensation and
medical malpractice coverage while limiting risks tied to
natural disasters. </p>
<p>''It wouldn''t make sense to have this kind of investment
strategy and be heavily into that kind of volatile, capital-intensive reinsurance exposure,'' he said. </p>
<p>Constantine Iordanou, the CEO of Bermuda-based Arch
Capital, has been diversifying risk through deals including an
agreement last year to add assets from bankrupt mortgage insurer
PMI Group Inc. </p>
<p>Arch slipped 0.8 percent to $57.07 at 10:17 a.m. in New
York, narrowing its gain to about 8.6 percent over the past
year. JPMorgan climbed 0.3 percent and is up 27 percent in the
past 12 months. </p>
<h2>Corporate Debt </h2>
<p>Junk-rated corporate debt worldwide returned 2.9 percent
since Dec. 31, beating global stocks and setting the stage for a
sixth year of gains, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. The bonds now yield 6.1 percent, compared with an
average of about 10 percent in the decade through 2007. Junk
bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt rated below BBB-by Standard
 Poor''s and lower than Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>''We believe that non-investment-grade credit complements
Watford''s reinsurance strategy,'' Purnima Puri, HPS''s managing
director, said in the statement. </p>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan advised on the capital structuring,
and Clifford Chance LLP was Watford''s outside counsel. </p>

<p>Citic Pacific Ltd.''s perpetual bonds

will buy its parent''s main operating unit, a move Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. says may help improve corporate governance. </p>

percent notes with no set maturity have leapt 9.9 cents on the
dollar since March 25 to 107.01, the most for any five-business-day period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company

state-owned parent Citic Group Corp. </p>
<p>Goldman removed Citic Pacific''s perpetual securities from a
list of its least favored bonds, according to a research note
dated March 30. The deal comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping

liberalization in 1978, including loosening yuan trading and
allowing more private investments in state businesses. </p>
<p>''If the transaction is completed, we believe it should

to 100.3 as of 11:24 a.m. in Sydney, according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The benchmark is poised for its lowest close since Feb.
18 after a 1.9 basis point drop last week, CMA data shows. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 0.3 basis point to
84 basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup prices show.
The measure, which fell 4.3 basis points last week, the most
since the five-day period ended Feb. 21, is on track for its
lowest close since March 19, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market. </p>
<p>Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. </p>

<p>Ed Dahlberg got 40 calls in one day when he put a Gulfstream G650 up for sale in February. That''s unusual for a private jet -- especially when the asking price tops the $64.5 million on the sticker. </p> <p>''We believe this plane''s going to bring north of $75 million,'' said Dahlberg, president of Manassas, Virginia-based Emerald Aviation Inc. and part-owner of the G650. </p> <p>Barely 15 months after its debut, the world''s biggest and fastest business jet is a corporate status symbol, with owners as high profile as Exxon Mobil Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. The waiting list is almost four years long for a factory-fresh model, whetting appetites among tycoons and chief executive officers when a used G650 hits the market. </p> <p>''It''s the must-have airplane if you''re in the top end of the spectrum,'' said Steve Varsano, founder of London-based Jet Business, who''s sold two pre-owned G650s since November for more than $70 million each to buyers he wouldn''t identify. </p> <p>G650s are also must-have for Gulfstream parent General Dynamics Corp., the tank and submarine maker squeezed by shrinking U.S. defense budgets. The jets helped boost 2013 aerospace revenue 17 percent to $8.12 billion, while combat systems unit revenue fell 23 percent to $6.12 billion. </p> <p>''The G650 is doing exceptionally well,'' said Peter Arment, a Sterne, Agee  Leach Inc. analyst who has a buy rating on Falls Church, Virginia-based General Dynamics. ''The demand for this plane is going to remain very strong.'' </p> <h2>Transoceanic Routes </h2> <p>Large, luxury aircraft are the bright spot in a $21 billion private-jet market recovering unevenly from the 2008-09 financial crisis. While orders remain weak for small, personal models like the Mustang from Textron Inc.''s Cessna, corporate fleet managers and billionaires are shopping again for big planes able to make transoceanic routes. </p> <p>Qualcomm''s G650 flew round trip between California and Barcelona before February''s Mobile World Congress in the Spanish city, where then-CEO Paul Jacobs collected an industry award. That jaunt, as chronicled by airline-data tracker FlightAware, was well within the jet''s advertised range of 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers), enough to reach Beijing from New York without refueling. </p> <p>Propelled by Rolls-Royce engines tucked on either side of the rear of the fuselage, the G650 can reach 627 miles an hour at 30,000 feet (9,100 meters), about 93 percent of the speed of sound. It seats as many as 18 people. To ease jet lag, the cabin air pressure is kept higher than on typical airplanes. </p> <h2>Engine Whisper </h2> <p>On a recent flight from Phoenix on a G650 owned by Honeywell International Inc., takeoff thrust pressed passengers into soft leather seats as the engines whispered. </p> <p>Wood-veneer tables popped out at the touch of a button. Entertainment options included watching satellite television from a seat-belted sofa or gazing out the windows -- billed as the largest on a business jet and fitted with powered shades -- at the red sandstone cliffs of Sedona, Arizona. </p> <p>''It''s just unbelievably capable and unbelievably reliable,'' Honeywell pilot Andy Eldringhoff said as he guided the plane above the Arizona desert at 16,500 feet. CEO Dave Cote is among the users of the jet, which has Honeywell avionics in the cockpit. </p> <p>With more than 50 delivered so far, the G650 has reset the market for business aircraft designed for maximum speed, comfort and distance. There won''t be a competitor in the G650''s class until 2016, when Bombardier Inc.''s Global 7000 is due for its initial handover. </p> <h2>Exclusive Aura </h2> <p>Gulfstream enhances the aura of exclusivity by refusing to let buyers leapfrog by swapping or buying delivery slots, as occurs with commercial jets. The Savannah, Georgia-based company wrote a clause that strictly prohibits contract holders from selling their spots, said Steve Cass, a spokesman. </p> <p>''There is no cutting in line,'' Cass said. ''Everyone that we deal with is pretty important folks. Once you go down that, it''s a pretty slippery slope. You just don''t want to go there.'' </p> <p>Gulfstream started taking G650 orders in March 2008 -- six months before the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy triggered a global credit freeze -- and customers stampeded to put down about $3 million and sign purchase contracts, said Jet Business''s Varsano. </p> <p>While Cass said the G650 order book held up during the economic crisis, flight trials were marred by a 2011 crash in New Mexico that killed four Gulfstream employees. U.S. safety officials concluded in 2012 that company pressure to speed up testing caused the accident. Gulfstream President Larry Flynn responded that any failings by the planemaker were inadvertent. </p> <p>Most Profitable? </p> <p>The G650 may become Gulfstream''s most profitable aircraft ever, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic told investors on Feb. 20 at a Barclays Plc conference. The jet uses 50 percent fewer parts than the smaller G550 and G450 and is assembled at a plant designed for the G650, according to Gulfstream. </p> <p>''We don''t know internally how good we can get, but we know we can get a whole lot better,'' Novakovic said of the plane''s profitability. </p> <p>General Dynamics soared 54 percent to $108.92 in the 12 months ended yesterday, topping the 19 percent gain for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. Montreal-based Bombardier rose 2 percent in the same period. </p> <p>Buyers'' silence about the G650 contrasts with the demand. Corporate touchiness about jet ownership only intensified after U.S. automaker CEOs drew criticism for flying company aircraft to Washington in 2008 to beg Congress for an industry bailout. </p> <h2>Owners'' Silence </h2> <p>Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, confirmed that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has a G650 while declining to discuss details. Emily Kilpatrick, a spokeswoman for San Diego-based Qualcomm, and Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, declined to comment when asked about the G650s registered to the companies at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. </p> <p>A G650 registered to Dick''s Sporting Goods Inc. was sold in February, according to FAA records that didn''t list the buyer or the terms. The Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based company didn''t respond to messages requesting comment on the transaction. </p> <p>Gulfstream is famous for secrecy about what''s on the drawing board, and General Dynamics'' Novakovic said the next jets won''t be unveiled until they''re ready to roll out on the tarmac under their own power. </p> <p>Jefferies LLC analyst Howard Rubel said a redo of the G550, the previous flagship, may be under consideration. Jet Business''s Varsano said buyers want other the Gulfstream models to get cabins like the G650''s. Dahlberg, the Virginia broker, said the G650 itself could be modified to extend its range. </p> <p>''Gulfstream really hit a home run with the product,'' said Josh Mesinger, vice president of Mesinger Jet Sales in Boulder, Colorado. ''There is no other product in the world in service that will fly 7,000 miles.'' </p> <p>Mesinger was the broker that offered the G650 registered to Dick''s, with an asking price of $73.5 million, according to an online posting. </p> <p>It sold the day the ad appeared. </p> <p>', 'Exxon to Wal-Mart Flying G650 Turn Jet Into Status Symbol', 'By Thomas Black', 'Apr 01, 2014 12:01 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-01/exxon-to-wal-mart-flying-g650-turn-jet-into-status-symbol.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Blythe Masters, who rose from being a JPMorgan Chase  Co.

<p>Microsoft Corp. renewed its push to catch up with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in mobile devices, unveiling updated Windows Phone software with voice-search features and offering it for free for small phones and tablets. </p> <p>Microsoft, which previously required a licensing fee for Windows, will offer it without charge for handsets and tablets with screens of less than nine inches, Microsoft operating systems chief Terry Myerson said at the company''s Build conference for developers in San Francisco today. Microsoft also showed off a voice-controlled digital assistant called Cortana that is similar to Apple''s Siri, which is part of a new Windows Phone 8.1 software for mobile gadgets. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who was appointed to lead the world''s largest software maker in February, is working to remake Microsoft for an era where smartphones and tablets have become central. To do so, he must strike a balance between offering Microsoft''s software for competing platforms while still keeping the company''s Windows operating system as a core focus. Today''s event was designed to re-emphasize the importance of Windows to the Redmond, Washington-based company and to spur adoption of the software. </p> <p>Related:</p>
Apple''s Maestri Takes Top Finance Role Amid Cash Scrutiny
Atop the Electronics World, Samsung Now Chasing Innovation
<p>''Reinvigorating the Windows franchise continues to be a key ingredient in Microsoft''s recipe for success as it looks to offset headwinds from the secular challenges in the PC market,'' Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note. </p> <h2>Delicate Balance </h2> <p>Nadella''s tricky balancing act was underscored by two Microsoft events last week and this week. The CEO last week debuted Microsoft Office software for Apple''s iPads and said he''ll ''hold nothing back'' to get the company''s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker''s longtime focus on Windows. </p> <p>In contrast, this week''s Build conference puts Windows front-and-center by giving developers tools and tactics to boost Microsoft''s single-digit share in phones and tablets, as well as providing money-making opportunities in a contracting personal-computer market. </p> <p>''We''re going to innovate with a challenger mindset,'' Nadella said at the event. </p> <p>In making Windows free for smaller phones and tablets, Microsoft is working to narrow the gap with Google, which distributes its Android mobile operating system to hardware manufacturers at no cost. Android has become the most widely used software in smartphones and tablets. </p> <h2>Start Menu </h2> <p>Myerson also said the company is restoring the Windows start menu, which will be made available to users as an update. The company yanked the feature from Windows 8, triggering customer complaints. Microsoft also showed Office applications for Windows that are redesigned for use with touch controls, one week after showing similar apps for Office for the iPad. </p> <p>Microsoft Vice President Joe Belfiore said the new Windows Phone 8.1 will have an action center, which is a pull-down menu that gives people access to basic functions regardless of whether programs are already open. The software, which will start rolling out in the next few months on existing phones and on new devices later this month and in early May, also lets users customize their phone''s lock screen and offers new choices for tweaking the start screen. </p> <h2>Cortana Speaks </h2> <p>Cortana, which ''fully replaces the search function on Windows Phone,'' according to Belfiore, is named for the artificial-intelligence character in Microsoft''s best-selling Halo Xbox video-game series. </p> <p>Developers outside Microsoft can write their own apps for Cortana, Belfiore said. With users'' permission, Cortana can learn about consumers from their searches, keep track of people they interact with and set up an ''inner circle'' of the most important people and who can contact users during the times of day they set as ''quiet hours.'' </p> <p>Belfiore demonstrated how he allowed Cortana to scan his e-mail, causing the program to ask him whether to track an Alaska Airlines flight mentioned in an e-mail itinerary. The program can be used to start a Skype call, add a TV show to the user''s Hulu queue or check a friend''s Facebook posts. </p> <p>''She''s great at helping me get things done, whether its by talking or typing,'' Belfiore said. </p> <h2>Windows Share </h2> <p>Nokia Oyj''s handset division, which is being acquired by Microsoft in a deal set to close this month, will begin selling new phones using Windows Phone 8.1, said former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop. The 930 is a high-end device that will debut in June and feature wireless charging, while two cheaper phones designed for emerging markets will become available in May, said Elop, who will become Microsoft''s executive vice president of the devices group when the transaction with Nokia is completed. </p> <p>Windows stands to be the fastest-growing smartphone operating system over the next four years with 30 percent annual growth, according to a Feb. 26 report by researcher IDC. Even at that rate, Windows Phone would only make up 7 percent of the total market in 2018, compared with Google''s Android software at 76 percent Apple''s iOS at 14 percent. </p> <p>In tablets, Windows had 3.4 percent share in 2013, IDC said. For Microsoft''s Surface tablet, the share was 1 percent. </p> <p>Global computer shipments fell a record 10 percent last year and are forecast to continue to decline this year as tablets and smartphones lure consumers away from traditional desktop and notebook designs, according to IDC. Tablet sales volume -- dominated by Apple and Google, whose operating systems account for 95 percent of that market -- will rise an average 16 percent annually through to 2017. </p> <p>One possible boon to Windows developers: Microsoft is working on obtaining tools, via acquisition or development, to make it easier for application developers to target multiple operating systems without having to rewrite software. The company is considering an acquisition or investment in Xamarin Inc., or other companies that enable mobile apps to run on different devices, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. Microsoft may also build those capabilities itself, one of the people said. </p> <p>', 'Microsoft Unveils Phone Software With Rival to Apple''s Siri', 'By Dina Bass and Ian King', 'Apr 02, 2014  2:48 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-02/microsoft-unveils-new-phone-software-with-rival-to-apple-s-siri.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Avolon Aerospace Leasing Ltd., the
private-equity backed aircraft financing company, has hired
JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley to explore a possible
initial public offering or sale, according to people familiar
with its plans. </p>
<p>Avolon, owned by Oak Hill Capital Partners LP, Cinven Ltd.,
and CVC Capital Partners Ltd., may seek a U.S. listing should it
opt for an IPO, said one of the people, who asked not to be
named because the discussions are private. The company, with the
youngest fleet of any large aircraft lessor and 198 planes in
its portfolio and on order, also counts Singapore''s sovereign
wealth fund among its investors, according to its website. </p>
<p>Avolon Chief Executive Officer Domhnal Slattery said last
year he was encouraged by transactions including Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc.''s $7.3 billion purchase of Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc''s aviation unit and that he would explore
strategic options as early as 2014. Companies in Europe have
raised about $17 billion in IPOs this year, more than triple
what they did a year earlier in the same period, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Representatives for Avolon, based in Dublin, Oak Hill,
Cinven, CVC, Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Growing Role </h2>
<p>Airfinance Journal reported earlier today that Avolon and
lessor Awas Aviation Capital Ltd. are exploring options for a
sale, with Awas hiring Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc. It didn''t identify bankers hired by Avolon to explore
options. </p>
<p>Airlines buying large commercial aircraft will require $100
billion in financing this year, according to Avolon estimates.
Lessors make up about 40 percent of the aircraft financing
market now, a figure that is set to rise in coming years. </p>
<p>To support growth, the companies rely increasingly on
external funding, including capital markets, and transactions
including lessors have picked up. In December, AerCap Holdings
NV (AER) agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corp. from American
International Group Inc. for $15 billion to create a lessor
rivaling General Electric Co.''s Gecas unit for size. </p>
<p>Avolon has raised $7.2 billion in capital since its launch,
with its four owners putting in $1.4 billion in equity
investments. Its most recent financing closed last month, when
it secured a $500 million debt facility to finance aircraft
purchases this year. </p>
<p>Mubadala Development Co., Abu Dhabi''s investment and
development company, is considering an initial public offering
for its Swiss SR Technics aircraft-maintenance business, people
with knowledge of the matter said this week. </p>
<p>Other lessor transactions in the last 24 months include the
purchase of Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK)''s Jackson Square Aviation
to Mitsubishi UFJ Lease  Finance Co. for about $1.1 billion,
and Babcock  Brown Aircraft Management''s sale of a 50 percent
stake in December 2012 to Onex Corp. </p>
<p>Slattery himself previously set up the RBS aircraft leasing
division, and left three years before it was sold to Sumitomo.
Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte agreed to enter Avolon
as a shareholder in October 2011, a little more than a year
after the lessor''s formation in May 2010. </p>

Industrija Nafte d.d. were also present in Zagreb as tenders
went out for 29 exploration blocks of Adriatic seabed, according
to Economy Ministry spokesman Tomislav Cerovec. </p>
<p>Croatia, which is seeking new revenue to revive its
economy, will close the tenders on Nov. 3. The terms are based
on a production-sharing agreement model with a five-year
exploration phase and a 25-year production phase. </p>
<p>''We have a great interest,'' Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak told reporters in Zagreb. ''A successful tender will
make Croatia a key gas and oil provider in this part of Europe,
and our gas will be the cheapest in the region.'' </p>
<p>Croatia, which joined the European Union in July, needs
investment to revive growth after five years of economic
recession. The country revised laws on hydrocarbon research in
June, easing the process for gaining permits to tap more of its
own resources and reduce dependence on Russian gas. </p>

<p>Croatia may also seek EU financing for a planned liquefied-natural-gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk, Vrdoljak
told Bloomberg News today. A location permit for the terminal
will probably be issued in June, he said. </p>
<p>INA is ''very interested'' in the tender, and may take part
in it alone or with a partner, Zoltan Aldott, head of the
management board at INA, told Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The blocks were drawn up after Norwegian seismic-data
company Spectrum ASA (SPU) completed the imaging of 35,000 square
kilometers (13,500 square miles) of Croatia''s seabed last year. </p>
<p>Croatia may hold as much oil and gas in the Adriatic Sea as
Italy does in the same branch of the Mediterranean,Vrdoljak
said on Oct. 29, citing initial results of the seismic mapping. </p>
<p>INA, Croatia''s largest refiner, operates offshore platforms
in the northern Adriatic with Edison SpA and Eni. Zagreb-based
INA, controlled by Hungary''s Mol Nyrt., has so far had a
monopoly on exploration in Croatia. </p>

London hedge-fund firm, as they try to profit from Europe''s
economic recovery. </p>
<p>Andrea Angelone, who spent 20 years at JPMorgan, and Amit Jain, previously an equity derivatives trader for the New York-based bank, both left last year to start a hedge fund with
Simone Russo, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing
director, and Guido Miani, previously a fixed-income trader at
UBS AG. The firm, Amagis Capital Ltd., will invest in companies
pursuing acquisitions, share buybacks and other transactions,
hoping to benefit from an increase in corporate activity as
Europe''s sovereign debt-crisis fades. </p>

Angelone, Amagis'' chief executive offer, said in an interview.
''After many years on the sell side we have the experience and
knowledge to be able to deploy a slightly different approach in
the event-driven space.'' </p>
<p>A growing number of traders have left banks for hedge funds
since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
prompted regulators to try to limit risk-taking by lenders.
Banks including JPMorgan shut proprietary trading desks after
the U.S. Congress approved the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, which
restricts lenders from using their own capital to make bets on
stocks and bonds. </p>
<p>''There is a gap that we can capitalize on'' with banks
moving away from proprietary trading, Angelone said. </p>
<p>Amagis will begin trading May 1 with $35 million from six
investors, Angelone said. The firm, which plans to open an
office in Monaco, seeks to manage $100 million by the end of

received in settlement from various plaintiffs, a Minnesota
court ruled March 31. </p>
<p>The ruling came in a case involving alleged unauthorized

<p>Nordea Bank AB (NDA) jumped to the top of
the Nordic region''s bond underwriter rankings in the first

<p>The largest Nordic bank underwrote $6.3 billion in bonds,
boosting its market share by 5 percentage points from a year
earlier to 12.7 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. SEB AB rose to second spot from fourth, grabbing 8

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will move its San
Francisco offices to the city''s largest tower as it relocates to
the heart of the financial district from the technology-heavy
South of Market area. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest software maker will move in December to
Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)''s 555 California St., San Francisco''s
largest building by square footage and second-tallest, said
Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft. He wouldn''t comment further on the relocation plans. </p>
<p>San Francisco is the ''center of the U.S. new economy''
after four years of sustained rent growth, according to
property-research firm Green Street Advisors Inc. Office rents
rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to
$57.21 a square foot on average, with vacancies little changed
at 11.3 percent, brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) said. Asking
rents have climbed 70 percent since 2010, when rates bottomed at
$33.57 a square foot. </p>
<p>''Microsoft had the ability to go anywhere in the city,''
David Greenbaum, president of Vornado''s New York office
division, said today in a telephone interview. The 555
California building is ''incredibly iconic both in San Francisco
and the country.'' </p>
<p>Microsoft will occupy about 50,000 square feet (4,600
square meters) on the second and third floors, said a person
with knowledge of the plans. Rent will be about $62 a square
foot for the two floors, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. </p>
<h2>Street View </h2>
<p>Greenbaum declined to comment on financial terms. He said
the tower''s second floor has 27-foot (8-meter) ceilings,
allowing Microsoft to establish a unique presence visible from
the street. </p>
<p>Asking rates in San Francisco''s north financial district
averaged $58 a square foot in the first quarter, up 7.8 percent
from a year earlier, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Microsoft''s Yammer Inc. unit, with 76,000 square feet in Twitter
Inc.''s headquarters building in the Central Market area, won''t
be affected by the parent company''s move, the person with
knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The 52-story tower between Montgomery and Kearny streets
has 1.5 million square feet of office space and 45,000 square
feet of retail, according to Vornado''s website. At 779 feet, the
building is surpassed in San Francisco only by the 853-foot
Transamerica Pyramid, according to property website Emporis.com. </p>
<p>The California Street high-rise, opened in 1969, is the
main building in a complex that was known as Bank of America
Center before the financial company moved to Charlotte, North
Carolina. The skyscraper was featured in the 1974 disaster film
''The Towering Inferno,'' according to Emporis. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. lender, agreed to sell its large-market 401(k)
recordkeeping business to a division of Canadian life insurer
Great-West Lifeco (GWO) Inc. Terms of the transaction weren''t
disclosed. </p>
<p>The deal will make Great-West the second-largest
recordkeeper of 401(k)-type retirement plans by participants,
serving 6.8 million workers with a combined $387 billion in
assets, the company said today in a statement from Winnipeg,
Canada. The largest provider of retirement recordkeeping
services, which include sending out account statements and other
communications to participants, is Boston-based Fidelity
Investments. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, whose recordkeeping business lags behind those of
firms such as Fidelity, Vanguard Group Inc. and Prudential
Financial Inc., is selling its unit as recordkeeping for
workers'' retirement accounts has become less lucrative for firms
that don''t have scale. The deal will catapult Great-West from
the seventh-largest recordkeeper of 401(k)-type plans by assets
in 2012, according to research firm Cerulli Associates, allowing
it to compete with the biggest firms. </p>
<p>''Bringing together these platforms allows us to be a
market leader,'' said Robert Reynolds, who was named last month
as president and chief executive officer of Great-West Lifeco
U.S., which owns Great-West Financial and Putnam Investments.
''You can make money in this business.'' </p>
<h2>''Top Priorities'' </h2>
<p>The sale is a shift for New York-based JPMorgan, whose head
of retirement, Michael Falcon, said in March 2011 that getting a
bigger share of retirement assets was ''one of the top
priorities'' at the bank. JPMorgan at the time had roughly
doubled its sales force dedicated to retirement plans including
pitches for its recordkeeping services. </p>
<p>''It''s not easy to see anything like this,'' Falcon, head
of retirement at JPMorgan''s asset-management unit, said in an
interview today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will continue to sell investments to retirement
plans, Falcon said. </p>
<p>''It''s a large and growing business on the investment
side,'' he said. </p>
<p>Americans held $23 trillion in retirement assets as of Dec.
31, of which $4.2 trillion was in 401(k) plans. Administrators
of 401(k)s are paid for their recordkeeping service also may
make money from investments in the plan if they are managed by
their own firm or through arrangements with other money managers
known as revenue-sharing. </p>
<h2>Cross-Selling </h2>
<p>Many recordkeepers also see the administration of 401(k)
accounts as an avenue for cross-selling other products to
workers such as individual retirement accounts when they retire
or change jobs. Those accounts usually have higher fees,
according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability
Office. </p>
<p>The proliferation of lower-fee products and more cost-conscious employers have contributed to declining expenses for
401(k) investments over the past 15 years, data compiled by the
Washington-based Investment Company Institute show. </p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close during the third
quarter of this year pending regulatory approval. More than
1,000 employees of JPMorgan''s retirement-services unit will move
to Great-West. </p>
<p>The deal won''t ''have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase''s
earnings, according to the bank''s statement. The two companies
said workers with accounts administered by JPMorgan should
expect no disruption. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is unfreezing a
money transfer from a Russian embassy in Central Asia to an
insurer linked to U.S.-sanctioned bank after getting a go-ahead
from regulators. </p>
<p>''Following consultation with our regulators, we are
processing this transaction,'' JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The reversal comes two days after Russia''s Foreign Ministry
decried the move by the biggest U.S. bank blocking a payment
from its embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan, to Sogaz Insurance Group
as ''illegal and absurd.'' Sogaz is part-owned by OAO Bank
Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender under U.S. sanctions
relating to the Ukraine crisis. </p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama announced the action against
Bank Rossiya last month as part of a broadening of sanctions
that targeted government officials and allies of Russian
President Vladimir Putin, whose associates own Bank Rossiya. The
embassy''s transaction was for less than $5,000, a person with
knowledge of the dispute said, asking not to be identified
because such transfers aren''t public. </p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said ''the hostile action'' by
JPMorgan bank was ''a grossest violation of international law,''
according to its April 1 statement. </p>
<p>A Bank Rossiya unit reduced its stake in Sogaz to 48.5
percent from 51 percent on March 11, according to a regulatory
disclosure on the insurer''s website. The U.S. added Bank Rossiya
and its billionaire shareholder Yury Kovalchuk to an extended
sanctions list on March 20 following Russia''s annexation of
Crimea. </p>
<p>Russia''s Finance Ministry picked JPMorgan last year to help
improve the country''s standing among U.S. credit-rating firms.
The bank was also short-listed to advise on the government''s
privatization program. </p>

globally, we are subject to specific regulatory requirements,''
New York-based JPMorgan said in an April 1 statement. ''We will
continue to seek guidance from the U.S. government on
implementing their recent sanctions.'' </p>

<p>Lenovo Group Ltd. (LNVGY) must convince
government officials that buying a server unit from
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) won''t give China back-door
access to U.S. secrets and infrastructure. </p>
<p>The wrinkle is that the Pentagon, the FBI and the nation''s
biggest telecommunications companies buy the IBM servers,
according to people familiar with the matter and an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<p>Use of the servers by the government, telephone networks
and other potentially sensitive customers will spark close
scrutiny from the interagency group known as the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the U.S., which investigates national-security risks of foreign acquisitions of domestic companies. </p>
<p>''It''s kind of the perfect storm of issues,'' said Anne
Salladin, a former Treasury Department official who worked on
CFIUS reviews and is now at Stroock  Stroock  Lavan LLP in
Washington. ''Any foreign acquirer with this kind of asset
purchase is very likely to be something that CFIUS would want to
take a look at.'' </p>
<p>Beijing-based Lenovo (992), which announced the $2.3 billion IBM
purchase Jan. 23, has formally sought approval for the deal from
CFIUS, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Acquisitions of U.S. businesses by Chinese buyers are rising,
increasing tension in Washington over Chinese access to U.S.
technology. CFIUS reviews can take as many as 75 days. </p>
<h2>Briefing Officials </h2>
<p>Lenovo fell 1 percent to close at HK$8.91 in Hong Kong. The
stock has lost 5.5 percent this year after advancing 34 percent
in 2013. IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $191.77 at the
close in New York. </p>
<p>Lenovo, which bought IBM''s personal computer business in
2005, has been briefing officials on the deal, pointing out that
it won''t have access to the servers because IBM will continue
maintenance on the equipment, according to a person familiar
with the matter. That agreement lasts for five years and could
be extended, said the person. </p>
<p>The service agreement may help ease the security review by
CFIUS, which examined more than double the number of
transactions by Chinese investors in 2012 than it did the
previous year, making them the most scrutinized foreign buyers
of American assets ahead of the U.K., according to the
committee''s most recent report to Congress. </p>
<h2>Breakup Fee </h2>
<p>''The government is going to take a look at the degree of
penetration of''the servers, where they are, how old they are,
what''the''reach-back capability might be,'' Mario Mancuso, an
attorney at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver  Jacobson LLP.
''Could they use the servers as a means of insertion''into U.S.
government networks and''data systems?'' </p>
<p>Lenovo agreed to pay a fee that''s more than double the
typical size should it fail to aquire IBM''s low-end server unit,
people familiar with the matter said in January. The breakup
charge of about $200 million, according to one of the people,
highlights the risk the Chinese company has chosen to bear for
its largest-ever purchase. </p>
<p>U.S. officials will also examine any use of the servers in
critical infrastructure, such as chemical plants and electric-utility companies, Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission. </p>
<p>''Exfiltration and infiltration are the issues,'' Wessel
said. ''Can they get access to servers in some way and take data
out or can they infiltrate the system to put in trap doors,
viruses, malware or be able to take down systems in a potential
conflict situation?'' </p>
<h2>Contract Data </h2>
<p>A Bloomberg Industries analysis of federal contract data
shows government purchasers of IBM BladeCenter servers include
the Pentagon, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. </p>
<p>Chris Padilla, the company''s vice president for
governmental programs, told Bloomberg in January that IBM
servers are used by the U.S. government, without identifying
which agencies. </p>
<p>Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Damien Pickart, a spokesman
for the Pentagon, acknowledged that the Lenovo-IBM transaction
is pending before CFIUS and added that the Defense Department,
which is a member of the committee, would be involved in the
deliberations. He declined to comment further and referred
questions to Treasury, which chairs the committee. </p>
<h2>Telephone Networks </h2>
<p>Holly Shulman, a CFIUS spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Spokesmen for the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security
didn''t respond to requests seeking comment. </p>
<p>The servers are also embedded in telephone networks
operated by ATT Inc. (T), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Sprint
Corp., according to three people familiar with the technology. </p>
<p>IBM spokeswoman Deirdre Murphy Ramsey declined to comment
on the Armonk, New York-based company''s clients. IBM is prepared
for a ''comprehensive review'' by CFIUS and is ''confident of a
positive outcome,'' she said. </p>
<p>Mark Siegel, an ATT spokesman, Richard Young, a Verizon
spokesman, and John Taylor, a Sprint spokesman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Lawmakers and the Obama administration have tried to
prevent China''s Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from doing
business in the U.S. A 2012 report by the House Intelligence
Committee cited security threats posed by Chinese
telecommunications companies and urged the government to block
transactions by Huawei and ZTE. The companies provide ''a wealth
of opportunities'' for Chinese intelligence agencies to insert
malicious hardware or software into U.S. telecommunications
networks, according to the report. </p>
<h2>''Deep Concerns'' </h2>
<p>Then U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke expressed ''deep
concerns'' to Sprint in 2010 that Huawei might win a contract to
upgrade the mobile-phone carrier''s network. </p>
<p>''Anything now with China gets attention,'' said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. ''But Lenovo, because it''s not a state-owned enterprise and because they''ve done deals successfully in
the past, they''re really well placed to get through.'' </p>
<p>Lenovo would get IBM servers that use x86 processors, an
industry-standard technology. The transaction includes
BladeCenter and Flex System blade-style servers -- slim devices
that slide into racks -- along with switches that run corporate
computer networks. IBM will keep its System z mainframes, Power
servers and other higher-end hardware. </p>
<h2>Working Cooperatively </h2>
<p>Lenovo is working cooperatively with CFIUS to win
clearance, spokesman Brion Tingler said in a statement. The
company has had three previous acquisitions cleared by the
committee, including the 2005 IBM deal. </p>
<p>While the companies say they expect to win clearance from
CFIUS, Lenovo will probably have to agree to restrictions on the
business, according to lawyers who advise companies on deals
that require U.S. security review. </p>
<p>Those agreements can include requirements that only U.S.
citizens handle certain services, independent audits, guidelines
for handling government contracts, and termination of certain
business activities, according to CFIUS''s most recent report to
Congress. </p>
<p>''This is not just some Chinese company you''ve never heard
of,'' said Stephen Paul Mahinka, a lawyer at Morgan, Lewis 
Bockius LLP. ''There are ways in which you can protect U.S.
interests while at the same time not preventing the
acquisition.'' </p>
<p>While servers can store large collections of sensitive
data, the risks associated with them are about the same as that
from laptops and smartphones, which consume the same data and
have access to the servers, said Michael Belton, a security
expert at cybersecurity company Rapid7. Once installed in a
network, servers are also more heavily defended and monitored,
he said. </p>
<p>''There isn''t a large difference between a server and a
laptop,'' Belton said. ''Modern laptops can and do store as much
sensitive data as a server.'' </p>

<p>Leon Black, who made billions by
buying up debt of companies in the U.S. and Europe that others
deemed worthless, is turning to emerging markets as the next
source of growth for his $161 billion money management firm. </p>
<p>Apollo Global Management LLC (APO), the private equity and
distressed debt specialist co-founded by Black, is starting a
unit to primarily buy investment-grade and high-yield corporate
debt from Latin America and Asia, according to Tolga Uzuner, the
41-year-old heading the group. The New York-based firm will also
invest in infrastructure, project financing and special
situations, said Uzuner, a former managing director in the
London branch of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s chief investment office. </p>
<p>Apollo and firms such as Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK) that
have largely focused on developed-market credit, are turning to
emerging markets, where the amount of corporate debt outstanding
tripled to $1.1 trillion over the past five years, according to
data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For Apollo, which
increased its credit business to more than $100 billion in
assets from $4 billion seven years ago by scooping up everything
from distressed assets to leveraged loans, this is one of the
largest untapped frontiers. </p>
<p>''There was a strategic decision that this was an asset
class that has the potential to move the needle at Apollo,''
said Uzuner. ''A lot of the credit-underwriting skills and
requirements for emerging markets are similar to those in the
firm''s other areas of focus.'' </p>
<h2>JPMorgan Background </h2>
<p>This will be the first time Apollo has created funds
dedicated to developing countries, though some investments were
previously made from buyout and credit funds, said Uzuner, who
Apollo recruited in October as he was looking to raise money for
his own hedge-fund firm, Brocade Capital Management. </p>
<p>Uzuner left JPMorgan last year, where his duties included
investing the bank''s excess cash in high-quality emerging market
corporate debt. The investment office was at the center of the
London Whale trading strategy that caused a $6.2 billion trading
loss for the New York-based bank. JPMorgan has said it will fold
the operation into its Treasury unit, according to an internal
memo obtained yesterday by Bloomberg. Uzuner, who also worked at
Bankers Trust and Credit Suisse Group AG, wasn''t involved in the
trades. </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve triggered a pullback from
emerging-markets in June, when the central bank signaled it
would reduce stimulus prompting international investors to pull
money out of assets considered more risky. The shift accelerated
as slowing economic growth in Brazil and China led to ratings
cuts and an increase in non-performing loans, with money only
recently returning. </p>
<h2>Apollo Hires </h2>
<p>Apollo also hired Stuart Firth, who worked at Brocade and
previously ran European distressed-debt trading at Credit
Suisse, and Richard Martin, founding partner of Longwood Credit
Partners LP. The firm plans to start multiple funds during the
next several years, said Uzuner, declining to comment on the
potential size of Apollo Emerging Markets LLC. </p>
<p>Apollo is expanding as some of the largest emerging
economies -- including Brazil --  decelerate, geopolitical
tensions escalate and corporate defaults increase, often in
countries where legal frameworks can heighten investment risk. </p>
<p>''Even places like Chile and Brazil, which are very highly
rated countries, have encountered a lot of defaults for a
variety of reasons, mainly failed government policies,'' said
David Hinman, the chief investment officer of SW Asset
Management LLC, a Newport Beach, California, firm that invests
in emerging-market corporate debt. </p>
<h2>Brazil Challenge </h2>
<p>The challenges in those markets were highlighted by one of
Carlyle Group LP''s first investments in Brazil. Real-estate
developer Urbplan Desenvolvimento Urbano SA, has been hit with
hundreds of lawsuits, in part for failing to complete home sites
across Brazil, according to court and regulatory filings.
Partners at the private equity firm have reached into their own
pockets to help rescue the investment. </p>
<p>The dollar-based default rate on Latin American corporate
debt soared to 7.6 percent last year from 2.5 percent in 2012
and 0.8 percent in 2011, according to data from JPMorgan. Hinman
estimates there is about $50 billion of distressed debt now
available in the region, including some $3.6 billion of dollar-denominated debt issued by Eike Batista''s Oleo  Gas
Participacoes SA (OGXP3), the Rio de Janeiro-based energy company that
filed for bankruptcy protection in October. The average yield on
a JPMorgan index of emerging market corporate bonds rose to 6.1
percent in September from a low of 4.4 percent in January 2013.
The yield has since dropped to 5.4 percent. </p>
<h2>Headline Risk </h2>
<p>''There are a lot of unknowns and a lot of headline risk,''
said Ted Neild, chief investment officer of Gresham Partners
LLC, which manages almost $5 billion for some 80 family offices
and set up Gresham Emerging Markets Strategies LP to increase
its allocation to the sector. ''But if we can get the right
companies at the right prices, we think there is a good long-term opportunity.'' The Chicago-based firm will primarily invest
in stocks instead of bonds. </p>
<p>Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York and Chicago-based
manager that oversees more than $1 billion of emerging-market
debt in separate accounts, anticipates continued pressure on the
sector. Still, it plans to increase the number of debt and
equity funds it devotes to developing economies. The firm is
adding capabilities as most other firms don''t commit new
resources, Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer for
Guggenheim Partners LLC, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<h2>Oaktree Investments </h2>
<p>A small number of distressed debt specialists are joining
that bet. Oaktree has raised $842 million for emerging market
corporate debt and has about $1 billion under management in
emerging-market equities, the Los Angeles-based firm said in
February. Cerberus Capital Management LP, the New York-based
firm run by Stephen Feinberg, incorporated Cerberus South
American Investments LLC this year to make potential investments
in the region, according to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>''Our emerging market debt strategy may well become one of
the most substantial parts of our business,'' John Frank,
Oaktree''s managing principal, said on an earnings call in
February. The firm had $83.6 billion in assets under management
as of Dec. 31, a figure that has more than doubled since 2006. </p>
<p>Apollo prides itself on being a contrarian. It got its
start from one of the best-known distressed debt opportunities
of the early 1990s, when the firm received financial backing
from the French bank Credit Lyonnais to bid on a portfolio of
junk bonds held by the insolvent Executive Life Insurance Co.
Black, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. banker, won the
auction with a bid of $3.25 billion, or about 50 cents on the
dollar, and ultimately reaped fees totaling as much as $350
million from the deal. </p>
<h2>Record Deal </h2>
<p>Last year the firm exited its investment from
LyondellBasell Industries NV, capping a gain of more than $10
billion, the largest ever for a private-equity deal, after
buying debt in the chemicals maker at the height of the
financial crisis. </p>
<p>Apollo now oversees $161 billion, as of Dec. 31 and Black
has an estimated net worth of $6.2 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Apollo shares fell 2.5 percent to
$31 at the close in New York, paring the gain to 29 percent in
the past year. </p>
<p>''It''s clearly a large market opportunity,'' Uzuner said.
''Emerging markets is deemed an asset class that has size, depth
and breadth.'' </p>

<p>The world''s largest pension fund
overhauled its Japanese stock strategy, adding new managers and
investment styles. </p>
<p>The 128.6 trillion yen ($1.24 trillion) Government Pension
Investment Fund will reduce passive investments based on the
Topix index and add the JPX-Nikkei 400 Index among new
benchmarks, the fund said today in a statement. Traditional
active investments will be trimmed to make room for smart-beta
strategies, according to GPIF. The JPX-Nikkei 400, a stock gauge
that is the brainchild of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
started in January. </p>
<p>''GPIF is changing in several ways, or at least I sense
their will to change,'' said Kazuyuki Terao, Tokyo-based chief
investment officer at Allianz Global Investors Japan Co. ''JPX-Nikkei 400 is designed to encourage investment in stocks with
high return on equity, which aims to change corporate governance
using the power of the market. Plus, they''re trying to boost
returns.'' </p>
<p>The strategy changes come amid pressure on GPIF, which has
more than half its assets in Japanese bonds, to achieve higher
returns to cover pension payouts for an aging population. A
panel handpicked by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last year
recommended that the fund move beyond passive stock investments
using the Topix as a benchmark. </p>
<p>GPIF selected 14 active and 10 passive investment managers,
eight of which had existing mandates from the fund, according to
today''s statement. It also said it will make passive and active
investments in Japanese real-estate investment trusts. The fund
will introduce a performance-based fee structure for active
managers, it said. </p>

<p>Experimental breast cancer drugs from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) slowed or halted growth of advanced tumors in studies, potentially adding a new treatment option for patients and top-selling therapies for the companies. </p> <p>Pfizer''s palbociclib doubled to 20.2 months the time in which patients'' advanced breast cancer didn''t progress, the drugmaker said today. In an unrelated study, Lilly''s drug, bemaciclib, aided 61 percent of patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer, meaning the size of their tumors shrunk by 30 percent or didn''t increase for 24 weeks. </p> <p>Doctors and investors have been awaiting results for the medicines, part of a class called cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors. The therapies offer a new treatment avenue for about 80 percent of patients whose breast tumors are hormone receptor-positive. Palbociclib is projected to sell $3.11 billion in 2020 as it expands to fight other cancers. </p> <p>''We took a new drug and asked how it works in a specific set of breast cancers based on science,'' said Richard Finn, an associate professor at the University of California at Los Angeles''s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and co-principal investigator of Pfizer''s study. ''This is really the type of benefit we''re aiming for, and it''s the type of benefit that results from a rational development program.'' </p>

<p>The Government Pension Investment
Fund revamped its 22.1 trillion yen ($214 billion) Japanese
stock portfolio, adding new managers and investment styles. </p>
<p>The world''s largest pension fund will reduce passive
investments that track the Topix index and add the JPX-Nikkei
400 Index among new benchmarks, according to an April 4
statement. Traditional active investments will be trimmed to
make room for smart-beta strategies, GPIF said. The JPX-Nikkei
400, a stock gauge that is the brainchild of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, started in January. </p>
<p>''We aimed for an overhaul that would show just what kind
of stock investment GPIF is targeting,'' Tokihiko Shimizu,
director of general of the research department at GPIF, said
April 4. ''We made bold changes.'' </p>
<p>The new strategy comes amid pressure on GPIF, which has
more than half its 128.6 trillion yen of assets in Japanese
bonds, to achieve higher returns to cover pension payouts for an
aging population. A panel handpicked by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last year recommended that the fund move beyond passive
stock investments using the Topix as a benchmark. </p>
<p>''GPIF is changing in several ways, or at least I sense
their will to change,'' said Kazuyuki Terao, Tokyo-based chief
investment officer at Allianz Global Investors Japan Co. ''JPX-Nikkei 400 is designed to encourage investment in stocks with
high return on equity, which aims to change corporate governance
using the power of the market. Plus, they''re trying to boost
returns.'' </p>
<p>GPIF selected 14 active and 10 passive investment managers,
eight of which had existing mandates from the fund, according to
last week''s statement. It also said it will make passive and
active investments in Japanese real-estate investment trusts. </p>
<p>The fund will introduce a performance-based fee structure
for active managers, it said. GPIF paid fees to domestic stock
managers equating to 0.04 percent of the assets they oversaw in
the year ended March 31, 2013. </p>
<h2>Smart Beta </h2>
<p>Smart beta occupies a middle ground between passive funds
and active management. Designers of the benchmarks used in the
strategy build their own indexes or change existing ones, trying
to boost returns by ranking companies not by price, but by
measures such as volatility and dividend payments. </p>
<p>GPIF''s three smart-beta managers will include Goldman Sachs
Asset Management Co., according to last week''s announcement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Asset''s benchmark is the SP GIVI Japan
index, which weights stocks based on their ''intrinsic value''
calculated by assessing the value of each company''s assets and
their forecast earnings growth, according to the website of SP
Dow Jones Indices LLC, which created the gauge. </p>
<p>GPIF said it named Diam Co., Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank
Ltd. and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust  Banking Corp. to oversee passive
JPX-Nikkei 400 investments, with BlackRock Japan Co. using the
MSCI Japan Index and Mizuho Trust  Banking Co. investing based
on the Russell Nomura Prime Index. </p>
<h2>Shares Drop </h2>
<p>The JPX-Nikkei 400 slid 6.3 percent this year through last
week, compared with a 6.6 percent decline for the 1,780 member
Topix and 7.5 percent for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. </p>
<p>''All shares were generally bought together in the past,
but that''s going to change, with some being chosen and others
not,'' Allianz''s Terao said. ''The government is trying to use
that to improve corporate governance and profitability. I hope
that''ll help improve Japan''s financial markets.'' </p>

<p>Disney Enterprises Inc., Warner
Bros. Entertainment Inc. and four other movie studios accused
the closed file-sharing service Megaupload.com of massive theft
of intellectual property in a copyright-infringement lawsuit. </p>
<p>While billing itself as a private data storage provider,
Megaupload.com functioned as a hub for uploading and downloading
copyrighted movies and TV shows, according to the complaint
filed today in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, which
names Megaupload Ltd., the owner of the Megaupload.com website,
company founder Kim Dotcom, a second company and two other
individuals as defendants. </p>
<p>Dotcom was accused in an indictment unsealed in January
2012 of belonging to a global criminal organization prosecutors
called Mega Conspiracy that was involved in copyright
infringement and money laundering and generated more than $175
million in illicit proceeds. </p>
<p>''When Megaupload.com was shut down in 2012 by U.S. law
enforcement, it was by all estimates the largest and most active
infringing website targeting creative content in the world,''
Steven Fabrizio, senior executive vice president and global
general counsel of the Motion Picture Association of America,
said in today in a statement. </p>
<p>Megaupload.com had ''a business model designed to encourage
theft -- and make its owners very rich in the process,''
Fabrizio said. </p>
<h2>''Bogus'' Claims </h2>
<p>''The @MPAA repeats bogus DOJ claims that we induced
copyright infringement. No. 1 reward rule published on MU site:
''No copyright infringement,'''' according to a post on Kim
Dotcom''s Twitter feed. </p>
<p>The studios'' lawsuit is a meritless re-hash of issues
raised in the criminal case, Ira Rothken, Dotcom''s San Rafael,
California-based attorney, said in a phone interview. ''We will
vigorously defend against the claims,'' he said. </p>
<p>Megaupload.com built up its library of illicit offerings by
encouraging users to upload movies and other entertainment
through an ''Uploader Rewards'' program. Amounts paid through
the program were based on how often pirated material was
downloaded for viewing by others, according to the studios''
complaint. </p>
<p>Megaupload.com made money by charging subscriptions
enabling faster downloads and by selling advertising on the
heavily trafficked website, the movie makers said in the filing. </p>
<h2>Rewards Program </h2>
<p>Rothken said the rewards program was limited to files that
are far too small to transmit movies. The studios'' assertion the
rewards program encouraged copyright infringement ''wouldn''t
pass the giggle test,'' he said. </p>
<p>Dotcom and two others named in the complaint, Mathias
Ortman, a German citizen, and Bram van der Kolk, a Dutch
citizen, are fighting extradition from New Zealand, according to
Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. </p>
<p>Ortman and van der Kolk provided technological expertise to
Megaupload and are part-owners of it, according to the suit. </p>
<p>In February, a New Zealand appeals court ruled that search
warrants used in a 2012 raid on Dotcom''s home were valid,
bolstering the U.S. effort to extradite him. </p>
<p>The suit also names Vester Ltd., a Hong Kong company of
which Dotcom is the sole shareholder. Vester is majority
shareholder of Megaupload Ltd. </p>
<p>Besides the unit of Burbank, California-based Walt Disney (DIS)
Co., plaintiffs in the case include Paramount Pictures Corp.,
Universal City Studios Productions LLLP, Columbia Pictures
Industries Inc. and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. </p>
<p>The case is Twentieth Century Fox v. Megaupload.com, 14-cv-362, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Alexandria). </p>

seeks a return to the capital markets, according to people with

worst jobless rate in the euro area attempts to sell bonds for
the first time since being shut out in early 2010, said the

<p>Greece''s Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras suggested last

selling debt has risen as bond yields have fallen to a four-year
low. Their optimism rests on the premise of persuading investors
that Greece will shake off a six-year recession. </p>
<p>The yield on Greek 10-year bonds has dropped below 6.2
percent from more than 30 percent in 2012. Greek securities have
returned 31 percent this year, the best performance among the 34
sovereign debt markets tracked by the Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. </p>
<p>Germany has welcomed the planned bond sale as evidence that
''confidence of the financial markets is returning'' to Greece,
Nadine Kalwey, a spokeswoman for Germany''s Finance Ministry,
said yesterday. </p>
<p>Greece''s financing situation has already benefited from a
budget surplus before interest costs of almost 3 billion euros
($4.1 billion), which the government expects the European
Union''s statistics agency to confirm this month. </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. and the U.K.''s
Department for International Development will contribute a
combined $20 million to a private-equity fund investing in
startup businesses operating in East Africa. </p>
<p>DFID''s Impact Fund, which is managed by CDC Group, a
development finance institution owned by the U.K. government,
will provide $15 million to Novastar Ventures and JPMorgan the
rest, the companies said today in an e-mailed statement. The
money will finance health care, education, housing, energy and
sanitation projects that are expected to reach as many as 2
million people over the next decade, they said. </p>
<p>''Private sector capital is crucial to economic growth in
East Africa,'' Peter Scher, head of corporate responsibility at
JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. ''There
is a recognition that governmental and aid organizations cannot
do this alone.'' </p>
<p>Investors should accelerate investments to build
infrastructure in Africa and form public-private partnerships
that will help improve economic and social conditions, Kenyan
President Uhuru Kenyatta said on April 2. </p>
<p>It marks the first investment released from the 75 million-pound ($124 million) Impact Fund announced by the U.K. in 2012
to provide capital to companies and programs that will generate
returns in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. </p>
<h2>Social Good </h2>
<p>Novastar is focusing its investments on ''early-stage
businesses that offer massive social benefits to low-income
households,'' Managing Director Steve Beck said on April 5 by
phone from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. </p>
<p>''Novastar will accelerate the existing investment program
of SpringHill Equity Partners, an informal investor circle that
has been making venture investments in East Africa,'' Beck said. </p>
<p>Novastar in March made its initial investment in Bridge
International Academies, which has built more than 250 schools
in Kenya, according to the statement. The Nairobi-based chain of
nursery and primary schools charges students an average of $5 a
month, according to its website. </p>
<p>''Market-based approaches, along with interested investors,
can attract the private sector capital necessary to create
change,'' Scher said. </p>
<p>Private equity funds invested more than three times as much
in sub-Saharan Africa last year as they did in 2012 as the
number of deals during the period rose to 84 from 58, according
to the 2014 East Africa Private Equity Confidence Survey
released by Deloitte. In East Africa, the number of deals in
Kenya last year was 12, five in Rwanda, and three each in Uganda
and Tanzania, according to the report. </p>

may be a good time to cut holdings of Chinese high-yield bonds
after the longest winning streak in six weeks. </p>

be more headlines noises to come out of China and expect to see
further credit differentiation.'' </p>
<p>Dollar-denominated junk bonds from the nation gained 0.95
percent in the seven days through April 4 for the second
straight weekly advance, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. While recent improvement in emerging-market
sentiment and China''s announcement of stimulus last week fueled
the rally, better-quality issuers remain Goldman''s preferred bet
amid continued concern about the world''s second-biggest economy,
according to the note. </p>
<p>China unveiled a package of measures to support the economy
including railway investment and tax breaks last week, as the
government seeks to bolster slowing growth. Exports (CNFREXPY) likely rose
4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the
median estimate of 37 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before
trade data this week, after the biggest drop since 2009 in
February. Manufacturing contracted a third month in March, an
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics gauge showed last week. </p>

<p>India''s main opposition party, which
leads in opinion polls ahead of federal elections, promised to
bring down one of Asia''s fastest inflation rates and expedite
foreign investment in most sectors except for multibrand retail. </p>
<p>Narendra Modi''s Bharatiya Janata Party said in its campaign
manifesto today it would create a price stabilization fund and
seek to ''rationalize'' interest rates for manufacturing. The
Hindu nationalist organization also said it would try to build a
temple on a disputed site, instill legal protections for cows
and pass a uniform civil code -- a step resisted in the past by
the country''s religious minorities. </p>
<p>''The BJP will be voted to power,'' Modi told reporters
today in New Delhi. ''Over the next 60 months, we will deliver a
government that will reverse the growth slowdown and fulfill the
desires and aspirations of Indians.'' </p>
<p>Opinion polls show Modi''s BJP will emerge as the largest
party while falling short of a parliamentary majority as voters
punish the ruling Congress party for rising vegetable prices,
graft scandals and the slowest economic growth in a decade.
Voting started today in the election and will continue through
May 12, with all ballots counted on May 16. </p>
<p>''We will bring back credibility and trust in government,
re-sowing confidence in the India story domestically as well as
internationally,'' the manifesto said. ''Through consistent,
long-term policies, we will not just spur the process of
economic growth, but also ensure that it is stable as well as
balanced.'' </p>
<h2>National Market </h2>
<p>The party said it would look to set up a national
agricultural market and take action against hoarders to bring
down inflation. It plans to give more power to states, create
consensus to implement a goods and services tax and develop
labor-intensive manufacturing. </p>
<p>The ruling Congress party, which is campaigning on the
party''s record of spending on programs ranging from cheap food
to guaranteed work in rural areas, promised in its manifesto to
give poorer voters a legal right to health care and housing.
Congress President Sonia Gandhi predicted her party would return
to power because opinion polls are unreliable. </p>
<p>Modi has promoted his image as a magnet for investment and
a record of stronger-than-average growth in the western state of
Gujarat, which he''s ruled since 2001. The state accounts for a
quarter of India''s exports and has attracted investment from
companies such as Ford Motor Co. (F) and Reliance Industries Ltd. </p>
<p>Modi has been attacked by opponents for failing to control
2002 riots in Gujarat. After Muslims set fire to a train,
killing Hindu activists, ensuing riots killed about 1,100
people, mostly Muslims, according to a government report by
Justice G.T. Nanavati and Justice Akshay Mehta. </p>
<p>Human rights groups including the Concerned Citizens
Tribunal say Modi failed to control the mob. Modi denies
wrongdoing and a panel appointed by India''s Supreme Court in
2012 found no evidence that his decisions prevented victims from
receiving help. </p>

<p>Holder made the comments in prepared remarks April 4 for a

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said its agents are
probing whether firms that conduct high-frequency trading get an
unfair jump on the competition by using computers and data lines
to gain access to non-public information. The bureau has taken
the unusual step of publicly appealing for traders and stock-exchange workers to blow the whistle on possible manipulation

<p>The practice drew extensive media coverage last week with
the publication of ''Flash Boys,'' a book on the topic by

insider trading that has led to 79 convictions of hedge-fund

<p>A project to double capacity of Colombia''s main coal railway is set to take another three years, according to the line''s operator, curbing government plans to boost exports of the fuel used by European power plants. </p> <p>Environmental permitting delays and opposition from local communities have held up work, Pat Ross, acting president of Ferrocarriles del Norte de Colombia SA, or Fenoco, said in an April 7 interview at the company''s Santa Marta offices. </p> <p>Subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Glencore Xstrata Plc and Drummond Co. are among companies that use the 246 kilometers (153 miles) of track to transport coal from northern mines to ports on the Caribbean coast, from where it''s shipped to Europe. A 46-kilometer stretch of single track still needs to be turned into double track, Ross said. </p> <p>''The second quarter of 2017 is the deadline at the rate we''re going, unless it''s expedited,'' he said. ''As long as you have one kilometer of single track, the inability to optimize our resources remains.'' </p> <p>Last year, the railway transported 44 million metric tons of coal, with a capacity under current contracts of 66.5 million tons, according to Fenoco. ''When the second line is completed the capacity will almost double,'' Ross said. </p> <p>Fenoco has spent $164 million since 2007 on an expansion that include a new high-tech signaling system, with a forecast total spend of $319 million. </p> <h2>Drummond Catchup </h2> <p>Companies working in the cement, oil and oil derivatives industries have expressed interest in using the upgraded line once it''s complete, Ross said. </p> <p>Colombian Mines and Energy Minister Amylkar Acosta said Feb. 20 that completion of the second line would help Drummond partially recuperate lost exports after the Birmingham, Alabama-based company failed to install a mandatory direct-loading system at its Caribbean port by a Jan. 1 deadline. </p> <p>The ministry didn''t reply to two e-mails and a voicemail seeking comment on the railway upgrade timeframe.

<p>Seven years after its acquisition by Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Pixar, the studio known for ''Toy Story'' and ''Finding Nemo,'' was facing three crises, according to a new book by its president, Ed Catmull. </p> <p>The cost of making animated films was rising, the DVD market was shrinking and there was a feeling among management that a tenet of the Pixar culture, employees'' freedom to speak their minds, was faltering, Catmull says in ''Creativity, Inc.,'' released today by Random House. </p> <p>After buying Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, Walt Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger put Catmull and Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter at the helm of both their studio and Disney''s animation unit. The wisdom of that decision has been evident in the unit''s success, including with the Oscar-winner ''Frozen,'' the top-grossing animated film of all time. </p> <p>Less well-known are what Catmull, 69, says were growing pains and soul-searching at Pixar. </p> <p>''How, we all wondered, could we maintain Pixar''s sense of intensity and playfulness, beating back the creeping conservatism that often accompanies success while also getting leaner and more nimble?'' Catmull writes. </p> <p>He quotes Lasseter as saying, ''There''s a lightness and a speed at Disney that I want to see more of at Pixar.'' </p> <h2>''Tough'' Criticism </h2> <p>Catmull and others in management assembled more than 1,000 employees in the atrium of its headquarters in Emeryville, California, for an event it called Notes Day in March 2013. </p> <p>Employees were asked in advance to share suggestions for topics, their complaints and ways for the company to improve. Lasseter received two-and-a-half pages of criticism. Among them were concerns he was so tightly scheduled that people wasted time overpreparing for meetings and that he carried his emotions from one meeting to the next, leaving some thinking he was mad at them when he wasn''t, according to the book. </p> <p>''Those two-and-a-half pages were really tough to read,'' Lasseter told employees that day, according to the book. ''But it was so valuable for me to hear, and I''m already working to correct those things.'' </p> <p>Brian Ferguson, a former Disney animator who left last year and now teaches at the California Institute for the Arts in Valencia, said competition for Lasseter''s attention was an issue at the studio. </p> <p>''It''s like children fighting over their parents,'' Ferguson said in an interview. ''He was being spread awfully thin. Any time anybody had with him was precious.'' </p> <h2>''Biggest Payoff'' </h2> <p>Catmull says in the book that one goal of Notes Day was figuring out how to cut costs by 10 percent. </p> <p>In November, Pixar fired about 5 percent of its 1,200 workers and closed a Vancouver, Canada, facility. The studio said at the time that it would delay the release of the film ''The Good Dinosaur'' until November 2015, making this the first year since 2005 that Pixar isn''t putting out a movie. </p> <p>Its last film, 2013''s ''Monsters University,'' grossed $738 million in theaters worldwide; its budget was $270 million, including the cost of distributing and marketing the film, according to Boxoffice.com. </p> <p>Employees discussed 106 topics in 171 sessions during the the Notes Day event, according to the book. Afterward, they were treated to beer and hot dogs. </p> <p>''I believe the biggest payoff of Notes Day was that we made it safer for people to say what they thought,'' Catmull said in his book. ''Notes Day made it OK to disagree.'' </p> <p>Disney fell 0.3 percent to $78.88 at 11:46 a.m. in New York.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s David Kostin has some good news, and some bad news. </p> <p>First, the bad news. There''s a good chance the U.S. stock market will see a 10 percent drop sometime during the next 12 months. Well, as far as precision goes, ''good chance'' is not good enough for a quant like Kostin, so he gives an exact probability: 67 percent odds of a 10 percent retreat from a peak in the next 12 months. </p> <p>Though quant work can be complicated, his rationale is actually quite simple -- the market has gone way too long without a so-called correction, or a drop of at least 10 percent from a peak. The biggest declines from highs this year and last year were about 6 percent, and it''s been 22 months since the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) saw a 10 percent drop. Mix in a little fancy math, and Kostin ends up with 67 percent odds we''ll see a correction in the next 12 months. </p> <p>Now for the good news, if you can call it that: He still expects the market to end the year higher, though not by much. Kostin is sticking with his year-end SP 500 forecast of 1,900, according to a note to clients dated yesterday. That implies a gain of less than 2.8 percent for the year and less than 3 percent from yesterday''s close.

The SP 500 will add another 4.8 percent on top of that to 2,200 in 2016, he predicts. </p> <h2>Ho Hum </h2> <p>Since the beginning of the year, Wall Street strategists have held firm to forecasts for a ho-hum market this year following last year''s 30 percent rally in the SP 500. The average projection on Jan. 3 called for a 5.8 percent gain to 1,955 in 2014, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By April 1, the mean forecast had only moved up six points to 1,961. </p> <p>It''s important to note in here that these oracles sort of missed the boat last year. The average estimate on Jan. 2, 2013, called for a 7.6 percent gain by the end of the year, while the SP 500 ended up jumping 30 percent to 1,848.36. Citigroup Inc.''s Tobias Levkovich was closest at 1,615, still more than 200 points off. Kostin forecast a 2013 close of 1,575, almost 300 points off. </p> <p>So if Wall Street strategists were meteorologists, last year they called for a few inches of snow and the market ended up getting a blizzard. This year, they''re calling for a dusting and so far they haven''t been too far off -- no accumulation. </p> <p>', 'Goldman Strategist Sees High Chance of 10% Market Drop', 'By Michael P.

<p>Microsoft pledged not to raise fees for its patents after

<p>Chinese regulatory approval follows sign-off from the

<p>''Chinese regulatory approval has been the remaining hurdle

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban''s re-election means
''unpredictable'' policies that risk weighing on growth, as the
nation''s bonds suffer East Europe''s worst returns after Russia. </p>
<p>Government bonds lost 1.6 percent this year in dollar
terms, while the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Sovereign Index
gained 1.6 percent. The forint weakened as much as 0.6 percent
from a two-month high and bonds dropped yesterday after Orban''s
Fidesz party won 67 percent of the seats in parliament in an
April 6 vote, according to preliminary results. </p>
<p>While Orban cut the biggest debt burden among former
communist European Union members, he roiled investor sentiment
in his last term by appropriating $13 billion of pension assets,
saddling banks with mortgage losses and driving out foreign-owned utilities. His ''unpredictable style of policymaking''
will last as his past policies ''weigh on Hungary''s growth
prospects,'' Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at
Goldman Sachs, said by e-mail April 6. </p>
<p>''Fidesz won''t really have an incentive to change its
economic policy after this victory,'' Zsolt Kondrat, head of
research at MKB Bank Zrt., a unit of Bayerische Landesbank, said
by phone from Budapest yesterday. ''And unless it does, there
won''t be much of a sustained gain in the forint or a drop in
yields.'' </p>
<h2>''Unambiguous'' Mandate </h2>
<p>MKB expects Hungary''s 10-year forint bond yield to rise to
6.2 percent by the end of the year from a close of 5.66 percent
yesterday and an average of 5.85 percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>Fidesz secured an ''unambiguous'' mandate to continue the
policy course it started four years ago, Orban said in Budapest
yesterday. The Economy Ministry declined to respond to e-mailed
questions regarding the government''s future policy. </p>
<p>Hungarian stocks underperformed peers in emerging markets
during Orban''s first term as his government changed the
constitution, levied extraordinary taxes on industries from
banks to telecommunications providers, and rejected concern over
the erosion of democracy as lobbying for foreign interests. The
BUX index tumbled 29 percent in the past four years compared
with a 3.2 percent retreat in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. </p>
<h2>Riskless Returns </h2>
<p>While gains of 39 percent on forint-denominated debt were
the best among the three major eastern European countries since
Orban took office in May 2010, those returns shrunk to a region-worst 6.6 percent when adjusted for price fluctuations,
according to the Bloomberg riskless return ranking. Polish debt
handed investors 9.4 percent and Czech securities 7.2 percent in
a risk-adjusted ranking of indexes from the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies in the period through the end of
last week. </p>
<p>Orban''s cabinet ''will continue to hold an unprecedented
degree of control over the direction of economic policies,''
Goldman''s Polan wrote. ''The government will press on with its
plans to extend the state''s control over the economy.'' </p>
<p>The premier has used the proceeds from the pension takeover
and industry taxes to keep the budget deficit below the EU
ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2011. GDP
grew 1.1 percent last year after contracting in 2012. Industrial
production increased 8.1 percent in February from a year
earlier, the biggest jump in three years, statistics office data
showed today. </p>
<p>Hungary''s Eurobonds are attractive as the economy picks up
and the yields exceed peers such as Romania, Gyula Toth, who
oversees $550 million of assets as a money manager at Ithuba
Gapital AG in Vienna, said by e-mail yesterday. </p>
<h2>Extra Yield </h2>
<p>The premium investors demand to hold Hungary''s dollar bonds
over Treasuries widened two basis points to 266 today, compared
with 198 for Romania, according to indexes from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. The forint strengthened 0.3 percent to 305.7 per euro by
9:31 a.m. in Budapest while yields on the government''s 10-year
local-currency debt fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 5.61 percent. </p>
<p>Hungary''s public debt burden fell to about 78 percent of
GDP last year from 82 percent in 2010, data from the European
Commission show. The country''s current-account surplus also
reached a record 2.9 billion euros in 2013, the central bank
said March 31. </p>
<p>While Orban''s policies helped reduce Hungary''s budget gap,
domestic yields fell too low after 20 consecutive months of cuts
in the benchmark interest rate to a record 2.6 percent,
according to Lutz Roehmeyer, a money manager at Berlin-based LBB
Invest overseeing $1.1 billion of developing-nation debt. </p>
<h2>''Too Low'' </h2>
<p>''Interest rates in Hungary are too low and politically
influenced by the new setup of the central bank,'' he said by e-mail yesterday. ''It doesn''t pay to go into Hungarian risk,''
said Roehmeyer, who has an underweight position on the country. </p>
<p>Gyorgy Matolcsy, the central bank''s president, was the
architect of much of Orban''s self-styled ''unorthodox'' policies
as the economy minister until March 2013. </p>
<p>The election gave an opposition alliance headed by the
Socialist Party 19 percent of the parliament seats, while the
Jobbik party, which wants a referendum on EU membership, secured
12 percent. Jobbik''s showing may embolden Fidesz to pursue
similar or even more drastic policies than it did in its last
term, Nora Szentivanyi, a London-based economist at JPMorgan,
said in an e-mailed report yesterday. </p>
<p>''Potential for renewed confrontation with the EU and
increasingly nationalistic rhetoric are risks worth watching,''
Szentivanyi wrote. </p>

<p>     April 9 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, had a ''tin ear'' when dealing with
regulators before settling probes into mortgage lapses and
trading losses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. </p>

<p>Koch Industries Inc. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.''s (GS) private-equity unit agreed to buy Flint Group
from CVC Capital Partners Ltd. to add chemicals and additives
used in the printing and packaging industries. </p>
<p>The transaction, which adds 137 sites, is expected to be
completed in the second half, the companies said today in a
statement, without giving financial terms. Flint, based in
Luxembourg, generates annual sales of about 2.2 billion euros
($3 billion). The asset fetched just over 2 billion euros,
according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined
to be identified. </p>
<p>The decision by Koch and Goldman Sachs to invest in the
business coincides with growing demand for packaging and
increased demand for newspapers in emerging markets. Flint,
along with DuPont Co. (DD) and MacDermid Group Inc., have been
gaining ground with flexographic printing plate technology for
packaging. </p>
<p>''Flint is uniquely positioned to capture growth in its
attractive printed packaging markets while at the same time
continuing to benefit from strong and resilient performance of
its print media business,'' said Matthias Hieber, head of
corporate equity investing for German-speaking operations at
Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division, in the statement.
''With a significantly improved capital structure, Flint is best
positioned to pursue its ambitious growth plans.'' </p>
<p>The sale marks the end of a years-long attempt by CVC to
exit Flint which became a market leader in the printing and
packaging additive industry via acquisitions. CVC shelved an
initial public offering in 2010 and abandoned another exit
attempt in 2012 after private-equity firms withdrew from a
bidding process, people close to the talks said at the time. </p>
<p>Greenhill  Co. advised CVC and Flint in the transaction
with Koch and Goldman Sachs. </p>
<h2>New Management </h2>
<p>CVC built the asset from two European ink companies bought
in 2004 from BASF SE and Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) and merged with Flint Ink
Corp. in the U.S. a year later to form the enlarged group. The
private equity company installed new management, appointing Akzo
Nobel executive Antoine Fady as chief executive in 2011, and
Steve Dryden as finance head last year from U.K. packaging
company DS Smith Plc. </p>
<p>For Koch, the purchase ties in with its ownership of
Georgia-Pacific LLC, which brings insight into the needs of
packaging makers. Koch, led by billionaire brothers Charles and
David Koch, is one of the largest closely held companies in the
U.S., with interests ranging from energy to fertilizers. </p>

<p>SodaStream International Ltd (SODA), the
Israeli maker of home soda machines, dropped to the lowest level
in two months after Stifel Financial Corp. said competition from
larger rivals will erode the company''s profits. </p>
<p>Shares of Lod, Israel-based SodaStream fell 3 percent to
$38.71 in New York, the lowest level since Feb. 7. Coca-Cola
Co. (KO)''s partnership with Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (GMCR) to introduce a
system for producing single-serve cold drinks will result in
''loss of shelf space,'' a group of Stifel analysts including
Jim Duffy, said in a note. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in Green
Mountain, a company developing a make-your-own, single-serve

weigh on margins while Chief Executive Officer Daniel Birnbaum
said Feb. 26 that he expects ''headwinds'' to remain after poor
holiday sales prompted the company to offer discounts. </p>

only defense suggesting a structural challenge for SodaStream

<p>The U.S. won''t issue a visa for an Iranian diplomat linked to the group that took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979, President Barack Obama''s spokesman said today. </p> <p>''We have informed the United Nations and Iran that we will not issue a visa'' to Hamid Aboutalebi, who was Iran''s choice for its next ambassador to the UN, White House press secretary Jay Carney said. ''The selection was not viable.'' </p> <p>The U.S. refusal brings to a head the standoff over Iran''s UN envoy, which comes amid delicate negotiations over the Islamic Republic''s nuclear development program. Carney said the decision won''t affect the nuclear talks with Iran, which also involve Russia, China, U.K., France and Germany. </p> <p>Hamid Babaei, spokesman for the Iranian mission to the UN, in an e-mail called the U.S. decision ''regrettable'' and said it was ''in contravention of international law, the obligation of the host country and the inherent right of sovereign member states to designate their representatives to the United Nations.'' </p> <p>He didn''t elaborate on further steps Iran may take. </p> <p>The U.S. decision follows votes by the House and Senate to bar Aboutalebi from the U.S. The decision on the visa is up to the executive branch, and Carney declined to say whether Obama would sign the legislation. </p> <p>''We are reviewing the legislation and will work to address any issues related to its utility and its constitutionality,'' Carney said. </p> <h2>Posing Threat </h2> <p>The bill doesn''t mention Aboutalebi by name. Instead, it urges denial of admission to the U.S. ''to any representative to the United Nations who has engaged in espionage activities against the United States, poses a threat to United States national security interests, or has engaged in a terrorist activity against the United States.'' </p> <p>Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran''s ambassador to Belgium and Italy, has been tied to a student group that led the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. responded to the takeover by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran. </p> <p>Carney and State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki refused to say explicitly why the visa was denied. However, Carney said that the issues raised in the congressional legislation and reports about Aboutalebi ''reflect our views.'' </p> <h2>President''s Authority </h2> <p>While the U.S. is obliged to grant entry visas to representatives of member states under the United Nations Headquarters Agreement Act approved by Congress in 1947, the U.S. president can deny visas to individuals deemed to pose a security threat to the U.S. </p> <p>The agreement says that the terms are applicable ''irrespective of the relations existing between the Governments of the persons referred to in that section and the Government of the United States.'' </p> <p>Some of the same legal questions came up in 2005 when Iran applied for a visa for then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to address the UN. The Department of Homeland Security initially found Ahmadinejad ineligible for a visa to enter the U.S. because of suspicions that he, too, participated in the embassy seizure, only to have the State Department grant it months later after interviewing former hostages. </p> <p>Since Iran doesn''t have an embassy in the U.S., its UN envoy is its most senior diplomat in the country. </p> <h2>Previous Cases </h2> <p>While the U.S. has previously denied visas for diplomats seeking short-term visits to attend meetings at UN headquarters in New York, UN officials and diplomats said they do not recall the U.S. barring entry for an envoy appointed to head a mission at the international body. </p> <p>Iran''s Fars News Agency reported on Sept. 22, 2012, that the U.S. denied entry visas for 20 Iranian officials seeking to attend a session of the UN General Assembly. </p> <p>In 1988, the U.S. denied a visa for Yasser Arafat, then-chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who wanted to speak before the UN General Assembly on the Palestinian issue. The U.S. government barred Arafat''s entry because he ''knows of, condones and lends support'' to acts of terrorism. The General Assembly session was moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where such visa issuance constraints do not exist. </p> <p>The U.S. and Iran have been inching toward repairing ties broken after the embassy takeover. Obama phoned his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, when the Iranian president was in New York last year for the opening of the UN General Assembly. It was the first direct contact between the leaders of the U.S. and Iran in decades. </p> <h2>Nuclear Agreement </h2> <p>One of the major goals of Obama''s foreign policy has been getting an agreement that would curb Iran''s nuclear development program. The U.S. and its allies contend Iran is moving toward the capability to build a nuclear weapon, which Iran denies. </p> <p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate panel this week it would take Iran two months to produce enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon. </p> <p>A six-month interim agreement reached between the so-called P5+1 and Iran ends in July. Diplomats have been meeting in Vienna on the next stage agreement. </p> <p>Among the issues being discussed are how sanctions on Iran would be lifted under a prospective accord. The international sanctions regime has been crippling Iran''s economy. </p> <p>', 'U.S. Rejects Visa for Iran Diplomat Linked to Hostages', 'By Margaret Talev and Sangwon Yoon', 'Apr 11, 2014  4:07 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-11/u-s-rejects-visa-for-iran-diplomat-linked-to-hostages.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Onex Corp. (OCX), Canada''s largest buyout
firm, paid Chief Executive Officer and founder Gerald Schwartz
$85.3 million in 2013 compensation, higher than payouts for the
top executives of Walt Disney Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Visa Inc.
combined. </p>
<p>Schwartz, 72, received an annual salary of $1.3 million, a
bonus of $24.4 million and $59.6 million in stock options -- his
first stock-option award in a decade --  the Toronto-based firm
said in an April 7 filing with Canadian regulators. By
comparison, Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger was paid $34.3 million
in annual compensation, while Visa''s top executive Charles Scharf received $24.2 million and Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent got
$20.4 million. </p>
<p>''The committee and the board are of the view that stock
options are an integral part of executive compensation and are
fundamental to the alignment of interests and the
incentivization of future performance,'' Onex said in its
filing, as an explanation for awarding Schwartz 3,950,000
options. </p>
<p>A message left with Onex spokeswoman Emma Thompson wasn''t
immediately returned. </p>
<p>Schwartz'' pay is more than any executive in the Standard
and Poor''s 500 Index this year, including Tim Cook, who received
compensation of $4.3 million as chief executive of Apple Inc.,
the U.S.''s biggest company by market value, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The data ranks the highest-paid
executives as reported in the summary compensation table for SP
500 companies with a fiscal year-end of Sept. 1, 2013 or later,
and have filed proxy statements for 2013 as of the market close
yesterday. </p>
<h2>Paid Options </h2>
<p>Onex said in its filing that Schwartz last received options
in early 2004 and exercised those last year, shortly prior to
their expiry. As a result, Schwartz ceased to hold any options
to buy Onex shares. </p>
<p>Onex has gained 26 percent over the past 12 months,
compared with a total return of 18 percent for the SP/TSX
Composite Index. </p>
<p>Schwartz also received $28.5 million in carried interest
payments, or his slice of investment profits, as well as $12.5
million from co-investments made with Onex, the filing said. He
also received about $2.8 million in dividend payouts from owning
20.1 million shares, according to calculations by Bloomberg.
That would lift Schwartz''s total from pay, investments and
dividends to about $129 million. </p>
<p>Blackstone Group LP chief Steve Schwarzman received $374.5
million last year in pay and cash dividends, according to a Feb.
28 company filing. Schwarzman was paid a $350,000 salary and got
$21.6 million in carried interest. He received $352.5 million in
cash distributions during the year from ownership of partnership
units in the New York-based firm he co-founded in 1985 as a
leveraged-buyout group. </p>
<h2>Stock Options </h2>
<p>Onex awarded stock options to senior managing directors due
to an ''evolution'' in the company''s management structure. The
firm last year appointed four senior managing directors -- Ewout Heersink, Robert Le Blanc, Seth Mersky and Anthony Munk -- along
with Schwartz to a newly formed executive committee, to help the
CEO guide the strategic direction of the firm. Le Blanc, Mersky
and Munk received a one-time grant of 850,000 options to buy
subordinate voting shares, the filing said. </p>
<p>''These option grants do not represent a routine practice
of the committee or the board, but rather were intended to
acknowledge an expectation as to the senior managing directors''
future contribution to growth and management of the firm,'' the
filing said. </p>
<h2>Munk''s Pay </h2>
<p>Le Blanc''s total compensation was $23.3 million, while Munk
was paid $19 million and Seth Mersky received $17.3 million, the
filing said. </p>
<p>Summary compensation tables are mandated by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and show some awards in the
year they''re granted rather than for the year they''re earned.
Some awards are restricted, vesting and paying out over a set
time frame, and the receipt of others may depend on future
performance goals. The summary compensation table also counts
changes in pension and the value of perks. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), a lightning rod
for environmental activists since the Valdez oil spill a
quarter-century ago, is appeasing some of its harshest critics
by agreeing to disclose internal risk and cost assessments. </p>
<p>Shareholders of the world''s second-largest corporation by
market value will vote on just one environmental resolution on
May 28, according to a proxy filing today. That''s after Irving,
Texas-based Exxon convinced activist investors to withdraw two
proposals dealing with greenhouse gas restrictions and hydraulic
fracturing. </p>
<p>Environmentalists and corporate-governance activists from
groups including the Sisters of St. Dominic and Arjuna Capital
have made Exxon''s annual meeting a focal point for objecting to
everything from drilling shale to producing motor fuels linked
to climate change. </p>
<p>This year, the company sought to head off criticism by
striking deals with some of its opponents after months-long
negotiations. On March 20, Exxon agreed to provide details on
oilfields and other assets whose value may be threatened by
carbon limits; two weeks later, the producer promised to
disclose risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking. </p>
<p>In exchange, resolutions on both issues were withdrawn by
their proponents. Exxon satisfied the first agreement on March
31 by issuing a report that said its oil and natural gas
reserves won''t lose value because demand for energy will trump
efforts to curtail climate change. </p>
<h2>Binary Outlook </h2>
<p>The fracking report will be released later this year, Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, said in an April 3 interview. </p>
<p>The disclosure agreements haven''t been enough to silence
all of Exxon''s critics. Mark Lewis, an analyst at investment
bank Kepler Cheuvreux SA in Paris, said the company still hasn''t
faced up to the risk that high-cost, carbon-intensive reserves
such as the tar sands in western Canada could deter some
investors who find it socially unacceptable. </p>
<p>''Exxon''s view of climate risk appears naively binary,''
Lewis said in a blog post the day after Exxon issued its
reserves-threat report. ''The reality is much more nuanced.'' </p>
<p>The environmental resolutions brought before investors at
last year''s annual meeting failed to garner enough votes to
succeed. </p>
<p>A proposal calling on Exxon to disclose risks associated
with shale drilling was supported by 30 percent of shareholders,
unchanged from 2012. A separate item on greenhouse gases
gathered 27 percent of the vote, also little changed from a year
earlier. </p>
<p>In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil
into Alaska''s Prince William Sound, devastating wildlife and
local businesses. Victims of the spill sued Exxon and won a $5
billion punitive damage award in 1994 that was cut to $507.5
million in 2008 by a divided U.S. Supreme Court. </p>

''Mortgage was under pressure and, despite the company warning about trading revenues in February, the 17 percent year-over-year drop in markets revenues feels softer than many were expecting,'' Morris said in an e-mail. </p>

<p>Achilles Macris, a former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) executive who oversaw the unit where a trader known
as the London Whale caused $6.2 billion in losses, won the
chance to respond to allegations he misled regulators. </p>
<p>Macris won a ruling that he should have been allowed to
provide comments to the Financial Conduct Authority before the
regulator published a report on Bruno Iksil''s losses. While
Macris wasn''t named, he had third-party response rights because
his identity could be determined, a finance tribunal in London
found. </p>
<p>Macris, who led the international chief investment office
at the bank, challenged the regulator over its findings in
October. The FCA found in September that the ''conduct of CIO
London management deliberately misled the authority about the
situation,'' according to the regulator''s notice on the fine. He
wasn''t mentioned by name. </p>
<p>Macris ''looks forward to challenging the findings made
against him in the final notice, which fail to take proper
account of the actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings
with the FCA,'' a spokesman for his lawyers at Clifford Chance
LLP said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The regulator is seeking permission to appeal the ruling,
it said in a statement today. If the request is rejected or
Macris wins on appeal, then he''ll be able to dispute the FCA''s
findings against him at the tribunal. </p>
<h2>Bad Bets </h2>
<p>The findings ''clearly identify and criticize him,'' his
lawyers said in a statement in October. ''Macris strenuously
denies the assertions made by the authority in the final notice
as being factually wrong. Those assertions fail to take proper
account of the actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings
with the authority at the relevant time.'' </p>
<p>Iksil''s bad bets led to $920 million in penalties from
regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and the FCA, which levied a 138 million-pound ($231 million)
fine. </p>
<p>Javier Martin-Artajo, a former JPMorgan banker fighting
extradition to the U.S. from Spain over the trading losses, is
also challenging the FCA at the finance tribunal. Martin-Artajo,
who oversaw synthetic credit trading at the CIO in London, filed
the case last month. </p>
<p>Martin-Artajo was indicted in Manhattan federal court in
September for allegedly helping to hide the losses caused by
Iksil. The SEC said in a parallel lawsuit that Martin-Artajo and
Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, engaged in a scheme
to enhance the portfolio''s apparent performance and thereby
curry favor with supervisors. </p>

<p>United Nations officials and
diplomats expressed concern that the Obama administration''s
denial of a visa to an Iranian diplomat linked to the 1979
American embassy takeover means the U.S. is less committed to
its role as host to the world organization. </p>
<p>The White House said yesterday that Hamid Aboutalebi won''t
get the visa he needs to enter the U.S. and serve at the UN
headquarters in New York. His selection by President Hassan Rouhani as the next Iranian ambassador to the UN was ''not
viable,'' said Jay Carney, President Barack Obama''s spokesman. </p>
<p>The Iranian mission to the UN called the move
''regrettable,'' and said it contravenes international law and
violates U.S. agreements with the UN and nations'' sovereign
right to designate their representatives. </p>
<p>Three UN diplomats and two UN officials, noting the Iranian
statement, said Aboutalebi''s case may make way for the U.S. to
use its authority more often to influence diplomatic
appointments to the UN. </p>
<p>The standoff over Iran''s UN envoy comes amid delicate
negotiations over the Islamic Republic''s nuclear development
program. While Carney said the decision won''t influence the
multilateral nuclear talks with Iran, the diplomats and
officials said this move affects the UN''s standing as a neutral
body and member states'' right to appoint envoys as they see fit. </p>
<p>Carney and U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki
refused to say explicitly why the visa was denied. However,
Carney said that the issues raised in congressional legislation
condemning Aboutalebi''s appointment ''reflect our views.'' </p>
<h2>Security Threat </h2>
<p>The U.S. House and Senate have passed a bill urging denial
of admission to the U.S. to any UN representative ''who has
engaged in espionage activities against the United States, poses
a threat to United States national security interests, or has
engaged in a terrorist activity against the United States.'' </p>
<p>Carney declined to say whether Obama would sign the
legislation, which cedes final decision on the visa to the
executive branch and doesn''t mention Aboutalebi by name. </p>
<p>Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran''s ambassador to
Belgium and Italy, has been tied to a student group that led the
takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. responded to the
takeover by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran, and since then
Tehran''s UN envoy has been its most senior diplomat in the U.S. </p>
<p>The U.S. government is obliged to grant entry visas to
representatives of member states under the United Nations
Headquarters Agreement Act approved by Congress in 1947. Even
so, the U.S. president can cite domestic laws to deny visas to
individuals deemed to pose a security threat to the U.S. </p>
<h2>UN Expectations </h2>
<p>While there are no international mechanisms that require
the U.S. to uphold its agreement with the UN over its domestic
laws, there is an expectation for the U.S. to adhere to
international accords, said the two UN officials who asked not
to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter. </p>
<p>The two officials said they see limited legal footing for
the U.S. argument that an incident decades ago still poses a
national security threat. One of the officials said if Iran were
to file an official complaint to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, that Ban would have to take a forceful stance to prevent
this incident from setting a precedent for the U.S. </p>
<p>One Western diplomat, who also asked not to be named due to
sensitivity of the matter, echoed the UN officials'' argument,
while adding that the visa refusal could be justified if there
were concrete intelligence on how sinister Aboutalebi''s role in
the hostage crisis was. </p>
<h2>Downplaying Participation </h2>
<p>Aboutalebi played down his involvement in the initial
occupation of the embassy in an interview he gave to the
Khabaronline news website in Iran. However, his photograph is
displayed on Taskhir, the website of the Muslim Students
Following the Imam''s Line, a group that took part in the embassy
takeover. Taskhir can mean both capture and occupation in
Persian. </p>
<p>According to Mohammad Hashemi, one of the students who led
the embassy occupation, Iran''s revolutionary government sent
Aboutalebi and Abbas Abdi, another architect of the occupation,
as emissaries to Algiers. The Algerian capital at that time was
a meeting point for third-world liberation movements, including
the Palestine Liberation Organization. </p>
<p>While the U.S. has previously denied visas for diplomats
seeking short-term visits to attend meetings at UN headquarters
in New York, UN officials and diplomats said they do not recall
the U.S. barring entry for an envoy appointed to head a mission
at the international body. </p>
<h2>Arafat''s Visa </h2>
<p>In 1988, the U.S. denied a visa for Yasser Arafat, then-chairman of the PLO, who wanted to speak before the UN General
Assembly on the Palestinian issue. The U.S. government barred
Arafat''s entry because he ''knows of, condones and lends
support'' to acts of terrorism. The General Assembly session was
moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where such visa issuance
constraints do not exist. </p>
<p>Iran''s Fars News Agency reported on Sept. 22, 2012, that
the U.S. denied entry visas for 20 Iranian officials seeking to
attend a session of the UN General Assembly. </p>
<p>The U.S. and Iran have been inching toward repairing ties
broken after the embassy takeover. Obama phoned his Iranian
counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, when the Iranian president was in
New York last year for the opening of the UN General Assembly.
It was the first direct contact between the leaders of the U.S.
and Iran in decades. </p>
<p>One of the major goals of Obama''s foreign policy has been
getting an agreement that would curb Iran''s nuclear development
program. The U.S. and its allies contend Iran is moving toward
the capability to build a nuclear weapon, which Iran denies. </p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate panel this
week it would take Iran two months to produce enough fissile
material for one nuclear weapon. </p>
<p>A six-month interim agreement reached between the so-called
P5+1 and Iran ends in July. Diplomats have been meeting in
Vienna on the next stage agreement. </p>

<p>ING Groep NV is the only bank left
predicting a 2014 interest-rate cut in South Korea. There may be
none soon as the call is reviewed after a Bank of Korea meeting
that prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to pull its forecast. </p>
<p>The central bank kept its benchmark rate at 2.5 percent at
an April 10 policy meeting and Governor Lee Ju Yeol said the
decision was unanimous. A recent slowdown in inflation was
mostly due to temporary factors and the monetary authority may
consider raising borrowing costs as price pressures build, Lee
told a press briefing that day. The bank lifted its 2014
economic growth estimate to 4 percent from 3.8 percent, and cut
its inflation projection to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent. </p>
<p>South Korea''s bonds have handed investors the second-lowest
returns in Asia excluding Japan this year, beating only the
Philippines, and the outlook for the securities may dim as rate-cut predictions are axed. Goldman described Lee''s tone as
''hawkish'' and said April 10 it was no longer expecting a 25
basis point reduction in the benchmark rate this year. Of 26
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 13 forecast the rate will be
raised at least once in 2014, while ING still sees a 25 basis
point cut in July. </p>
<p>''We are reviewing our current forecast for a possible
change,'' Prakash Sakpal, a Singapore-based strategist for ING
Bank, said in an April 11 interview. ''Governor Lee''s comments
after the policy meeting indicated the possible next move in the
benchmark rate would be up.'' </p>
<h2>Swap Strategy </h2>
<p>Investors should pay South Korea''s 10-year interest-rate
swap to ''position for expectations of higher rates,'' Ashish Agrawal, a Singapore-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG,
wrote in an April 11 research note. The contracts, which
exchange fixed payments for the three-month certificate of
deposit rate, fell six basis points last week to 3.29 percent in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The three-month
rate was steady at 2.65 percent. </p>
<p>Last week''s Bank of Korea meeting was the first since
Governor Lee Ju Yeol replaced previous chief Kim Choong Soo
whose term ended March 31. Lee has 35 years'' experience at the
central bank, which he left in April 2012 when a three-year term
as senior deputy governor ended. The latest announcements showed
the monetary authority sees inflation as a bigger risk than an
economic slowdown, Kwon Goohoon, Seoul-based economist for
Goldman Sachs, wrote in an April 10 report. </p>
<h2>''Hawkish Stance'' </h2>
<p>''The press conference confirmed Lee''s hawkish stance,''
Hwangbo Youngok, a Seoul-based director for Korea Investment 
Securities Co., one of the nation''s 21 bond primary dealers,
said in an April 11 interview. ''Still, the actual rate increase
will only happen after data matches Bank of Korea''s
expectations.'' Hwangbo predicts borrowing costs will be left
unchanged this year. </p>
<p>Consumer-price gains quickened to 1.3 percent in March from
February''s 1 percent, while remaining below the central bank''s
target band of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. Export (KOEXTOTY) growth
accelerated to 5.2 percent from 1.5 percent. </p>
<p>President Park Geun Hye unveiled in February a three-year
plan to boost the country''s growth potential through
deregulation and innovation. That signaled authorities seek to
support the economy through broader reforms instead of monetary
policy adjustments, according to ING''s Sakpal. </p>
<p>The yield on South Korea''s 10-year government debt fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this year to 3.53
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. South Korea''s won
appreciated 1.9 percent to 1,035.35 per dollar, touching
1,031.55 on April 10, the highest since August 2008. </p>
<h2>Rate Outlook </h2>
<p>The 10-year yield, which climbed 43 basis points in 2013,
will rise to 3.9 percent by year-end, according to a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. That would mark the first back-to-back
annual increases in Bloomberg data going back to 2000. </p>
<p>Barclays Plc recommends entering one-year interest-rate
swaps to position for an increase in borrowing costs. The
contracts declined two basis points this year to 2.69 percent. </p>
<p>''Expectations for rate increases aren''t reflected in the
interest-rate market yet as the market is still unsure of the
timing of monetary-policy normalization,'' Rohit Arora, a
Singapore-based strategist at Barclays, said April 11. ''We
expect the Bank of Korea to begin normalizing rates in the third
quarter, and see room for one-year interest rate swaps to rise
40 basis points in the next six months.'' </p>
<p>Bond yields haven''t yet risen on bets of potential policy
tightening by the central bank because ample cash supply in the
financial system is fueling demand, according to Moon Hong Cheol, a fixed-income analyst at Dongbu Securities Co. </p>
<p>''Investors still unsure of an economic recovery are
parking money in money-market funds and cash-management
accounts,'' which buy short-term bonds, Seoul-based Moon said.
''We see continued demand for mid- to long-term sovereign debt
from insurers.'' </p>
<p>The amount managed by money-market funds and cash-management accounts rose to 76.5 trillion won ($74 billion) as
of March 31 from 68.7 trillion won at the end of 2013, according
to central bank data. </p>

<p>Nickel prices rose, extending the
longest rally in 42 months, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
price is poised climb an additional 12 percent because of
limited supplies. </p>
<p>On the London Metal Exchange, nickel for delivery in three
months jumped 2.2 percent to settle at $17,790 a metric ton at
5:53 p.m. Earlier, the price reached $17,917, the highest since
Feb. 19, 2013. The commodity climbed for the 11th straight
session, the longest advance since Oct. 6, 2010. </p>
<p>The price may climb as high as $20,000 a ton, Goldman said
in a report dated yesterday. Nickel gained 28 percent this year
after Indonesia, the world''s top producer from mines, barred
exports of raw mineral ores in January. Russia, home to OAO GMK
Norilsk Nickel, the leading producer of refined metal, might
face more sanctions from the U.S. and Europe amid turmoil in
Ukraine. </p>
<p>''We have been bullish on nickel since the start of the
year, but prices have risen more quickly than in our base
case,'' Jeff Currie, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in the
report. ''The price rally predominantly reflects the ongoing
Indonesian ore export ban'' and ''concerns about the potential
impact of any sanctions on Russian commodity exports.'' </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. raised its 2015 estimate by 13 percent to
$21,500 a ton. </p>
<h2>Shortfall Looms </h2>
<p>While the market expects inventories in China, the largest
consumer, to last from eight to 12 months after the export ban,
most of those supplies are concentrated in the hands of the
larger nickel pig-iron producers, and smaller ones may begin to
run out of higher-grade Indonesian-sourced ore as soon as the
end of this month, Citigroup said. </p>
<p>Nickel open interest rose to a record 297,642 contracts as
of April 10. In March, the contracts outstanding jumped 18
percent, the most since September 2007. </p>
<p>The market ''remains in an artificially induced squeeze,
one that could propel prices even higher from current levels,''
Edward Meir, an analyst at INTL FCStone Inc. in New York, said
today in a report. The tension between Russia and Ukraine
''continues to merit increased attention, as it has the
potential to destabilize the markets, should it spiral out of
control,'' he said. </p>
<p>Zinc, lead and tin gained in London, while aluminum and
copper dropped. </p>
<p>On the Comex in New York, copper futures for May delivery

convertible debt since at least 1999, as the lenders took
advantage of a stock-market rally to fund overseas expansion. </p>
<p>The world''s largest underwriter of the notes helped to
arrange three of the firms'' five U.S. currency sales in the last
12 months. It co-managed deals by Yamagata Bank Ltd., Bank of
Iwate Ltd. and Shizuoka Bank Ltd., whose convertible offering
last April was the first by a Japanese company since 2002,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman had only
underwritten seven Japanese convertible-note sales in the decade
prior to 2013. </p>
<p>''Convertible bonds have established themselves as one
funding tool, so all regional lenders have no choice but to
consider them to some extent,'' Hiroyuki Sugiura, a vice
president at Goldman''s investment banking division at the
company''s Japanese unit in Tokyo said in an April 11 interview.
They offer the regional lenders cheaper funding, he said. </p>
<p>Abe''s stimulus program to overcome 15 years of deflation
has spurred a stock market recovery that has allowed banks to
get favorable terms on their convertibles, with the three
lenders all selling zero-coupon notes. The regional institutions
will use the funds to lend to clients expanding overseas as a
shrinking domestic population curtails growth prospects at home. </p>
<h2>Quickest Proposal </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs underwrote $330 million of the $1.3 billion
of dollar convertible bonds sold by regional banks over the past
12 months, a figure exceeded only by Nomura Holdings Inc. Morgan
Stanley, the next biggest overseas manager, managed $120
million, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Nomura, Japan''s largest
brokerage, arranged $585 million in debt, including an issuance
by Yamaguchi Financial Group Inc. </p>
<p>''Goldman was the quickest in bringing us a proposal,''
Katsunori Nakanishi, the president of Shizuoka Bank, said
yesterday in an interview. ''After looking at the success of our
deal, it became easier for other regional banks to follow.'' </p>
<p>Sales of convertible notes, which combine a fixed-income
security with an option to buy stock, have surged since Abe''s
stimulus program sparked a 51.5 percent gain in the Topix
benchmark index last year. While the index is down 13 percent
since the start of this year, it''s still higher than at any
point from 2009 to 2012. </p>
<p>Demand for Japanese convertibles has been 10 to 15 times
more than the amount of notes on offer since the beginning of
2014, Takashi Masuda, head of equity linked products at Goldman
in Tokyo, said in the same interview. Outstanding issuances have
fallen to about 1.5 trillion yen ($14.8 billion) from about 10
trillion yen in 2000, he said. </p>
<h2>Bond Returns </h2>
<p>Japanese exchangeable-note returns fell 3.9 percent this
year, following a 35 percent gain in 2013 which was their best
performance since 1999, data from UBS AG show. While the bonds
have insulated investors somewhat from stock-market declines,
they''re underperforming the 2.4 percent gain in convertible debt
globally. </p>
<p>All Japanese companies including Joyo Bank Ltd. sold $900
million in dollar convertibles so far this year, compared with
$1 billion for all of 2013. </p>
<p>''There are more than 100 companies in Yamagata with
overseas operations and we will use the money to help meet their
funding needs,'' said Nobuhiro Konno, the manager of the general
planning and coordination division at Yamagata Bank, based in
northern Japan. ''Since the sale of dollar convertibles by
Shizuoka, Iwate and Yamaguchi Financial, a lot of brokerages
came to explain the product, and that was the catalyst for our
sale.'' The bank sold $100 million of five-year convertible
debentures this month. </p>
<h2>Yen Convertibles </h2>
<p>Other regional banks including Nagano Bank Ltd. and Daisan
Bank Ltd. have issued yen-denominated convertibles this year,
with financial institutions accounting for the biggest amount of
sales by sector after industrials. </p>
<p>Shizuoka Bank''s dollar notes due 2018 can be exchanged for
shares at $13.46, or 18 percent above the closing stock price on
April 9 in dollar terms. The stock was at the equivalent of
$9.38 yesterday. Shares in Yamagata Bank closed at $4.01 April
14, compared with a conversion price of $5.09 on its 2019 debt. </p>
<p>''It''s cheap dollars, and all the larger regional banks are
trying to increase their U.S. dollar lending as their clients
increasingly venture overseas,'' Graeme Knowd, an associate
managing director who overseas financial institutions at Moody''s
Investors Service in Tokyo said in a phone interview. ''Given
they lend to Japanese corporates, they probably need to fund as
cheaply as possible.'' </p>
<h2>Abe Stimulus </h2>
<p>Abe came to power in December 2012 calling for fiscal
spending, deregulation and Bank of Japan monetary easing to
raise the inflation rate to 2 percent. BOJ stimulus has helped
weaken the yen more than 14 percent against the dollar since the
end of 2012, bolstering the overseas earnings of Japanese
companies. </p>
<p>The yen traded at 101.61 per dollar as of 5:22 p.m. in
Tokyo yesterday, while the benchmark 10-year bond yield was at
0.605 percent, the world''s lowest. </p>
<p>Non-yen-denominated lending by Shizuoka Bank rose 91
percent to the equivalent of 414.4 billion yen at the end of
last year, compared with a 5.5 percent increase in total loans
to 6.98 trillion yen. The bank said yesterday it will seek to
boost lending at overseas branches to $3 billion by March 2019
from an estimated $1.72 billion for the fiscal year just ended
as part of a medium-term plan. </p>
<h2>Biggest Underwriter </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs has been the biggest manager of global
convertible bonds for the last three years, underwriting about
$14 billion in 2013 including notes sold by Yahoo Inc., Tesla
Motors Inc. and Air France-KLM, Bloomberg-compiled data show. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank hasn''t underwritten any yen-denominated convertible bonds since it helped manage Sony
Corp.''s 150 billion yen issue in November 2012. Prior to that
Goldman helped manage one convertible bond deal each in 2009,
2008 and 2007, by Japanese issuers, the data show. </p>
<p>Convertible sales this year may exceed last year, said
Goldman''s Masuda, adding the bank is looking to underwrite both
yen and dollar-denominated deals. </p>
<p>''If issuance continues to climb, we''re confident of taking
market share,'' Masuda said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects
commodity prices to decline this year even after precious metals
and crop prices rallied on Ukraine tension and weather concerns. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index may drop 4 percent in
the next 12 months from a 4.3 percent decrease predicted in
February, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated
yesterday. Precious metals will decline 15 percent, compared
with a 14 percent retreat forecast in February, it said.
Agriculture prices will drop 10 percent, from February''s
estimate of a 9 percent loss, it said. </p>
<p>Gold rose 10 percent in 2014, rebounding from the biggest
drop since 1981, as unrest in Ukraine and concerns the global
recovery may be uneven boosted demand for a haven. Tensions in
Ukraine also contributed to corn''s 20 percent jump this year on
speculation supply may be disrupted and dry weather in the U.S.
pushed wheat 12 percent higher. The six-month rolling
correlation of commodities and equities returns has averaged 23
percent this year, the lowest since 2008, Goldman says. </p>
<p>''Since the beginning of the year, transient events
including cold weather, Chinese credit concerns and tensions in
Crimea have driven commodity prices,'' Goldman said. ''Although
these drivers are transient in nature, they are idiosyncratic,
which has helped to drive down the correlations not only with
other asset classes but also within the commodity space itself,
reinforcing the diversifying component of the strategic
investment case for commodities.'' </p>
<h2>Gold Forecast </h2>
<p>Bullion''s recent rally was spurred by poor U.S. data
probably linked to the weather and rising tension in Ukraine,
Goldman said, maintaining a year-end forecast of $1,050 an
ounce. With the tapering of the Federal Reserve''s bond-buying
program, U.S. economic releases will return as the driving force
behind lower prices, it said. </p>
<p>Corn will drop to $4 a bushel in 12 months on expectations
U.S. plantings will be higher than the U.S. Department of
Agriculture forecasts, increasing stockpiles, Goldman said.
Wheat will decline to $5.75 a bushel on production prospects in
Europe and the Black Sea, and normalization of U.S. rains, it
said. Soybeans may drop to $10.50 a bushel on record South
American output, slowing Chinese imports and as U.S. acreage
reaches an all-time high, it said. </p>
<p>Nickel may climb to as much as $20,000 a metric ton should
Indonesia''s ore export ban remain in place after its July
presidential election, according to Goldman. Prices in London
surged 28 percent this year as Indonesia, the largest miner of
nickel, curbed ore exports to spur local processing. Copper will
drop to $6,200 a ton over the next 12 months, it said. </p>
<p>Energy prices are set to decline 2.5 percent in the next 12
months, from a 3.5 percent drop forecast in February, Goldman
said today. Livestock will retreat 2 percent, from a February
forecast of unchanged prices, it said. </p>

<p>Western nations probably won''t
impose energy export-related sanctions on Russia amid escalating
tensions in Ukraine as Europe has little alternative to Russian
gas, according to Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>Europe could displace Russian gas imports for eight weeks
before prices need to rise to attract supplies of liquefied
fuel, Goldman analysts led by Jeff Currie in London said in an
e-mailed report dated yesterday. Spare capacity available on the
Nordstream pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea
wouldn''t cover lost volumes if Ukraine transit was disrupted,
Citigroup said in a separate report dated today. </p>
<p>Russia, the world''s biggest energy exporter, called for an
emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after
Ukrainian security forces clashed with pro-Russian gunmen in the
eastern town of Slovyansk. Ukraine is key to Europe''s energy
security because pipelines crossing the country carry Russian
gas making up about 15 percent of the region''s supply. </p>
<p>''In the worst-case scenario where energy flows are
disrupted, we would expect the European natural gas market to
tighten significantly,'' Goldman said. ''The global crude oil
market becomes better supplied with U.S. and OPEC ramping up
production on top of ample reserves today, suggesting a
deflationary rather than inflationary impact.'' </p>
<p>Camouflaged gunmen fired on Ukrainian government forces
near Slovyansk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) from the
Russian frontier, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said.
''Henchmen'' of the government in Kiev are organizing attacks
with the backing of Western nations, Russia''s Ambassador to the
United Nations Vitaly Churkin said at an emergency session of
the Security Council in New York. </p>
<h2>Gas Storage </h2>
<p>U.K. natural gas futures extended their biggest weekly gain
since 2011, paring their decline for the year to 23 percent
after the mildest winter in seven years cut demand and left
inventories brimming. Prices have been ''relatively
unresponsive'' to the tensions between Russia and Ukraine and
significant disruptions in Russian gas supply to Europe are
unlikely, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Gas stockpiles in Europe were 48.1 percent full yesterday,
compared with 20 percent at the same time last year, according
to data on the website of Gas Infrastructure Europe, a Brussels-based lobby group. Contracted supplies have continued to flow
''healthily'' to western Europe from its two main suppliers,
Russia''s gas-pipeline monopoly OAO Gazprom and Norway''s Statoil
ASA, according to Citigroup. </p>
<h2>Revenue Source </h2>
<p>''A stoppage of Russian oil and gas flows to/via Ukraine or
to Europe as a whole could be hugely impactful for oil and gas
prices, especially if it is long-lasting,'' said Citigroup
analysts including Edward Morse. ''A disruption of gas flows in
the short run would be muted by current high storage in Europe
due to the recent mild winter and the upcoming seasonal slowdown
in demand.'' </p>
<p>Gas exports to Europe are ''an important source'' of
revenue for Russia, making reductions unlikely, according to
Goldman Sachs. While Ukraine''s refusal to accept Russian gas
until prices are discounted has raised the risk of cut-offs, a
resolution is expected ''in the near term'' given the
consequences it could have for all parties, Citigroup said. </p>
<p>European gas prices may need to fall further to boost usage
in the power sector at the expense of coal, which could start to
happen when prices fall below 45 pence a therm ($7.53 a million
British thermal units), according to Citigroup. Front-month gas
on the National Balancing Point hub rose 2.1 percent to 53.2
pence a therm at 12:41 p.m. in London. </p>
<p>''We believe that U.K. NBP prices are not likely to be
unduly pressured,'' Goldman said. ''We still expect northwest
European gas markets to remain well supplied this year.'' </p>
<p>While a switch to gas may happen this summer, winter gas
prices will make burning coal more advantageous, Citigroup said,
forecasting U.K. prices at 56 pence a therm this year and 55
pence in 2015. </p>

<p>Gold''s 12-year bull run ended in 2013 as the Fed prepared
to reduce monthly bond-buying that fueled gains in asset prices
while failing to stoke inflation. Prices rose 10 percent this
year even as the Fed cut purchases, with Russia''s annexation of
Crimea and mixed U.S. economic data boosting haven demand. Last
year, Currie described gold as a ''slam-dunk sell'' for 2014. </p>
<p>''It would require a significant sustained slowdown in U.S.
growth for us to revisit our expectation for lower gold prices
over the next two years,'' Currie wrote in the report, dated
yesterday. ''While further escalation in tensions could support
gold prices, we expect a sequential acceleration in both U.S.
and Chinese activity, and hence for gold prices to decline.'' </p>
<p>Gold for immediate delivery traded 0.3 percent higher at
$1,322.01 an ounce at 7:43 p.m. in Singapore, according to

<p>Bill Gross just can''t catch a
break. As investors flock to funds designed to make money even
if interest rates increase, Gross''s Pacific Investment
Management Co. is alone among the biggest bond managers in
suffering withdrawals from the strategy. </p>
<p>In a category that''s been the most popular choice for
fixed-income investors this year, the Pimco Unconstrained Bond
Fund (PUBAX) has lost $2.7 billion to redemptions. Similar offerings
from Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
BlackRock Inc. have seen a surge of deposits from investors
seeking to avoid potential bond-market losses. The Pimco fund
has trailed a majority of peers over the past three and five
years, and has lagged behind most rivals over the past year. </p>
<p>''Pimco has kind of shot themselves in the foot here,''
said Steve Roge, a money manager with Bohemia, New York-based
R.W. Roge  Co., where he helps oversee $225 million. ''In a new
category where there are other choices, why is someone going to
look at a fund that has been a bottom performer?,'' said Roge,
who owns several Pimco funds but has no money in Pimco
Unconstrained. </p>
<p>The redemptions from the fund are particularly painful for
Pimco because bond managers are counting on the flexible
strategy to attract money as investors flee traditional funds in
anticipation of the end of a bull market in bonds. Gross''s Pimco
Total Return Fund (PTTRX) suffered record redemptions last year after
the 70-year-old manager misjudged the impact of the Federal
Reserve''s move to scale back its bond-buying program -- a
mistake echoed by the Unconstrained fund. </p>
<h2>Top Sales </h2>
<p>Non-traditional funds attracted $12.6 billion in the first
three months of 2014, with offerings from Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan and BlackRock collecting a combined $10.7 billion
through March, according to data from Chicago-based Morningstar
Inc. </p>
<p>Last year, $24.3 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund was
Pimco''s best-selling mutual fund as investors added $8.7
billion. Industrywide, unconstrained or flexible funds as a
group collected $55 billion last year. Intermediate funds, the
biggest category of bond funds, which includes Pimco Total
Return, saw withdrawals of $79 billion, Morningstar data show. </p>
<p>The redemptions over the past year mark a new phase for
Pimco, which has more than doubled assets since 2008 as
investors fled to the perceived safety of bonds following the
financial crisis. As that rally has come to an end, Gross and
the Newport Beach, California-based company he co-founded in
1971 have faced their share of challenges this year. </p>
<h2>El-Erian Departure </h2>
<p>In January, Gross''s heir apparent, Mohamed El-Erian,
unexpectedly announced his resignation as chief executive
officer and co-chief investment officer. His departure was
followed by reports of tension between the two. Gross lashed out
at El-Erian in a June meeting as performance stumbled and
withdrawals continued, two people familiar with the matter said
this year. </p>
<p>Pimco Total Return suffered record redemptions of $41.1
billion last year and lost its title as the world''s biggest
mutual fund. Clients pulled an estimated net $3.1 billion from
the fund and $7.3 billion from all of Pimco''s U.S. mutual funds
in March, according to Morningstar. Pimco''s assets under
management declined to $1.94 trillion as of March. 31, from a
peak of $2.04 trillion last March. </p>
<p>Pimco Unconstrained''s former manager, Chris Dialynas, said
in December that he was going to take a sabbatical. Gross took
over the management of the fund, highlighting the importance of
the strategy to the firm. Dialynas, who joined Pimco in 1980,
had run the fund since it was created in June 2008. </p>
<h2>Gross Overhauls </h2>
<p>When Gross took over management, he made changes including
extending the effective duration, or sensitivity to interest
rates, as well as jettisoning 30-year Treasuries (USGG30YR) and most of the
agency mortgage bonds. The duration of the fund more than
doubled to 4.1 years in December before falling back to 2.1
years as of March 31, Pimco''s website shows. </p>
<p>Orange County Employees Retirement System voted Jan. 29 to
put the Unconstrained strategy on a watch list for change in key
personnel after investment consultant NEPC LLC said it had
''elevated'' concerns following the management change. </p>
<p>Flexible funds can buy anything in the fixed-income realm,
from emerging market debt to credit default swaps, and they also
have the ability to bet against rates, which means they make
money if rates climb. </p>
<h2>''Wide Net'' </h2>
<p>''We can cast a wide net, long or short,'' said William
Eigen, manager of the $26.3 billion JPMorgan Strategic Income
Opportunities Fund, (JSOAX) which passed Pimco Unconstrained in March to
become the biggest of what are considered non-traditional bond
funds. </p>
<p>While the Unconstrained Bond fund has the flexibility to
navigate across the fixed-income spectrum, it wasn''t able to
avoid losses last year because, along with other Pimco funds, it
is guided by the firm''s world view on everything from the global
economy to interest rates. Gross, in a December interview posted
on Pimco''s website, said a model portfolio established by the
firm''s investment committee is the driving force behind the
positioning of its funds. </p>
<p>The Unconstrained Bond fund was hurt last year by holding
intermediate and long-dated bonds when former Fed Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke in May hinted that the central bank might scale back
its bond-buying program. The subsequent increase in interest
rates caused those bonds to lose value. The fund also suffered
losses in its holdings of emerging-market debt, according to a
December regulatory filing. </p>
<h2>Trailing Peers </h2>
<p>Pimco Unconstrained fell 2.6 percent last year, lagging
behind 84 percent of peers, Morningstar data show. The fund''s
assets have declined 16 percent since July 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Pimco Unconstrained has had ''unexciting,'' results, Eric Jacobson, an analyst for Morningstar, wrote in an email. </p>
<p>''It''s also possible that the recent drama at Pimco is
having some effect,'' said Jacobson, referring to the departure
of El-Erian. </p>
<p>Sabrina Callin, the product manager for Pimco''s
Unconstrained Bond strategy, which has $46 billion in assets,
said it is not a surprise that some rival funds have done
better. </p>
<h2>Shunning Credit </h2>
<p>''Many of the funds in this universe are very credit-oriented, especially high-yield credit,'' said Callin in a
telephone interview. ''People who have had that risk exposure
have done well.'' Credit generally refers to corporate debt,
which is sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy. </p>
<p>Pimco Unconstrained has never been focused on corporate
credit or other risk assets, she said. It is designed instead to
preserve capital and limit losses in falling markets. </p>
<p>U.S. high-yield bonds returned 7.4 percent in 2013,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The Pimco
fund had 2 percent of its money in junk bonds as of Dec. 31 and
had a bet against the bonds as of Sept. 30, according to data on
Pimco''s website. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Eigen said his fund had more than 40 percent of
its money in high-yield bonds at the beginning of 2013. He cut
that allocation to 25 percent as of Feb. 28, according to the
fund''s website, as the bonds rallied. JPMorgan Strategic Income
Opportunities Fund climbed 2.8 percent in 2013, ahead of 74
percent of rivals, according to Morningstar data. </p>
<h2>Goldman Beats </h2>
<p>The $20.7 billion Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX),
which gained 6.1 percent last year to beat 97 percent of peers,
was generally bullish on corporate bonds in 2013 on the
assumption the debt would do well in an improving economy,
Jonathan Beinner, manager of the fund said in a telephone
interview. The fund had 5.1 percent of its money in high-yield
bonds as of Dec. 31, data from Goldman''s website show. </p>
<p>The $14.8 billion BlackRock (BLK) Strategic Income Opportunities
Portfolio, which rose 3 percent last year, had a 21 percent
allocation to bonds rated BB or lower, below investment grade,
as of Dec. 31, a blend of high-yield bonds, bank loans and
emerging-market debt, the firm said. </p>
<p>The Pimco fund has also had a different take than rivals on
the maturities of bonds it prefers. Last year, the fund held
intermediate and long-term bonds. This year, according to
Pimco''s website, the fund has invested at the front-end of the
yield curve, usually defined as bonds with maturities of 1-5
years, and has bet against longer-dated bonds. </p>
<p>In 2014, the fund has advanced 1.3 percent, with the
second-best returns of the four biggest flexible funds, trailing
only the BlackRock fund. In March, shorter-term bonds fell as
the Federal Reserve suggested it could begin raising interest
rates in 2015. The bonds have rallied in April. </p>
<h2>Rieder''s Approach </h2>
<p>Rick Rieder, manager of BlackRock Strategic Income, took
the exact opposite approach to Pimco''s. He avoided longer-term
debt in 2013, which helped his performance, he said in a
telephone interview. He bought those bonds this year, another
plus, and bet against bonds with between 3 years and 7 years of
maturity. </p>
<p>''There are not a lot of cheap assets out there so you have
to be nimble,'' said Rieder. </p>
<p>The Goldman and JPMorgan funds are both wagering that rates
in general will climb this year. </p>
<p>''We are believers in an economic rebound, and you have to
think rates will normalize as is the economy does,'' said Eigen.
Goldman expects rates to rise in the U.S., and the United
Kingdom, said Beinner. </p>
<h2>Low Inflation </h2>
<p>Gross has argued the Fed will be in no rush to raise rates
because inflation remains well below the central bank''s target
of 2 percent. </p>
<p>At Pimco, Callin said the goal of the Unconstrained Bond
fund is to produce good risk-adjusted results over the long
haul. In the past three years, the fund''s risk-adjusted results
were the lowest among the four funds, according to the Bloomberg
Riskless Return Ranking. The BlackRock fund ranked first,
followed by the Goldman fund. </p>
<p>''Pimco may not get every call right every day or every
year,'' said Callin. ''But we have a good long-term record of
getting things right for investors.'' </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent can exhale now. </p>
<p>The world''s largest soda maker today showed signs of a
rebound in the first three months of the year, easing the
concerns that arose when the company unsettled investors with
surprisingly sluggish global sales in the fourth quarter.
Earnings met estimates, sales volume in North America halted its
slide, and sales gains were strong in markets such as China. </p>
<p>After the fourth-quarter report, Kent promised improvement
and implemented a cost-cutting program that''s already showing
some progress. Global sales volume rose 2 percent, and an
emphasis on new package sizes helped boost pricing by 2 percent. </p>
<p>Add it all together and profit excluding some items was 44
cents a share in the three months ended March 28, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola said today in a statement. That matched the average of
18 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income fell
7.5 percent $1.62 billion, or 36 cents a share, from $1.75
billion, or 39 cents, a year earlier. </p>
<p>''We don''t think this is a great result, but satisfying as
one step in the right direction to restore momentum,'' Kent said
during a conference call. </p>
<p>Volume in North America was little changed in the first
quarter, compared with a 1 percent decline in the fourth
quarter. Sales on that basis strengthened in emerging markets,
including a 12 percent gain in China. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella touted new products at an event in San Francisco for the third time in as many weeks, part of an effort to re-establish the software maker as an innovator. </p> <p>Nadella, who took the top job in February, unveiled new tools and software for sifting through large amounts of data to identify trends and patterns at a meeting with developers today at the Bentley Reserve Building. </p> <p>The company has been rolling out products for corporate clients that are seeking to manage Web-linked devices and crunch the information they generate. Nadella, who took the top job in February after leading the cloud and enterprise group, is working to remake Microsoft for an era where mobile gadgets have become central, corporations run software from remote servers and household electronics get more connected. </p> <p>''The most imporant thing is to create a data culture,'' Nadella said at the event. </p> <p>Analytics tools are in demand as a greater number of hardware devices, from personal-fitness monitors to thermostats to industrial equipment, connect to the Web, generating a sea of data. By 2020, the amount of information created may reach 5,247 gigabytes per person, according to Microsoft. That''s twice as many bytes of data than liters of water in the world''s oceans, the Redmond, Washington-based company said last month. </p> <p>''It''s yet another boost to the volume of data,'' said Dan Vesset, an analyst at researcher IDC, referring to the surge in smart devices.

<p>Iran filed a complaint to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressing ''serious concern'' over the Obama administration''s refusal to grant a visa to an Iranian diplomat tied to the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. </p> <p>Ghollamhossein Dehghani, the acting head of the Iranian UN mission, submitted a letter yesterday requesting that the UN General Assembly take up the matter, mission spokesman Hamid Babaei said in an e-mail. </p> <p>Dehghani will meet Ban''s legal adviser, Miguel de Serpa Soares, today in New York, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said by phone. </p> <p>The U.S. refusal is ''in breach of their legal obligations under international law'' and its accord with the UN, Dehghani wrote, according to excerpts of his correspondence provided by Babaei. ''This decision of the U.S. government has indeed negative implications for multilateral diplomacy and will create a dangerous precedence.'' </p> <p>The complaint came three days after President Barack Obama''s administration said that Hamid Aboutalebi won''t get the visa he needs to enter the U.S. and lead the Iranian delegation at UN headquarters in New York. Efforts to improve strained ties between the U.S. and Iran have been damaged by the standoff over Iranian President Hassan Rouhani''s choice of Aboutalebi amid multinational negotiations over the Islamic Republic''s nuclear program. </p> <h2>International Law </h2> <p>Iran asked Ban to help resolve the dispute and gain U.S. admission for its designated envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the official Islamic Republic News Agency earlier yesterday. </p> <p>Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran''s ambassador to Belgium and Italy, has been linked to the student group that led the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. responded by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran, and since then Tehran''s UN envoy has been its senior diplomat in the U.S. </p> <p>Refusing a visa to ''a representative of a UN member-state is in contravention of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, including the principles of sovereign equality of states and respect for their sovereignty and political independence,'' Dehghani said in the letter. </p> <p>Dehghani urged that the issue be addressed in an ''extraordinary and urgent manner'' by the General Assembly''s Committee on Relations with the Host Country, a 19-member group that manages UN diplomats'' immigration, security and visas. </p> <h2>''Security Threat'' </h2> <p>The committee will hold a meeting on April 22 where the Iranian delegation will brief members on the matter, the UN''s Dujarric said, citing information provided by Nicholas Emiliou, Cyprus''s ambassador to the UN who is chairman of the committee. </p> <p>In 1988, the U.S. denied a visa to Yasser Arafat, then-chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who wanted to address the UN General Assembly because he ''knows of, condones and lends support'' to acts of terrorism. The General Assembly session was moved to Geneva, where such visa constraints don''t exist. </p> <p>Following a formal appeal to the committee by the PLO, the UN''s legal office ruled that the U.S. was required to grant the visa under its 1947 agreement with the UN. </p> <h2>U.S. Law </h2> <p>The accord ''does not contain a reservation of the right to bar the entry of those who represent, in the view of the host country, a threat to its security,'' according to the ruling. </p> <p>The U.S. Congress in 1947 approved the Headquarters Agreement Act, which obligates the American government to grant visas to UN diplomats. Even so, a U.S. president can cite domestic laws to deny visas to individuals deemed to pose a security threat. </p> <p>While there are no international mechanisms that require the U.S. to uphold its agreement with the UN over its domestic laws, there is an expectation for the U.S. to adhere to international accords, said two UN officials who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. </p> <p>', 'Iran Complains About U.S. Visa Refusal for Envoy', 'By Sangwon Yoon', 'Apr 15, 2014  1:34 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-15/iran-complains-about-u-s-visa-refusal-for-envoy.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is gaining
ground in the debt markets of Gulf Cooperation Council states
after the biggest U.S. bank helped manage this month''s Islamic
bond sale by Saudi Arabia''s utility. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the biggest bond underwriter after HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) in the six-nation GCC in 2014, its best start to a
year since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
New York-based lender advised on six deals, including Saudi
Electricity (SECO) Co.''s $2.5 billion sukuk sale on April 1. </p>
<p>Its jump from sixth place in the rankings at the end of
2013 partly reflects the rise of Islamic finance, which will
become a $2.7 trillion market by 2017, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Sukuk made up more than 70 percent of
total bond issuance this year in the GCC, which supplies one-fifth of world oil, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>''Islamic finance now has the biggest slice of the bond
market,'' Samer Mardini, a vice president of fixed income at SJS
Markets Ltd. in Dubai, said in a phone interview yesterday.
''Issuers are more comfortable with big names like JPMorgan.
They can act as market-makers and bookrunners to ensure a
successful issuance.'' </p>
<p>JPMorgan hired former UBS AG banker Hussein Hassan last
year to head global Shariah-compliant financing. It has also
''intensified its focus on corporate clients'' needs in the Gulf
region over the past few years,'' Hani Deaibes, head of Middle
East and North Africa debt capital markets at the bank, said in
an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. </p>
<h2>Rate Clarity </h2>
<p>''This effort, combined with more market certainty, has
better positioned us to assist them in raising funding across
the international and domestic markets.'' </p>
<p>International bond-market conditions have become
''conducive'' since the start of the year as the U.S. Federal
Reserve provided more clarity on interest rates, encouraging
companies to raise long-term funding, he said. </p>
<p>Saudi Electricity raised $1 billion in 30-year sukuk and
$1.5 billion in 10-year securities. HSBC and Deutsche Bank AG
also worked on the transaction. Deutsche Bank is the region''s
third-biggest underwriter this year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. </p>
<p>The GCC has become a battleground for international banks
as other parts of the Middle East and North Africa struggle to
recover from political turmoil following a series of popular
uprisings that first erupted in 2011. </p>
<p>Economic growth in the oil-rich Gulf region is set to
accelerate to 4.4 percent this year, compared with 2.8 percent
for non-oil producers, according to HSBC forecasts released in
January. </p>
<h2>Sales Drop </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s performance has come even as bond sales dropped
almost 50 percent this year to $8 billion as some regular
issuers, such as cash-flushed banks, refrain from tapping the
market and offer cheaper loans to companies, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan said Hassan, previously global head
of Islamic structuring for UBS, is focusing on clients in
countries including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, according to an
e-mailed statement at the time of his appointment in January
2013. Malaysia hosts the world''s biggest market for Islamic
bonds, or sukuk, while Saudi Arabia boasts the world''s biggest
share of Shariah-compliant assets. </p>
<p>More Saudi borrowers may still issue debt after Fitch
Ratings upgraded the kingdom one level in March to AA, the
third-highest investment grade, according to John Sfakianakis,
chief investment strategist at MASIC in Riyadh. </p>
<p>''The recent sovereign upgrade should also help issuers who
are looking for more competitive pricing,'' he said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. Economic growth in Saudi
Arabia may accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2014, from 3.8 percent a
year earlier, according to economists'' estimates provided to
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has helped arrange bond sales for Saudi Arabia''s
National Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, Qatar
National Bank QD, as well as Kuwait Projects Co., data compiled
by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>''At the end of the day, it''s all about being competitive
in pricing against the rest,'' Sfakianakis said. ''That''s the
only way it can be done in a market that is price sensitive.'' </p>

two-week low after JPMorgan Chase  Co. lowered the debt of
Latin America''s third-largest retailer to hold, saying a
downgrade to junk would force some funds to sell. </p>
<p>The securities due in 2023 dropped 0.47 cent to 96.38 cents
on the dollar at 4:40 p.m. in New York, according to data

<p>JPMorgan reduced its recommendation on Cencosud''s bonds
maturing in 2021 and 2023 to the equivalent of hold, citing the
possibility that Moody''s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings may
lower their ratings on the Santiago-based company from Baa3 and
BBB-, just one level above junk. The ratio of adjusted net debt
to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
is 4.1, compared with 3.5 or less for an investment-grade
company, according to JPMorgan. </p>
<p>''It is worth taking profits given the higher uncertainty
around a potential downgrade,'' JPMorgan analysts Daniela Savoia
and Julio Arantes said in an e-mailed research note to clients.
A rating cut below investment grade would require some funds to
sell the securities and ''drive spread widening in the short
term,'' they said. </p>
<p>The company''s total debt rose to $7.4 billion at the end of

Corp. (IBM) was sued by Iusacell SA, Mexico''s third-biggest mobile-phone provider, for $2.5 billion in lost profits tied to a 2010
deal that failed. IBM claims the lawsuit is intended to avoid
arbitration over the contract. </p>
<p>Iusacell consulted with IBM in connection with a multiyear
plan to increase market share and revenue, the company said in a
heavily redacted complaint filed today in Manhattan federal
court. Iusacell alleged IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations
that caused it to suffer damages and lose profits. </p>
<p>''IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully
concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during
the parties'' relationship,'' Iusacell said in the complaint. The
public version of the filing doesn''t explain the alleged
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>IBM said today that Iusacell and IBM Mexico entered into a
''long term contract under which IBM Mexico made significant
investments in Iusacell''s business operations'' that resulted in
''major improvement to Iusacell''s information technology
infrastructure and growth in Iusacell''s revenues.'' </p>
<p>The matter is in arbitration, said Doug Shelton, a
spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM. </p>
<p>Iusacell, co-owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas and by
Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the country''s largest broadcaster, has
struggled to compete with larger rivals such as America Movil
SAB (AMXL) and Telefonica SA. (TEF) The company had 8 million subscribers at
the end of 2013, or about 8 percent of the market. </p>
<p>Televisa recorded a fourth-quarter loss from joint ventures
of 4.74 billion pesos ($363 million), mostly to write down the
value of Iusacell. It acquired its 50 percent stake in the
company from Salinas for $1.6 billion in 2012 and invested an
additional 1.59 billion pesos last year. </p>

<p>RedBird Capital Partners LLC, co-founded by a former leader of the private-equity business at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is seeking $400 million for a debut
fund to help back entrepreneurs and business owners. </p>
<p>Gerald Cardinale, 46, the former co-head of Americas
private-equity funds at Goldman Sachs, and Earl Rotman, 58, are
targeting a first close of about $150 million within weeks, said
a person with knowledge of the fundraising, who asked not to be
named because the information is private. The two started the
firm last year and will mainly invest in media and
entertainment, sports, communication-infrastructure and
consumer-goods companies. </p>
<p>Cardinale spent most of his career at Goldman Sachs, where
he managed more than $6 billion in investments, including a
stake in Yankees Entertainment  Sports Network, which was
founded in 2001 to broadcast the games of the New York Yankees
baseball team and New Jersey Nets basketball team. In 2007, he
worked with Yankees third-baseman Alex Rodriguez to help
negotiate a new contract, people familiar with the matter said
at the time. </p>
<p>Adrian Maizey, chief operating officer at New York-based
RedBird, declined to comment on fundraising. </p>
<p>Cardinale and Rotman worked together for the first time in
2006, when Goldman Sachs''s private-equity unit and CanWest
Global Communications, which was led by Leonard Asper, looked to
purchase Canadian media company Alliance Atlantis
Communications. Cardinale helped structure the deal, while
Rotman represented the Asper family. </p>
<h2>Leaving Goldman </h2>
<p>In 2012, Cardinale, known as Gerry, along with two other
senior employees of Goldman Sachs''s merchant bank left as the
bank prepared for regulations that would limit its investments
in private-equity funds to 3 percent. Cardinale joined merchant
bank BDT Capital Partners, where he decided he wanted to back
entrepreneurs and business owners so left the firm and teamed
with Rotman to form RedBird, said the person. </p>
<p>Rotman had built a business before, when he co-founded
Genuity Capital Markets in 2005, which merged with Canaccord
Financial Inc. in 2010. </p>
<p>The debut RedBird fund will make equity and structured
equity investments of $30 million to $80 million, according to a
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. It will target
companies with $25 million to $50 million of earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, said the person,
and will also make lifestyle, hospitality and gaming
investments. </p>
<p>RedBird is gathering commitments as first-time funds find
it harder to attract capital. Debut pools raised $5 billion in
the first quarter, the lowest amount in that period since the
financial crisis, according to London-based researcher Preqin
Ltd. Investors have been narrowing the number of managers they

<p>Foreign aid has long been one of
the most unpalatable dishes on the federal plate. Why should
U.S. taxpayers give billions of dollars to ungrateful countries
that will waste it and whose people don''t like America anyway? </p>
<p>Quietly, though, the U.S. Agency for International
Development has been undergoing a market-oriented sea change
that has attracted fans such as Amy Bell, an executive director
of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), and hundreds of Wall Street veterans. </p>
<p>''They''re really showcasing the power of business to do
well and do well in a prudent way,'' said Bell, the head of
principal investments for JPMorgan''s Social Finance unit in New
York, in a telephone interview. ''I think they''ve done a
remarkable job.'' </p>
<p>The U.S. government''s global anti-poverty agency backs a
private equity fund that Bell''s JPMorgan unit runs for African
agriculture businesses. It helped General Electric Co. (GE) secure
$10 million in local financing for small maternal-health clinics
in Kenya. It''s supported loans by Root Capital, a social-investment fund, to help coffee farmers in Latin America supply
Starbucks Inc. (SBUX) </p>
<p>It''s a sea change for an agency that for years simply gave
out money. The program, called the Development Credit Authority,
was begun in 1999 under President George W. Bush with authority
from Congress to provide loan guarantees, but in the 10 years
before 2011 it backed only $2.2 billion in credit. Since 2011,
the authority has issued $1 billion in guarantees. </p>
<h2>Shrinking Funding </h2>
<p>That''s still a fraction of the aid agency''s effort. AID has
seen its funding shrink from $22.5 billion in fiscal year 2010
to $20.4 billion in fiscal 2014, not adjusted for inflation. The
Obama administration has asked Congress for $20.1 billion in
fiscal 2015. </p>
<p>''Our developmental objectives -- ending extreme poverty in
15 years, ending preventable child death, ending large-scale,
widespread child hunger -- will only be achieved if we can
effectively harness and deploy massive amounts of private
investment against those goals,'' said Rajiv Shah, the agency''s
administrator. </p>
<p>When Shah and Ben Hubbard, former director of the credit
authority, arrived in January 2010, they saw an underutilized
asset. </p>
<p>''We don''t look at these problems and say, ''How do we get
the appropriations budget to solve this?'''' Hubbard said in an
interview. ''It''s, ''How do I attract the private sector to get
this done, because it''s inherently more sustainable?'' Rather
than building and paying for solar power plants, we can attract
private capital to pay for them.'' </p>
<h2>Former Bankers </h2>
<p>The agency''s credit authority, with a few dozen ''private
sector, deal-oriented'' former bankers and financial analysts,
has brought tools from Wall Street to hone a model that Shah
said he hopes will transform not only development work, but also
the thinking in his agency. </p>
<p>Since 2011, the credit unit has leveraged private capital
to help companies expand while assisting some of the world''s
most vulnerable people. </p>
<p>The credit authority guaranteed an $8 million loan by New
York-based JPMorgan to the African Agricultural Capital Fund,
which helped attract equity investors and boost the Uganda-based
fund to $25 million. The arrangement allowed the bank to
experiment with a new market, lending to the small- and medium-sized businesses that are the engine of economic growth. </p>
<h2>Republican Applause </h2>
<p>The private-sector approach has drawn applause from critics
of foreign aid such as Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who''s praised the credit agency''s ''proven
track record of significantly leveraging private financing in
support of development aid,'' even as she''s called for cuts to
other parts of the foreign aid budget. </p>
<p>The development credit agency works in a number of ways.
Most often, it encourages banks in developing countries to loan
to smaller businesses, usually in underserved sectors such as
farming that align with U.S. development goals, by sharing the
risk if there''s a default. </p>
<p>''There''s a lot of wealth in these banks, but they''re risk-averse,'' said Hubbard. ''We don''t take out all the risk, so
they have skin in the game, but we lower it.'' </p>
<p>When Nereus Capital LLC was struggling for funds, the
credit authority partnered with U.S.-based institutional
investors to help raise a $100 million investment in the Mumbai-based company''s fund for clean-energy projects. </p>
<h2>Deploying Wealth </h2>
<p>''Learning how to deploy that wealth to tackle development
challenges, environmental challenges in India, is how we will
solve extreme poverty and its consequences of child hunger and
child death there,'' said Shah, 41, who earned a medical degree
from the University of Pennsylvania and previously was chief
scientist for the U.S. Agriculture Department and worked for the
Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation. </p>
<p>The credit authority''s default rate has been 1.89 percent,
with the aid agency paying out $11.6 million in claims since
1999 and collecting $14.1 million in bank fees. It also provide
credit enhancement to companies such as Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Root Capital, which identified a gap in
financing for farmers'' cooperatives that were too large for
microcredit loans and too small for bank loans. </p>
<p>The cooperatives use the funding to help small farmers
improve their yields, reduce post-harvest losses -- enhancing
food security -- and earn more by selling collectively to
companies such as Seattle-based Starbucks, the world''s largest
operator of coffee shops. </p>
<h2>Loan Guarantees </h2>
<p>This year, the president has asked Congress to raise the
annual cap on the credit authority''s loan guarantee program to
$2 billion from $1.5 billion. It''s an idea whose time had come,
Hubbard said. </p>
<p>Still, change is sometimes difficult, Shah acknowledges.
The aid agency, created in 1961 by an executive order from
President John F. Kennedy, has 9,421 people worldwide who are
steeped in a culture of giving money away, not raising it. Now,
Hubbard said, overseas missions are being held accountable to
targets for attracting private capital to fund their programs. </p>
<p>''There''s a huge amount of enthusiasm and excitement, and
also resistance in any system to doing things in new and
innovative ways,'' Shah said. </p>
<p>One solution has been to recruit Wall Street veterans to
the government aid agency, with almost 1,000 joining since the
end of the Bush administration, Hubbard said. </p>
<p>Reasons for signing up vary, said Hubbard, who has left the
agency to start a firm funding businesses in Africa. ''Some lost
their jobs because of the financial crisis and found purpose in
our mission,'' he said. ''Others could command a bigger salary
elsewhere, they just didn''t have a lot of purpose and meaning in
those positions.'' As a group, he adds, they''re ''very counter-cultural inside the agency.'' </p>
<h2>Cairo Reality Show </h2>
<p>These ''field investment officers'' work across the
agency''s ''silos,'' Hubbard said, bringing a financial viewpoint
to help health or agricultural specialists figure out how to
bring private capital into their programs. </p>
<p>Chris Lee, a former energy trader from Newtown,
Connecticut, now works as a field investment officer in Cairo,
where he''s developed a loan program for small- and medium-sized
businesses, helps run a local reality TV show about
entrepreneurs, and is looking at ways to support business people
in the informal economy. </p>
<p>''It''s amazing how simple ideas can be effective,'' he
said. </p>

<p>Paul Flowers, the former chairman
of Co-Operative Bank Plc, was charged with possession of
cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine, almost a month after the
lender said it would post a full-year loss of as much as
1.3 billion pounds ($2.2 billion). </p>
<p>Flowers, 63, is scheduled to appear at a criminal court in
Leeds, England, on May 7 to face the charges, the U.K. Crown
Prosecution Service said in a statement today. Flowers, who was
arrested in November as part of a drug investigation after he
was filmed buying crack cocaine by a U.K. newspaper, was
released on bail, West Yorkshire Police said in a statement. </p>
<p>''I have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it
is in the public interest to charge Paul Flowers with possession
of Class A and Class C drugs relating to an incident on Nov. 9,
2013,'' prosecutor Clare Stevens said in the statement. </p>
<p>Regulatory and government probes are also in the works
after the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported Nov. 17 that Flowers
bought crystal meth and crack cocaine. Flowers, a Methodist
minister, was Co-Op Bank''s chairman from March 2010 until June
of last year. </p>
<p>Co-Operative Group Ltd., the bank''s parent, ceded control
of the lender to bondholders in October to help plug a 1.5
billion-pound capital shortfall. The bank said last month it
will raise an additional 400 million pounds after discovering a
capital shortfall tied to mounting legal and restructuring
costs. </p>
<h2>''Stupid and Wrong'' </h2>
<p>After Flowers'' arrest and the parent company ceded control
of the bank, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne ordered
an independent inquiry. The investigation won''t start until it''s
clear it won''t prejudice any probes by the U.K. Prudential
Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. </p>
<p>David Masters, a spokesman for the bank, didn''t immediately
respond to a request for comment. Flowers'' lawyer also didn''t
immediately respond to a request for comment on the charges. </p>
<p>Flowers apologized for his conduct in a statement after his
arrest last year, saying there had been a death in the family
and pressures related to the bank. </p>
<p>''At the lowest point in this terrible period, I did things
that were stupid and wrong,'' Flowers said in the November
statement. ''I am sorry for this, and I am seeking professional
help, and apologize to all I have hurt or failed by my
actions.'' </p>
<p>Ketamine, also known as Special K, has pain-killing and
stimulant properties and causes users to become detached from
themselves, according to charity DrugScope. </p>
<p>A second defendant in the case, Gavin Woroniuk, was charged
with four counts of offering to supply a controlled drug and one
count of possessing criminal property, prosecutors said. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) executives said
consumers who listen to ESPN radio and interact with the sports
channel''s websites spend triple the amount of time with the
company as those who just watch the TV network. </p>
<p>Fans who take part in ESPN.com''s fantasy football or use
the Watch ESPN app are with the company 17 hours a month on
average, versus five hours for people who only watch TV. The
data demonstrate that online and mobile offerings boost
engagement with ESPN, as well as the potential for ad sales,
executives told analysts today at ESPN''s offices. </p>
<p>''It''s exploded the misconception that digital media would
cannibalize television,'' Arthur Bulgrin, ESPN''s senior vice
president of global research and analytics, said at the investor
event in Bristol, Connecticut. ''The overall time spent with
ESPN media more than triples and at the same time TV viewing
goes up. It''s a rising tide that floats all boats.'' </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, is using
the event to showcase ESPN, one of the company''s most profitable
businesses, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
said. </p>
<p>A new studio ESPN plans to begin using next month for its
flagship ''SportsCenter'' news show is a ''great example of us
investing in the value of a franchise, investing not only to
continue to protect it but to continue to grow its value,'' Iger
said. </p>
<p>ESPN''s online offerings attract larger audiences than Yahoo
Sports, Bleacher Report and NFL.com, Bulgrin said. Mobile use by
customers also exceeds the time spent on desktop computers, he
said. Watch ESPN''s typical user is 29 years old, compared with
age 47 for the traditional TV viewer. The median income of
$74,000 is 54 percent more. </p>
<h2>Changing Habits </h2>
<p>TV networks, which accounted for more than half of Disney''s
profit, face challenges from new video options, the migration of
ad sales to online media and escalating costs for sports rights,
ESPN President John Skipper said. </p>
<p>A deal Disney signed last month that lets Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) create a Web-based service with its programming will
attract customers who don''t have pay TV now, rather than ones
who trade down from an existing service, Skipper said. He
expects more such deals. </p>
<p>''Pay television is going to remain a large business,
though it will exist in a more complicated and dynamic
atmosphere, which will require some evolution of our current
business model,'' he said. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 1.3 percent to
$79.99 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 4.7
percent this year. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has offered to
raise starting pay at its Florida theme parks by 25 percent to
$10 an hour over two years, almost matching the federal minimum
wage sought by President Barack Obama. </p>
<p>Disney presented the proposal yesterday to the Service
Trades Council, a consortium of six labor groups, the company
and union representatives said. They are scheduled to resume
bargaining over a contract on May 28. </p>
<p>The unions, which represent more than 30,000 employees at
Walt Disney World near Orlando, asked for at least $10.10 an
hour, the amount congressional Democrats and Obama propose as a
new U.S. minimum. Starting pay at the Florida parks is now $8.03
an hour, according to Burbank, California-based Disney. That
would reach the rate Disney is offering by July 2016. </p>
<p>''I''m very pleased,'' Ed Chambers, president of the
council, said in a telephone interview. ''We''re well on our way
to getting a deal done.'' </p>
<p>The contract being negotiated covers full-time hourly
employees at the world''s most-popular theme-park complex. Disney
reported record profit of $6.6 billion on revenue of $45 billion
last year from its TV networks, parks, studios and consumer
products. </p>
<p>''It is more generous than they have been in the past,''
said Donna-Lynne Dalton, secretary-treasurer of the council.
''It comes at a cost.'' </p>
<p>Disney also told the unions it wants to stop offering
pensions to new hourly employees starting in 2016. </p>
<p>New hires would be offered a 3 percent company match to a
401(k)-style retirement plan, said Dalton. The company doesn''t
currently contribute to that plan, which is available to
employees from bell staff to costumed entertainers, she said. </p>
<h2>Union Opposition </h2>
<p>Chambers said the union would oppose the pension change. </p>
<p>''This offer reflects our appreciation and care for our
cast members and our commitment to providing a leading
employment package,'' Kim Prunty, a Disney World spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement. ''We look forward to working with
the union and engaging in constructive negotiations to finalize
and reach a collective bargaining agreement.'' </p>
<p>Disney''s last contract with the council took effect in
October 2010, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The pact
included annual raises of 3 percent to 4 percent for workers who
hadn''t already reached the top of their pay scales, as well as
$650 one-time bonuses for non-tipped, full-time employees. </p>
<p>Disney''s parks and resorts business, the company''s second-largest division after television, generated operating income of
$2.22 billion last year on sales of $14.1 billion. </p>
<p>Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer,
said at the annual meeting in March the company has good
relations with its unions and doesn''t expect that to change. </p>
<p>''It is our intention to behave very responsibly and fairly
with all of our cast members and compensate them in ways that
reflect the value that they create for the company and for our

whether it''s Seamless and the way I order takeout food, or Uber
and the way I catch a cab, or OpenTable and the way I book
restaurant reservations, or the way Apple iOS is shaped.'' </p>
<p>Lenders including JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by
assets, are leaning on mobile and online offerings to win
loyalty while lowering the cost of retail services. The firm''s
mobile users rose 24 percent from a year ago to 16.4 million.
Bank of America Corp., the No. 2 U.S. lender, said mobile
customers increased 19 percent to 15 million. </p>
<p>Michael, who reports to consumer-banking chief Gordon Smith, joined JPMorgan from consulting firm Accenture, where he
was head of technology innovation. He has since hired executives
from outside finance, including Tim Parsey, a former senior vice
president of design at Yahoo! Inc. and Josh Klenert, a former
designer for the Huffington Post. Both are based in San
Francisco. </p>
<p>Prior versions of the bank''s mobile app for the iPhone drew
3 1/2 out of five stars on Apple Inc.''s App Store as of late
yesterday. Bank of America''s had a similar rating. Apps from San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and New York-based Citigroup
Inc. both had three stars. </p>
<h2>New Greetings </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s redesigned app for the iPhone has a simpler
login and location-based greetings to give users a more
personalized experience, Michael said. The background photo
shown to a customer in New York may feature the Brooklyn Bridge,
for example, while a client in San Francisco sees streetcars. </p>
<p>''People work on an emotional level before they go to the
rational level,'' Michael said. ''What we''re trying to do with
banking is create that emotional experience inside the way which
images are used, the way we greet and the way we understand how
customers bank with us.'' </p>
<p>Future versions will probably detect users'' location to
tailor their experience and ease transactions including in-store
purchases and pulling cash from automated teller machines, he
said. </p>
<h2>Cutting Branches </h2>
<p>''When I''m near an ATM, how do I get the two to work so I
can preload transactions?'' Michael said. ''We want a cohesive
experience across our digital and live interactions. So things
should work together and feel like they belong together.'' </p>
<p>Mobile technology has helped firms including Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America reduce bank branches.
Customers ''effectively carry a branch in their pocket,'' Chief
Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, 54, said yesterday on a
conference call. </p>
<p>Still, branches will remain a key fixture for lenders,
Michael said. They are evolving into places where customers seek
financial advice, while performing routine activities like
depositing checks with mobile phones or ATMs. </p>
<p>''It changes the relationship you have with the branch, as
opposed to replacing it,'' Michael said. </p>

<p>The largest U.S. banks can remain entangled with each other now that global regulators have loosened proposed limits on the financial web that led to investor panic in 2008 and prompted bailouts. </p> <p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which set out a year ago to block banks from relying too heavily on each other, changed course last week, opting to let firms preserve most derivatives and repurchase agreements among themselves.

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, held informal, now-discontinued talks with
AstraZeneca Plc about buying the London-based maker of asthma 
and heart drugs, said two people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The companies aren''t currently negotiating, said the
people, who asked not to be identified. One said the talks
happened several months ago and there are no plans to resume.
The discussions were first reported yesterday by London''s Sunday
Times, whose unnamed bank and industry sources said New York-based Pfizer made a tentative approach about a takeover valuing
AstraZeneca at more than 60 billion pounds ($101 billion). </p>
<p>If revived, such an acquisition would be among the largest
ever in the industry. Pfizer has reorganized its business over
the past three years, shuttering some research projects and
emphasizing others. A deal with AstraZeneca (AZN) would add early-stage drugs in a field of cancer treatments that use the body''s
own immune cells to recognize and attack cancer. </p>
<p>''We don''t comment on market speculation or rumors,'' said
Andrew Topen, a Pfizer spokesman, in an e-mail. Esra Erkal-Paler, am AstraZeneca spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>American depositary receipts for AstraZeneca gained 8.8
percent to $69.10 at 4 p.m. New York time. Pfizer rose 2 percent
to $30.86. The stock has increased about 37 percent in the last
two years as Pfizer benefited from the revamping that focused it
into three units: two for new drugs, and one for older products. </p>
<h2>AstraZeneca Treatments </h2>
<p>AstraZeneca in January announced an agreement with
Immunocore Limited to develop the new cancer treatments that use
the body''s own immune cells, and it also has several of its own
immune-based drugs being tested in multiple cancers. The
company''s shares in London have risen about 34 percent over two
years, even as sales have fallen from $33.6 billion in 2011 to
$25.7 billion last year, with further losses projected by some
analysts as drugs lose patent protection. </p>
<p>While a deal would be highly accretive through cost
cutting, Pfizer shareholders may have doubts about AstraZeneca''s
pipeline as well as its eroding revenue, said Mark Schoenebaum,
an analyst with ISI Group LLC. </p>
<p>''The consensus AstraZeneca model is hugely dependent on
pipeline assumptions, as the base business will deteriorate
massively by 2020 as several key products go off patent,'' he
said in a note to clients. </p>
<h2>Mega-Mergers </h2>
<p>A merger of this reported size would top Pfizer''s 2000
purchase of Warner-Lambert Co. for $87 billion, the industry''s
largest deal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pfizer
has been at the center of the biggest drugmaker mega-mergers,
making up three of the 10 deals worth more than $30 billion in
the last two decades. </p>
<p>It would also provide a use for Pfizer''s cash from profits
that have been stashed overseas instead of being brought back to
the U.S., where they would be taxed at a higher rate. Pfizer had
$69 billion in untaxed cash overseas as of last month, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>A purchase of AstraZeneca could also potentially allow
Pfizer to move its tax domicile to the U.K. through a so-called
inversion transaction, a move that has allowed other U.S.
drugmakers to lower their tax bill. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca shares in London rose 0.6 percent to close at
3,781.50 pence on April 17, giving the company a market value of
47.7 billion pounds. The London stock market was closed for a
holiday April 18 and today. </p>
<h2>Merger Comments </h2>
<p>Since taking over in 2010, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read''s answers to whether or not he would pursue a mega-merger such as a deal with AstraZeneca have shifted. </p>
<p>On a January conference call in 2012 he said, ''I''m very
disinclined to be looking at any possibility of another mega-acquisition. You never say never, but we have all of the science
we need.'' </p>
<p>In July 2013, when Read was asked on another conference
call about the size of deals he might pursue, he replied:
''We''ll look at any type of acquisition -- never say never to a
larger acquisition that made sense.'' </p>
<p>Schoenebaum said there were signs Pfizer could pursue a
large target. ''Pfizer has been signaling since last summer
that, in theory, the company would not be opposed to a larger
MA deal if the numbers made sense,'' Schoenebaum said. </p>

<h2>Diller Goes Big in U.S. High Court Gamble on Aereo''s Future </h2>
<p>From the moment billionaire media mogul Barry Diller joined
the board of Aereo Inc. in 2012, he had a date with the U.S.
Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Aereo, the streaming-TV startup challenging the economics
of the television industry, goes before the court tomorrow to
fight copyright claims from broadcasters including CBS Corp. (CBS) and
Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s ABC. Aereo''s Internet service lets customers
in 11 cities watch live and recorded broadcast programs for $8 a
month. </p>
<p>The case marks the culmination of a two-year court fight
stemming from Aereo''s bid to forge a technological route around
the broadcasters'' copyrights and from Diller''s hope to transform
an industry he once embodied. </p>
<p>Broadcasters say an Aereo victory might create a blueprint
that would let cable and satellite providers stop paying
billions of dollars in retransmission fees each year to carry
local programming. While Aereo questions that assessment, Diller
says his goal is nothing short of upending the TV distribution
system so consumers can buy programming they want, rather than
the packages offered through cable and satellite. </p>
<p>With the Supreme Court now set to rule by early July, the
broadcasters say they are confident the gamble will fail. </p>
<p>Chances for a definitive ruling rose last week when Justice
Samuel Alito indicated he will take part. Alito didn''t
participate when the court agreed in January to hear the
dispute, raising the prospect that the court might divide 4-4.
The court''s online docket on April 17 said Alito is ''no longer
recused'' from the case. </p>
<p>The case is American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo,
13-461. </p>

<h2>Pandora Sued by Record Companies Over Music Made Before 1972 </h2>
<p>Pandora Media Inc., (P) the biggest Internet radio service, was
sued by major record labels for failing to pay for using music
recorded before 1972. </p>
<p>The companies, including Capitol Records LLC and Sony Music
Entertainment, filed the copyright-infringement lawsuit in New
York State Supreme Court in Manhattan April 17 because federal
law doesn''t protect recordings made before Feb. 15, 1972. New
York courts have enforced ownership rights stemming from before
that date, according to the suit. </p>
<p>The labels accused the Oakland, California-based music
streaming service of ''massive and continuing unauthorized
commercial exploitation'' of thousands of recordings including
iconic songs such as the Beatles'' ''Hey Jude,'' Bob Dylan''s
''Like a Rolling Stone'' and Marvin Gaye''s ''I Heard It Through
the Grapevine.'' </p>
<p>Pandora has been fighting in court over how much it has to
pay to stream music. In a ruling that sets a precedent for
future rate battles, a federal judge in Manhattan last month
said the company must give 1.85 percent of revenue to a group
representing songwriters and music publishers, rejecting
Pandora''s request for a lower rate. </p>
<p>''Pandora is confident in its legal position and looks
forward to a quick resolution of this matter,'' Will Valentine,
a spokesman for the company, said by e-mail. </p>
<p>Pandora had sued the 470,000-member American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers in 2012, saying that the fees
charged at the time made sustained profitability impossible. </p>
<p>The complaint follows a similar suit filed last year
against New York-based Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) in state court in
California. </p>

<h2>Patent </h2>
<h2>Teva Rejected by Justice Roberts on Generic Copaxone Delay </h2>
<p>A U.S. Supreme Court justice rejected Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA)''s bid to block generic versions of its Copaxone
multiple-sclerosis drug while the court hears the company''s
appeal in a patent clash. </p>
<p>The rebuff by Chief Justice John Roberts on April 18 leaves
Teva open to generic competition as soon as next month. Mylan
Inc., Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA) and Novartis AG''s Sandoz are
positioned to start selling generic Copaxone in late May,
although they would risk having to pay damages if Teva
ultimately wins its patent-infringement case. Momenta and Sandoz
are working together on a generic version of the drug. </p>
<p>''Teva will continue pursuing its appeal in the Supreme
Court and defending its intellectual property for Copaxone,''
according to a statement April 19 from the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company. </p>
<p>Teva can ask another justice to intervene. By custom, that
application would then go to the full court for consideration. </p>
<p>In a one-paragraph opinion April 18, Roberts said a court-ordered delay was unnecessary because Teva could recover damages
for infringement if it wins the case. </p>
<p>''We are pleased with the chief justice''s decision, and we
look forward to introducing the first generic Copaxone treatment
for multiple sclerosis patients in the U.S. at market
formation,'' Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch said
in a statement. </p>
<p>Copaxone brings in $3.2 billion in annual U.S. sales and
accounts for more than half of Teva''s profit. A delay would give
Teva more time to switch patients from the 20-milligram dose
that is the subject of the legal fight to a 40-milligram dose it
says is covered by other patents. </p>
<p>The case is Teva v. Sandoz, 13-854. </p>

<p>John Stafford, the chief executive
officer of American Home Products Corp. who sold units to focus
on pharmaceuticals and made three attempts to merge before
changing the company''s name to Wyeth, has died. He was 76. </p>
<p>He died on April 18 at his home in Essex Fells, New Jersey,
where he had lived since 1976, Carolyn Stafford Stein, his
daughter, said today in a telephone interview. The cause of
death was prostate cancer. </p>
<p>Stafford, who was CEO from 1986 to 2001 and chairman from
1986 to 2002, boosted investment and research in American Home''s
pharmaceuticals division while spinning off non-related units,
such as Brach''s candy, household goods and agricultural
chemicals. With brands such as Anacin aspirin, Dristan cold
medicine and Premarin estrogen treatment, then the most-prescribed drug in the U.S., annual revenue almost tripled to
$14.6 billion under his leadership. </p>
<p>The former lawyer also courted SmithKline Beecham Plc and
Monsanto Co. in failed merger attempts before a $58 billion deal
with Warner-Lambert Co. to create the world''s largest drugmaker
fell apart in 2000 in a takeover battle won by Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
Stafford also presided over the $9.7 billion acquisition of
American Cyanamid Co. in 1994 that included its Lederle
Laboratories unit. </p>
<h2>Stock Gain </h2>
<p>In 2002, American Home changed its name to Wyeth, which was
bought by Pfizer seven years later. By the time he stepped down
as CEO, the shares had increased sixfold during his tenure. </p>
<p>''Stafford is credited with moving American Home Products
from a diversified manufacturer of consumer health products into
a major pharmaceutical company,'' according to a Harvard
Business School profile. ''He did so while consistently
achieving impressive financial returns.'' </p>
<p>American Home''s attempts to merge with Warner-Lambert, the
maker of the cholesterol treatment Lipitor, followed its removal
of two diet pills and one painkiller from the market and a $3.75
billion settlement of diet-pill litigation in 2000. Warner-Lambert was purchased by Pfizer in a hostile takeover that left
American Home with a breakup fee of $1.8 billion. </p>
<p>''We''ve made it on our own since 1926,'' Stafford said in a
March 2000 interview with the New York Times after losing the
bid for Warner-Lambert. ''We''re in a better position now than
we''ve been in sometime in terms of our pipeline and balance
sheet. There is no question that we can compete.'' </p>
<h2>Settlement Reserve </h2>
<p>Lawsuits over the diet drugs, known as fen-phen and
recalled in 1997, led to the settlement reserve being increased
to $21 billion after Stafford''s retirement. Former users of the
appetite suppressants claimed the pills caused an often-fatal
lung disease and that the company hid the health risks. </p>
<p>John Rogers Stafford was born on Oct. 24, 1937, in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His father, Paul Stafford, was a civil
engineer, and his mother, Gladys Sharp, was a homemaker. </p>
<p>He attended Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
before earning a law degree at George Washington University, in
Washington, D.C., where he edited the law review. Stafford then
practiced law for four years at the Washington-based firm
Steptoe  Johnson before joining the health-care company
Hoffmann-La Roche in Nutley, New Jersey, as a lawyer in 1966. </p>
<p>In 1970, Stafford moved to American Home Products as
general counsel and was named vice president two years later. He
became a director in 1980 and president the following year. </p>
<h2>Employee Care </h2>
<p>''He was tremendously proud, and rightfully so, with what
he could do with AHP,'' his daughter said. ''The way they tried
to take care of their employees was one thing he was
particularly proud of.'' </p>
<p>Under Stafford, American Home moved its headquarters in the
early-1990s from midtown Manhattan to Madison, New Jersey, where
it built a child-care center and gymnasium on site for
employees. Workers were also granted equal time off for adoption
as for maternity leave, his daughter said. </p>
<p>In 1959, Stafford married the former Inge Paul, a
psychologist, whom he met at Dickinson College. She died in
April 2012. </p>
<p>His survivors include their four daughters, Carolyn Stein,
Jennifer Farrow, Christina Chapin and Charlotte Stafford; 13
grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. He also is survived
by a brother, P. Gordon Stafford. </p>

<p>A week before Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)
Chairman Peter Munk retires, his successor John Thornton is
emerging as a dealmaker as the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
banker pursues a bid to combine the two biggest gold miners. </p>
<p>Negotiations between Barrick and Newmont Mining Corp. broke
off last week amid minor disagreements while leaving open the
possibility that discussions could still resume, two people with
knowledge of the matter said April 19. </p>
<p>The deal under discussion would have seen Thornton become
executive chairman of the combined company while the chief
executive officer would have been Gary Goldberg, who currently
leads Newmont, the people said. Toronto-based Barrick''s CEO
Jamie Sokalsky would have led a smaller gold producer spun off
from the merged company, according to the people. </p>
<p>The proposed tie-up and its management reshuffle confirm
Thronton''s elevation as Barrick''s most senior executive. The 60-year-old, who had no role in the mining industry until he joined
the company''s board just over two years ago, is set to succeed
Munk, Barrick''s 86-year-old founder, as chairman at the annual
shareholders meeting next week. Leading a successful acquisition
of Newmont (NEM), in what would be the biggest gold takeover, would
set up Barrick to do further deals, including ones involving
other commodities. </p>
<h2>Long-Term Strategy </h2>
<p>''I think if anybody has the skill to drive this
transaction through, whether or not it is successful from an
operational standpoint, I think he certainly has the
leadership,'' said Michael Sprung, president of Toronto-based
Sprung Investment Management Inc., which owns Barrick shares.
''It''s a merger to set them up for bigger, future MA deals
which may in fact include an element of diversification.'' </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Barrick and Newmont both declined to comment
on last week''s talks. Newmont''s shares closed little changed at
$25.04 in New York, while Barrick rose 1.8 percent to C$19.37 in
Toronto. Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.4 percent to

<p>Thornton spent 23 years at Goldman before departing in
2003. He joined Barrick as an independent director in February
2012 and was hired as co-chairman in June of that year, just as
the company fired CEO Aaron Regent following a decline in its
share price. </p>
<p>Slumping gold prices and rising mining costs eroded
Barrick''s margins, raised concerns about its debt and spurred
the company to start selling higher-cost mines. Those
divestments have improved the company''s financial flexibility
and will reduce its borrowings, Goldman Sachs said today in a
note. Goldman raised its recommendation on the stock to buy from
hold. </p>
<h2>McKinsey Review </h2>
<p>As part of Barrick''s senior management, Thornton has helped
oversee its long-term strategy. He has looked at establishing
partnerships with Chinese companies including China Investment
Corp., people familiar with the matter said in December.
Thornton''s role also involves developing and maintaining
relationships with governments, according to Barrick. </p>
<p>Thornton was behind a decision to bring in management
consultant McKinsey  Co. to help evaluate the mining company''s
direction, one of the people said in December. While he sees
Barrick''s top priority to remain as the leading gold producer,
he''s open to rethinking the whole business, which may involve
acquiring mining assets in other minerals, such as copper, the
people also said. Barrick already produces copper in Chile and
Zambia. </p>
<h2>Spinoff Plan </h2>
<p>''We haven''t seen him put a stamp on the company yet,''
said Michael Siperco, a Toronto-based analyst at Macquarie
Capital Markets. ''Obviously, the combining of Barrick and
Newmont would be a meaningful step in that direction.'' </p>
<p>Both Barrick and Newmont operate on five continents and
have a combined market value of about $33 billion. Before talks
broke off April 18, the companies had agreed to an all-stock
merger in which Barrick was to offer Newmont shareholders a
premium of 13 percent more than Newmont''s average share price
over the latest 20 trading days, one of the people with
knowledge of the situation said. </p>
<p>The companies had agreed to all terms not related to a
spinoff of Asia Pacific assets and had identified $1 billion a
year in cost savings, the people said. The companies, which have
tried to merge several times in the past, still have interest in
getting a deal done, the people said. </p>
<p>Most of the cost savings would come from Nevada, where
Barrick and Newmont both produce more than a third of their
gold. They operate in close proximity in the state, from which
they originally built out their respective businesses. </p>
<h2>Goldman Contender </h2>
<p>While Sokalsky is a 20-year veteran of Barrick, Thornton
and Goldberg are both relative newcomers to gold mining at a
tumultuous time for the industry. Goldberg worked in various
roles at diversified miner Rio Tinto Group before joining
Newmont as chief operating officer and became CEO in March 2013. </p>
<p>Newmont was considering acquisitions in both gold and
copper and was adding in-house capacity to assess copper supply
and demand trends, Goldberg said in a September interview.
Taking on more copper was a ''logical'' step after gold
companies began to lose the valuation premium that they used to
attract, he said. </p>
<p>While at Goldman, Thornton was seen as a top contender to
succeed Henry Paulson as CEO in the early 2000s, according to
''Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World''
(2011) by William D. Cohan. </p>
<h2>Placer Dome </h2>
<p>After leaving the bank, he headed to China, helping to
start up a business leadership program at Beijing''s Tsinghua
University. He sits on the board of China Unicom (Hong Kong)
Ltd., the country''s second-largest mobile phone carrier, and is
a member of China Investment Corp.''s international advisory
board. He''s also chairman of the board of trustees of the
Brookings Institution, where he helped establish the John L.
Thornton China Center. </p>
<p>Munk, a Hungarian immigrant who escaped the Nazis as a
teenager, founded Barrick as an oil and gas company, later
shifting his focus to gold. The company expanded through
acquisitions, with at least 29 completed since 1994, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Barrick surpassed Newmont as the
industry leader when it bought Placer Dome Inc. in 2006 for
about $10.2 billion including net debt, a record for a gold
takeover. </p>
<p>''The ultimate goal is to, in my case, to be the biggest,''
Munk said at a May 2011 conference organized by Bloomberg in
Toronto. ''Why would you be happy with halfway?'' </p>

Microsoft insists there are no restrictions on the type of questions an entrepreneur can ask, but expects its dedicated call center staff to be mostly advising customers on legal, funding or marketing issues. Microsoft says workers will walk callers through the processes of registering a company, preparing taxes, tracking down an accountant and finding a good lawyer. They''re also happy to suggest technology solutions. (Microsoft Azure, perhaps?)</p><p>These days, dial-in tech support seems old-fashioned to say the least, but Indians could use whatever help they can get. It''s one of the toughest countries to start a business in, according to the World Bank. Part of that can be attributed to the 2012 "startup tax" that treats Indian investments as income, essentially penalizing companies that raise money locally. Amid complaints of over-regulation, last year was also the worst for Indian technology IPOs in more than a decade.</p>

<p>The first ''Star Wars'' movie to be
made under Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has begun shooting in Abu Dhabi,
according to Alan Horn, chairman of the company''s film division,
who said the casting will be announced soon. </p>
<p>Horn spoke at a Bloomberg Business of Entertainment event
today in New York, before heading to the U.K. with other Disney
executives overseeing the project. Filming thus far has involved
secondary scenes, he said. The U.K.''s Pinewood Studios will be
the primary site, he said. </p>
<p>''We have to give it that ''Star Wars''-ian look,'' Horn
said. ''So we need to go to different places that give us the
right look and feel.'' </p>
<p>The movie, to be released in December 2015, will be the
seventh ''Star Wars'' picture from Lucasfilm, purchased in 2012
by Disney in a $4.05 billion bet on the franchise created by
George Lucas. Lucas is a consultant on the film, Horn said. </p>
<p>Disney''s studio chairman emphasized the importance of the
faster-growing international box office in approving projects. </p>
<p>''The challenge is to have pictures that can travel,'' Horn
said. ''We''ve learned that these tentpole movies are most
desired all around the world.'' </p>
<p>Horn has led a revival of the Walt Disney Studios, which
include the company''s original live-action and animation
businesses, along with Marvel and Pixar. Since his arrival in
June 2012, two Disney films have topped $1 billion in worldwide
ticket sales: ''Iron Man 3'' and ''Frozen.'' ''Captain America:
The Winter Soldier,'' the latest Marvel superhero movie, has led
the box office for three weeks. </p>
<h2>Baseball Feature </h2>
<p>Next month, Disney is scheduled to release the baseball
movie ''Million Dollar Arm,'' starring ''Mad Men'' actor Jon Hamm. The film is testing ''extremely well,'' Horn said. </p>
<p>Another ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film is possible, Horn
said. While he hasn''t seen a screenplay he''s ready to approve,
he''s ''very confident'' Disney will get one. The four pictures
produced thus far generated worldwide ticket sales of $3.73
billion, according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher </p>
<p>Before joining Disney, Horn was president of Time Warner
Inc.''s Warner Bros. for 12 years, where he co-lead the studio
that made the ''Harry Potter'' and ''Dark Knight'' franchises. </p>
<p>Horn indicated Disney may revert to a May release for the
two additional ''Star Wars'' films that are planned as part of
the latest trilogy. The current production will have a ''big
tentpole movie budget,'' he said. </p>
<p>Such films typically cost $175 million to $200 million,
give or take, he said. </p>
<p>''We need to give the audience, essentially, a full meal in
return for their affection and devotion and love for these
properties.'' </p>

<p>UBS AG (UBSN) joined JPMorgan Chase  Co. in recommending investors stop buying shares in Deutsche Bank AG, saying the company may delay efforts to cut costs and build capital. </p> <p>UBS cut Deutsche Bank to neutral from buy and lowered its price estimate for Deutsche Bank''s shares to 33 euros from 47 euros, analysts including Daniele Brupbacher and Mate Nemes in Zurich said in an e-mailed report today. </p> <p>Deutsche Bank is contending with a global slowdown in trading revenue as clients hold off investing amid uncertainty over monetary policy and geopolitical crises.

<p>AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) rose the most in
more than three years after reports over the weekend that Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) discussed acquiring the London-based drugmaker in informal,
now-discontinued talks. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca climbed 8 percent to 4,085.5 pence at 8:06 a.m.
in London. The intraday increase of as much as 8.5 percent was
the biggest since June 2010. </p>
<p>Pfizer and AstraZeneca aren''t currently negotiating, said
two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be
identified. One said the talks happened several months ago and
there are no plans to resume. The discussions were first
reported April 20 by London''s Sunday Times, which said New York-based Pfizer made a tentative approach about a takeover valuing
AstraZeneca at more than 60 billion pounds ($101 billion). </p>
<p>If revived, such an acquisition would be among the largest
ever in the industry. Pfizer has reorganized its business over
the past three years, shuttering some research projects and
emphasizing others. A deal with AstraZeneca would add early-stage drugs in a field of cancer treatments that use the body''s
own immune cells to recognize and attack cancer. </p>
<p>Pfizer and AstraZeneca both declined to comment.

<p>India''s Congress party is claiming credit for a stock-market rally that sent the SP BSE Sensex index to record highs. Much of the evidence suggests the real catalyst is Narendra Modi, the leader of the opposition party projected to win the national elections. </p> <p>The Sensex has advanced 16 percent since Sept. 13, when the Bharatiya Janata Party named Modi as its prime minister candidate, the only advance among equity indexes in the four largest emerging markets. A gauge of companies based in Modi''s home state of Gujarat, including Adani Enterprises Ltd. (ADE), has more than doubled in the period. </p> <p>''The stock market rally is due to Modi,'' said Mahendra Chheda, a 52-year-old who trades shares for a living from the suburbs of Mumbai and has doubled his allocation to the market in the past six months. ''The BJP will get credit and goodwill from it,'' said Chheda, who plans to vote for the BJP today after siding with Congress in 2009. </p> <p>While Finance Minister P. Chidambaram points to Congress measures since September 2012 that pared the budget shortfall, narrowed the current-account deficit and removed barriers to foreign capital, investors say those efforts have been eclipsed by expectations that a Modi-led government would do even more to boost economic growth. The BJP said this month it plans to construct 100 new cities, build high-speed railway lines and a national fiber-optic network. </p> <p>General elections began on April 7 and votes will be counted on May 16. People in Mumbai, India''s financial capital, cast their ballots today. </p> <h2>''Bull Market'' </h2> <p>Brokerages including Macquarie Group Ltd. and Deutsche Equities India predicted further gains for the Sensex (SENSEX) in a Bloomberg survey this month. Rakesh Arora, head of research at Macquarie in Mumbai and the most accurate forecaster for the stock gauge in 2013, said his year-end Sensex target of 23,900 may ''prove conservative'' if Modi comes to power next month. The gauge climbed to a record 22,876.54 yesterday. </p> <p>Global investors bought $4.9 billion of Indian shares this year, the second-most after Taiwan among 18 nations tracked by Bloomberg. Stocks are in a ''massive bull market'' and a strong government will boost the rally''s ''intensity,'' B.P. Singh, chief investor officer for equities at Pramerica Asset Managers Pvt. in Mumbai, said in an April 16 interview. </p> <p>The BJP and its allies may win 275 of 543 parliamentary seats, three more than they need for a majority, according to a Hansa Research survey for the NDTV channel released April 14. The Congress looks set for its worst-ever performance as graft cases, Asia''s fastest inflation and sputtering economic growth erode support. </p> <h2>Volatility Climbs </h2> <p>Demand for protection against swings in shares is still climbing as some investors weigh prospects for a surprise outcome. The India VIX, which gauges the cost of options on the 50-stock CNX Nifty Index, rose to 34.4 on April 21, the highest level since October 2011. </p> <p>Opinion polls have had a poor record forecasting election outcomes in India. The Congress party won in 2004, even after surveys predicted the BJP would keep power. In 2009, after polls forecast a close fight, Congress emerged with the largest tally in 20 years, lifting the Sensex by a record 17 percent. </p> <p>''The results can throw a surprise, and no one wants to be caught on the wrong side,'' R.K. Gupta, managing director of Taurus Asset Management Co., which oversees about $585 million, said by phone from New Delhi on April 16. </p> <p>Investors are betting a win by Modi will allow him to fast-track public works projects, an ability that''s helped the state of Gujarat expand 10 percent a year on average since he took office in 2001. Modi''s focus on how he will revive growth has helped neutralize criticism over his handling of 2002 riots in the state that killed about 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. </p> <h2>Adani Rally </h2> <p>Gujarat lured 1.3 trillion rupees ($22 billion) of planned foreign and local investment, about 22 percent of India''s total, in the year ended March 31, 2012, according to the most recent industry ministry data. That compares with 103 billion rupees in 2002, when Gujarat took 11 percent of the country''s investment, the data show. </p> <p>Shares of Adani Enterprises, which operates the state''s biggest private port, have had a 52-fold increase since 2002, gaining about nine times more than the Sensex. </p> <p>''This rally will continue if a government led by Modi, as opinion polls show, comes to power,'' Shishir Bajpai, a Mumbai-based director at IIFL Wealth Management Ltd. with $8 billion under management and advisory, said in a phone interview on April 22. ''Over the past five years India has suffered due to poor execution of infrastructure projects. If Modi is able to revive that, then the economy will be back on the growth path. Execution is the key.'' </p> <h2>Construction Approvals </h2> <p>Projects worth $230 billion are awaiting clearance as lawmaking stalled in the Congress-led coalition, data from the Cabinet Committee on Investment show. A $12 billion steel mill planned by South Korea''s Posco has been held up for nine years. </p> <p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh''s government is claiming success for stemming last year''s rout in the rupee and pushing foreign reserves higher, helped by Raghuram Rajan''s stewardship of the central bank. Since Rajan became governor in September, the currency has been a world beater and holdings have climbed back above $300 billion. </p> <p>The Congress party must get ''some credit for bringing back the economy when other emerging markets are facing problems,'' Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal said in an interview on April 21. D.S. Malik, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry, declined to comment. </p> <p>Rajan, who spurred dollar inflows by offering discount currency swaps to banks and reining in inflation, said April 11 that Asia''s third-largest economy is now prepared for potential fallout should the Federal Reserve raise rates in the coming year. The rupee has rallied 13 percent from a record low of 68.845 per dollar in August, the biggest gain among 78 global exchange rates tracked by Bloomberg. </p> <p>''This government can''t take credit for the last few months'' recovery, unless they also take credit for bringing it down,'' Ajit Dayal, chairman of Mumbai-based Quantum Asset Management Ltd., said in an interview on April 1. </p> <p>', 'Stock Trader Abandons Congress for BJP as Modi Spurs Sensex Gain', 'By Rajhkumar K Shaaw', 'Apr 23, 2014  2:31 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-23/stock-trader-abandons-congress-for-bjp-as-modi-spurs-sensex-gain.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) won investor approval
for its plan to award employees with stock, overcoming an
argument from money manager David Winters that lavish pay
packages are diminishing returns for shareholders. </p>
<p>Eighty-three percent of votes cast supported the equity
plan, according to preliminary results in an e-mailed statement
today from the company. The annual meeting was held in Atlanta,
the city where Coca-Cola is based. </p>
<p>Winters had waged a campaign since March to persuade
investors to reject the soft-drink maker''s proposal. The new
plan, in addition to ones already enacted, could transfer $29.8
billion to the managers, he said. Investors such as the Ontario
Teachers'' Pension Plan and Calvert Investments had sided with
Winters, who runs the firm Wintergreen Advisers LLC. Coca-Cola
said its board was pleased with the vote. </p>
<p>''The company''s compensation programs are performance-based
and the equity plan is fair, competitive and consistent with
shareowners'' interests and our pay for performance philosophy,''
according to the statement. </p>
<p>In making his case, Winters appealed directly to Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett, who
controls the biggest stake in Coca-Cola. Buffett, the world''s
third-richest person, used to be on Coca-Cola''s board, and his
son is a director. </p>
<h2>''Extraneous Factors'' </h2>
<p>''His fiduciary duty is to all of the Berkshire
shareholders,'' Winters said in an interview yesterday. Buffett
shouldn''t vote based on ''any other extraneous factors.'' </p>
<p>Coca-Cola has said that stock repurchases, including $4.8
billion of buybacks in 2013, cushion the dilution tied to
employee awards. Dilution related to equity plans has been less
than 1 percent annually over the past three years, ''and is
expected to be in this range going forward,'' the company said
in a presentation. Coca-Cola also said that the link of the pay
to performance means that all the potential awards may not be
earned. </p>

compensation won 90 percent support. Investors also voted
against a measure that called for an independent board chairman. </p>

<p>Warren Buffett owes it to shareholders of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) to vote against Coca-Cola Co.''s executive-compensation plan, said David Winters, a money manager who controls stakes in both companies. </p> <p>Winters has waged a campaign since March to persuade investors to reject the soft-drink maker''s proposal, which comes to a vote today. The new plan, in addition to ones already enacted, could transfer $29.8 billion to the managers, he said. He wants the plan withdrawn, calling it a ''raw deal.'' Investors including the Ontario Teachers'' Pension Plan and Calvert Investments have sided with him. </p> <p>Winters appealed directly to Buffett, who controls the biggest stake in Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and has criticized companies that offer lavish stock awards to managers. The billionaire chief executive officer used to be on the board of the world''s biggest soda maker, and his son is a director. </p> <p>''His fiduciary duty is to all of the Berkshire shareholders,'' Winters said of the billionaire in an interview yesterday. Buffett shouldn''t vote based on ''any other extraneous factors.'' </p> <p>Winters said his letters to the Berkshire CEO on the matter have been met with ''radio silence.'' Buffett, 83, didn''t respond to a request for comment sent to an assistant. Petro Kacur, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, declined to comment on the stance of its largest shareholder. </p> <h2>''Fresh Look'' </h2> <p>''Irrational and excessive comp practices will not be materially changed by disclosure or by ''independent'' comp committee members,'' Buffett wrote in a 2007 letter. ''Reform will only occur if the largest institutional shareholders -- it would only take a few -- demand a fresh look.'' He has shunned handing out stock as compensation at his own company. </p> <p>Buffett has rarely clashed in public with the managers of the businesses in which Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire owns stock. He described his equity-investing strategy as ''passive'' in a letter to shareholders this year. </p> <p>Coca-Cola listed terms of the compensation plan last month in a proxy statement. Numbers in the filing show that the company could grant 340 million shares and options under the new proposal, according to calculations from Winters''s firm. </p> <p>That would be in addition to the 388 million outstanding equity awards and 3.6 million additional ''holdback shares'' from prior plans. Coca-Cola said it granted long-term equity compensation to about 6,400 employees in 2013. </p> <p>Winters calculates that existing shareholders will be diluted by 16.6 percent. That represented $29.8 billion of Coca-Cola''s market value as of yesterday''s close in New York. </p> <h2>Proposal Criticized </h2> <p>''There''s no gray area,'' said Winters, whose firm Wintergreen Advisers LLC held about 2.5 million shares of the soft-drink maker''s stock and 1.2 million Class B shares of Buffett''s company at the end of December. ''It''s a bad plan. It''s bad for Coca-Cola. It''s bad for Berkshire.'' </p> <p>Coca-Cola said stock repurchases, including $4.8 billion of buybacks in 2013, cushion the dilution tied to employee awards. Dilution related to equity plans has been less than 1 percent annually over the past three years, ''and is expected to be in this range going forward,'' the company said in a presentation. Coca-Cola also said that the link of the pay to performance means that all the potential awards may not be earned. </p> <p>The California Public Employees'' Retirement System, the biggest U.S. public pension, is among investors who have supported the equity plan. </p> <h2>''Industry Norms'' </h2> <p>Winters said he likes Coca-Cola because of the value of its brand and popularity of its namesake beverage. The soft-drink maker, led by CEO Muhtar Kent, has returned 120 percent over the last five years, including dividends. That compares with 148 percent for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p> <p>The company said that its board ''fully stands behind'' the plan and that it links the interests of employees and shareholders. ''The new proposal is consistent with prior equity plans and industry norms,'' Coca-Cola said. </p> <p>Alan Johnson, a managing director at compensation consultant Johnson Associates, said the compensation plan provides an incentive for employees. </p> <p>''Would you rather them be paid in cash, which is gone today, or to be paid in some kind of stock or stock option, which is linked to the success of the company,'' he said in a phone interview. ''What Coke is saying is, ''We allocate a lot of the pay we need to offer people in stock, and we think that''s a good idea.'''' </p> <p>Berkshire''s Coca-Cola holding has climbed more than 12-fold since Buffett began accumulating the stake in the 1980s. It''s now valued at $16.3 billion. </p> <p>The annual meeting is scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m. in Atlanta. </p> <p>', 'Buffett Pay Principles Tested by Coca-Cola, Winters Says', 'By Noah Buhayar and Laura Marcinek', 'Apr 23, 2014  8:36 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-23/buffett-pay-principles-tested-by-coca-cola-winters-says.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that once generated millions of dollars in fees from
its Global Alpha hedge fund, is turning to beta strategies for
growth. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which oversees $30 billion
in such products, agreed this week to buy Westpeak Global
Advisors LLC, without disclosing terms. Westpeak, which
supervises just $300 million of assets, can help spur growth in
the firm''s beta products, which are drawing more interest from
clients, Armen Avanessians, head of GSAM''s quantitative
business, said in an interview. Beta refers to how much an
asset''s price moves in relation to the broader market. </p>
<p>While many indexes are weighted based on market
capitalization, Westpeak develops so-called active beta
strategies by investing in groups of stocks using other
characteristics. The idea is to offer the low fees and liquidity
that have drawn investors to passive exchange-traded funds,
while providing more value than a proxy for the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>''Anyone who wants to be in the passive space has already
shifted into that space, and they enjoy a certain degree of
liquidity and transparency,'' said Avanessians, a partner and
29-year veteran of New York-based Goldman Sachs. ''The question
is, ''Can they do something more than just slavishly follow the
market cap?'''' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which has avoided large mergers throughout
its history, has made several purchases in the past two years to
grow an asset-management business that saw outflows in three
straight years ended in 2012. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in May that he''s devoting a ''very high
percentage'' of his attention to improving the division''s
performance. </p>
<h2>Assets Increase </h2>
<p>Last year, assets under supervision topped $1 trillion for
the first time and pretax profit climbed 20 percent to $1.11
billion. The division produced $1.57 billion of revenue in the
first quarter, a 20 percent increase from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Avanessians, 54, declined to set a growth target for the
advanced beta strategies business. He said only that it can get
''much bigger'' and will help the bank attract a bigger slice of
clients'' portfolios. </p>
<p>''We see it as being purely additive to our business,'' he
said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs shut Global Alpha in 2011 as clients pulled
money from what was the firm''s biggest hedge fund. </p>

<p>Resolution said last month that it plans to initially

businesses that are no longer adding new clients. The
announcement followed its agreement to buy Lincoln Benefit Life
from Allstate Corp. (ALL) in July. Insurers including Hartford
Financial Services Group Inc. have been looking to sell U.S.
life operations as low interest rates pinch profit. </p>
<p>Resolution Chairman Clive Cowdery pursued a similar
strategy in the U.K., where he amassed a personal fortune
consolidating the industry. Over the last decade, his Resolution
Group bought 25 insurers, comprising more than 10 million
policyholders and $200 billion in policy assets. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
the case for holding commodities remains strong, bolstering the
rationale for investments in oil and metals even as other banks
exit the market. </p>
<p>Commodities still offer a way to diversify holdings
together with equities and bonds, and are best suited as a hedge

few years, they wrote, without giving a forecast. </p>
<p>While returns from commodities lagged behind those from

Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley are leaving parts of their
commodities businesses, boosting speculation that Goldman will
be able to increase its market share. </p>

<p>Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., which
in March agreed to buy JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s physical commodity
unit for $3.5 billion, reported the largest increase in annual
revenue among big closely held commodity-trading houses. </p>
<p>Mercuria''s 2013 revenue rose 14 percent to $112 billion,
according to an update on the Geneva-based company''s website. </p>
<p>That beats a 10 percent increase to $133 billion reported
by Trafigura Beheer BV for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
Annual revenue at Vitol Group, the world''s largest independent
oil trader, rose 1.3 percent to $307 billion, the company said

Corp. (IBM) will add technology from its Watson supercomputer, known

<p>The world''s biggest computer services provider also is
hiring Keith Salzman, a former chief medical information officer
at the Army hospital in Tacoma, Washington, where the Pentagon
plans to test the new health records project, for its U.S.
federal team. Salzman will become the division''s chief medical
officer, IBM said in a news release today. </p>
<p>IBM, whose U.S. agency contracts have slipped over the past
two years, is making the changes as companies prepare to compete
to deliver a new electronic medical-records system for the
Defense Department. The lifecycle cost of the project may be as
much as $11 billion, Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of
defense for health affairs, said in testimony before a U.S.
House appropriations subcommittee this month. </p>

the records project or include Watson technology in a potential

indictment of Singh''s decade as prime minister in a coalition
headed by the Congress party, said Subrata Mukherjee, a retired
professor of political science at Delhi University. </p>
<p>The world''s largest ever election will enter its final
three phases in May, including critical swing states of Uttar
Pradesh and Bihar. Opinion polls, which show the BJP ahead,
suggest Congress'' lead campaigner Rahul Gandhi is struggling to
shed the party''s image of policy paralysis which led to double-digit inflation and the slowest growth rate in a decade. </p>
<p>''While Kohli himself isn''t an important figure, he could
symbolize a shift in support from the Congress to the BJP in the
eyes of voters,'' Mukherjee said in an interview today. ''It''s a
smart political tactic, but I''m sure Kohli will be an
insignificant player in a BJP-led government.'' </p>
<h2>Political Significance </h2>
<p>Congress party Spokesman Satyavrat Chaturvedi said Kohli
never played a role in Singh''s government and his joining the
BJP wouldn''t affect Congress party''s electoral prospects.
Singh''s Spokesman Pankaj Pachauri didn''t answer two calls made
to his mobile phone today. </p>
<p>''You''ve never heard his name before yesterday, that is his
political significance,'' Chaturvedi said in a phone interview
from Delhi today. ''This is nothing more than a joke and an
effort to convince voters of this false Modi wave.'' </p>
<p>Modi, donning a traditional headgear worn by Sikhs,
welcomed Kohli while campaigning for Arun Jaitley, the leader of
the opposition in the upper house of parliament. He said the
Gandhi family had wasted opportunities for improving growth,
especially in trade and technology. </p>
<p>Since Jawaharlal Nehru, Rahul Gandhi''s great-grandfather,
became prime minister after British rule ended in 1947, the
Gandhi family has led India''s government for nearly 38 of its 67
years as an independent nation. </p>
<h2>Opinion Polls </h2>
<p>''Today, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh''s brother Daljeet
Singh joins the BJP, which will only strengthen us,'' Modi told
voters. ''We are not a membership party, we form blood bonds
which cannot be broken.'' </p>
<p>The latest opinion poll released on April 14 by Hansa
Research for the NDTV television channel predicts BJP and its
allies taking 275 seats, three more than needed for a majority.
Other polls show the BJP-led group falling short of 272 seats. </p>
<p>India has seen record turnout during the first six of the
election''s nine phases, according to the Election Commission of
India. Turnout has averaged 66 percent, up from 58 percent in
2009, the commission estimates. The last round of voting will
take place on May 12, with all votes counted on May 16. </p>

<p>The U.K. may have opened the door
for Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s $98.7 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the
country''s second-biggest drugmaker, with a tax policy designed
to draw research investment from abroad. </p>
<p>While the U.K. tightened takeover rules following Kraft
Foods Inc.''s hostile bid for candy maker Cadbury Plc, the
country has created incentives for drugmakers to increase
research and capital investments. A program implemented last
year enables companies to apply a lower corporate tax rate to
profits from patents. That encouraged GlaxoSmithKline Plc,
AstraZeneca''s larger British rival, to build its first U.K.
factory in almost four decades. </p>
<p>While Britain would lose AstraZeneca if Pfizer pulls off
the biggest-ever U.K. takeover, the nation would become the
domicile of the world''s biggest pharmaceutical company and
receive a $100 billion boost to its economy, Pfizer Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read said on a conference call with
reporters yesterday. A spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said there were rules in place governing acquisitions,
and declined to comment further. </p>

billion at Polar Capital Holdings Plc in London. ''You could

<p>U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) erasing an earlier slide, as Internet and smaller companies pulled back from a selloff amid optimism over merger activity. </p> <p>Pfizer Inc. added 4.2 percent after proposing to buy AstraZeneca Plc for about 58.8 billion pounds ($98.7 billion). Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. rallied more than 2.4 percent, leading gains among the largest technology companies. Bank of America Corp. dropped 6.3 percent after suspending its planned buybacks and dividend increase because of an error in its capital planning. </p> <p>The SP 500 rose 0.3 percent to 1,869.43 at 4 p.m. in New York, reversing an earlier loss of 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 87.28 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,448.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) declined less than 0.1 percent after tumbling as much as 1.5 percent, and the Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies slid 0.5 percent. About 7.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 9.3 percent above the three-month average. </p> <p>''It''s remarkable how volatile the market can be on an intraday basis,'' John Carey, a Boston-based fund manager at Pioneer Investment Management Inc., which oversees $220 billion worldwide, said by phone. ''Most of the companies that have reported so far have exceeded expectations and there''s MA that''s bubbling along and that could be causing some optimism, with big deals and restructuring.'' </p> <p>U.S. equities began higher as large companies rallied on optimism about merger activity. Stocks turned lower as the U.S. and European Union imposed new sanctions on Russia, while selling in Internet and small-cap stocks spread to the broader market. Major indexes recovered in the afternoon, turning positive during the final hour of trading. </p> <h2>Technology Selloff </h2> <p>The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5 percent last week, including a 1.8 percent tumble on April 25, as disappointing results from Amazon.com Inc. triggered a selloff in technology shares and tensions over Ukraine intensified. The technology-heavy gauge has fallen in four of the past five weeks amid concern valuations have outpaced estimates for earnings growth. Nasdaq companies trade at 34 times reported earnings, about double the level of SP 500 members. </p> <p>The frequency of selloffs has increased even as technology makers are forecast to post the second-fastest profit growth in the SP 500 this year and members of the Nasdaq 100 Index are beating analyst estimates by almost 10 percent this earnings season. </p> <h2>Microsoft, IBM </h2> <p>Increases among larger stocks helped push technology companies in the SP 500 higher as a group. Microsoft surged 2.4 percent to $40.87 and Apple climbed 3.9 percent to $594.09 to extend its three-day rally to 13 percent, the most since 2009. International Business Machines Corp. added 1.9 percent to $193.14. </p> <p>The Dow Jones Internet Index (VIX) fell 1.9 percent, extending a 4.1 percent decline on April 25. The index has dropped 18 percent from a 13-year high on March 5. Only four of 41 members in the gauge rose today. Yahoo! Inc. dropped 1.4 percent to $33.99. Amazon slumped 2.4 percent to $296.58. Netflix tumbled 2.4 percent to $314.21. </p> <p>A report by the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes climbed in March by the most in almost three years, showing residential real estate was starting to stabilize entering the spring selling season. The pending home sales index rose 3.4 percent, the first gain in nine months, after a 0.5 percent drop in February that was smaller than initially reported. </p> <h2>Economic Data </h2> <p>A busy calendar this week will give investors more clues about the strength of the economy and the pace of the Federal Reserve''s stimulus program. </p> <p>The government''s initial tally of first-quarter gross domestic product on April 30 may show the slowest expansion in a year. Federal Reserve policy makers, who on the same day conclude their third meeting of the year, will probably reduce the pace of assets purchases designed to stoke the economy. </p> <p>Three rounds of monetary stimulus have helped fuel economic growth, sending the SP 500 surging as much as 180 percent from its 2009 low. </p> <p>Payroll growth probably accelerated in April as companies remained upbeat about the economy''s prospects after a setback in demand caused by snowstorms and colder temperatures earlier this year. Employers added 215,000 workers, the most since November, economists project a May 2 report from the Labor Department will show. </p> <h2>Ukraine Crisis </h2> <p>Investors are also watching developments in Ukraine. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on seven Russian officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin''s inner circle involved in banking, energy and infrastructure. </p> <p>The sanctions, announced by the White House today, are being imposed in conjunction with the European Union, which said today it is adding 15 names to its list of previously sanctioned individuals. </p> <p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a gauge of options prices on the SP 500, dropped 0.6 percent for its first loss in four days. The gauge jumped 5.6 percent on April 25. </p> <p>Consumer-staples and phone companies had the biggest gains among 10 groups in the SP 500, climbing more than 1.1 percent. Financial and raw-materials shares declined the most, dropping at least 0.5 percent. </p> <h2>Pfizer, GE </h2> <p>Pfizer added 4.2 percent to $32.04. The world''s largest drugmaker is still interested in a deal after AstraZeneca spurned its earlier offer. Pfizer proposed buying the London-based company on Jan. 5 for 46.61 pounds a share in cash and stock, and AstraZeneca declined to pursue negotiations, the New York-based company said in a statement today. The bid was about 14 percent above AstraZeneca''s closing price on April 25. </p> <p>General Electric Co. gained 0.7 percent to $26.78 after Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt met with France''s President Francois Hollande over the company''s offer for Alstom SA. Immelt may be moving closer to pulling off his largest-ever acquisition, even after French officials over the weekend urged Alstom to consider a rival offer from Germany''s Siemens AG. </p> <p>The government doesn''t oppose GE''s proposal, and the meeting in Paris today focused on protecting jobs and maintaining the independence of France''s nuclear industry, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. The state doesn''t favor either bid, the person said, asking not to be named as the talks weren''t public. </p> <h2>Newmont, Barrick </h2> <p>NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. soared 7.3 percent to a record $17.20. American Realty Capital Properties Inc., the largest owner of single-tenant U.S. buildings, is interested in acquiring NorthStar for about $20 a share, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. That''s a premium of 25 percent to NorthStar''s closing price of $16.03 last week and would value the New York-based company at about $6.5 billion. American Realty fell 3 percent to $12.62. </p> <p>Newmont Mining Corp. dropped 6.7 percent to $24.67. Barrick Gold Corp. said Newmont ended discussions about a takeover, which would have combined the world''s two largest gold producers. Talks between Newmont and Toronto-based Barrick broke down on April 18 over a disagreement about a proposed spinoff of some of the combined company''s assets, people familiar with the situation said the following day. </p> <p>Bank of America lost 6.3 percent to $14.95. The bank said it will suspend its planned buybacks and dividend increase because of an error in its capital planning. The lender will resubmit its proposal to the Federal Reserve, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said in a statement. The company said it incorrectly adjusted for cumulative realized losses on structured notes issued by Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>', 'U.S. Stocks Gain as Selloff Fades in Internet, Small-Caps', 'By Callie Bost', 'Apr 28, 2014  4:42 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-28/u-s-stock-index-futures-climb-amid-pfizer-ge-m-a-buzz.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>LightSquared Inc.''s plan to
reorganize will improperly benefit lenders including JPMorgan
Chase  Co., which will own all of the wireless-spectrum
company''s assets after bankruptcy, Dish Network Corp. (DISH) Chairman
Charles Ergen said. </p>
<p>The plan was devised in talks where LightSquared''s
controlling shareholder, Philip Falcone, ''made it clear that he
was interested in using the plan to enrich himself and equity
holders,'' Ergen said yesterday in a bankruptcy court filing in
Manhattan. Falcone stated that he wanted to protect three
parties: his investment firm Harbinger Capital Partners LLC,
Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) and JPMorgan, Ergen said. </p>
<p>SP Special Opportunities Inc., an Ergen fund that invested
$1 billion in LightSquared debt, made the allegations following
an eight-day trial on whether LightSquared can reorganize under
a plan that puts Ergen''s debt behind other lenders and equity
holders to be repaid. In yesterday''s filing, the fund dissected
how much JPMorgan, Fortress, Harbinger and another investor,
Melody Capital Advisors LLC, stand to benefit compared with what
money they put at risk. </p>
<p>''Mr. Falcone made it clear in numerous e-mails that the
primary purpose of the plan and its subordination or
disallowance of SPSO''s claims was to enrich Mr. Falcone and
Harbinger,'' Ergen said. Closing arguments in the trial are
planned for May 5 and 6. </p>
<p>Falcone has said he had a fiduciary duty to advocate for
Harbinger''s investment. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan Affiliate </h2>
<p>JPMorgan (JPM) affiliate SIG Holdings Inc. currently holds all of
LightSquared''s series B preferred stock. The New York-based bank
also has put $360 million into LightSquared through operating
loans. </p>
<p>The investments may be worth ''hundreds of millions of
dollars,'' and JPMorgan will own all of LightSquared''s equity
and assets after the bankruptcy, Ergen said. JPMorgan also may
benefit from LightSquared tax-loss benefits estimated at more
than $2 billion, according to the filing. </p>
<p>LightSquared, based in Reston, Virginia, sought court
protection after the Federal Communications Commission blocked
the company''s wireless service, saying it might interfere with
global-positioning-system navigation equipment. The company
listed assets of $4.48 billion and debt of $2.29 billion. </p>

would be owned by a new U.K. parent. That doesn''t mean any of
New York-based Pfizer''s executives would need to move abroad:
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said the drugmaker would be
run from the U.S. It does mean, however, that Pfizer is joining
a wave of U.S. companies using mergers as ways to slash income
tax bills by shifting their head office overseas -- often on
paper only. </p>
<p>''This is basically an opportunity to go outside the U.S.
and still sell in the U.S. and strip the tax base,'' said H.

University''s school of law. ''If we ever had a legislature in
the United States, we could do something about this, but I don''t

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is rushing to fix a
security flaw in its Internet Explorer browser that is already
being used in ''limited, targeted attacks,'' as antivirus firms
and the U.S. government advise switching to alternate products. </p>
<p>To take over a user''s personal computer through the
browser''s vulnerability, a hacker would have to persuade that
person to click on a link to view a malicious website, Microsoft
said in an advisory. </p>
<p>The Explorer security concerns come just weeks after the
public discovery of Heartbleed, a flaw in the design of an
encryption tool that runs on as many as two-thirds of all active
websites. Some edition of Internet Explorer runs on 58 percent
of all desktop PCs, according NetMarketShare, compared with 18
percent for Google Inc.''s Chrome, the No. 2 browser. </p>
<p>''An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
could gain the same user rights as the current user,'' Microsoft
said in the advisory, issued on April 26. ''On completion of
this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action
to protect our customers, which may include providing a solution
through our monthly security update release process, or an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs.'' </p>
<h2>Windows XP </h2>
<p>The flaw exists in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11,
which means it will affect users of Windows XP, the operating
system that Microsoft stopped supporting with security updates
earlier this month. </p>
<p>Symantec Corp., the biggest maker of PC-security software,
advised customers to switch to another browser until Microsoft
releases a software patch to fix the vulnerability and to use a
security mitigation tool kit that Microsoft recommended and that
will work with Windows XP. The U.S. Department of Homeland
Security''s Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued similar
advice today. </p>
<p>The vulnerability was found on April 26 by researchers at
security firm FireEye Inc. (FEYE), who also discovered the related
attacks and named the campaign ''Operation Clandestine Fox.''
FireEye, in a statement on its blog, declined to provide details
of the campaign except to say that it was targeted at Internet
Explorer versions 9 through 11, which account for about a
quarter of the total browser market. </p>
<h2>Zero-Day Threat </h2>
<p>This type of security flaw is known as a zero-day threat
because there is no time between the discovery of the weakness
and attacks attempting to exploit it. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, researchers disclosed discovery of the
Heartbleed bug, a flaw in OpenSSL encryption software.
Researchers pushed out a fix for the vulnerability, which could
have enabled hackers to gain access to user names, passwords and
other sensitive information, and users were urged to change
their website passwords. Companies such as BlackBerry Ltd.,
Cisco Systems Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. were affected by the bug. </p>
<p>Consumer-data breaches at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus
Group Ltd. in recent months and the spying scandal involving the
National Security Agency have also raised concerns about the
security of networks and private information. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), one of two
banks that dominate clearing in the $1.8 trillion tri-party
repurchase agreement market, said it curtailed daily credit risk
that regulators blamed for fueling the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>All clients have been moved to a system that includes
rolling settlement, simultaneous exchange of cash and collateral
and creation of a secured committed clearance advance facility,
JPMorgan said today in a statement. Collectively, the changes
provide the bank with more protection against losses while
reducing the need of Wall Street dealers for intraday loans. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has been urging JPMorgan and Bank of
New York Mellon Corp. to speed improvements in repo markets,
which are used by the Fed''s primary dealers for short-term
funding. The system neared collapse in 2008 amid the demise of
Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Bankers had
pledged to finish upgrades by 2016, prompting the Fed to say
industry-led efforts were too slow. </p>
<p>''Every new piece of functionality introduced over the last
four years has allowed us to reduce materially the systemic risk
previously created by over-reliance on clearing-bank credit,''
Michael Albanese, head of JPMorgan''s U.S. tri-party repo
clearing and collateral management, said in the statement. </p>
<p>BNY Mellon, the industry leader, and JPMorgan act as
middlemen to process repo transactions and keep charge of
collateral. The role required the two New York-based banks to
temporarily extend hundreds of billions of dollars in credit for
several hours during the day, which puts their safety at risk if
the market breaks down before the deals are unwound. </p>
<h2>Curbing Risk </h2>
<p>The Fed''s goal was to curb the need for the lenders to
finance the deals, people familiar with the plans have said. The
market is the biggest source of financing for primary dealers,
the 22 firms that act as counterparties for the central bank. </p>
<p>BNY Mellon is ''fully on track for practically eliminating
intraday credit risk this year and enabling market participants
to continue to efficiently and effectively fund their
operations,'' Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the company, said in
an e-mailed statement. The lender, which handles about 80
percent of the transactions, expects to have the final pieces of
its upgrade in place by the end of this year, according to the
firm''s website. </p>
<p>Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed''s chairman during 2008, told the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that a breakdown of the tri-party market in 2008 almost created a ''black hole'' as
financial firms lost access to cash for daily operations. The
commission in a report cited structural flaws in the market as
one of the biggest causes of the crisis. </p>

franchise was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, owned by Viacom Inc. </p>
<p>''Cars,'' another Disney property, led the list last year,
when retail sales of from licensed toys climbed to $5.3 billion,
according to Port Washington, New York-based NPD. The toy
industry is increasingly relying on entertainment franchises to
spur sales. While total U.S. toy sales declined 1 percent last
year, revenue from licenses rose 3 percent. </p>

''Frozen,'' ''Planes'' and ''Sofia the First.'' The top spot
went to toys based on ''Despicable Me,'' owned by Comcast

<p>It''s a painful time to be a junk-bond skeptic. </p> <p>It may seem inevitable that the riskiest corporate debt will lose value, since investors are getting paid about the least ever to own such bonds. Yet after bearish wagers on the biggest junk-bond exchange-traded funds surged to a record last month, the market just keeps on rallying. </p> <p>''Will the search for yield come to tears?'' JPMorgan Chase  Co. strategists led by Jan Loeys wrote in an April 25 report. ''Eventually, yes.'' But not, at least, until probably next year, according to the strategists, who are sticking to a positive outlook for now on U.S. speculative-grade debt. </p> <p>The volume of borrowed shares -- usually used for short selling -- on BlackRock Inc.''s $13.3 billion ETF (HYG) soared to an all-time high of almost $3.6 billion on March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For State Street Corp.''s similar fund, the bets approached $1.3 billion, also a record. </p> <p>How did the market respond? BlackRock''s ETF has gained 0.3 percent this month, while State Street''s (JNK) is up 0.4 percent. Yields on the debt as measured by a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index dropped to 6.02 percent, about the same rate buyers were paid to own 10-year Treasuries (USGG10YR) during the past three decades. Investors have since pared their bearish ETF wagers a bit. </p> <h2>Hating Junk </h2> <p>Aversion to the market was on display at a hedge-fund conference last month. </p> <p>''We hate high-yield -- we''re actually short high-yield,'' Andrew Rabinowitz, Marathon Asset Management LP''s chief operating officer, said March 19 on a panel at the Absolute Return Symposium 2014 in New York. ''It''s trading at dangerous levels.'' </p> <p>DoubleLine Capital LP''s Jeffrey Gundlach trimmed allocations to the debt earlier this year, saying last month that ''if they start to suffer losses, you really wonder who''s going to buy them.'' </p> <p>As investors have learned over the past five years, it hasn''t paid to fight Federal Reserve stimulus, which is still supporting values that by any historical measure seem expensive. There''s a growing sense that the tide will turn. Many are losing confidence that the time is now. </p> <p>', 'Junk-Bond Skeptics Squeezed as JPMorgan Sees Tears in ''15', 'By Lisa Abramowicz', 'Apr 28, 2014 11:32 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-28/junk-bond-skeptics-squeezed-as-jpmorgan-sees-tears-in-15.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ended a
lawsuit that accused Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) of illegally protecting its
Windows computer operating system from competition 20 years ago
by undercutting a rival word-processing program. </p>
<p>Declining to take up a lingering antitrust case stemming
from Microsoft''s software dominance in the 1990s, the justices
today rejected without comment an appeal by Novell Inc., which
once made the WordPerfect application. </p>
<p>Novell was looking to revive a lawsuit that accused
Microsoft of anticompetitive conduct during development of its
Windows 95 operating system in 1994. Novell said that, late in
the rollout process, Microsoft withheld software components
known as namespace extensions so competing developers would have
trouble making their programs run smoothly on Windows. </p>
<p>Novell said the move slowed the development of WordPerfect,
a word-processing program that posed a threat to Microsoft''s
Word. </p>
<p>In throwing out the lawsuit, a Denver-based federal appeals
court said ''antitrust laws rarely impose on firms -- even
dominant firms -- a duty to deal with their rivals.'' The ruling
upheld a federal trial judge''s opinion. </p>
<p>Novell, now part of privately held Wizard Parent LLC,
argued in its appeal that Microsoft ''made its own operating
system less attractive to consumers in order to crush
competition and protect its operating system monopoly.'' </p>
<p>The case bore some similarities to the 1998 Justice
Department lawsuit that at one point produced a court order that
would have split Microsoft into two companies. An appeals court
overturned that order, and the company later settled the case by
agreeing to let computer makers promote rival software products. </p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts didn''t take part in the Supreme
Court action. He was involved as a lawyer in the Justice
Department''s antitrust case against Microsoft. </p>
<p>The case is Novell v. Microsoft, 13-1042. </p>

<p>Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan''s job will be safe if the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party comes to power in elections ending May 16, Piyush Goyal, the organization''s treasurer, said in an interview. </p> <p>''Just because he''s been appointed by someone else doesn''t mean we have an agenda to remove him,'' Goyal, a lawmaker who is on the standing committee on finance, said in New Delhi yesterday, referring to Rajan. ''No government can dictate to the central bank. It''s an autonomous body and he holds a constitutional position. We don''t have any likes or dislikes.'' </p> <p>Most polls show Narendra Modi''s BJP winning enough seats to form a coalition government as voters look to end 10 years of Congress party rule amid the slowest economic growth in a decade. Rajan this month dismissed talk of any differences with the BJP as ''speculation'' that was invented by the press. </p> <p>Goyal distanced himself from comments he made in February to the Economic Times newspaper, which quoted him saying that ''Governor Rajan is only aggravating the problems and making it worse by increasing interest rates.'' Goyal said he meant that RBI governors under Congress rule have been forced to increase rates due to ineffective policy implementation. </p> <h2>''Lousily Managed'' </h2> <p>''The Reserve Bank is fulfilling its duty to make an effort to reduce inflation, but sadly the government has been so lousily managed in the last few years,'' Goyal said. ''A government led by Modi will repress the concerns of any central bank leader.'' </p> <p>India: Reshaping the World''s Biggest Democracy</p><p>India''s consumer-price inflation quickened in March for the first time in four months to 8.31 percent from a year earlier, keeping pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates elevated. Rajan left the repurchase rate unchanged in the last review on April 1 after raising it by 75 basis points since September, and said further tightening isn''t anticipated if price gains stay on path to hit 8 percent in January 2015 and 6 percent a year later. </p> <p>Goyal said the BJP has ''zero tolerance for inflation'' and would move to prevent hoarding of fresh produce, which has exacerbated food prices during supply shortages. It would seek a price stabilization fund to support farmers during supply gluts and procure imports when there are shortages, he said, without saying how much it would cost. </p> <h2>BJP Worries </h2> <p>Government pressure on Rajan to change his policy focus ''would be perceived as shooting themselves in the foot because Rajan has been the source of credibility in India and you don''t want to destroy that,'' said Benoit Anne, London-based head of emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA. ''The best thing that they can do is to leave him alone.'' </p> <p>The 1934 Reserve Bank of India Act says the federal government may give direction to the central bank on what it considers the public interest. The provision has never been used and doesn''t mention monetary policy, Chakravarthy Rangarajan, a former RBI governor who is chairman of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Economic Advisory Council, said in an Oct. 9 interview. </p> <p>India''s rupee has been the best performer among emerging markets since hitting an all-time low on Aug. 28, surging 14 percent in that time as Rajan offered discounted swaps for dollars raised by banks and on optimism that a Modi government will boost economic growth. The benchmark SP BSE Sensex has climbed 15 percent since Sept. 13, when the BJP named Modi as its prime minister candidate. </p> <h2>Fiscal Deficit </h2> <p>Reducing the fiscal deficit and fighting corruption would give space for interest rates to come down, Goyal said. </p> <p>The ruling Congress party saw the fiscal deficit rise to a peak of 6.5 percent of gross domestic product in the 2010 fiscal year. It will narrow to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product by March 31, 2015 from an estimated 4.6 percent in the previous fiscal year, lower than an earlier target of 4.8 percent, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in February. </p> <p>India''s subsidy bill rose fivefold in the past decade under Singh''s ruling Congress party to 2.6 trillion rupees ($43 billion) a year. In the same period, the Indian economy has only doubled in size, according to the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>India has seen record turnout averaging 66 percent through six of nine rounds of voting, according to the Election Commission of India. More than two-thirds of seats among the 543 up for grabs have already been decided. The last round of voting will take place on May 12, with all votes counted on May 16. </p> <p>', 'Rajan Job Safe If Modi Wins India Polls, BJP Treasurer Says', 'By Kartikay Mehrotra', 'Apr 28, 2014  2:31 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-28/rajan-s-job-safe-if-modi-wins-india-election-bjp-treasurer-says.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>The Swiss units of Goldman Sachs
Group (GS) Inc. and Morgan Stanley (MS) are among 106 banks seeking U.S.
non-prosecution agreements after saying they had reason to
believe they helped Americans violate tax laws, according to
three people familiar with the banks'' actions. </p>
<p>Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley applied to a Justice
Department program that requires banks to disclose how they
helped Americans hide assets, hand over data on undeclared
accounts and pay penalties, according to the people who asked
not to be identified because they weren''t authorized to discuss
the matter publicly. </p>
<p>To gain non-prosecution deals, banks must pay 20 percent of
the value of accounts not disclosed to the Internal Revenue
Service on Aug. 1, 2008, 30 percent for such accounts opened
between then and February 2009 and 50 percent for accounts
opened afterward. Banks submitted letters of intent by Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Wesley
McDade, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The voluntary disclosure program, offered last year to more
than 300 Swiss banks, is part of the U.S. crackdown on offshore
tax evasion. It wasn''t open to 14 institutions already under
criminal investigation, including Credit Suisse Group AG, the
second-biggest Swiss bank; the Swiss unit of HSBC Holdings Plc;
Julius Baer Group Ltd., Switzerland''s third-largest wealth
manager; and Zuercher Kantonalbank, the largest state-owned
regional bank. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is considering strategic options for its
Swiss private bank, including a sale or wind-down, a person
briefed on the discussions said last month. </p>
<h2>Undeclared Accounts </h2>
<p>Those under criminal investigation are known as Category 1
banks, while those seeking non-prosecution agreements are called
Category 2. If no undeclared U.S. accounts are found, banks can
apply as Category 3. Category 4 banks are those with mainly
local clients. </p>
<p>Banks seeking non-prosecution agreements must disclose the
total number of U.S. accounts since 2008, their highest dollar
value, and the employees who managed them. The banks also must
use independent examiners to certify findings. </p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said in January
that the department is reviewing the letters of intent to see if
applicants qualify as Swiss banks. Some banks are still
reviewing records, and some may withdraw, she said. </p>
<p>At least 33 banks announced that they will join the program
in Category 2, including Cie. Lombard, Odier SCA, Geneva''s
oldest bank, and BSI Group, the Swiss private bank owned by
Italy''s Assicurazioni Generali SpA. </p>
<p>Banks that said they will participate include: Union
Bancaire Privee, the Geneva-based bank founded by Edgar de
Picciotto in 1969; Edmond de Rothschild Group, owned by Baron
Benjamin de Rothschild; and EFG International AG, controlled by
Greek billionaire Spiro Latsis and his family. Another 15 banks,
mainly regional lenders, declared they will opt for Category 3
or 4. </p>
<p>Category 3 banks seek Justice Department letters saying
they''re not a target of a criminal probe. In return, an
independent examiner must confirm the bank broke no laws. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal earlier reported about the banks''
participation in the U.S. program. </p>

Shell Plc (RDSA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) have the capacity to bid for BG

<p>Finlayson''s sudden departure has started speculation that
the U.K.''s third-largest oil company may become a target as bids

oil assets in Brazil, gas discoveries in Tanzania and a gas-export plant in Australia, has a market value of 39.6 billion

unveiled project delays, and haven''t recovered yet. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. named

America research amid a leadership overhaul in the global
banking division. </p>
<p>Werning will replace and report to Luis Oganes, who was
promoted earlier this month to global head of emerging-markets

<p>MasterCard Inc. (MA)''s approach to making bank-card transactions more secure could give it a competitive edge, analysts said after Target Corp. (TGT) awarded its portfolio to the company yesterday over larger rival Visa Inc. (V) </p> <p>Target, which suffered a data breach during the holiday season, said its co-branded cards and in-house REDcards would use MasterCard''s network and technology instead of Visa''s. </p> <p>Visa and MasterCard have given retailers and banks until October 2015 to adopt so-called EMV technology or assume liability for bogus transactions. Merchants and lenders can use chip cards that require a signature or a personal identification number. While Visa''s approach doesn''t distinguish between the two, MasterCard''s emphasizes PIN, which could improve its prospects with retailers who prefer that method. </p> <p>''We were not anticipating the EMV shift could be catalyst for portfolio movement from Visa to MasterCard and this shows that there are some opportunities,'' David Darst, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said of Target''s decision. </p> <p>Target said it would accelerate its move to chip-card technology after tens of millions of credit- and debit-card accounts were breached late last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer said yesterday that upgrade would include chip-and-PIN. </p> <p>''Target is very publicly broadcasting that they are an early adopter of EMV and it''s not just EMV, it''s also chip-and-PIN,'' said Darrin Peller, a Barclays Plc analyst. ''That gives room to someone like MasterCard to gain market share.'' </p> <h2>''Nice Win'' </h2> <p>Earlier this month, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the largest U.S. retailer, chose MasterCard to handle transactions for its store-branded credit cards, ending a nine-year relationship with Discover Financial Services. </p> <p>While Target''s deal with Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is a ''nice win,'' the revenue boost should be ''fairly negligible,'' according to Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods in New York. Target cards currently are co-branded with Foster City, California-based Visa. </p> <p>The deal may boost MasterCard''s annual revenue by about $13 million, or 1 cent a share, Sakhrani said. </p> <p>MasterCard rose 0.7 percent to $72.55 at 12:03 p.m. in New York and Visa was little changed at $202.72. The shares have slid 13 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively, this year. </p> <p>EMV -- a technology named for founders EuroPay International, MasterCard and Visa -- is standard in Europe and much of the rest of the world and makes it more difficult for hackers to clone card data. EMV has been slower to catch on in the U.S. in part because it cost merchants and issuers more than cards with magnetic strips. </p> <h2>Held Accountable </h2> <p>''Target is in a position where they need to show how they are changing,'' said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. ''By switching to MasterCard -- and going with that perception that MasterCard is more oriented toward PIN -- they can communicate that they are making a change to become more secure.'' </p> <p>Requiring a PIN adds security that protects against fraud involving lost or stolen cards. While MasterCard''s strategy allows for either PIN or signature, it supports a hierarchy that holds whichever party -- issuers or merchants -- offering the least secure method liable when cards are compromised. Visa doesn''t have a similar pecking order. </p> <p>''Whatever verification method is adopted is the choice of our merchant and financial institution clients and we will support whatever verification method they prefer,'' said Paul Cohen, a Visa spokesman. </p> <h2>''More Competitive'' </h2> <p>Target choosing MasterCard also means that the company may have more opportunity to gain debit-card market share, according to Barclays''s Peller. Visa currently has the majority of the U.S. signature debit-card market, he said. </p> <p>''It makes the landscape more competitive for debit,'' as more PIN technology is introduced, Peller said. </p> <p>Groups including the National Retail Federation have also said they prefer chip-and-PIN cards. As the industry continues its conversion, it''s possible MasterCard may win more business from merchants advocating for PIN technology, according to Guggenheim''s Darst. </p> <p>''There are different times when there could be portfolio or market share movement from Visa to MasterCard,'' Darst said.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will begin selling its Xbox One video-game console in China in September after a 13-year ban on such equipment was lifted in January. </p> <p>The device will be sold through Microsoft''s partnership with BesTV New Media Co. (600637), a unit of Shanghai Media Group Inc., the company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Microsoft didn''t provide details on game titles for the Chinese market, except to say the venture will invest ''to establish an innovation program that will enable creators and developers to build, publish, and sell their games on Xbox One in China.'' </p> <p>China''s video-game industry will generate about $10 billion in sales next year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and the rule change has set off a flurry of activity.

''Right now they don''t have a clear value proposition of what content they are going to sell on the gaming front, the music front, the TV front or the movie front.'' </p> <p>Microsoft formed the $79 million venture with BesTV in September to enter the Chinese market. Microsoft will make an official announcement tomorrow in China about the Xbox debut. </p> <p>Consoles such as the Xbox, Nintendo''s Wii U and Sony''s PlayStation were banned under a 2000 rule to protect youths from the perceived corrupting influence of video games. China announced last year that the ban would be lifted within the Shanghai free-trade zone, which opened in September. </p> <p>In January, China''s ruling State Council temporarily suspended the ban for the entire country and said it will draft new rules. </p> <p>BesTV invested $40.3 million for a 51 percent stake in the joint venture, while Microsoft put in $38.7 million for the rest, according a September filing. </p> <p>The Xbox One, which went on sale in November, has been outgunned in U.S. sales by Sony''s PlayStation 4 for three consecutive months, according to market research firm NPD Group Inc. </p> <p>Sales of the $399 PlayStation 4, also released in November, have surpassed 7 million units worldwide through April 6, Sony said in an April 16 statement.

<p>Pfizer (PFE) Inc.''s $106 billion bid for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) faces increased resistance as the unwilling
target''s chairman listed the reasons the offer was rejected and
British lawmakers began efforts to block the buyout attempt. </p>
<p>The offer ''significantly undervalued'' AstraZeneca,
Chairman Leif Johansson said today in a video posted to the
company website. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, offered 46.61 pounds a
share in cash and stock in January, and London-based AstraZeneca
declined to pursue negotiations. On April 28, Pfizer made the
offer public and said it wanted to restart discussions.
AstraZeneca was also concerned that the offer was too heavily
weighted in stock, and about the proposed tax structure of the
new entity, Johansson said in the four-minute video. </p>
<p>''AstraZeneca has a clear innovation-based strategy,
focused on achieving scientific leadership and returning to
growth,'' he said. ''The board is also confident in our ability
to successfully execute that strategy as an independent
company.'' </p>
<p>The deal may run into barriers set by U.K. officials
worried about the loss of jobs and research investment. </p>
<p>Pfizer executives likely will be summoned before
parliament''s Business Committee to explain their intentions,
Adrian Bailey, the committee''s chairman, said April 29.
Yesterday, Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat member of
parliament, submitted a motion calling for ministers to ''act as
necessary to protect employment and skills in the U.K.'' </p>
<h2>Largest Takeover </h2>
<p>''There is a great deal at stake here,'' Huppert said in a
statement. ''This would be the largest takeover of a British
firm. I want to make sure AstraZeneca retains its position in
the U.K. It is extremely important for those people employed by
the company and our economy generally.'' </p>
<p>Under the terms of Pfizer''s offer, a deal would create a
company incorporated in the U.K. for tax purposes and run out of
New York, where Pfizer is based. The U.S. company has until May
26 to make an offer for AstraZeneca, or say that it won''t bid,
under U.K. takeover rules. </p>
<p>On a conference call with reporters, Pfizer Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read said he wouldn''t commit to preserving British
jobs, although he added the U.K. was an attractive jurisdiction
in which to do business. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca shares have climbed 32 percent since Jan. 1.
That growth shows that shareholders have endorsed the company''s
strategy, Johansson said. </p>
<p>The stock rose 1.1 percent to 4,715.50 pence at 11:37 a.m.
in London. </p>
<h2>Pfizer Meeting </h2>
<p>Read met with U.K. government ministers April 29 to discuss
a potential takeover, according to a person familiar with the
meetings. Read emphasized the American company''s plans to carry
out research, development and manufacturing in the U.K. as well
as the appeal of the British tax system, the person said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s reputation in Parliament isn''t helped by its 2011
decision to close a research hub in the coastal town of
Sandwich, southeast England, with the loss of 2,000 jobs.
AstraZeneca is moving to a new global headquarters and research
center in Cambridge, which is represented by Huppert. </p>
<p>Bailey''s committee will discuss on May 6 whether to hold
hearings with executives. </p>
<p>''I view it with great concern,'' Bailey, who is a Labour
lawmaker, told reporters. ''We have a company which closed its
operations in Sandwich for tax purposes and now says it''s buying
a British company for tax purposes.'' </p>
<p>If the bid goes ahead and is subject to a European
Commission investigation, the U.K. may ask for it to be referred
back on public interest grounds, at which point ministers could
block it. Or the government could try to amend the Enterprise
Act, which allows ministers to intervene to protect national
security, media plurality and the stability of the financial
system. </p>
<p>Jean-Christophe Gray, spokesman for Prime Minister David
Cameron, called AstraZeneca''s research center in Cambridge ''a
significant part of the U.K.''s developing science skill base.'' </p>
<p>''Would you expect senior figures in government to take
close interest? Of course,'' Gray said in London today. </p>

''You''re seeing a massive rotation from the frothy, speculative glamor areas.'' </p> <h2>Equity Valuations </h2> <p>The Dow''s gain of 45.47 points yesterday bought its April advance to 0.8 percent, a third straight monthly gain that capped a 7.9 percent rally from its Feb. 3 low. The index sank 7.3 percent in the first five weeks of this year after surging 27 percent to close 2013 at the record. </p> <p>Dow futures gained 14 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 16,525 at 9:44 a.m. in London today. </p> <p>The Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) of technology stocks sank 2 percent last month, adding to a 2.5 percent slide in March that was its steepest since 2012, as investors sold the biggest winners from the five-year bull market on concern that valuations have outpaced earnings growth. </p> <p>Stocks in the Dow index trade for an average of 15 times reported earnings, while the higher-growth members of the Nasdaq index are valued at 35 times profit. </p> <p>Caterpillar climbed 0.1 percent yesterday to $105.40, up from a 2014 low of $86.17 on Jan. 24. The world''s largest maker of construction machinery said sales in that segment rose 20 percent in the first quarter while earnings tripled. IBM increased 0.7 percent to $196.47, compared with a low of $172.84 on Feb. 4. </p> <p>The blue-chip record came amid broader equity gains today after the Fed concluded its two-day policy meeting. </p> <h2>Growth Pickup </h2> <p>''Growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply,'' the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement following a meeting in Washington. ''Household spending appears to be rising more quickly.'' </p> <p>Policy makers committee pared monthly asset buying to $45 billion, its fourth straight $10 billion cut, and said further reductions in ''measured steps'' are likely. </p> <p>''The Fed seems to be putting aside the weakness in the first quarter that the market reacted to this morning,'' Walter Todd, who oversees about $975 million as chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC, said in a phone interview. ''The statement seems business as usual, and perhaps if you''d seen the Fed react more dovish to a weaker first quarter, that would''ve been more negative.'' </p> <h2>SP Recovery </h2> <p>The Fed decision pushed the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index to within seven points of its all-time high reached on April 2. The gauge rose 0.3 percent to cap a 0.6 percent gain in April, its third straight monthly advance. </p> <p>The SP 500''s 8.2 percent recovery from a low of 1,741.89 on Feb. 3 has been led by a 14 percent rally energy stocks and increases of 11 percent each in industries least tied to economic growth: utilities and home-product makers. </p> <p>Fed Chair Janet Yellen is winding down record stimulus as the economy shows signs of rebounding from a first-quarter standstill. At the same time, the Fed repeated that it''s likely to keep the benchmark interest rate near zero for a ''considerable time'' after bond purchases end. </p> <p>''This announcement is really no news is good news. No surprises here,'' Kristina Hooper, a U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York, said in a phone interview. The firm oversees $475 billion. ''The market will have a positive reaction, might be muted, but it''s positive because this announcement is more of the same in terms of underscoring that Fed is going to remain very accommodative.'' </p> <h2>Barely Grew </h2> <p>Data today showed the U.S. economy barely grew in the first quarter as harsh winter weather chilled investment and exports dropped. The expansion stalled even as consumer spending on services rose by the most in 14 years. </p> <p>Gross domestic product grew at a 0.1 percent annualized rate from January through March, compared with a 2.6 percent gain in the prior quarter, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington. The median forecast of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.2 percent increase. </p> <p>The pullback in growth came as snow blanketed much of the eastern half of the country, keeping shoppers from stores, preventing builders from breaking ground and raising costs for companies including United Parcel Service Inc. </p> <p>Companies in the U.S. boosted payrolls by 220,000 in April, figures from the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, New Jersey, showed today. The median forecast of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 210,000. </p> <h2>Jobs Reports </h2> <p>The ADP numbers come before data from the Labor Department on May 2. The government''s report may show employers added 215,000 workers in April, the most since November, according to economists'' projections. </p> <p>Some 75 percent of the 310 SP 500 (SPX) members that have reported earnings this season have posted profit that exceeded analysts'' estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About 52 percent beat sales projections, according to the data. </p> <p>Profits for members of the index climbed 3.4 percent in the first quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. They had predicted an increase of 0.7 percent as recently as April 17. Revenue probably rose 2.8 percent in the quarter, the projections show. </p> <p>', 'Dow Jones Index Reaches Record as Caterpillar, IBM Rally', 'By Joseph Ciolli and Lu Wang', 'May 01, 2014  4:45 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-01/dow-gets-back-to-record-as-caterpillar-joins-ibm-in-rally.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world''s

<p>Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will drop about
20 percent from a year earlier at the New York-based company
amid ''a continued challenging environment and lower client
activity levels,'' JPMorgan said yesterday in its quarterly
regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
Continued weakness has spurred analysts including Chris Mutascio
of Stifel Financial Corp.''s KBW unit to ponder whether the drop
in fixed-income trading might persist through 2014 and beyond. </p>
<p>''It''s an industry phenomenon, and other banks allow
JPMorgan to grease the skids for them so there can be a gentle
letdown process,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC. </p>
<p>A 20 percent revenue slide from the $5.37 billion JPMorgan
posted in last year''s second quarter would mean results of $4.3
billion this period. That figure, along with the first quarter''s
$5.06 billion, would mark the bank''s worst first half in trading
since the financial crisis. </p>

<p>In January 2010, four months before
then Prime Minister Gordon Brown''s election defeat, Kraft Foods
Group Inc.''s takeover of candy maker Cadbury Plc was used by the
Conservative opposition to portray a government that was out of
touch with the British people. </p>
<p>Now in power and facing his own general election within the
year, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron is seeking to
avoid opening himself to a similar charge over Pfizer Inc.''s bid
for London-based AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) </p>
<p>Even as Pfizer''s 63.1 billion-pound ($106.5 billion)
sweetened offer for AstraZeneca was rejected, the government
said it was pressing Pfizer for assurances on jobs and the
U.K.''s place as a center for the life-sciences industry. The
government will carefully weigh Pfizer''s proposals to see
''whether they offer sufficient protection of our priorities,''
Cameron''s office said yesterday. </p>
<p>Cameron''s Conservative-led coalition is trying to strike a
balance between leaving the decision to the companies''
shareholders without government interference and securing
safeguards for jobs and U.K. science. In doing so, it is being
reminded of Northfield, Illinois-based Kraft''s reversal of a
pledge to keep open a Cadbury plant in Keynsham, southwestern
England. </p>
<p>Whether Pfizer''s commitments are binding ''is a real
issue,'' Science Minister David Willetts said in an interview.
''After the way in which Labour mishandled Kraft''s takeover of
Cadbury, we''re very much aware of it.'' </p>
<h2>Electoral Pressure </h2>
<p>The AstraZeneca takeover bid is all the more sensitive to
Cameron less than three weeks before his party contests local
and European elections at which securing jobs will play a role.
With a U.K. general election due in May 2015, the opposition
Labour Party has upped the political pressure, accusing the
premier of being ''in league'' with Pfizer, which its business
spokesman, Chuka Umunna, referred to as ''the beast.'' </p>
<p>''Labour will try to get as much advantage out of it as
possible but would be doing similar things if they were in
power,'' Steve Fielding, who teaches politics at the University
of Nottingham, said in an interview. That said, ''if people
start losing their jobs, then Labour will say ''we did warn
you,'''' he said. </p>
<p>Cameron''s office yesterday welcomed a letter to the prime
minister from Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read,
describing it as ''a positive sign with significant undertakings
on research, jobs and investment.'' In it, Read pledged to set
up the company headquarters in the U.K., complete a planned
AstraZeneca science hub in Cambridge, eastern England, and
protect jobs in Britain. </p>
<h2>Plant Pledge </h2>
<p>In 2010, Cadbury agreed to be sold to Kraft for 11.7
billion pounds, creating the world''s largest confectionery
company. Business Secretary Peter Mandelson was accused by the
opposition of failing to stand up for British workers after
Kraft went back on its pledge to keep open a Cadbury plant with
400 workers in Keynsham. </p>
<p>Kraft''s Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld said in
September 2009, at the beginning of the unsolicited takeover,
that she believed the Keynsham plant could be kept open, only to
announce seven days after her company''s offer was made
unconditional, that it would close. The U.K.''s takeover panel
reprimanded the company for misstating its plans. </p>
<p>Peter Luff, a Conservative lawmaker and then chairman of
the House of Commons Business Committee, said at the time he was
''left with the uncomfortable feeling that politicians in these
circumstances can''t do anything except talk.'' He compared
Mandelson to Shakespeare''s King Lear,''fulminating against the
winds but without any control over those winds.'' </p>
<h2>Benevolent Employer </h2>
<p>Founded by John Cadbury in 1824 in Birmingham, central
England, Cadbury built a reputation as a benevolent employer
after John''s sons Richard and George opened a ''factory in a
garden'' in 1879 and provided housing, education facilities and
sports fields for their staff. </p>
<p>Rosenfeld, in a letter to Mandelson, pledged to ''proceed
with sincere respect for Cadbury''s heritage and identity,''
Mandelson told lawmakers on Luff''s committee in January 2010. He
rejected calls from lawmakers in his then governing Labour Party
for new powers to stop such mergers and said he would meet with
Kraft to ''hear how Kraft will fulfill the commitments they made
to Cadbury and its workforce.'' </p>
<p>In Cameron''s favor is the fact that AstraZeneca, while it
is Britain''s second biggest pharmaceutical company, does not
enjoy the same household status as Cadbury, maker of chocolate
Creme Eggs and Dairy Milk bars. </p>
<p>For most people in the U.K., Cadbury ''was an issue that
had a resonance because they''d heard of the product,'' said
Fielding. ''AstraZeneca is not a name people talk about down the
pub.'' </p>

<p>Wang also was global co-head of the One Delta trading unit,
according to an internal memo from trading co-heads Isabelle Ealet, Pablo Salame and Ashok Varadhan. Michael DuVally, a
Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the top equity-trading bank last year,
posted a 6 percent decline in first-quarter revenue for that

to hedge holdings or bet on directional moves in markets using
derivatives or baskets of securities, which can be cheaper to
trade than obtaining all of the stocks involved. </p>

2006, according to the memo. He took on his most recent role in

<p>Peter D. Selman is the other co-head for the Americas
equities business, while Brian T. Levine serves as co-head of

<p>AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) rejected Pfizer Inc.''s (PFE) sweetened takeover proposal, saying the 62.6 billion-pound ($105.6 billion) offer fails to appreciate the value of the promising medicines under development by the U.K.''s second-biggest drugmaker. </p> <p>The cash-and-stock offer, which values AstraZeneca at about 50 pounds a share based on today''s closing price for Pfizer, also still relies too heavily on equity, London-based AstraZeneca said in a statement.

Pfizer-AstraZeneca Deal Threatens Spending on New Drugs
U.K. Signals It Won''t Block Pfizer''s Bid for AstraZeneca
Pfizer Planning to Raise AstraZeneca Bid Above $106 Billion
<p>AstraZeneca may not get much help from the government of U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron in fending off Pfizer. The government today signaled it wouldn''t interfere, rebuffing calls from members of other political parties to step in to protect jobs in the country''s science base. </p> <p>AstraZeneca declined less than 1 percent to 48.08 pounds in London. Pfizer fell 1.3 percent to $30.75 in New York. </p> <h2>CEO Meetings </h2> <p>Pfizer raised its bid after Chief Executive Officer Ian Read met with AstraZeneca shareholders and government officials in the U.K. In a letter to Cameron, New York-based Pfizer pledged to follow through on AstraZeneca''s plan to build a substantial campus in Cambridge, England, and to keep key scientific management at the site. </p> <p>''This is ultimately a decision for AstraZeneca shareholders,'' said Universities and Science Minister David Willetts in an interview. </p> <p>The U.K. government has been in talks with Pfizer about preserving jobs, particularly in research and manufacturing, in the country, Willetts said. </p> <p>''I think those messages are getting home to Pfizer, but there''s a lot more hard-headed negotiation to come,'' Willetts said. </p> <p>Cameron spoke with Johansson today about the deal, said Jean-Christophe Gray, Cameron''s spokesman. </p> <p>''AstraZeneca has a fantastic role in the British economy,'' Cameron told reporters today in Newcastle-Under-Lyme, England. ''Action on any merger is a decision for both companies. We''ve sought and received robust assurances from Pfizer should the deal go ahead.'' </p> <h2>Tax Rate </h2> <p>Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a lower tax rate because the combined company would be a corporate resident of England. The company, which would maintain its head office in New York, also would gain a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs from the purchase. </p> <p>AstraZeneca in its April 28 statement rejecting the initial offer said Pfizer''s decision to move its tax domicile to the U.K. may be problematic. The U.K. company highlighted that issue again in today''s statement. </p> <p>Pfizer''s earlier offer, made in January, valued AstraZeneca at 58.8 billion pounds. The acquisition would be the largest ever of a U.K. company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and would create the world''s biggest drugmaker by sales. </p> <p>''The consistent message from leading shareholders reinforces our belief that there is a highly compelling strategic, business and financial rationale for combining our businesses, with significant benefits for all our stakeholders,'' Read said in a letter to Johansson. ''We believe our revised terms will be viewed by the market as a basis for engagement.'' </p> <h2>Cash Mix </h2> <p>Stockholders would get 15.98 pounds in cash and 1.845 shares of the combined company for each share in AstraZeneca, Pfizer said. The new bid was 7.3 percent above the previous proposal and 39 percent above the closing price Jan. 3, before AstraZeneca made its initial offer. </p> <p>The new proposal consists of about 32 percent cash and 68 percent stock, versus about 30 percent cash and 70 percent stock in the original offer. AstraZeneca said April 28 the initial bid ''very significantly undervalued'' the company, and said it was concerned that too much of the payment was in stock rather than cash. </p> <h2>Limited Commitment </h2> <p>Pfizer, in the letter to Cameron, pledged to keep at least 20 percent of the combined company''s research and development workforce in the U.K., retain ''substantial'' manufacturing facilities at AstraZeneca''s site in Macclesfield, England, and invite at least two AstraZeneca directors to join Pfizer''s board. </p> <p>The U.S. company is committing to the steps for at least five years, though it could ''adjust these obligations should circumstances significantly change,'' according to the Pfizer statement. </p> <p>AstraZeneca employs almost 2,000 people in Macclesfield, and the company is in the process of moving its corporate headquarters from London to Cambridge. </p> <p>', 'AstraZeneca Snubs Pfizer Approach That U.K. Won''t Block', 'By Oliver Staley and Robert Hutton', 'May 02, 2014  4:29 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-02/pfizer-raises-astrazeneca-offer-to-106-5-billion.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson''s goal of breaking a production
record three years from now just got harder to reach. </p>
<p>After spending more than $100 million a day on average
during the first three months of the year on new oil wells and
other projects, Chevron posted its lowest first-quarter crude
and natural gas output since 2006 today. The company pumped the
equivalent of 2.59 million barrels a day during the period, 1
percent below the average estimate of three analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The output disappointment comes less than two months after
Watson scaled back his 2017 output target to 3.1 million barrels
a day from 3.3 million amid low gas prices that stalled some
drilling and scant new discoveries. For Chevron, the world''s
third-largest energy company by market value, production in the
era after its 2001 takeover of Texaco Inc. peaked at 2.78
million a day in 2010. </p>
<p>''They are having to battle quite hard to get bottom-line
production growing,'' Stephen Clark, who helps manage $305
billion, including Chevron shares, at Standard Life Investments
in Boston, said in a telephone interview today. ''The sheer size
of some of the projects is an issue.'' </p>
<p>Watson cited winter weather in Kazakhstan, the source of
one in every eight barrels Chevron pumps worldwide, and a storm
in Thailand for the production decline. ''We continue to advance
our key development projects'' that will begin boosting output
next year, he said in a statement today. </p>
<h2>Still Viable </h2>
<p>The Chevron-operated $10 billion Angola LNG complex in
Africa that chills gas for shipment to overseas markets has been
shut since a pipe failure in mid-April, Chief Financial Officer
Pat Yarrington said during a conference call today. </p>
<p>An internal investigation into the incident should be
concluded in a matter of days, she said. Yarrington didn''t
provide an expected restart date, though she said the outage
will have a negative impact on Chevron''s overall production. </p>
<p>Watson''s 2017 goal ''still seems viable because they have a
lot of big projects coming on,'' said Stewart Glickman, an
equity analyst at SP Capital IQ in New York who rates Chevron a
buy and doesn''t own any shares. New contributions to output will
include fields beneath the Gulf of Mexico and off the Australian
coast, he said in an interview today. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income was $4.51 billion, or $2.36 a
share, compared with $6.18 billion, or $3.18, a year earlier,
San Ramon, California-based Chevron said in the statement. Sales
fell 6.1 percent to $50.98 billion. The company increased
capital spending 5.6 percent to $9.4 billion during the quarter. </p>
<h2>Russia Pipeline </h2>
<p>Chevron is among international energy explorers caught in
the middle of an intensifying row between the U.S. and its
European allies on one side, and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the other. Putin put foreign oil companies on the spot
on April 29 when he said they may be shut out of his country if
their governments continue to ratchet up sanctions against
Russian nationals and institutions. </p>
<p>Chevron and its partners are in the midst of a $5.4 billion
expansion of a pipeline that carries oil across Russia''s
Caucasus region from fields in neighboring Kazakhstan that
account for 12 percent of the company''s global supplies. </p>
<h2>Spending, Selling </h2>
<p>Watson is spending almost $40 billion this year to drill
for new discoveries and transport oil, gas and fuels such as
diesel to markets. In tandem with exploration forays that span
the globe from Argentina to China, Watson is overseeing $10
billion in asset sales to narrow the company''s focus on its
highest-profit projects. </p>
<p>Brent crude futures, the benchmark for more than half the
world''s oil, declined by 4.2 percent to an average of $107.92 a
barrel during the quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. U.S. gas prices climbed 35 percent to average $4.712
per million British thermal units during that period. </p>
<p>Chevron dropped 0.2 percent to $124.72 at the close in New
York. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. is the world''s largest energy company by
market value, followed by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc. </p>

Trading houses such as Mercuria, which has in less than a decade grown to become the world''s fourth-largest independent commodity trader with 2013 revenue of $112 billion, are filling the void. </p> <p>JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Burton declined to comment as did Mercuria spokesman Benoit Lioud. </p> <p>Mercuria is most interested in JPMorgan''s physical gas and power traders in Europe and the U.S. as well as gas and crude trading operations in Canada, the person said. </p> <p>Blythe Masters, the head of the bank''s global commodities operations, will leave once the sale is completed, JPMorgan has said. </p> <h2>Henry Bath </h2> <p>Mercuria hasn''t decided how many of the more than 100 employees at JPMorgan''s Henry Bath  Sons Ltd. metals warehousing unit will be asked to join the new company, the person said. The 220-year-old Liverpool-based firm handles and stores aluminum, copper and other metals and was a founding member of the London Metal Exchange. </p> <p>From 2011 to 2013, Mercuria hired 570 people, including executives from banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays. That boosted staff to 1,200 from about 10 in 2004. </p> <p>The JPMorgan unit will give Mercuria gas and power trading operations on both sides of the Atlantic, physical assets spanning 40 locations in North America, an oil-trading book with a supply and off-take contract at the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast, and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian oil sands. </p> <h2>European Gas </h2> <p>Mercuria''s head of compliance Victoria Attwood Scott said last month that the trading house is in discussions with Britain''s Financial Conduct Authority to determine whether the purchase of JPMorgan''s European gas and power business means Mercuria should be subject to regulatory oversight. Unlike banks, the FCA does not have regulatory authority over trading houses. </p> <p>Revenue for the 10 largest investment-bank commodity operations slumped to $4.5 billion last year from about $14 billion in 2008, according to the London-based analytics company Coalition. </p> <p>Barclays said last week that it''s exiting most commodities markets apart from precious metals, oil and gas derivatives and index products. Barclays cut jobs in January in fixed income, currencies and commodities and shut power-trading desks in the U.S. and Europe in February. </p> <p>Deutsche Bank AG, Germany''s largest bank, said in December it would get out of dedicated energy, agriculture, dry-bulk and industrial-metals trading, cutting about 200 jobs. Bank of America Corp. said in January it would dispose of its European power and gas inventory as increasing regulation curbs trading. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley agreed to sell its oil-merchant business to OAO Rosneft (ROSN), Russia''s state-run producer, in December. The sale hasn''t been submitted for regulatory approval and the companies will probably wait until tensions cool after the U.S. sanctioned Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, a person with knowledge of the situation said on April 29. </p> <p>', 'Mercuria Said to Offer Jobs to JPMorgan Traders', 'By Andy Hoffman and Rachel Morison', 'May 02, 2014  9:23 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-02/mercuria-said-to-offer-jobs-to-jpmorgan-traders.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron''s
government signaled it won''t stand in the way of Pfizer Inc.''s
takeover bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), rebuffing cross-party calls to
intervene to safeguard jobs and the country''s science base. </p>
<p>Cameron, who received a letter from Pfizer and spoke with
AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson today, ''is clear that the
U.K. government regards the potential takeover bid as a matter
for the respective boards and shareholders of the two
companies,'' the prime minister''s office said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>The government ''is determined'' to secure jobs in life
sciences and the letter ''''is a positive sign with significant
undertakings on research, jobs and investment,'''' Cameron''s
office said. The government will now weigh the proposals to see
''''whether they offer sufficient protection of our priorities,''''
it said. </p>
<p>The comments suggest that Pfizer Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read has given the government enough confidence to face down
mounting political opposition to the deal among members of
Cameron''s Conservative Party and opposition Labour lawmakers.
AstraZeneca rejected New York-based Pfizer''s increased offer as
inadequate today. </p>
<h2>''Getting Home'' </h2>
<p>''''We''ve had very tough-minded conversations with Pfizer,''
Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said in a
telephone interview. ''We''ve emphasized the importance of RD,
the importance of manufacturing, the importance of having high-level management in the U.K. if this deal goes ahead. I think
those messages are getting home to Pfizer, but there''s a lot
more hard-headed negotiation to come.'' </p>
<p>In its letter to Cameron, Pfizer pledged to set up its
headquarters in the U.K., complete a planned AstraZeneca science
hub in Cambridge, eastern England, and protect jobs in Britain.
Pfizer also sweetened its bid for London-based AstraZeneca to
about 63.1 billion pounds ($106.6 billion), an offer the company
said failed to recognize the value of the promising experimental
medicines under development. </p>
<p>Chuka Umunna, Labour''s business spokesman, accused the
government of being ''in league'' with Pfizer and said that for
all the reassurances offered there is ''grave concern'' the deal
was driven by tax planning and would risk U.K. jobs and
''intellectual asset stripping.'' </p>
<h2>''The Beast'' </h2>
<p>''The head of the beast, the central management of the new
merged entity, will be in the U.S. They''re simply seeking to be
domiciled here for tax purposes,'' he told BBC Radio 4. ''Do we
really want of a jewel in the crown of British industry, our
second biggest pharmaceutical firm, to basically be seen as an
instrument of tax planning.'' </p>
<p>Officials at the Department for Business are examining how
binding any commitments from Pfizer would actually be, according
to a person familiar with internal discussions. </p>
<p>Business Secretary Vince Cable, a member of Cameron''s
Liberal Democratic junior coalition partner, told the BBC the
letter from Pfizer was ''encouraging, positive.'' </p>
<p>Critics of Pfizer''s bid for AstraZeneca cite Kraft Foods
Inc.''s takeover of Britain''s Cadbury Plc (CADBURY) in 2010. Cadbury agreed
to be sold to Kraft for 11.7 billion pounds, creating the
world''s largest confectionery company. </p>
<h2>Reputation Damaged </h2>
<p>Before the deal, Kraft, based in Northfield, Illinois, said
it would keep open a factory in Keynsham, southwest England.
After the takeover was completed, Kraft announced it had decided
to close the plant by 2011. A panel of lawmakers said Kraft
damaged its reputation with its handling of the takeover. </p>
<p>''That''s a real issue,'' Willetts said, when asked how
binding Pfizer commitments are. ''After the way in which Labour
mishandled Kraft''s takeover of Cadbury, we''re very much aware of
it.'' </p>
<p>Pfizer''s takeover bid has become a political football as
the parties highlight their differences less than a month before
local elections and elections to the European Parliament. Both
will be held on May 22. </p>
<p>Senior lawmakers from both the Conservatives and Labour
weighed in against the deal today. Michael Heseltine, an adviser
to Cameron on efforts to spur economic growth and a minister in
Margaret Thatcher''s administration, said the government should
have powers to intervene against such a bid. </p>
<p>''There are so many issues about the science base, about
the supply chains, about employment prospects that ought to be
explored and I don''t see any way in which this can be adequately
done unless the government has reserve powers,'' Heseltine told
the BBC. </p>
<p>David Sainsbury, a Labour Party lawmaker in the House of
Lords who was science minister under Tony Blair, called on
Cameron to block the deal, telling the Financial Times that any
promises from the company were ''frankly meaningless.'' </p>

<p>Two months after Partners Group
Holding AG bought a majority stake in a Mexican gas pipeline
operator, the $43 billion investment firm is capitalizing on
unprecedented demand for the nation''s corporate debt. </p>
<p>Fermaca Enterprises, owned by the Zug, Switzerland-based
firm that specializes in private equity, sold $550 million of
bonds overseas yesterday. The sale was the seventh first-time
offering since August, when President Enrique Pena Nieto
proposed changes to the state oil industry that were signed into
law four months later. In the same span, only one debut issuer
came from Brazil, the biggest developing-nation bond market. </p>
<p>Partners Group, founded by three former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. money managers in 1996, is seeking to profit from Mexico''s
energy industry after the government ended its 76-year-old oil
monopoly and from a boom in shale gas, according to the firm''s
managing director, Jean Perarnaud. Fermaca, purchased from New
York-based hedge fund Ospraie Management LLC for $750 million in
February, has a 25-year transportation agreement with state-owned utility Comision Federal de Electricidad. </p>
<p>''The momentum is there for Mexico, fundamentally and
sentiment-wise,'' Perarnaud said by phone. ''The timing is
right.'' </p>
<h2>Refinance Debt </h2>
<p>Fermaca, based in Mexico City, sold the bonds due 2038 to
yield 6.375 percent. The senior secured amortizing notes, which
will have an average maturity of 15 years, are backed by Fermaca
assets including pipelines. Fitch Ratings and Standard  Poor''s
rate the bonds BBB-, the lowest investment grade. </p>
<p>Mexico''s peso weakened 0.1 percent to 13.0537 per U.S.
dollar at 7:02 a.m. in New York, paring its advance this week to
0.6 percent. </p>
<p>Partners Group, started by Alfred Gantner, Marcel Erni and
Urs Wietlisbach, will use proceeds of the sale to refinance both
the debt that it took on to buy Fermaca and a loan the company
used to finance construction of a pipeline, according to
Perarnaud. It bought the 86 percent stake in Fermaca from
Ospraie Management in February. </p>
<p>The agreement with CFE will last throughout the life of the
bonds, giving investors comfort that they will get paid, said
Ray Zucaro, who manages $390 million at SW Asset Management LLC. </p>
<p>''That kind of long-term contract with government agencies
beyond the life of the bond where effectively you neutralize
that counterparty risk -- those are the kind of bonds that will
let you sleep at night,'' he said in a telephone interview from
Newport Beach, California. </p>
<h2>CFE Plan </h2>
<p>CFE, as the company is known, plans to take advantage of
legal changes to the energy industry to sell natural gas, Chief
Executive Officer Enrique Ochoa said March 20. After allowing
foreign investors to drill for oil for the first time since
1938, Mexico is looking to increase natural-gas supply, reduce
its dependence on U.S. imports and lower the cost of electricity
generation. </p>
<p>That push will increase demand for Fermaca''s gas pipelines,
said Partners Group''s Perarnaud. The company is also bidding on
multiple pipeline contracts being auctioned by CFE, he said. </p>
<p>''We found Fermaca was the perfect asset,'' Perarnaud said.
''It would be an upside if the oil and gas exploration happen in
Mexico because our pipelines are actually located in one of the
prospective areas for shale gas in Mexico. When you combine
everything together, you end up with a good story.'' </p>
<p>While Fermaca is taking advantage of the investor demand
for Mexican assets after the country passed constitutional
changes in December, the company is not dependent on those
measures to prosper in Mexico, he said. </p>
<h2>Secondary Laws </h2>
<p>After pushing through sweeping changes in his first year in
office that earned Mexico its highest-ever credit rating, Pena
Nieto has struggled to overcome opposition to pass the secondary
laws needed to implement the new oil legislation, damping demand
for Mexican assets. He submitted his proposals on April 30, the
last day of the congressional session. Lawmakers plan to vote on
the bills during special sessions in June after Congress missed
a mid-April deadline to pass the rules. </p>
<p>The delays helped spark a 0.14 percent loss in Mexican
government debt in April, trailing the emerging-market average
for the first time since January, according to Bank of America
Corp. indexes. </p>
<h2>''Right Place'' </h2>
<p>Fermaca is also the first debut issuer from Mexico since
Oceanografia SA de CV defaulted on $495 million in February,
when the government seized the oil services provider following
allegations it took out a $400 million loan from Citigroup Inc.
under fraudulent circumstances. Citigroup determined that
Oceanografia, which provides oil services to state-run producer
Petroleos Mexicanos, overstated the collateral from its billings
to the company that were used to back the loans. </p>
<p>Unlike Oceanografia''s agreement with Pemex, Fermaca''s
contract with CFE doesn''t involve a third party and is
transparent, Perarnaud said. </p>
<p>Fermaca''s ''in the right place at the right time,''Rafael Elias, a New York-based analyst at Credit Agricole SA, said in
an April 22 note to clients. ''These bonds should do well.'' </p>

<p>Since Ian Read became Pfizer Inc.''s
leader, he''s shed two non-drug businesses, reorganized the
company into three separate units and pursued the largest merger
in the history of the pharmaceutical industry. </p>
<p>Now, even with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) in his sights as a takeover
target, Read said he could theoretically see a time in the
future when Pfizer splits into two parts to boost investor
value, potentially making a proposed mega-company short lived. </p>
<p>''We''re not talking about a three or four-way split, we''re
talking about two major segments,'' said Read, 60, a native of
Scotland who started his career at Pfizer as an accountant and
became chief executive officer in 2010, </p>
<p>Pfizer never really thought of itself as three businesses,
Read said on a conference call with investors and analysts
today. It''s a shift from last year, when the company began
dividing the company into three units, each with its own leader.
Read emphasized he''s made no decision about a breakup. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 2.6 percent to $29.96 at the close in
New York. The stock had gained 3.5 percent in the last 12
months, the worst performance of any major brand drugmaker on
the Standard  Poor''s 500 Pharmaceutical Index of 13 companies. </p>
<p>Pfizer last week offered about $106 billion to buy
AstraZeneca Plc, a bid that was promptly dismissed by the
London-based company. Along with the lower tax rate linked to
AstraZeneca''s U.K. base, Read has said the acquisition would
give New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of
experimental cancer drugs that use the body''s own immune system
to attack the disease. </p>
<h2>Seeking Efficiency </h2>
<p>Being bigger would also help Pfizer be more efficient,
strengthen it in key drug development areas, and give the
company more leverage against the governments and insurers
buying its products, he said during the call. </p>
<p>''Immune-oncology is exciting, it''s something to hang your
hat on. But the tax stuff and the synergies are really where
this lies,'' said Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones 
Co.  based in Des Peres, Missouri. </p>
<p>The deal to buy AstraZeneca is being looked at closely by
the U.K. government, over concerns it could reduce British
pharmaceutical industry jobs. </p>
<p>So far, it hasn''t attracted nearly the same level of
scrutiny in the U.S., where Read has said Pfizer will largely
keep its operating headquarters even as it moves its legal
residence to the U.K. for the lower tax rate. ''We clearly will
stay with a massive presence in the U.S. with a combined
company,'' he said. </p>
<p>Read declined to say when or if Pfizer might take its case
directly to AstraZeneca shareholders in a hostile takeover
attempt, though he hinted they might. </p>
<h2>''Considering Options'' </h2>
<p>''We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to
engage in conversations and believe it is in the best interests
of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer shareholders that
we pursue a friendly negotiated transaction,'' Read said. ''We
are considering our options on how we progress these
discussions.'' </p>
<p>Two units inside Pfizer makes more sense than three, with
half the company focused on brand-name drugs while the other
part focuses on older products, Clark said. </p>
<p>''It calls in the question why restructure into three unit
instead of two in the first place,'' Clark said by telephone.

short of analyst expectations. </p>
<h2>Estimates Beat </h2>
<p>Earnings excluding one-time items were 57 cents a share, 2
cents above the average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue fell 9 percent to $11.4 billion as foreign exchange
rates reduced sales by 3 percent, the company said in a
statement today. Analysts expected $12.1 billion. </p>
<p>''Overall, a weak quarter with disappointing revenues,''
said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., who called it a ''low-quality'' beat of earnings estimates. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income fell 15 percent to $2.33 billion,
or 36 cents, from $2.75 billion, or 38 cents, the company said.
Pfizer said it would change its full-year earnings outlook,
though wasn''t permitted to do so now because of rules
surrounding its offer to buy the U.K. drugmaker. </p>
<p>Pfizer for the first time broke out separate financial
results for the three units. Total first-quarter drug sales fell
9 percent to $10.5 billion from a year earlier. Sales of
Prevnar, Pfizer''s pneumonia vaccine, were little changed at $927
million. Viagra, a pill for erectile dysfunction, had sales that
dropped 19 percent to $374 million. </p>
<p>The quarter''s results were helped by a 11 percent reduction
in cost of sales, which fell to $2.05 billion. Administrative
expenses declined 6 percent to $3.04 billion, and research-and-development spending decreased 5 percent to $1.62 billion. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, sees no signs of a bubble in emerging-market
corporate debt, challenging the International Monetary Fund''s
warning on rising risks in the bond market. </p>
<p>Bonds sold by developing-country companies account for just
3 percent of gross domestic product in these economies, compared
with 35 percent in the U.S., according to Joyce Chang, global
head of research at the New York-based bank. Most of the lenders
selling debt are rated investment grade or backed by their
governments while maturities have been extended, she said in a
May 2 interview. </p>
<p>The IMF warned last month that some emerging-market
companies are vulnerable to capital flight if global borrowing
costs rise further as the Federal Reserve gradually withdraws
its expansionary monetary polices. Corporate debt for developing
countries tracked by Bank of America Corp. surged to $1.1
trillion from $411 billion at the end of 2009 as companies took
advantage of low interest rates to raise cash. </p>
<p>''I would really''challenge some of the views from''official
creditors that emerging-market corporate debt is''the next asset
bubble,'' Chang, who was promoted from head of fixed-income
research last month amid a leadership reshuffle in the global
banking division, said in New York. ''The''credit''quality of
emerging-market''issuance''has been pretty''good.'' </p>
<p>Olga Stankova, a spokeswoman for the IMF, didn''t respond to
a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Crisis Catalyst </h2>
<p>Growth of emerging-market bonds is mostly driven by supply-demand imbalances rather than speculation, Chang said. </p>
<p>The rise of developing-country debt has happened after the
supply of fixed-income products from mature markets shrank
following the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Chang. </p>
<p>At the same time, banks, pension funds and insurance
companies are required to hold more bonds in their investment
portfolio as part of tighter financial regulation, boosting the
demand for emerging-market securities, she said. </p>
<p>''You have a structural shift in the market with a supply
and demand imbalance and emerging markets''have benefited from
the lack of alternative investment opportunities,'' Chang said.
''The''increase in issuance is obviously something to flag, but
then you have to look at whether''the issuance is''short-term debt
for refinancing.''EM issuance is the longest duration within
fixed income and EM is not facing a wall of maturities.'' </p>
<p>The IMF said on April 9 in a report that corporate bonds of
developing nations are vulnerable in an environment of rising
global interest rates and slower growth prospects. About $740
billion, or 35 percent of emerging-market outstanding debt, may
be at risk of default in a scenario involving a 25 percent
increase in borrowing costs and a 25 percent drop in corporate
earnings, according to the Washington-based fund. </p>

<p>Even after the longest run of gains in
16 months for Poland''s zloty bonds, BNP Paribas SA and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. say there''s still reason to be bullish. </p>
<p>Government debt returned 1 percent in April and 3.6 percent
during the past three months, the longest stretch since December
2012, the Bloomberg Poland Local Sovereign Index shows. Yields
on five-year notes reached 3.53 percent, 58 basis points less
than this year''s high and 302 basis points over similar German
securities, compared with 272 on Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Policy maker Adam Glapinski told PAP newswire April 28 that
the National Bank of Poland may be free to keep its benchmark
rate at a record-low 2.50 percent until the middle of 2015 amid
consumer-price growth 2.1 percentage points below its five-year
average. BNP Paribas advises buying five-year zloty notes given
''persistently low inflation'' and prospects of quantitative
easing by the European Central Bank, emerging-market strategists
Piotr Chwiejczak and Dina Ahmad wrote in an April 29 report. </p>
<p>''Poland is one foot in the euro area and will offer a
positive real interest rate of about 2 percent in the next two
years, while Europe will show negative real rates,'' Chwiejczak
said by phone from London on May 2. </p>
<p>The central bank pledged in March to keep rates on hold at
least until the end of the third quarter as growth in the
European Union''s largest eastern economy accelerates without
stoking price growth. Inflation stayed unchanged at 0.7 percent
in March, leaving the real interest rate at 1.8 percent. </p>
<h2>ECB Outlook </h2>
<p>The ECB will probably keep its benchmark rate at an all-time low of 0.25 percent at the next meeting on May 8, according
to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Policy makers will take some sort of action within two months
against the threat of low prices, which rose a less-than-forecast 0.7 percent in April, another survey showed last month. </p>
<p>Given the outlook for price growth across Europe, analysts
will probably push back forecasts for Polish rate increases,
creating scope for further bond gains, Andrew Matheny, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note on April 22. </p>
<p>Poland is seen raising rates by 50 basis points to 3
percent in the first three months of next year and to 3.25
percent by the end of the first half, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>''More Dovish'' </h2>
<p>''Our views are significantly more dovish than market
pricing in Poland on a 12-18 month horizon,'' which translates
into a ''constructive outlook'' on Polish bonds, Matheny wrote
in the report. He predicted a 25 basis-point increase by the end
of June 2015. The view was still valid on May 2, the bank''s
Frankfurt-based spokeswoman Katharina Jung said by e-mail. </p>
<p>Traders have scaled back bets for higher rates in Poland,
now predicting less than a quarter-point increase over the next
year, according to forward-rate agreements on May 2. That
compares with expectations for a full 25 basis-point jump in the
12 months from April 23 and more than a half-point increase in
the year from Jan. 31, the data show. </p>
<p>The zloty slipped less than 0.1 percent to 4.2077 against
the euro at 12:49 p.m. in Warsaw, taking its 2014 drop to 1.3
percent. The additional yield on Poland''s dollar bonds over
Treasuries was unchanged at 119 basis points, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. indexes show. That compares with this year''s low of 103
basis points on April 17. </p>
<p>Poland may decide to start raising rates in the fourth
quarter as the economy accelerates, Andrzej Rzonca, a member of
the central bank''s Monetary Policy Council, said in an interview
for newspaper Parkiet on May 2. </p>
<p>''The sooner we raise rates, the more gradual the increases
will be and their total scale will be more limited,'' he said. </p>
<h2>Zloty Weakens </h2>
<p>Inflation will probably accelerate to 1.3 percent this year
from 0.9 percent in 2013, as the economy expands 3.2 percent,
double last year''s pace, according Bloomberg surveys of
economists. The central bank is targeting price growth of 2.5
percent. </p>
<p>An escalating crisis may damp economic expansion, shaving
off about 0.6 percentage point from growth in the worst-case
scenario, according to BNP''s Chwiejczak. </p>
<p>Violence increased in Ukraine''s easternmost regions as the
government pursued its offensive to dislodge rebels and the
conflict spread to the south. The easternmost area is
''essentially at war,'' the head of the country''s anti-terrorist
agency said May 3. </p>
<p>''The geopolitical situation works toward lower inflation
in Poland,'' further supporting zloty bonds, Chwiejczak said. </p>

starting in 2017, the London-based company said today in a
statement. Its pipeline of drugs, led by lung and ovarian cancer
treatments, could generate as much as $63 billion in peak-year
sales, the company said. Revenue last year totaled $25.7
billion. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca last week rejected a takeover bid by Pfizer of
62.6 billion pounds ($106 billion) in a mix of cash and stock
that valued the company at about 50 pounds a share. The offer
failed to appreciate the promising medicines the company is
developing, AstraZeneca said, and threatened to disrupt its
progress. The pipeline is the product of a strategy announced
last year to turn the company around, Pascal Soriot, who took
over as chief executive officer in 2012, said in the statement. </p>
<h2>Opposing ''Distraction'' </h2>
<p>''Any distraction can suddenly have a negative impact,''
Soriot told analysts and investors on a conference call. ''We
are in a race with many of our competitors to get products into
the marketplace. Any distraction that causes us to slow down, or
any distraction that causes us to lose talent, can destroy
value.'' </p>
<p>Andrew Widger, a spokesman in the U.K. for New York-based
Pfizer, declined to comment on AstraZeneca''s presentation today. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca''s expectations are ''ambitious, to say the
least,'' and rely on the ultimate approval of products that are
high-risk, have unclear market potential or are in areas where
the U.K. drugmaker lags behind competitors, according to
Barclays Plc analysts, including Mark Purcell. </p>
<p>''We are deeply skeptical of Astra achieving such a level
of revenues,'' Purcell and his colleagues wrote in a report to
investors. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca fell 2.7 percent to 4,677 pence at the close in
London. Pfizer declined 1.3 percent to $29.58 as of 12:34 p.m.
in New York. </p>
<h2>Product Prospects </h2>
<p>Only 30 percent of the projected $45 billion in revenue in
2023 stems from drugs in the pipeline, Soriot said. There is a
low chance of success for any one drug, he said. In aggregate,
products in the pipeline have a 36 percent chance of success and
the company isn''t relying on any of them, he said. </p>
<p>''I can''t tell you what products will make it,'' the CEO
said. ''But I can tell you none of the products is more than 10
percent of the pipeline.'' </p>
<p>Lawmakers from across Britain''s political parties have
raised questions about implications of Pfizer''s potential
takeover of AstraZeneca on jobs and pharmaceutical investments.
Executives from the two drugmakers will also be asked to testify
about the proposed acquisition, the House of Commons lawmakers
Business Committee said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The Unite and GMB labor unions asked for a meeting with
U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable to urge him to impose a
''national interest'' test on the deal. They accused Prime
Minister David Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, both Tories, of being supportive of the Pfizer bid
while AstraZeneca workers haven''t been consulted. </p>
<h2>Intervention ''Constraints'' </h2>
<p>Cable, who said he would be happy to meet with the unions,
said the government is ''working hard within the constraints we
have'' to secure a positive outcome for British jobs and
science. European Union rules restrict the amount that states
can intervene in business transactions, and British law only
allows intervention on issues of national security, media
plurality and banking, he said. </p>
<p>''The government must and will approach this from a
position of even-handed neutrality,'' Cable said in Parliament.
''I''m not ruling out intervention. We have to look at all the
options open to us.'' </p>
<p>AstraZeneca reiterated that 2017 revenue will be in line
with its 2013 sales. Analysts estimate its revenue falling to
$24.3 billion in 2016. </p>
<p>Growth will be driven by AstraZeneca''s strength in diabetes
and respiratory disease treatments, which may each bring in
about $8 billion in sales in 2023, as well as Brilinta, a heart
medicine that may garner about $3.5 billion. it said. Whether
Brilinta meets that goal depends on winning approval of the drug
for different uses, Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients. </p>
<p>The company is also counting on increasing sales in
emerging markets, including China, and Japan. </p>
<h2>Cancer Therapies </h2>
<p>AstraZeneca said its investment in science is paying off,
particularly in a line of cancer therapies that stimulate the
body''s immune system to fight off the disease, and its drugs are
worth more than analysts predict. For example, AZD9291, a lung
cancer medicine, could be worth $3 billion a year, compared with
estimates of as much as $2 billion. </p>
<p>''Immuno-oncology is the therapeutic area that is getting
the most investor attention now, but AZN will be a late entrant
into the category and it is unclear how the company will compete
effectively if there is no differentiation with its molecule,''
Anderson wrote. ''It does have other immuno-oncology products
also in development.'' </p>
<p>An experimental Alzheimer''s treatment could be worth $5
billion, compared with estimates of as much as $3 billion. That
drug has about a 9 percent chance of success. Merck  Co. (MRK), based
in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, has a similar medicine in a
more advanced stage of development, Anderson said. </p>

<p>U.K. lawmakers decided to call
executives from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to testify on the proposed takeover
of AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), as London Mayor Boris Johnson added his
voice to those urging caution on the deal. </p>
<p>Representatives of London-based AstraZeneca will also be
asked to appear before the House of Commons Business Committee,
the panel said in an e-mailed statement after meeting in London
today. Business SecretaryVince Cable, answering lawmakers''
concerns in the House of Commons today, said the government is
approaching the Pfizer bid from a position of neutrality. </p>
<p>Lawmakers from across Britain''s political parties have
raised questions about the offer of more than $100 billion and
are pressing for assurances that New York-based Pfizer honors
its pledge, made in a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron
last week, that it will protect jobs and investment in
pharmaceutical research and development in the U.K. </p>
<p>''It would be very important to establish that Pfizer is
genuinely committed to RD in this country,'' Johnson, a member
of Cameron''s Conservative Party, told LBC Radio today. ''I
believe in principle that we should have an open system of
markets in this country, but when I look at something like
AstraZeneca and I look at an organization of that scale, of its
relative importance to the U.K. economy, the sheer percentage of
its money that goes into RD, I think it is of great importance
to Britain.'' </p>
<h2>Union Demand </h2>
<p>Labor unions Unite and the GMB asked for a meeting with
Cable, a member of Cameron''s Liberal Democrat coalition
partners, to urge him to impose a ''national interest'' test on
the deal. They accused Cameron and Tory Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne of being supportive of the Pfizer bid
while AstraZeneca workers have not been consulted. </p>
<p>''AstraZeneca is a key player in the U.K.''s advanced
manufacturing sector and as such is strategically important to
the U.K., yet David Cameron and George Osborne seem comfortable
waving the deal through, leaving any manufacturing strategy in
tatters,'' Unite Assistant General Secretary Tony Burke said in
an e-mailed statement. ''The workforce and the unions have acted
in a responsible manner and shown remarkable patience, but that
is now wearing thin.'' </p>
<p>Cable, who said he would be happy to meet with the unions,
insisted the government is ''working hard within the constraints
we have'' to secure a positive outcome for British jobs and
science. He said European Union rules restrict the amount that

<h2>''Even-Handed Neutrality'' </h2>
<p>''The government must and will approach this from a

''I''m not ruling out intervention, we have to look at all the

<p>Cameron''s spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, defended the
prime minister''s involvement and repeated the government''s view
that the final decision should rest with the companies''
shareholders. </p>
<p>''The government''s position is one of active engagement
with both companies in terms of assessing the link to jobs and
skills,'' Gray told reporters in London today. ''The sole basis
on which the government is engaging is with regard to
underlining the importance we attach to continuing to expand the
life-science sector in the U.K.'' </p>
<h2>AstraZeneca Defense </h2>
<p>AstraZeneca, which last week rejected Pfizer''s 62.6
billion-pound ($106 billion) bid, said today that its plan for
growth is working and it is aiming for annual revenues of more
than $45 billion by 2023. The company highlighted drugs it has
developed, including Brilinta and Farxiga, which it said will be
the drivers of growth. </p>
<p>''The increasingly visible success of our independent
strategy highlights the future prospects for our shareholders,''
Chairman Leif Johansson said in a statement. ''These are
benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca''s
shareholders.'' </p>
<p>Cable praised AstraZeneca''s plans and the company''s
investment in research and development of new drugs. </p>
<p>''AstraZeneca do have an ambitious and attractive long-term
investment plan which we encouraged as part of the industrial
strategy,'' he said. ''We want to see it fulfilled.'' </p>

House of Commons Science and Technology Committee about the
government''s involvement in the deal. </p>

was indicted in July by federal regulators for insider trading,
and continued to do business with the firm after it agreed to

<p>Lloyd Blankfein is sticking by Steven Cohen through thick and thin. While other banks have drifted
away from the personal credit lines they''ve given Cohen since,
well, you know, Goldman Sachs appears never to have wavered. </p>

<p>''Frozen'' continues to sizzle for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS), where quarterly profit rose 27 percent as kids
snapped up DVDs and merchandise tied to the animated mega-hit. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, reported
second-quarter net income of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share,
beating the average of analysts'' estimates. Sales grew to $11.6
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement, exceeding
projections of $11.2 billion. </p>
<p>''Frozen'' is working magic for Disney in home video, after
scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney''s other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. </p>
<p>''The whole thing is doing well,'' said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital
Management LLC in Austin, Texas, which holds more than 45,000
Disney shares. ''You talk about hitting on every cylinder.'' </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.9 percent to $80.29 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company generated profit growth of 15 percent or more
from its four largest divisions, including the film studio,
where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding
the 96-cent average of analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Earnings at the Disney studios soared to $475 million,
reflecting home-video sales of ''Frozen'' and ''Thor: The Dark
World,'' according to the company. Revenue grew 35 percent to
$1.8 billion, Disney said. </p>
<h2>''Frozen'' Assets </h2>
<p>''Frozen'' came out in home video during the period and has
become the company''s biggest digital and Blu-ray release ever,
Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said
yesterday on a conference call. The company is working on
related theme-park attractions and a Broadway show, with Iger
predicting revenue could last for five years. </p>
<p>''Given the passion for this film and these characters is
so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined, it
would be hard to believe that it wouldn''t sustain itself over a

to $1.97 billion, reflecting growth in pay-TV subscriber fees
for channels such as ESPN. Revenue increased 5 percent to $3.63
billion, even as ad sales shrank at the sports channel. </p>
<h2>Broadcast Division </h2>
<p>Profit at the ABC broadcast unit increased 15 percent to
$159 million, buoyed by higher affiliate fees and cost-cutting,
the company said. Revenue was little changed at $1.5 billion,
reflecting smaller audiences watching the broadcast network </p>
<p>Disney''s namesake theme parks increased profit 19 percent
to $457 million as the division weathered a later Easter
holiday, which pulled business from the January-March quarter
into the current period. </p>

<p>Concern that regulatory scrutiny will
curb the market for collateralized loan obligations may have
been overblown. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for new CLOs in the U.S.
this year to as much as $85 billion, at least the third bank
since April to boost projections for the biggest buyers of junk
loans. JPMorgan Chase  Co. boosted its projection to as much as
$100 billion on May 2, while Wells Fargo  (WFC) Co. lifted it to as
high as $90 billion last month. </p>
<p>CLO issuance is accelerating after concern regulatory
attention would damp new formation of the funds, which provide
financing to speculative-grade companies. The Volcker Rule,
adopted in December as part of the financial overhaul mandated
by the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banks from investing in a CLO
that owns bonds. </p>
<p>''The new issue market has shrugged off this year''s slow
start, as well as the potential regulatory headwinds from the
Volcker rule,'' Morgan Stanley analysts Vishwanath Tirupattur
and Mia Qian wrote in a research note today. </p>
<p>A total $12.3 billion of broadly syndicated U.S. CLOs were
formed last month, the highest monthly volume since the
financial crisis, bringing total issuance this year through
April to $31.7 billion as the investor base expanded, according
to the report. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo raised its forecast to what would potentially
be the most in seven years, according to an April 1 research
note. JPMorgan increased its projections to $90 billion to $100
billion from $60 billion to $70 billion, according to a May 2
research note. </p>
<h2>Resurging Issuance  </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) revised its forecast to $75 billion to $85
billion of CLOs, from previous projections for $55 billion to
$65 billion, according to the research note. </p>
<p>Issuance of CLOs collapsed to $20.6 billion in 2008, the
year Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed, from a record $104.7
billion in 2007, according to Wells Fargo. Last year''s issuance
totaled $82.6 billion. </p>
<p>CLOs were the biggest buyers of new high-yield loans last
quarter, with about 55 percent of the primary market, according
to Standard  Poor''s Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary  Data. </p>
<p>Companies have raised $223 billion of U.S. loans this year
from institutional investors such as CLOs and mutual funds,
after a record $686 billion in 2013, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Junk loans are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors

<p>British and French politicians have
traditionally had diametrically opposed attitudes to takeovers
of their corporate crown jewels by foreigners. In Pfizer Inc.''s (PFE)
bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the difference is a lot smaller. </p>
<p>The offer worth more than $106 billion, the largest ever
for a U.K. company, prompted demands for guarantees on jobs,
facilities, and retaining research work from Prime Minister
David Cameron''s Conservative-led coalition. Opposition Labour
Party leader Ed Miliband called for a ''public-interest test''
on major deals by foreign acquirers and Liberal Democrat
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he might support one. </p>
<p>With U.K. national elections a year away today, British
leaders are sounding more like their counterparts in France,
where lawmakers can intervene to stop companies deemed
''strategic'' from being bought, and the state rarely hesitates
to get involved. President Francois Hollande said yesterday that
General Electric Co.''s proposed $17 billion acquisition of most
of Alstom SA (ALO) was ''not acceptable'' in its current form because
of its impact on employment. Cameron said today he''s ''not
satisfied'' with the Pfizer offer so far. </p>
<h2>''Clear Message'' </h2>
<p>''The U.K. government is reacting more strongly now to
Pfizer''s intention to take over AstraZeneca because they need to
start sending a clear message to citizens that they are
concerned about them as the next general election gets closer,''
said Daniel Lacalle, a senior fund manager at Ecofin Ltd. in
London. </p>
<p>U.K. politicians'' attitudes reflect the anxieties of a
country that''s seen high-profile companies from carmakers to
confectioners absorbed by foreign buyers. </p>
<p>Unlike in the U.S., Canada, France and Australia, British
officials have no direct legal mechanism to halt foreign
acquisitions -- an absence illustrated by Kraft Foods Inc.''s
successful takeover of chocolate-maker Cadbury Plc in 2010 over
the objections of lawmakers, with the subsequent closing of a
factory in southwest England. </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne was probably too
enthusiastic in quickly hailing the Pfizer bid, which would see
the American company move its legal domicile to the U.K., as
positive for the country and an endorsement of its corporate-tax
regime, according to two government officials with knowledge of
the discussions. </p>
<h2>''Legal Constraints'' </h2>
<p>Cameron''s government is now trying to show it is neutral by
stressing that it''s talking to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca, the
people said on condition of anonymity because the talks are
private. Cable told lawmakers yesterday the government is
''operating within serious European legal constraints.'' </p>
<p>Today, the prime minister told Parliament at his weekly
question-and-answer session that evaluating the bid would
include examining its impact on jobs and science in the U.K. </p>
<p>''The commitments that have been made so far are
encouraging,'' Cameron said. ''I''m not satisfied. I want more.'' </p>
<p>The chief executive officers of both companies will testify
before the House of Commons Business and Science Committees over
two days next week, the panels said today. </p>
<p>Cameron, Cable and Osborne have Paris to look to for a
recent example of navigating an unexpected offer from an
American company. After Bloomberg News reported GE''s Alstom bid
on April 23, French officials led by Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg began a last-ditch effort to encourage a counterbid
from Siemens AG. Even after securing guarantees on jobs and
keeping French sites from GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Montebourg and
Hollande said this week the American company''s offer still isn''t
sufficient. </p>
<h2>Outside Buyers </h2>
<p>The U.K.''s generally hands-off approach to deal making has
helped make it more attractive than its neighbors to foreign
acquirers. Buyers from outside Europe have spent about $358
billion on deals in the U.K. over the last five years, not
including AstraZeneca, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with just $86 billion in France and $114 billion in
Germany. </p>
<p>A takeover of AstraZeneca would be the biggest-ever
acquisition of a U.K. company by value -- about five times
bigger than the largest transaction of the past half-decade,
Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA)''s $22 billion deal for U.K. broadband
provider Virgin Media last year. </p>
<p>A deal would also mean ceding control of a large part of
the country''s pharmaceutical infrastructure. The London-based
company has about 7,000 domestic staff, a major RD facility in
Cambridge, eastern England, and a 2,900-employee global hub for
cancer research outside Manchester in the north. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, is very unlikely to proceed with
a bid for AstraZeneca if it can''t win the blessing of Cameron''s
government, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<h2>More Difficult </h2>
<p>Even in the absence of a direct mechanism to block the
deal, the U.K. could make doing business much more difficult for
Pfizer if it chose to, especially in an industry as heavily
regulated as pharmaceuticals, the person said, asking not to be
identified discussing private deliberations. </p>
<p>According to one Cameron aide, there are many more
political risks for the government if the takeover goes ahead
than if it collapses. As with previous deals in which the
government has been involved, such as Lloyds TSB Group Plc''s
2008 rescue of HBOS Plc, ministers risk being criticized if job
losses follow or the deal is seen as a failure. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Cameron in a May 2
phone call that even by engaging with Pfizer, the government
risked being seen as supporting the takeover, according to a
person familiar with the call. </p>
<h2>Mayor''s Concern </h2>
<p>Along with Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson, a possible
candidate to succeed Cameron as Tory leader, has said he''s
concerned about AstraZeneca being in foreign hands. </p>
<p>After meetings with U.K. officials, Pfizer has pledged to
keep about 20 percent of the combined group''s research staff in
the U.K. for five years. That promise comes with a caveat,
though: that Pfizer may have to ''adjust these obligations
should circumstances significantly change,'' the company said. </p>
<p>Both Cable and Miliband have said they''re worried about
Pfizer''s commitment to those promises. </p>
<p>Britain''s government is almost alone among major economies
in having never in recent years scuttled a major foreign
takeover. German Chancellor Angela Merkel''s government torpedoed
the proposed merger of BAE Systems Plc (BA/) and what''s now Airbus
Group NV (AIR) in 2012, citing concerns over the loss of German
control and jobs. </p>
<p>In recent years Canada has blocked deals by BHP Billiton (BHP)
Ltd. and Petroliam Nasional Bhd., although the latter was
eventually approved. Australia intervened last year to stop the
$2.9 billion acquisition of GrainCorp Ltd. by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. </p>
<h2>Special Case </h2>
<p>While British politicians are clearly concerned about the
Pfizer deal, its size and relevance to high-tech research make
it a special case, said Stephen Blackshaw, a partner in London
at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. For that reason the country isn''t
likely to ''go down the road to a more formalized test'' for
foreign deals, as in Canada and Australia, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s case isn''t being helped by concerns it''s moved to
shut down research after past acquisitions, and by its decision
in 2011 to close a lab in Sandwich in southeast England that
cost about 2,000 jobs. Since it bought rival Wyeth in 2009, it''s
cut $4.6 billion in research spending and narrowed its
scientific focus to six areas of medicine. Pfizer''s plan to be
domiciled in the U.K. for tax purposes would also give it a
lower tax rate. </p>
<p>''I''m sure these companies are motivated by hard-headed
commercial considerations, and we should be motivated by hard-headed considerations of national interest,'' Cable told
lawmakers yesterday. ''We see the future of the U.K. as a
knowledge economy, not a tax haven.'' </p>

<p>David Cameron said Pfizer Inc.''s bid
for AstraZeneca Plc ''must do more'' for British jobs and
science as the prime minister was challenged to intervene in the
proposed takeover. </p>
<p>In a series of clashes in the House of Commons today,
opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband urged Cameron to
apply a public-interest test to the offer valued at more than
$106 billion, the largest ever for a U.K. company, saying if he
does not ''everyone will know he was acting as a cheerleader''
for the bid. </p>
<p>Cameron said commitments made by Pfizer, including
retaining at least 20 percent of the research and development
workforce in the U.K., guaranteeing the completion of a new
research campus at Cambridge, eastern England, and retaining a
manufacturing base in Macclesfield, northern England, are
''encouraging.'' </p>
<p>''Let me be absolutely clear, I''m not satisfied, I want
more,'' Cameron said. ''The more we can do to strengthen the
assurances the better.'' </p>
<p>The chief executive officers of both companies will testify
to lawmakers on the proposed takeover next week. Ian Read of
Pfizer and Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca will appear before the
Business, Innovation and Skills Committee on May 13 at 9:30 a.m.
and then before the Science and Technology Committee on May 14
at 9:15 a.m., according to statements from the panels. </p>
<p>Questioned by reporters after the exchanges in Parliament,
Cameron''s spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, refused to expand on
what assurances Cameron was seeking and any timetable for the
talks. Cameron has not spoken to Pfizer, Gray said, adding that
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Liberal Democrat
Business Secretary Vince Cable had done so. </p>
<h2>''Deep Concern'' </h2>
<p>Cable refused yesterday to rule out intervening in the bid.
Miliband said today ''there is deep concern'' about the deal as
it would ''have an impact for decades to come on British jobs,
British investment, British exports and British science.'' He
said his party would back using the public-interest test to slow
down or halt the deal if it runs counter to British interests
amid jobs concerns. </p>
<p>The government could amend the 2002 Enterprise Act within a
month without significant difficulty to include the effect the
takeover may have on the U.K.''s research and development base as
one of the grounds for blocking the deal, according to the
Labour Party. An independent body such as the Competition and
Markets Authority could examine the proposed takeover. </p>
<h2>Playing Politics </h2>
<p>Currently, U.K. rules only allow ministers to intervene to
protect national security, media plurality and the stability of
the financial system. </p>
<p>With U.K. national elections one year away today, British
leaders are sounding more like their counterparts in France,
where lawmakers can intervene to stop companies deemed
''strategic'' from being bought. President Francois Hollande
said yesterday that General Electric Co.''s proposed $17 billion
acquisition of most of Alstom SA was ''not sufficient, so it''s
not acceptable'' in its current form because of its impact on
employment. </p>
<p>Cameron accused Miliband today of playing politics over the
bid for AstraZeneca ''rather than backing the British national
interest.'' </p>

<p>''Frozen'' continues to sizzle for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS), where quarterly profit rose 27 percent as kids
snapped up DVDs and merchandise tied to the animated mega-hit. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, reported
second-quarter net income of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share,
beating the average of analysts'' estimates. Sales grew to $11.6
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement, exceeding
projections of $11.2 billion. </p>
<p>''Frozen'' is working magic for Disney in home video, after
scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney''s other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. </p>
<p>''The whole thing is doing well,'' said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital
Management LLC in Austin, Texas, which holds more than 45,000
Disney shares. ''You talk about hitting on every cylinder.'' </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.9 percent to $80.29 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company generated profit growth of 15 percent or more
from its four largest divisions, including the film studio,
where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding
the 96-cent average of analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Earnings at the Disney studios soared to $475 million,
reflecting home-video sales of ''Frozen'' and ''Thor: The Dark
World,'' according to the company. Revenue grew 35 percent to
$1.8 billion, Disney said. </p>
<h2>''Frozen'' Assets </h2>
<p>''Frozen'' came out in home video during the period and has
become the company''s biggest digital and Blu-ray release ever,
Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said
yesterday on a conference call. The company is working on
related theme-park attractions and a Broadway show, with Iger
predicting revenue could last for five years. </p>
<p>''Given the passion for this film and these characters is
so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined, it
would be hard to believe that it wouldn''t sustain itself over a
fairly long period of  time,'' he said. </p>
<p>With help from Marvel pictures and the resurgent Disney
animation unit, film studio profit for the year may top $1
billion for the first time since 2008, Alan Gould, an analyst at
Evercore Group LLC, wrote in an April 16 note. He has the
equivalent of a buy rating on Burbank, California-based Disney. </p>
<p>Operating income at Disney cable networks rose 15 percent
to $1.97 billion, reflecting growth in pay-TV subscriber fees
for channels such as ESPN. Revenue increased 5 percent to $3.63
billion, even as ad sales shrank at the sports channel. </p>
<h2>Broadcast Division </h2>
<p>Profit at the ABC broadcast unit increased 15 percent to
$159 million, buoyed by higher affiliate fees and cost-cutting,
the company said. Revenue was little changed at $1.5 billion,
reflecting smaller audiences watching the broadcast network </p>
<p>Disney''s namesake theme parks increased profit 19 percent
to $457 million as the division weathered a later Easter
holiday, which pulled business from the January-March quarter
into the current period. </p>
<p>The company credited higher attendance at California''s
Disneyland resort and increased guest spending at Walt Disney
World in Florida. Revenue grew 7.9 percent to $3.56 billion. </p>
<p>Profit from consumer products expanded 37 percent to $274
million, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Disney Stores </h2>
<p>''Nine out of the 10 highest-selling items at the Disney
store in the quarter were ''Frozen'' merchandise,'' Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call. </p>
<p>Licensing revenue grew on sales of merchandise related to
Disney channel program, along with products based on Mickey
Mouse and Minnie and the animated feature ''Planes.'' </p>
<p>Toys and costumes featuring the film''s Elsa character have
outsold perennial top-performers Cinderella and Snow White on
EBay Inc. in the past year, according to Terapeak, an online
commerce tracker. </p>
<p>The interactive division posted a profit of $14 million,
reversing a loss a year earlier, on the strength of sales of
Disney Infinity, the company''s video-game platform. Revenue grew
38 percent to $268 million. </p>

<p>If you''ve followed analyst Natalia Corfield during her stints at two of Wall Street''s biggest
banks, you know one call has been constant: her recommendation
to buy Banco BMG SA''s bonds. You also know that she''s been
right. </p>
<p>Corfield, now at JPMorgan Chase  Co., began recommending
the notes in July 2012 when she was at Deutsche Bank AG. In that
span, BMG''s $250 million of bonds due in 2020 have returned 46
percent -- more than four times the average gain for emerging-market corporate debt. </p>
<p>BMG''s decision to form a joint venture with Itau Unibanco
Holding SA, Latin America''s biggest bank, 22 months ago has
propelled its $1.1 billion of notes and prompted Corfield to
stick with her view. The bank, based in the Brazilian Corfield''s
home state of Minas Gerais before moving to Sao Paulo this year,
said April 29 it will boost its stake in the venture to 40
percent from 30 percent, adding to bond gains. The unit has
allowed BMG to obtain cheaper funding and stem losses after
Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA''s collapse dried up funding for midsize
banks. </p>
<p>''Everyone was afraid because of what happened to Cruzeiro,
but I knew BMG,'' Corfield, who reiterated a buy on the BMG
notes after the April 29 announcement, said by phone from New
York. ''It''s a very good story. The cost of funding surged after
Cruzeiro, and it decreased with the joint venture, and it will
likely drop more now.'' </p>
<h2>''Drastically'' Reduced </h2>
<p>Yields on BMG''s bonds soared to a record 18.51 percent in
June 2012 after Cruzeiro defaulted on $1.6 billion of notes and
was seized by Brazilian regulators. A month later, BMG announced
the joint venture with Itau, which agreed to provide as much as
300 million reais ($134.6 million) per month for five years to
finance BMG''s payroll loans. The 2020 securities now yield 7.94
percent. </p>
<p>The deal has ''drastically'' reduced BMG''s funding costs as
the market prices in improvements in the bank''s performance and
margins, according to investor relations manager Danilo
Herculano Andrade Silva. BMG''s increased stake in the venture
will be reflected in the bank''s fourth-quarter earnings, he
said. </p>
<p>The lender''s net income totaled 428.5 million reais last
year, reversing a loss of 580 million reais in 2012. Net
interest margin reached 9.3 percent in 2013, 5.1 percentage
points higher than the previous year. </p>
<p>''The joint venture is exceeding all our estimates,'' BMG''s
Silva said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. ''The
performance of the bonds shows that investors see the deal was a
success. I think we''ll still see an improvement in the market''s
perception of BMG.'' </p>
<h2>''Huge Success'' </h2>
<p>The bank has no plans to buy back bonds and is unlikely to
increase the stake in the venture further, Silva said. </p>
<p>Marcelo Kopel, Itau''s head of investor relations, said on a
conference call with reporters April 29 that he expects Banco
Itau BMG Consignado''s loan portfolio to reach 20 billion reais
by the end of this year from about 12 billion reais now. </p>
<p>An Itau official who asked not to be named in accordance
with company policy declined to comment further on the venture
or on BMG''s bond performance when contacted by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>''The partnership has been a huge success, with the obvious
benefit being the decreased cost of funding,'' Jim Harper, the
head of research at BCP Securities LLC in Greenwich,
Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. ''The BMG bonds will
react favorably to anything that represents a move towards
integration.'' </p>
<h2>Yield Gap </h2>
<p>Carlos Gribel, vice president for emerging markets at INTL
FCStone Securities, said that while BMG''s notes may continue to
climb as the partnership grows, they will still trade at a
premium to Itau''s bonds. </p>
<p>Itau''s $1 billion of subordinated debt due in 2020 yields
4.38 percent, or 3.56 percentage points less than BMG''s notes. </p>
<p>''BMG''s curve has climbed a lot, but the yield will not
reach Itau''s,'' Gribel said in a telephone interview from Miami.
''It will be somewhere between mid-sized banks and Itau, because
at the end of the day, Itau doesn''t guarantee the bonds. There''s
an extra risk, and there''s a premium for that.'' </p>
<p>BMG''s 2020 bonds have gained 5.8 cents to 104.5 cents on
the dollar, the highest since 2011, since the bank said it will
boost its stake in the joint venture, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. While the rally will continue, further gains will
be more ''gradual,'' Corfield said. </p>
<p>''This will free up capital and decrease their funding
costs even more,'' she said. ''Bondholders are seeing the
venture is working well.'' </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
shifted its real estate focus to lending from buying properties
after the financial crisis, completed fundraising for its second
real estate credit pool at $4.2 billion. </p>
<p>The New York-based firm raised $1.8 billion in equity
pledges from institutions and wealthy individuals, supplemented
by the same amount in borrowings and $600 million of the firm''s
own money, said Alan Kava, co-head of the real estate investing
group in Goldman''s merchant banking division. About 60 percent
of the capital pledged came from U.S. investors and most of the
rest was from Europe, with a small amount from Asian investors. </p>
<p>Goldman is competing with other private debt funds,
mortgage-oriented real estate investment trusts and banks in
offering ways to earn higher yields at a time of low interest
rates. The new vehicle will invest in Europe and the U.S.,
expanding on Goldman''s first real estate credit fund, which made
about $3.5 billion of loans, according to a marketing document. </p>
<p>''We will be opportunistic in terms of where we see
value,'' Kava said in a telephone interview. ''The first fund
was U.S. only. We''re hopeful we will end up with about 50-50''

<p>The new Broad Street Real Estate Credit Partners II plans
to make senior loans and mezzanine loans backed by high-quality
commercial real estate, to fund acquisitions, refinancings and
recapitalizations, according to the document. It intends to
generate returns in the ''mid-teens'' by charging interest rates
of 7 percent to 10 percent and leveraging the equity. </p>
<h2>Current Yield </h2>
<p>The new fund will make and hold the loans, distributing the
interest income it receives to investors quarterly, said Peter
Weidman, the managing director who oversees the new fund. </p>
<p>''What our investors like about this is it''s a current
yield so we''re not just making one-time distributions by
securitizing,'' Weidman said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The new fund has invested about $500 million already, in
five deals, according to the marketing document. They include a
mezzanine loan to help finance the purchase of a group of
Southern California office buildings, and a senior loan, or
first mortgage, on a New York City rental apartment building
that''s being converted to for-sale condominiums. Higher-yielding
mezzanine loans are used to fill the gap between first mortgages
and equity. </p>
<p>Goldman''s first real estate credit fund, known as Real
Estate Mezzanine Partners, made 28 investments, about two-thirds
of which were senior mortgages and one-third mezzanine loans,
according to the marketing document. </p>
<p>''We have a competitive advantage by focusing on larger
deals and being able to provide the entire loan to our
borrowers,'' Weidman said. ''We see less competition in the
larger loan space.'' </p>
<p>The new fund has an investment period of three years, with
possible extensions, according to the marketing document. </p>

<p>The governors of Maryland and Delaware have asked Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer Ian Read whether jobs will be cut in their states after the drugmaker promised to keep people employed in the U.K. as a way to further a $100 billion-plus bid to buy AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) </p> <p>If the acquisition occurs, it would allow Pfizer to move its legal address from New York to the U.K. to gain a lower tax rate. Read told U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron that Pfizer would keep at least 20 percent of the combined company''s research and development workers and substantial manufacturing facilities in the U.K. for at least five years to win support for the deal. </p> <p>Read''s U.K. commitment may boost pressure on Pfizer to reduce U.S. costs to obtain the savings needed from the deal. Since buying Wyeth in 2009, Pfizer has cut $4.6 billion in research spending, announced plans to close at least seven labs and narrowed its scientific focus to six areas of medicine. During the past three years, the company lost patent protection on its best-selling drug Lipitor, divested its animal health business and reduced its workforce 25 percent to 77,700 employees by the end of 2013, according to filings. </p> <p>The letter from the governors asked Read to detail potential job losses in the AstraZeneca deal and commit to continued investments in their states. </p> <h2>No Assurances </h2> <p>''Despite our requests, we have received no corresponding assurances about retaining jobs and research and development in our states,'' Maryland Governor Martin O''Malley and Delaware Governor Jack Markell, both Democrats, wrote in a letter obtained by Bloomberg News. ''Our concern is exacerbated by Pfizer''s history of closing U.S. research facilities, including sites in Michigan and Illinois, after closing on previous corporate transactions.'' </p> <p>Pfizer officials have spoken to the governors and understand their concerns, said Mackay Jimeson, a company spokesman. Bringing together the two companies would help create a leader in the pharmaceutical industry, he said. </p> <p>''We believe a potential combination with AstraZeneca would build a stronger company by bringing together our assets, people and scientific expertise to create vibrant businesses with new potential growth and opportunities to meet patients'' needs,'' Jimeson said in an e-mail. </p> <p>In their letter, the governors included six questions, saying they wanted information to better understand how Pfizer''s potential merger would affect their states and the role they play in the pharmaceutical industry. </p> <h2>''Good People'' </h2> <p>''We have 2,600 very good people in Delaware and 3,100 in Maryland,'' Markell said by telephone. ''My job is to do everything I can do to make sure they have continued career opportunities.'' </p> <p>AstraZeneca''s North America headquarters are located in Wilmington, Delaware. The company has a research center in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and a manufacturing facility in Newark, Delaware. About 22 percent of 51,500 people London-based AstraZeneca employs worldwide work in the U.S., according to the company''s website. </p> <p>Also today, Democrats in the U.S. Senate said they may push legislation that would block companies from shifting their legal addresses overseas to reduce their tax bills. That effort runs counter to Read''s April 28 statement that he didn''t believe an acquisition allowing the New York-based company to move its legal resident to the U.K. would ''create a conflict with the interest of the U.S. government.'' </p> <h2>''Hollowing Out'' </h2> <p>Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he is looking for a way to move quickly to prevent companies from ''hollowing out'' the tax base by moving overseas in name only, while keeping their operating headquarters in the U.S. </p> <p>The response from the governors and lawmakers isn''t surprising, Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University in New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. </p> <p>''These tax inversions, they are like a 2x4 into the face of Congress, saying pay attention to this,'' Reinhardt said. </p> <p>The governors decided to act after reading the past week about the assurances Read had provided to the British government, Markell said.

<p>A potential raised bid for AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN) means that Pfizer Inc. (PFE) would have to generate more than $2
billion in annual savings from the deal, and that job cuts are
more likely to happen outside the U.K. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca, the U.K.''s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
Pfizer''s offer last week of more than $106 billion, about 50
pounds a share, some 32 percent of which is in cash. At that
price, Pfizer would have to save at least $2 billion for the bid
to add to earnings in 2014 and 2015, according to an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<p>That amount would rise to at least $3 billion if the New
York-based company raised its bid to 55 pounds a share, and
Pfizer may need to increase the cash portion to 40 percent,
Bloomberg Industries analyst Sam Fazeli said. If Pfizer sticks
to the current cash offer, the savings may have to exceed $3.5
billion, ''approaching a prohibitive level'' in terms of U.K.
job reductions, he wrote. </p>
<p>''Any cost savings are likely to come partly from RD in
Sweden and the U.S., as well as the global commercial
infrastructure,'' Fazeli wrote. Pfizer''s pledge to Prime
Minister David Cameron suggests AstraZeneca''s 2,000 U.K.
research and development jobs should be ''safe from cuts if a
deal goes ahead.'' </p>
<p>The largest U.S. drugmaker told Cameron last week that it
would keep at least 20 percent of the combined company''s
research and development workforce in the U.K. for at least five
years and retain ''substantial'' manufacturing facilities at
AstraZeneca''s site south of Manchester. </p>
<h2>Swedish Workers </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s global RD workforce totals about 10,880 and
AstraZeneca''s about 9,000, according to estimates by Bloomberg
Industries. With fewer than 20 percent of those jobs in the
U.K., job cuts may occur outside Britain, said Asthika Goonewardene, a London-based analyst at Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca employs about 5,900 people in Sweden, home of
predecessor company Astra AB. Sweden, unlike the U.K., hasn''t
received any promises on jobs from Pfizer. </p>
<p>Pfizer may be more likely to cut its own RD operations
than eliminate jobs in the U.K. because of tax benefits, said
Fabian Wenner, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich. Keeping
research operations in Britain enables Pfizer to say that
products were invented in the U.K., and use the country''s lower
tax rate, Wenner said. Pfizer''s tax rate is 27.4 percent, while
AstraZeneca''s is 21.3 percent, according to Fazeli. </p>
<h2>Lower Taxes </h2>
<p>''They want to lower the tax rate for the overall group by
implementing transfer pricing, which you can only get when you
have sufficient RD in the lower tax regime,'' Wenner said. ''It
would make more sense to save 15 to 20 percent of Pfizer RD. It
would make sense from a both a political point of view and a tax
point of view.'' </p>
<p>Manufacturing jobs in Britain could also be preserved in
this way, Wenner said. The most probable positions to be
eliminated would be in sales and administration, he said. </p>
<p>Typically, a merger results in cost reductions equivalent
to about 10 percent of the target''s global sales, Wenner said.
In this case, Pfizer may cut $3.3 billion in costs, which
include a 10 percent decrease in cost of goods sold, 20 percent
of sales and administrative costs and 20 percent of research and
development costs. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which wagered more than $300 billion last year on things like yen rates and bond spreads, just laid down a bet that guys like Nelson ''Johnny'' Aguilar can stay out of jail. </p> <p>Aguilar was at a Dunkin'' Donuts near Boston on a Sunday night in March when a shooting outside left a 21-year-old man with a bullet wound to the gut, police said. They arrested Aguilar, a 19-year-old gang member with a criminal record and a tattoo that says ''Life''s a Gamble.'' </p> <p>Such crime-blotter moments are Goldman''s concern thanks to a financial product called a social-impact bond. Goldman is anchoring a $21 million plan to help a Boston-area nonprofit called Roca expand its efforts to steer young men like Aguilar away from dealing drugs, stealing cars or committing assaults and murders. </p> <p>Under the deal, if men targeted by Roca spend 22 percent fewer days in jails and prisons than their peers, Massachusetts would save enough to repay Goldman''s $9 million loan. An even bigger drop in recidivism would hand Goldman as much as $1 million in profit. If Roca fails and too many men end up behind bars, Goldman will lose almost everything it ventured. </p> <p>''It''s not that different than if you were looking at any company'' to invest in, said Andrea Phillips, vice president of Goldman''s Urban Investment Group, who leads the bank''s social-impact bond transactions. ''You''re relying on a management team. You''re relying on their human capital, their folks who work at the plant and deliver and do what they''re supposed to do.'' </p> <h2>Bottom Line </h2> <p>Young men like Aguilar are part of the bottom line: Each participant Roca keeps out of jail for a year saves Massachusetts $12,400, the state calculated. If it can close a 300-person facility and keep from expanding jail space, it could save $47,500 per person per year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S.
bank, bought $2.8 billion of Argentine bonds at a discount from
Repsol SA (REP) two days after the oil company received them as
compensation for the government''s seizure of its local unit. </p>
<p>The bonds, due in 2024, have a nominal value of $3.25
billion, the Spanish oil producer said in a regulatory filing in
Madrid. The transaction is expected to close by May 13, and for
seven days Repsol will refrain from selling its remaining
Argentine bonds to other parties except under certain
unspecified conditions, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Repsol, Spain''s largest oil producer, is reducing its ties
to Argentina after receiving $5.32 billion of bonds as payment
for the government''s April 2012 nationalization of the company''s
51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF. JPMorgan probably
believes it can resell the bonds to investors in the market,
said Fernando Recalde, portfolio manager at Galileo Argentina SG
FCI SA in Buenos Aires. </p>
<p>''This was a way for Argentina to sell bonds indirectly,''
Recalde said. ''It shows there''s appetite for Argentine risk.'' </p>
<p>Argentine bonds have returned 11.7 percent this year,
double the emerging-market average. South America''s second-biggest economy hasn''t sold bonds in international markets since
its $95 billion default in 2001, and is locked in a dispute with
some creditors in a case that is now before the U.S. Supreme
Court. </p>

JPMorgan, declined to comment on Repsol''s announcement. </p>
<h2>''No Hurry'' </h2>
<p>Argentina''s global 8.75 percent bonds due 2017, the closest
in maturity to the 2024 notes, rallied 2.8 cents on the dollar
today to 93.66 cents, bringing yields down to 11.26 percent. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, Repsol disclosed that it had sold its
remaining 12 percent equity stake in YPF for $1.3 billion
through Morgan Stanley, another New York-based bank. </p>
<p>Antonio Brufau, who was Repsol''s chief executive officer,
said Feb. 26 said that the company probably would sell the
Argentine bonds after receiving them, though it was in no hurry
to do so. In addition to the 2024 bonds, the Madrid-based
company received bonds due in 2015, 2017 and 2033. Brufau
stepped down as CEO last week and is now executive chairman. </p>
<p>The company said yesterday in a filing that the bonds have
a market value of $4.67 billion, or $650 million below their
nominal value. </p>

<p>Todd Vitale, a personal trainer who opened his own gym last year, said he was having difficulty getting a mortgage of more than $700,000 to buy a home in Greenwich, Connecticut, because his new business was untested. </p> <p>Vitale then tried Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender, where he kept most of his savings in an account he opened more than a decade ago, he said. He worked with the bank''s private mortgage unit, whose clients are entitled to loans of up to $6 million and personalized service, and had the opportunity to explain that he had already run a similar business and could make the gym succeed. Wells Fargo approved his 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of more than $700,000, he said. </p> <p>''I don''t think I would have gotten a loan unless Wells Fargo private mortgage gave me a shot,'' said Vitale, 38, who moved in to his new 3,000 square-foot home in February. ''I would have had to walk away from the home.'' </p> <p>Jumbos, or loans of at least $417,000 in most areas, are one of the few thriving pieces of an otherwise shrinking mortgage market. The biggest banks, including San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., are ratcheting up efforts to win wealthier borrowers while keeping credit tight for almost everyone else. Lenders are allowing assets in accounts to serve as collateral in lieu of down payments, cutting rates if customers have or set up investment accounts, rolling out new adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages, and accepting lower down payments. </p> <h2>Applications Increase </h2> <p>''Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead,'' said Paul Miller, a banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. based in Arlington, Virginia. ''Big banks need loan growth. If they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn''t be so aggressive on competing for jumbos.'' </p> <p>Applications for jumbo mortgages of at least $729,000 increased 4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, while requests for loans of less than $150,000 fell by 21 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average purchase application loan amount reached $280,500 in the week ended April 18, the highest since the survey started in January 1990, the MBA said. </p> <p>Jumbos, also called non-conforming loans because they exceed the limit for government-backed Fannie Mae (FMCC) and Freddie Mac to guarantee, are loans of more than $625,500 in pricier markets such as Manhattan and Los Angeles. They''re generally made to the most creditworthy borrowers with FICO scores of 760 on average and held by banks instead of being packaged into securities and sold to investors. </p> <h2>Job Cuts </h2> <p>Plunging mortgage lending at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender, dragged down their first-quarter earnings. Both banks are paring staff, with New York-based JPMorgan reducing the number of jobs at its mortgage unit by 30 percent, or 14,000 positions, since the start of last year. Wells Fargo got rid of 1,100 jobs in its residential mortgage business in the first quarter to keep expenses in line with demand for loans. Bank of America, the fourth-largest mortgage lender, swung to a surprise loss in the first quarter on costs tied to mortgage disputes. </p> <p>Refinancing, which drove lenders'' profits last year, fell in the week ended April 25 to the lowest level since 2008, according to the MBA, after increases in borrowing rates. While the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage declined to 4.21 percent this week, it''s still up almost a full percentage point from a near-record low last May, data from Freddie Mac show. </p> <h2>Lower Rates </h2> <p>''That level of drop sends everyone everywhere looking for business,'' said Joel Kan, director of economic forecasting at Washington-based MBA. </p> <p>Lenders are also vying for jumbos since they don''t have to pay higher guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to insure the bonds, as they do with conforming loans, said Richard Lepre, an Alamo, California-based loan officer with RPM Mortgage. That means they can charge lower rates on jumbos, making them more attractive than traditional loans. </p> <p>The rate at Wells Fargo for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage was 4.13 percent as of yesterday, compared with 4.25 percent for a conventional 30-year fixed loan. </p> <p>JPMorgan modified its guidelines in the third quarter for making jumbo loans to take into account a client''s total assets at the bank. The bank made the change after seeing that customers who had long-term relationships with JPMorgan were less likely to default on their loans. </p> <h2>Leverage Relationships </h2> <p>The lender created a separate process last year to review all declined loans to ensure those decisions made sense. It also set up a group that works with wealthy clients who have more complex financial situations, such as self-employed borrowers. </p> <p>''We leverage relationships to let the customers know we really want to do business with them,'' said Lesley Corydon, a senior vice president in the private client mortgage group at JPMorgan. </p> <p>JPMorgan''s jumbo mortgage originations represented 21 percent of its total originations in the first quarter of 2014 compared with 10 percent a year earlier, according to the bank. </p> <p>Customers of Chase Private Client, who have assets ranging from about $500,000 to $5 million in total wealth, increasingly are opting to use their deposits and investments as collateral when borrowing. Some clients use the credit as bridge loans or to make larger down payments. </p> <p>Vitale, the trainer who works with high school and college athletes at his Division 1 Prep gym, said he considered going to a non-bank, such as a hedge fund, for his home loan. He said he was dissuaded by the high rates and hoops he would have had to jump through to get the loan, compared with getting his Wells Fargo mortgage. </p> <h2>100% Financing </h2> <p>''We are pleased to know that Mr. Vitale received assistance with his home lending needs,'' said Emmanuel Vuillequez, product manager for non-conforming mortgages at Wells Fargo. </p> <p>Last year, Wells Fargo created a team of 400 underwriters spread across six U.S. locations who just focus on jumbo loans. The bank is trying to win more jumbo business through better execution, deploying specially trained underwriters who can handle complicated deals and complete them by the closing date, Vuillequez said. </p> <p>''Jumbo lenders are looking for ways to distinguish themselves from other jumbo lenders,'' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication in Bethesda, Maryland. ''Jumbo lending was the bright star of the mortgage market last year, so everyone is looking to ride that momentum into 2014.'' </p> <p>At Bank of New York Mellon Corp., where the average size of a mortgage is $1 million, clients can get 100 percent financing. They don''t have to put any money down and can instead pledge assets in investment accounts as collateral, said Bill Sappington, head of private banking at the New York-based firm. </p> <h2>Smaller Deposits </h2> <p>BNY Mellon earlier this year started offering customers the option to lock in mortgage rates for 90 days, instead of the typical 30-day term. The additional days give them more time to close knowing the rate is secure. </p> <p>Bank of America in October reduced the down payment to 15 percent from 20 percent for most jumbos of less than $1 million. Existing customers at the bank may receive discounts on their mortgages based on their level of business with the firm, said Susan Atran, a Bank of America spokeswoman. </p> <p>At the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, nonconforming mortgage originations were 37 percent of overall loans made during the first quarter compared with 22 percent a year earlier, according to the firm. </p> <p>RPM Mortgage this year began offering new jumbo adjustable-rate mortgages with initial low rates. One of their loan products provides a fixed rate for five years at a maximum of 2.63 percent, and then resets once during the next five years to no more than 4.63 percent, Lepre said. </p> <h2>Jumbo Defaults </h2> <p>Jumbo originations are still lower than they were before the financial crisis. A decade ago, jumbo ARMs helped fuel the housing bubble by letting buyers qualify for homes they could only afford at the low rates before they reset. </p> <p>When home prices stopped climbing in mid-2006, both jumbo and conventional ARM borrowers began defaulting in higher numbers, contributing to the collapse of the mortgage market that in turn led to the most severe financial crisis in decades. </p> <p>Today, demand for jumbos is growing as borrowers resume buying second homes or investment properties, according to Chase''s Corydon. Banks are often fighting for loans in the $1 million to $2 million range, said Mike McPartland, head of lending for Citigroup Inc.''s (C) private bank in North America. </p> <p>''If in the past, I was competing with two private banks, now it feels like I''m competing with two private banks and two regional lenders for that $2 million mortgage,'' said McPartland, whose clients generally have at least $25 million in net worth. ''The benefit to working with a bank that knows you is we don''t treat a mortgage like an isolated financial transaction.'' </p> <p>', 'JPMorgan Joins Wells Fargo in Rolling Out Jumbo Offerings', 'By Alexis Leondis', 'May 09, 2014 11:14 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-09/jpmorgan-joins-wells-fargo-in-rolling-out-jumbo-offerings.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker
seeking to acquire AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), advanced its U.K. charm
offensive with a series of videos extolling the scientific
benefits, while downplaying the potential tax advantages. </p>
<p>''It really meets the scientific needs,'' Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read said today in a video and statement on Pfizer''s
website. ''It meets needs of efficiency, it meets needs of
strengthening our balance sheet and strengthening our fiscal
position.'' </p>
<p>AstraZeneca rejected the bid of about $106 billion from
Pfizer earlier this month. Buying the company would give Pfizer
a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs.
Read and Pascal Soriot, CEO of London-based AstraZeneca, will
testify to U.K. lawmakers next week amid political tension over
public-interest issues related to the takeover. </p>
<p>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said on BBC
Radio 4 today that the government wants to clarify what a deal
would mean for British scientific research and jobs. Lawmakers
are prepared to negotiate hard as they engage both companies, he
said. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca shareholders will ''get an immediate benefit
from the cash that we would pay them,'' Pfizer''s Read said. ''It
allows them to participate in a very strong combined company
with great cash flows and a great portfolio, and it allows a
very efficient allocation of capital.'' </p>
<p>''Improving the efficiency of the organization'' and the
ability to ''liberate the balance sheet and tax of the combined
companies'' are the key reasons for the takeover, Read said.
''We liked where their science is being done, which is in the
U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio.'' </p>
<p>Read may soon also face government inquiries in the U.S.
Pfizer has said it plans to keep the company''s operating
headquarters in the U.S., even as its legal address shifts to
the U.K. for the lower tax rate. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read faces heightened public scrutiny of his bid for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) this week when he''ll be questioned by lawmakers
on his commitment to the U.K. in hearings broadcast live. </p>
<p>Read has been summoned by separate parliamentary committees
to testify on the U.S. company''s offer of about $106 billion for
London-based AstraZeneca, the biggest takeover bid in U.K.
history. He and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot are scheduled to
appear before the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee
tomorrow and the Science and Technology Committee on May 14. </p>
<p>The hearings in London provide a first opportunity for
lawmakers to question the pharmaceutical executives amid growing
public and political concern that a takeover would mean job
losses and cuts to research. As executives from Rupert Murdoch
to Robert Diamond have learned, lawmakers acting in the name of
British taxpayers can force company changes to assuage public
concerns. </p>
<p>''The entire political class and media will be spending a
couple of hours listening to Pfizer''s business and intellectual
case'' for the takeover, said Richard Berry, managing director
of Democratic Audit, a charity that has studied the work of
parliamentary committees. ''Sessions where people get a grilling
get a lot of attention and I''m sure the media will highlight the
most aggressive part.'' </p>
<h2>Video Appearances </h2>
<p>Read may have pre-empted some of the questions he is likely
to face with videos posted on Pfizer''s website over the weekend
in which he outlined the case for the bid, stressing his
company''s commitment to research and explaining its decision to
shutter a plant in Sandwich, England, in 2011. Pfizer''s
commitment to the new AstraZeneca headquarters being built in
Cambridge, eastern England, fits the company''s record of
bringing together scientists at its research hub in the U.S.,
Read said. </p>
<p>''In the U.K. I see great similarities with Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where you have this hub of innovation, this hub
of young scientists,'' he said. ''The strategy to build a center
in Cambridge in fact is in line with our strategy as we''ve shown
by what we''ve done in Massachusetts.'' </p>
<p>When Read first approached ministers after announcing the
bid, Conservatives including Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed it as a vote of confidence in the U.K. Since
then, ministers have grown more cautious, demanding assurances
about jobs and research spending. According to one person
familiar with the company''s plans, Pfizer won''t proceed with the
bid if the U.K. government is hostile. </p>
<h2>''Bitter Experience'' </h2>
<p>''Bitter experience in other contexts has taught us about
the importance of really pinning these commitments down and not
just allowing them to rest as aspirations but to make sure they
are exacting, binding commitments,'' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said in an interview with Sky News broadcast yesterday.
''There are various ways that they could be made more solid and
that''s exactly the kind of thing we''re discussing with Pfizer.'' </p>
<p>The most hostile questioning may come from members of the
opposition Labour Party, whose leader Ed Miliband has accused
Prime Minister David Cameron of being a cheerleader for the
takeover. Conservatives will also want to be seen to be asking
tough questions to demonstrate they are pursuing due diligence. </p>
<p>''Frankly, we have not seen any guarantees from Pfizer that
they have an investment plan that is equal to what AstraZeneca
are putting into the science base over the next 10 years,''
William Bain, a Labour lawmaker on the Business Committee, said
in an interview. ''Pfizer does have a record of launching
takeovers for other pharmaceutical companies and then seeing a
reduction in investment in research and development.'' </p>
<h2>Executive Roll-call </h2>
<p>Tomorrow''s session will begin at 9:30 a.m. in London with
evidence from union officials. At 10 a.m., Read will be joined
by Frank D''Amelio, the company''s chief financial officer, and
Jonathan Emms, its U.K. managing director. Their testimony is
scheduled to end at 11:15 a.m., when Soriot, flanked by Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca''s executive vice president, and Ian Brimicombe, vice president in charge of corporate finance, will
make the case against the takeover. </p>
<p>''The main issue is to understand what Pfizer''s commitments
to the U.K. are and how binding they are,'' Julian Huppert, a
lawmaker who represents Cambridge, said in an interview. ''The
deal is driven by their desire to avoid paying tax in the U.S.'' </p>
<p>The British government''s ''patent box'' allows companies to
pay reduced tax on products spun out of research done in the
U.K. For Huppert, it makes Pfizer''s attachment to Britain shaky. </p>
<h2>U.S. Pressure </h2>
<p>Pfizer is also facing political pressure in the U.S., where
the New York-based company has said it plans to keep its
operating headquarters even as it moves its legal address to the
U.K. for a lower tax rate. </p>
<p>In the videos at the weekend, Read sought to shift the
emphasis away from tax and onto the business case for the
takeover, which AstraZeneca''s board has rejected. </p>
<p>''We liked where their science is being done, which is in
the U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio,''
he said. The approach was, he said, ''a win-win for society, a
win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders.'' </p>
<p>British parliamentary committees, originally introduced to
scrutinize the work of government, have become increasingly
willing to intervene in matters of more general interest. </p>
<p>In 2012, the Treasury Committee summoned Diamond, then CEO
of Barclays Plc, to explain the Libor-rigging scandal. He
resigned before he got there, despite investor support, after
politicians on all sides made him a target. </p>
<h2>Foam Pie </h2>
<p>Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., made it through three
hours of testimony to parliament''s culture committee on the
phone-hacking scandal in 2011. He emerged unscathed barring a
foam-pie assault by a member of the public after telling members
that his appearance was ''the most humble day of my life.'' His
son James wasn''t so lucky, with his account of events disputed
by two former executives. </p>
<p>The first sign of whether the U.K. government''s view on
Pfizer and AstraZeneca has shifted as a result of the testimony
will come at 1 p.m. tomorrow, when Business Secretary Vince Cable responds. </p>
<p>Cable has been examining how Pfizer''s proposed takeover
could be blocked on public-interest grounds, including the
possibility of referring the case to the European Commission or
proposing a change to the Enterprise Act that would widen the
public-interest test for takeovers, a person familiar with
discussions in government said on May 9. </p>
<p>''I will do whatever is right for Britain, I will always
stand up for British jobs, British interests, British science,
British RD,'' Cameron said when asked on BBC TV yesterday about
toughening up the law on takeovers. ''But when we think of that,
it is important to make the point that Britain benefits
massively by being an economy that''s open to overseas
investment.'' </p>

<p>Debt investors are betting
Australia''s iron-ore producers will survive what Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. has described as the dusk of a bull market as they
improve balance sheets and cut production costs. </p>
<p>Bond risk for BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group fell
this quarter even as prices of the steelmaking ingredient
slumped 11 percent, according to CMA credit-default swap
pricing. Contracts for Rio, which last year got 87 percent of
its profit from iron ore, were at 93 basis points on May 8, 12
below this year''s high. Those for BHP dropped to 61 basis points
from as high as 71. </p>
<p>''BHP and Rio have been lifting production while also
taking out costs,'' Ben Byrne, a credit sector specialist at
Citigroup Inc. in Sydney, said by phone May 9. ''These efforts
have offset weaker commodity prices to some degree.'' </p>
<p>Goldman wrote in a May 7 report that over-investment in new
supply means dusk is settling on the iron-ore bull market from
2004 to 2013, which will force mine closures among high-cost
producers. BHP and Rio, the world''s two biggest mining
companies, are reining in investment and cutting debt after a
decade-long boom in metal prices slowed. </p>
<p>Rio plans to reduce spending on new operations to about $8
billion in 2015, less than half its outlay in 2012. BHP is
focusing on the highest-returning projects and plans to spend
$16 billion during fiscal 2014 on new projects and exploration,
down from $22 billion the previous year. </p>
<h2>Bond Dearth </h2>
<p>The austerity drive, which includes slashing operating
costs, is set to reduce net debt for both companies. Rio''s may
fall 21 percent to $14.2 billion in 2015 compared with this
year, RBC Capital Markets forecast this month. BHP''s net debt
may fall 45 percent to $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, RBC said. </p>
<p>The savings drive by the miners means there''s a smaller
pool of debt for bond investors to choose from, said Chris Walter, a credit analyst in Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp. </p>
<p>''There''s little to no supply of cash bonds in the near
term'' from mining companies, Walter said. ''Credit investors
still need to put their money to work in a low-yield
environment, so it''s not surprising we''re seeing further spread
tightening'' in CDS. </p>
<p>BHP and Rio have both predicted lower iron-ore prices this
year after producers in Australia and Brazil spent billions of
dollars to expand output. After a balanced export market in 2013
totaling 1.2 billion metric tons, Goldman Sachs forecasts a
surplus of about 77 million tons this year, rising to about 145
million tons next year. </p>
<h2>Metrics Strained </h2>
<p>U.S. dollar debt issued by Rio returned 1.7 percent this
quarter through May 8 while BHP''s gained 1.6 percent, according
to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Metals, Mining  Steel
Index. The gauge advanced 2.4 percent. </p>
<p>Australia''s 10-year bond yield fell to an seven-month low
of 3.80 percent last week, before closing at 3.82 percent. It
offered a 1.21 percentage point pick-up over similar-maturity
U.S. Treasuries. </p>
<p>The Aussie dollar, the world''s fifth most-traded currency,
fetched 93.56 U.S. cents as of 5 p.m. in Sydney on May 9, having
gained 4.9 percent since Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Growth in China, the biggest buyer of iron ore, is slowing
after the government reined in a credit boom and toughened
regulation to combat pollution. The economy expanded 7.4 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, matching the weakest
pace since 2009. Premier Li Keqiang is targeting growth of 7.5
percent. </p>
<p>Iron ore entered a bear market in March and fell to $103.70
a ton on May 8, the lowest level since September 2012, taking
this year''s price drop to 23 percent. The average annual price
is forecast to decline each year until at least 2017, according
to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''If iron ore fell to $80 or $90 a ton in the next couple
of years, Rio''s credit metrics could become strained for its
current A- and A3 ratings,'' said Byrne. ''However there is
little risk of a credit event given the company''s scale and
strong liquidity.'' </p>

<p>Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)''s warring
creditors aren''t the only ones focused on a trial to divide the
more than $7 billion remaining after the Canadian telecom giant
was liquidated. </p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will also have lawyers on hand to guard
secrets surrounding more than 6,000 patents that it teamed up
with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Sony Corp. (6758) to buy for $4.5 billion. </p>
<p>At a trial that began today, U.S., Canadian and European
creditors are fighting over how to divide cash raised through a
series of auctions after what was once North America''s largest
telephone-equipment maker went bankrupt in 2009. </p>
<p>The European creditors, including British pensioners, said
the Canadians are seeking 82 percent and the Americans are after
73 percent of the $7 billion under their respective proposals.
The division of the $4.5 billion raised in the patent sale has
been a key sticking point. </p>
<p>''The U.S.-Canada fight on the patents will be the main
part of the trial,'' Kevin Starke, a senior analyst with CRT
Capital Group Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut, said in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>The Canadian creditors, including Nortel''s pension system,
said that because the company was based in Ontario and owned the
patents, it deserves the cash that was paid for them by the
technology company group, according to Starke. Canada is seeking
everything from the patent sale and 90 percent of all IP
proceeds. </p>
<h2>U.S. Licenses </h2>
<p>The U.S. creditors, including bondholders seeking full
interest payments, said U.S. businesses held licenses for the
patents, so they deserve the money. </p>
<p>Judges in Wilmington, Delaware, and Toronto are presiding
over the video-linked proceeding. The tech companies that now
own the patents said they fear valuable secrets may accidentally
leak out during 25 days of testimony and argument and want the
court to shield information concerning license agreements,
potential litigation targets and other matters. </p>
<p>Nortel''s U.S. unit contributed about $5.3 billion in assets
to the bankruptcy sales, said Sheila R. Block, a lawyer for the
U.S. estate speaking in Toronto. That unit also contributed
about 70 percent of revenue from 2001 to 2009. As of 2001, every
unit had a fully paid up license for the patents in their
geographic region in perpetuity, said James L. Bromley, a lawyer
for the U.S. unit in Wilmington. </p>
<h2>''Administrative Simplicity'' </h2>
<p>The European group dismissed Canada''s bid for sole right to
the patent proceeds, saying the parent held legal ownership only
for ''administrative simplicity,'' according to Bill Maguire, a
lawyer for the unit. </p>
<p>The proper way to make distributions is based on each
unit''s financial contribution in creating the patents, Maguire
said. Investments in research and development are used to
establish economic ownership of the intellectual property, which
is how Nortel calculated distributions when it sold assets to
Alcatel-Lucent in 2006, according to Maguire. </p>
<p>''You reap what you sow,'' he said. </p>
<p>The U.S. creditors would get about 73 percent of the $7
billion under their approach, with Canada getting about 11
percent and Europe the rest, according to an exhibit presented
by the European creditors. </p>
<p>Canada''s model would give its creditors more than 82
percent, while the U.S. and European creditors would get about
14 percent and 4 percent, respectively. The European model would
give U.S. creditors 50 percent, the Canadians about 32 percent
and its own creditors the remainder. </p>
<h2>1,000 Documents </h2>
<p>About 1,000 documents may be used that Nortel''s U.S.
attorneys say potentially contain confidential information. As
the papers are presented to witnesses, they might become public
as part of the court record. And while other documents may be
safe to disclose in public, the patent holders still want to be
able to review them before they are introduced. </p>
<p>The Canadian and U.S. creditors have said that without
clear rules, the trial could be disrupted by the need to keep so
many documents secret. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross has agreed to allow
sensitive material to be blacked out. With so many documents
involved, however, decisions on what to keep secret may have to
be made while court is in session. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the joint venture that Microsoft, Apple and
Sony formed to buy the patents in 2011, Rockstar Consortium
Inc., will be following the trial along with Ericsson AB, which
bought Nortel''s wireless unit for $1 billion. </p>
<h2>Show Why </h2>
<p>Gross said that on certain patent-related documents, he
would defer to Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and the other
companies about whether something should be kept secret. Anyone
challenging the need to keep a document confidential would have
to show why it should be made public, Gross said. </p>
<p>Nortel filed for bankruptcy after losing almost $7 billion
since 2005. At its height in 2000, it reported $30 billion in
annual revenue, had a market capitalization of $250 billion and
employed almost 93,000 people, the company said in court papers. </p>
<p>''Today it''s every debtor for itself making a territorial
grab'' for the sale proceeds, said Brian E. O''Connor, a lawyer
representing about 36,000 U.K. pension claimants. ''While they
fight like jackals over the decaying carcass,'' the pensioners
are being harmed, he said. </p>
<p>The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-bk-10138, U.S.

<p>For at least a decade, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) gave fired employees information detailing a severance package that asked them to waive age-discrimination claims and also included a page listing the job titles and ages of workers being let go. </p> <p>This disclosure helps fired employees determine if they have an age-discrimination case, and it''s required by U.S. federal law for workers over 40 if a company wants the person to agree not to file such a lawsuit. Now IBM is withholding the information, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. It''s avoiding the disclosure requirement by offering workers the option of bringing claims in arbitration. </p> <p>Although employees are now able to accept a severance agreement and maintain their ability to bring an age-discrimination claim in arbitration, the strategy could make it harder and riskier for dismissed older employees to decide whether it''s worth taking on the cost of a legal battle, lawyers and labor law experts say. And many older workers are already feeling vulnerable in a still anemic economic recovery, said Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank affiliated with labor. IBM, considered a pioneer in employee benefits, may be one of the first major companies to make these changes in severance agreements. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the world''s third-largest energy company by market value, became the first major
international oil producer to reveal partnership plans with
state-run Petroleos Mexicanos since Mexico signed landmark
legislation to reopen its doors to foreign producers. </p>
<p>Chevron, (CVX) which operates several rigs on the U.S. side of
the Gulf of Mexico, is in talks with Mexico City-based Pemex for
exploration opportunities in deepwater, shallow water or shale,
Ali Moshiri, Chevron''s president of Latin America and Africa,
said today during a conference in Mexico City. Chevron produces
more crude in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico than anyone
except Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc, according to the U.S.
Interior Department. </p>
<p>''We are not here to replace Pemex,'' said Moshiri, who
oversees exploration and production projects from Argentina to
Angola. ''We are not here to change their strategy. We are here
to complement what they are doing.'' </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is waiting for the
passage of Mexico''s secondary energy legislation before deciding
the sites of the first partnerships in Mexico. The legislation,
which will determine Pemex''s participation in new projects and
the tax structure for private companies joining the newly opened
energy market, could be approved as soon as June, according to
Mexico''s two largest political parties. </p>
<h2>Investment Options </h2>
<p>Mexico passed an energy law last year that ended Pemex''s
75-year production monopoly to allow for private firms to tap
the country''s 13.44 billion barrels of proven oil reserves.
Private investment is anticipated to generate an additional $30
billion annually and create as many as 2 million jobs, Mexico''s
energy ministry has said. </p>
<p>''We look for the opportunity that brings the most value to
the Mexican government, the Mexican people, and our
shareholders,'' Moshiri said. ''We are a huge company. We can
invest money in conventional, deepwater, or shallow water. What
drives our decision is really to see what is the best for
everybody.'' </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are the world''s
first- and second-biggest energy companies by market value.
Pemex and Exxon signed a technical collaboration agreement last
year before the energy law was approved by President Enrique
Pena Nieto in December. </p>
<p>''We are going to align our strategic direction in Mexico
with Pemex,'' Moshiri said. ''Our future in Mexico is based on
building this exisiting partnership.'' </p>
<p>Chevron added 0.2 percent to close $125.24 in New York. </p>

<p>Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. hired
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partner Magid Shenouda as global
head of trading, the most senior ex-banker to join the Swiss
commodity firm, said a person with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Shenouda, the former London-based co-head of Goldman''s
global commodities unit, will also join the fast-growing
trader''s board of directors, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the decision hasn''t been made public. The
appointment was announced today in a memo to Mercuria staff seen
by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>As investment banks pull back from commodities amid
heightened regulatory scrutiny, firms like Mercuria are snapping
up high-profile talent and assets. The company agreed in March
to buy JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s physical commodity business for
$3.5 billion. </p>
<p>Mercuria has offered jobs to about 200 people from the
JPMorgan unit. Etienne Amic, managing director for European
energy trading at JPMorgan in London, will join the firm, said
people with knowledge of the matter. Raj Chawla, JPMorgan''s head
of China commodities, will become Asia Pacific chief operating
officer based in Singapore, two of the people said. </p>
<p>Mercuria spokesman Benoit Lioud declined to comment. </p>
<p>Shenouda will be the number three executive at the Geneva-based company after co-founders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi,
one of the people said. A 14-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, he
takes over the head trading role from Jaeggi, who will focus
more on strategy and the integration of the JPMorgan business. </p>
<h2>Top Sphere </h2>
<p>In less than a decade, the founders have transformed
Mercuria from a 10-person company supplying oil to a pair of
Polish refineries into the world''s fourth-largest independent
commodity trader with revenue topping $112 billion in 2013. </p>
<p>Seeking to join the top sphere of independent trading firms
such as Vitol Group and Trafigura Beheer BV, Mercuria has hired
570 staff from 2011 to 2013 including key executives from
investment banks. It now has about 1,200 employees. </p>
<p>The appointments included Houston-based Shameek Konar, a
former managing director at Goldman who is chief investment
officer overseeing Mercuria''s corporate development including
the JPMorgan acquisition. Victoria Attwood Scott, Mercuria''s
head of compliance, also joined from Goldman. </p>
<h2>Former Traders </h2>
<p>Roger Jones, the ex-head of commodities at Barclays Plc (BARC) who
has spent more than a quarter-century trading, was hired in 2012
to lead its non-oil business and join the board. </p>
<p>Shenouda, whose recruitment by Mercuria was reported
earlier by the Wall Street Journal, left Goldman last year,
according to an internal memo confirmed by the bank on Oct. 29.
He joined New York-based Goldman in 1999 and became a partner in
2008. </p>
<p>Before he was the co-head of Goldman''s global commodity
business, Shenouda ran the bank''s European crude oil and
products trading unit as well as its European gas and power
trading business. </p>
<p>Former Goldman traders themselves, Dunand and Jaeggi will
significantly increase Mercuria''s gas and power trading with the
JPMorgan deal. The company has offered jobs to about 200
JPMorgan traders, or about half of the commodity business staff,
a person with knowledge of the matter said this month. </p>
<p>Blythe Masters, head of JPMorgan''s commodity unit, will
leave the bank once the sale of the business is completed, the
firm said last month. </p>
<p>Banks from Barclays to Morgan Stanley (MS) are exiting or
shrinking their commodities businesses as regulators crack down
on risk and as revenue falls. Sales for the 10 largest
investment-bank commodity businesses fell to $4.5 billion in
2013 from $14 billion in 2008, according to London-based
analytics company Coalition. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
billion, bringing its purchases of the country''s securities to
about $5 billion in less than a week. </p>
<p>JPMorgan agreed to purchase Argentine bonds due in 2015,
2017 and 2033, Madrid-based Repsol said in a filing. The oil
company said last week that it agreed to sell Argentine
government bonds due in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) will become Keurig
Green Mountain Inc. (GMCR)''s largest shareholder after raising its
stake to 16 percent, doubling down on the maker of Keurig coffee
brewers at a time when consumers are increasingly shunning
sugary sodas. </p>
<p>Keurig jumped 7.6 percent to $119.07 after Coca-Cola
announced the plan in a filing today. The soft-drink company
will own about 26 million shares within nine months after it
exercises an option to add additional stock. It had bought an
initial stake of 10 percent in February. </p>
<p>The investment fits into Coca-Cola''s strategy of taking
equity stakes in promising new brands and technologies as
healthier habits hits its main revenue growth. The companies are
working together on the Keurig Cold single-cup beverage system
that will be sold in Keurig''s fiscal 2015, starting later this
year. The coffee maker will also produce and sell Coca-Cola-branded pods to go with the machine. </p>
<p>The ''purchases demonstrate our continued belief that
Keurig Green Mountain has substantial growth potential,''
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Shares of Waterbury, Vermont-based Keurig have jumped 47
percent since Feb. 5, the day Coca-Cola announced it was the
buying the stake. Coca-Cola''s stock advanced 0.7 percent to
$41.11 today. </p>
<h2>SodaStream Competition </h2>
<p>Under today''s agreement, Coca-Cola owns about 19.5 million
shares and has the right to buy as much as 6.5 million more. The
company signed a pact with Credit Suisse Group AG to purchase
the balance of the stake by Feb. 13, 2015. The bank will set the
price, determined by timing and an agreed-upon formula,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>The partnership between Coca-Cola and Keurig will ratchet
up competition for SodaStream International Ltd., a Lod, Israel-based company that makes home carbonation appliances and soft-drink syrups. </p>
<p>In February, Coca-Cola bought 16.7 million newly issued
shares in Keurig for about $1.25 billion and said it had the
option to raise the stake to as much as 16 percent during the
first 36 months. Amanda Rosseter, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola,
declined to elaborate on the timing of the agreement beyond the
filing. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola previously took equity stakes in Zico coconut
water and Honest Tea, and helped incubate them. Coca-Cola

<p>International Business Machines (IBM) Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty will face a skeptical
audience when she speaks to Wall Street analysts tomorrow. </p>
<p>As she''s worked to revamp the company in a shifting
technology industry, Rometty has kept herself bound to IBM''s
target of at least $18 a share in adjusted earnings this year --
a number that 60 percent of analysts anticipate the company will
miss. After eight consecutive quarters of revenue declines, she
must start increasing sales or reduce expenses further to avoid
missing the profit goals. </p>
<p>At a daylong conference in New York, Rometty, 56, will
probably lay out her plan to use newer technology, such as data
analytics and cloud computing, to mount a strong comeback in the
coming quarters. The question is whether those lines of business
can expand quickly enough to make up for falling sales in IBM''s
hardware unit and in emerging markets like China. </p>
<p>''There has to be intense pressure on her to carry out the
execution of the plan,'' Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones
 Co., said in an interview from St. Louis. ''The concern is
largely about the way to get there.'' He advises buying the
shares and estimates IBM will hit the $18 target. </p>
<p>Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>''We''re transitioning to key growth areas and transforming
parts of the business,'' Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call last month. ''We''re
continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as
mobility, security and cloud, and these initiatives are gaining
traction but are not yet at scale.'' </p>
<p>Abandon Roadmap? </p>
<p>Those changes need to happen more quickly, and Rometty
should consider dropping her earnings targets so she can focus
on the transition, said Ben Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Plc. </p>
<p>''Given the deterioration in earnings quality and revenue
challenges, we believe it makes sense for IBM to abandon its
roadmap and change its business model,'' he said in a research
note. The company needs to more aggressively shift to providing
technology as a service rather than a product, he said. He has
the equivalent of a neutral rating and estimates IBM will report
adjusted earnings of $17.80 this year, short of its target. </p>
<p>IBM shares are up 2.5 percent this year, in line with the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. They fell less than 1 percent to
$192.19 at the close today in New York. Eight analysts advise
buying the stock, while 24 say to hold and three recommend
selling. </p>
<p>After a 30-year career at IBM, Rometty stepped into the
role of CEO in 2012 amid sweeping changes in the industry. Her
company is still adjusting to the upheaval in the technology
world. </p>
<p>Technology customers are increasingly storing data and
software on cloud-computing networks, rather than on site,
limiting their need for servers and mainframes and the IBM
consultants needed to install and maintain them. While the
company has shifted its focus to cloud services and data
analytics to keep up, the effort has not been enough to
reinvigorate sales growth. </p>
<h2>Hardware Slump </h2>
<p>Lagging demand for IBM''s hardware division continues to
drag down revenue, with the unit''s sales falling 23 percent to
$2.4 billion in the first quarter. Revenue in developing
countries slid 11 percent, or 5 percent when adjusting for
currency fluctuations. Revenue from China fell 20 percent. </p>
<p>Tomorrow''s meeting with analysts gives Rometty and her
executive team a chance to show how their more recent
investments will produce more revenue. </p>
<p>''IBM has implemented significant actions as it shifts
toward a higher valued-added mix; by no means is the company
standing still,'' Jim Kelleher, an analyst at Argus Research in
New York, said in a note. ''IBM has also shown an ability to
align costs in periods of challenging revenue growth.'' He has a
hold rating on the shares and estimates IBM will fall short of
its target with earnings of $17.96 a share this year. </p>
<h2>New Products </h2>
<p>The company will probably highlight newer products tomorrow
like the cloud offerings from SoftLayer Technologies Inc., which
it acquired last year, or the Watson cognitive-computing tool,
said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
In a note to investors, he questioned whether those initiatives
are incremental for the company or can actually help boost sales
growth. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the shares and
estimates IBM will hit its $18 target. </p>
<h2>Cloud Promise </h2>
<p>IBM has held up cloud computing as one of its biggest
opportunities for growth. Cloud revenue grew more than 50
percent last quarter, and cloud offerings delivered as a service
are now on pace to generate about $2.3 billion a year. That''s
still a fraction of IBM''s total $100 billion in annual sales. </p>
<p>While it searches for growth, IBM is also cutting expenses
and shedding less profitable businesses. Earlier this year,
China''s Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) agreed to buy IBM''s low-end server
business for $2.3 billion. The deal is awaiting government
review before closing, and the companies must convince U.S.
officials that the transaction won''t give China back-door access
to secrets and infrastructure. </p>
<h2>Job Cuts </h2>
<p>Lower tax rates have also helped profits continue to grow,
and a surge in buybacks has helped IBM hit its targets for
earnings per share. It also took an $870 million charge last
quarter to cut jobs, and has changed the information it provides
in U.S. severance packages in a way that may help reduce age-discrimination lawsuits, according to lawyers and labor law
experts. IBM said the changes were made to protect worker
privacy. </p>
<p>The company''s cost-cutting moves helped lift adjusted
profit to $16.28 a share last year, up 40 percent from 2010. </p>
<p>For this year, the average estimate of 25 analysts is for
$17.88 a share in adjusted earnings, less than the company''s $18
target. Next year''s average analyst estimate of $19.79 a share
also falls short of a $20 goal. </p>
<p>IBM has said it can meet its forecasts, even as costs mount
in its pursuit of the goals. IBM''s debt has climbed, and its
cash balance has dropped, partly because of spending on stock
repurchases -- spending that could have gone to acquisitions or
other investments. </p>
<p>Some Wall Street analysts, such as Morningstar Inc.''s Peter Wahlstrom, argue that Rometty shouldn''t be trying to hit the
targets. Yardsticks like revenue and free cash flow are more
important than earnings per share anyway, Wahlstrom said. He has
a hold rating and estimates IBM''s adjusted earnings will fall
short of the target at $17.47 a share this year. </p>
<p>''Those are things that can be kind of managed,'' he said
of earnings per share. ''You don''t really give a company credit
for that.'' </p>
<p>Numbers to watch include: </p>
<p>*Free cash flow: CFO Schroeter said last month that the company
expects at least $16 billion for the year, up from $15 billion
in 2013. </p>
<p>''Given that non-operating forces have a limited impact on
FCF vs. EPS (buybacks, tax rate, one-time gains, etc), we expect
investors to remain focused on this metric and to look for both
upside and downside risk at the analyst day,'' Bernstein''s
Sacconaghi said in a note. </p>
<p>*Acquisitions: IBM said in 2010 it planned to spend $20 billion
on acquisitions through 2015. With revenue declining, some
analysts say a large acquisition could be warranted. </p>
<p>''Given the ongoing challenges with weak organic revenue
(especially in hardware), IBM may need to do a large deal to
help stabilize the revenue,'' Reitzes of Barclays said in a
note. </p>
<p>*Growth markets: IBM has said it expects emerging markets to
approach 30 percent of revenue in 2015. Last year, the markets
made up 23 percent of total sales after falling 4.9 percent
year-over-year. </p>
<p>''We also expect to hear about IBM''s growth markets and
what changes have been put in place to stimulate revenue
growth,'' Reitzes said in a note. </p>

<p>Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.''s head banker on Twitter Inc.''s initial public offering
last year, is leaving to join hedge-fund firm Coatue Management
LLC. </p>
<p>Dan Dees, who became co-head of technology, media and
telecommunications banking with Noto earlier this year, will
become sole leader of the group, according to an internal memo.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed
the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the top-ranked adviser on mergers and
acquisitions involving technology, media and telecommunications
companies last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Noto, 46, rejoined the firm in 2010 after leaving in 2008 to
become chief financial officer of the National Football League. </p>
<p>Coatue, which manages about $9.2 billion, was founded in
1999 by Philippe Laffont, who worked for Julian Robertson at
Tiger Management LLC, according to a regulatory filing last
month. Coatue managed the 20th-most-profitable hedge fund in the
world last year, according to Bloomberg Rankings. The New York-based firm has made investments in technology companies such as
Snapchat Inc. and Flipboard Inc. </p>
<p>''Anthony is a key addition to our private investing
effort, helping us build on the momentum we have established,''
Laffont said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Noto''s move was reported earlier today by website Re/Code. </p>
<h2>''Big Personalities'' </h2>
<p>Simon Holden, Nick Giovanni and Michael Ronen will become
co-chief operating officers of the group at Goldman Sachs,
according to the memo. Holden runs the telecommunications sector
and leads the TMT group in Europe. Giovanni is head of the
Internet sector, while Ronen leads the media and
telecommunications MA business in the Americas. </p>
<p>Dees was co-head of the investment-banking division for
Asia Pacific ex-Japan before moving back to the U.S. to take the
TMT job. George Lee and Gene Sykes will remain co-chairmen of
the TMT group, according to a memo sent by investment banking
co-heads Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg. </p>
<p>''Deals in technology, media and telecom are really
interesting to the world, they involve really big
personalities,'' Lee said in a March interview. ''It''s a big
revenue and profit contributor, and it''s so high-profile that
our success there has an overweight impact on the way people
perceive our overall franchise.'' </p>
<h2>West Point </h2>
<p>Noto, a football player at the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, New York, trained to be a member of the Army Rangers
and spent time in the Middle East while serving as a signal
officer in the infantry. He was a research analyst covering
Internet companies in his first stint at Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Since returning to the firm, Noto has competed with Morgan
Stanley (MS) for the lead spot on a string of high-profile IPOs.
Goldman Sachs led the offerings for Yelp Inc. and Twitter, while
Morgan Stanley won the prime spot on LinkedIn Corp. and Facebook
Inc. </p>
<p>''My last four years at Goldman Sachs have been as equally
rewarding as the first nine years,'' Noto said in an e-mailed
statement. ''The TMT franchise has never been stronger and I
look forward to seeing the continued success of such a fantastic
team and to working with the firm as a client.'' </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced a lower-priced option for its Xbox One, seeking to take back the lead in
video-game console sales from Sony Corp. (6758) </p>
<p>The new version, which will cost $399 and won''t include the
Kinect motion-sensing camera, will be available on June 9 in all
markets where Xbox One is available, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The move reverses a controversial decision by Microsoft to
bundle Xbox One with Kinect, increasing the price of the console
to $499, or $100 more than Sony''s PlayStation 4. Although
Microsoft had insisted it needed Kinect to convince game
developers to write software for the motion sensor, Sony''s big
lead is prompting Microsoft to change its strategy. The
PlayStation 4 outsold Xbox One consoles in the U.S. in March,
holding the lead for a third month. </p>
<p>''The vision we have had for Xbox One continues, and that
is that the premium experience is with Kinect,'' Yusuf Mehdi,
Xbox vice president for strategy and marketing, said in an
interview. ''We did get a lot of customer feedback since launch
from people saying ''I''d like more choices,'' and for some people
$399 is an important price point,'' </p>
<p>Microsoft will also start giving users more access to
entertainment applications such as YouTube, Netflix and HBO GO,
changing another policy that annoyed customers. The company had
required users to pay for an Xbox Live Gold subscription to use
such apps. Starting in June, anyone with an Xbox One and Xbox
360 can use those apps. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is betting the
world''s biggest bond gains are far from over. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank bought $3.25 billion of Argentine
bonds from Repsol SA (REP) as a wager the notes will rally and hasn''t
hedged them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
bank''s strategy. It paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year debt, or
about 86.6 cents on the dollar, and will keep some of the bonds
longer-term, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because he wasn''t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. </p>
<p>Argentina''s bonds, rated seven levels below investment
grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most among
emerging-market government debt, as the country repairs ties
with the International Monetary Fund and seeks to stem a drop in
the foreign reserves it uses to pay debt. The government gave
the Bonar notes due in 2024 to Madrid-based Repsol as
compensation after seizing 51 percent of YPF SA two years ago,
as part of a package with a total face value of $5.32 billion. </p>
<p>''People were aching to be a part of the Argentine story,''
Patrick Esteruelas, senior sovereign analyst at Emso Partners
Ltd., which oversees about $2 billion, said in an interview in
New York. ''It''s a junk credit, but it''s a credit that people
are evaluating as part of a broad convergence play.'' </p>
<h2>Repsol Deal </h2>
<p>JPMorgan sold some of the notes and will keep some with the
intent to sell at a profit, the person said, without giving
amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined
to comment on the deal. </p>
<p>Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not to
sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold some of the 2024 securities for about 86.75
cents on the dollar to at least two investment firms, according
to two people familiar with the transactions. The 8.75 percent
notes were trading late yesterday at 88.35 cents on the dollar,
with a yield of 10.7 percent. </p>
<p>Given prices on other Argentine government bonds, the 2024
notes should be about 8 cents higher at 96.5 cents on the dollar
with a yield of 9.4 percent, according to a May 12 report by
Citigroup Inc. strategists Jeff Williams and Guillermo Mondino. </p>
<p>Argentina''s notes due in 2017 traded at 92.4 cents on the
dollar with a 10.3 percent yield. </p>
<h2>''Steady Increase'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, which opened its first office in Buenos Aires in
1978, sold about half of the bonds, according to Michael Roche,
a strategist at Seaport Global Holdings LLC, citing trades he''s
observed. The country hasn''t issued international bonds since it
defaulted on $95 billion of debt in 2001. It restructured 93
percent of the debt in swaps in 2005 and 2010. </p>
<p>''They''ve demonstrated that they''re able to access
international capital markets,'' Roche said in a telephone
interview from New York. ''We''re continuing to see a steady
increase in the breadth of investors interested in getting
exposure to Argentina.'' </p>
<p>Joshua Rosner, managing director and bank analyst at Graham
Fisher  Co., said JPMorgan is making a risky bet. </p>
<p>''They may be betting that the government will ultimately
act rationally,'' he said in a telephone interview from New
York. ''If they didn''t hedge it, and are holding this for their
own portfolios, it''s a wildly risky thing to do especially given
the statements and actions of the government.'' </p>
<h2>Regime Change </h2>
<p>Since taking office in 2007, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has also seized $24 billion of private pension funds
and flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas SA. The country still
hasn''t settled claims with defaulted-debt creditors demanding
full payment. </p>
<p>Fernandez''s efforts to mend ties with overseas creditors
and the prospect of a new government after elections next year
will spark further bond gains, Seaport Global''s Roche said. </p>
<p>Argentina revamped its economic data indexes earlier this
year at the behest of the IMF, which had censured the country
for inaccurate inflation and growth figures in 2013. It has also
settled with five companies in the World Bank''s arbitration arm
and is in negotiations with the Paris Club of creditors. </p>
<p>''Investors are pretty convinced that a new political force
at the new elections will continue to normalize the country''s
relations with international investors,'' Roche said. </p>

companies are scheduled to appear before U.K. lawmakers to

<p>In a presentation to AstraZeneca shareholders published

would create an industry leader with scale and operational
efficiency as well as a broader portfolio of experimental
medicines. AstraZeneca faces challenges as a standalone company,
including the declining revenue from products losing patent
protection, Pfizer said. </p>
<p>The offer proposed by Pfizer on May 2, which AstraZeneca
rejected as undervaluing the company, was based solely on public
information, Pfizer said today in a statement. Talks between the
companies would enable AstraZeneca''s management to provide
Pfizer with a better understanding of the company, Pfizer said. </p>

AstraZeneca can recommend,'' Pfizer said. ''Pfizer will continue
to be disciplined on price.'' </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read told the governors of Maryland and Delaware it''s too
soon to determine what effect the company''s bid for AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN) will have on jobs and manufacturing in their states. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca, the U.K.''s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
an offer of about $106 billion from Pfizer earlier this month,
saying the New York-based pharmaceutical company wasn''t offering
enough. Pfizer is planning to increase its bid, said people with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because
the information is private. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the biggest U.S.-based drugmaker, said it would
shift its legal address to the U.K. to reap tax benefits if the
deal goes through. Maryland Governor Martin O''Malley and
Delaware Governor Jack Markell wrote Read last week asking what
assurances he could give them for the 5,700 AstraZeneca workers
in their states. Pfizer already has pledged to keep at least
one-fifth of the companies'' research units and a substantial
manufacturing presence in the U.K. for at least five years. </p>
<p>''Because we are in the very early stages of our proposal
and are not in direct discussions, it is premature to speculate
on any specific impact this would have on jobs and facilities in
any given state,'' Read said in letters dated yesterday to the
two Democratic governors. ''I can tell you that Pfizer will
continue to perform operational, research and manufacturing
activity and will continue to have a significant number of
employees in the U.S.'' </p>
<p>Maryland''s U.S. congressional delegation sent its own
letter to Read yesterday expressing concern that there may be
job losses among AstraZeneca''s 3,000-plus employees in the
state. </p>
<h2>''Similar Assurances'' </h2>
<p>''As you evaluate your next steps, we ask you to extend
similar assurances to those you gave in the U.K. to the research
and development workforce in Maryland,'' wrote U.S. Senators
Barbara Mikulski and Benjamin Cardin and Representatives C.A. ''Dutch'' Ruppersberger, Chris Van Hollen, John Sarbanes and John Delaney. ''AstraZeneca and its MedImmune subsidiary have strong
presences in the state, and their workforces are highly skilled
and extremely effective.'' </p>
<p>Pfizer hasn''t had access to any proprietary information
from London-based AstraZeneca and the company still needs to
collect additional details on its business and prospects, Read
wrote to the two governors. He said Ken Cole, Pfizer''s senior
vice president of government relations, would schedule a meeting
to give them an update on the status of the discussions. </p>
<p>Markell said last week that updates on the status of the
discussions wouldn''t be enough to assuage his concerns. </p>
<p>''Keeping us informed is very different from the kind of
jobs they have committed to in the U.K.,'' Markell said. </p>

<p>AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) Chief Executive
Officer Pascal Soriot said a sale of the U.K. drugmaker is ''not
inevitable,'' increasing pressure on Pfizer Inc. to raise its
60.4 billion-pound ($101 billion) offer to kick-start talks. </p>
<p>''The price is really far from what we think the value of
the company is,'' Soriot said today in a telephone interview.
Because Pfizer is offering stock as part of the deal,
AstraZeneca would also need assurances about the future of the
new company before agreeing to negotiate, he said. </p>
<p>Soriot''s comments may increase speculation that New York-based Pfizer will take its offer directly to AstraZeneca
shareholders. The proposed takeover is facing skepticism from
U.K. lawmakers concerned about possible job cuts and Pfizer (PFE)''s
unwillingness to commit to preserving the workforce of the
country''s second-biggest drugmaker. Pfizer CEO Ian Read said it
was difficult to make more specific guarantees because
AstraZeneca hasn''t engaged in talks. </p>
<p>Read and Soriot both appeared before parliamentary
committees yesterday and today to answer questions about
consequences of the acquisition. With their testimony behind
them, the focus is shifting to Pfizer''s next move. Pfizer plans
to raise its offer, people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>A takeover could distract London-based AstraZeneca from
advancing its pipeline of experimental drugs, and even more so
were Pfizer to make a hostile bid, Soriot said. </p>
<h2>Drug Pipeline </h2>
<p>''The risks are exacerbated in a hostile situation,'' he
said in the interview. ''Any merger of this magnitude is
disruptive and that''s why we would want to discuss strategy, the
operating model and how we would go about merging these
companies, if we ever get to this.'' </p>
<p>Pfizer would try to protect AstraZeneca''s most valuable
products in a takeover and wouldn''t jeopardize the pipeline,
Read said to the Science and Technology committee today. </p>
<p>''There''s no truth that products of a critical nature would
be delayed getting to patients,'' Read said. ''If anything, we
would accelerate those products.'' </p>
<p>Pfizer urged AstraZeneca to engage in talks so that the two
companies could reach an agreement. </p>
<p>Pfizer contacted AstraZeneca last year to discuss a
purchase, and Chairman Leif Johansson and Soriot flew to New
York to meet with Pfizer, which made the initial bid of about
46.61 pounds a share, Soriot said. </p>
<h2>Lower Offer </h2>
<p>The subsequent cash-and-stock offer initially valued the
company at about 50 pounds a share and now has a value of 47.83
pounds a share. AstraZeneca rose 0.3 percent to 46.54 pounds at
the close of trading in London. </p>
<p>''The offer today is 48 pounds,'' Soriot said. ''The offer
is hardly different from the January price, but in the meantime,
our pipeline has progressed quite a lot. I don''t see why we
would accept today what we didn''t think was the right price in
January.'' </p>
<p>None of AstraZeneca''s shareholders have pressed him to
accept the current offer, said Soriot, who is on the company''s
board of directors. </p>
<p>''Of course, shareholders will tell us, but they don''t even
need to tell us, that if the appropriate offer was made, we
should consider the offer,'' he said. ''But we know this and we
certainly agree.'' </p>

<p>Three oil fields operated by Exxon
Mobil (XOM) Corp. in the Norwegian North Sea could be shut by a strike
if mediation with a union over pensions fails, cutting about
50,000 barrels of crude output a day. </p>
<p>The Safe union will order as many as 154 offshore-platform
workers to walk out if the talks fail, paralyzing production at
the Ringhorne, Jotun and Balder fields, the group''s leader
Hilde-Marit Rysst said by phone. Though the date for a possible
walkout has been set at June 16, a strike could start earlier or
later, depending on the date of the mediation, which has yet to
be scheduled, she said. </p>
<p>''We expect Exxon to take the hint,'' Rysst said. ''We
expect this to be dealt with either before or during the
mediation.'' </p>
<p>Safe and another oil-worker union broke off talks over
pensions last week, raising the risk of a strike two years after
the same issue triggered the longest ever labor action by
platform employees and reduced output by western Europe''s
biggest oil and gas producer. The government used its power to
stop the strike as a lockout by oil companies threatened to shut
production entirely. </p>
<p>The three Exxon fields, including satellite Ringhorne East,
produced about 50,000 barrels of oil a day in 2013, according to
figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. </p>
<p>Exxon has a 100 percent stake in the Balder and Ringhorne
fields, while it holds 77.4 percent in Ringhorne East, which is
tied in to the Balder and Jotun installations. Exxon holds 45
percent in Jotun, where other partners include Dana Petroleum
Plc with 45 percent. </p>
<p>Safe is targeting Exxon specifically because the company
has yet to implement an early-pension plan for 31 employees that
are members of the union, it said in a statement. </p>
<p>The pension plan isn''t an issue that should be discussed in
wage talks, Exxon spokesman Knut Riple said by phone, echoing
the position held by the organization representing employers,
the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association. Exxon declined to say
whether there was room to meet Safe''s demands, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
billion, bringing its purchases of the Latin American country''s
securities to almost $5 billion in the past week. </p>
<p>The bank will buy Argentine bonds due in 2015, 2017 and
2033, Madrid-based Repsol said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
The oil company agreed last week to sell new Argentine bonds due
in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. Those bonds have since
rallied 1.7 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol''s efforts to
reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
Under an agreement reached with the government earlier this
year, Repsol received bonds last week with a face value of $5.32
billion as compensation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has now bought almost all of that. The New York-based bank, which has already sold some of the Argentine bonds
received from the first purchase, is wagering that the remaining
holdings will gain in value, a person with direct knowledge of
the bank''s strategy said earlier this week. </p>
<p>Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Argentina''s bonds, rated seven levels below investment
grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most in
emerging markets, as the country took steps to repair ties with
international investors, including Repsol and the International
Monetary Fund. </p>
<h2>Riskiest Debt </h2>
<p>The country''s debt is still considered risky, with the cost
of five-year protection in the credit-default swaps market at
1,567 basis points, according to CMA, the highest in the world.
The country hasn''t sold bonds directly to international markets
since a $95 billion default in 2001, and it''s locked in a
dispute with some creditors in a case now before the U.S.
Supreme Court. </p>
<p>The transaction disclosed yesterday is expected to be
completed by May 16, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The sale included all of Repsol''s Argentine securities due
in 2017 and 2033 and all except $117 million of those due in
2015, known as Bodens, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Boden bonds maturing 2015 gained 0.20 cent to 97.65 cents
on the dollar at 9:31 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Repsol previously said it had $500 million of the 2017
securities, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds and $317 million of
the 2015 debt. All the securities are governed by Argentine law. </p>

<p>After a rough ride in front of the
U.K. Parliament''s Business Committee yesterday, Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read got gentler treatment from its
science and technology panel today over his plan to take over
AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) </p>
<p>There was a smaller audience for the hearing in London,
with empty seats compared with the standing-room-only session
the previous day. It was still a larger one than the committee
chairman, Andrew Miller, was used to. ''A lot of people are
interested,'' he commented, looking around. </p>
<p>Much of the questioning focused on how a merged company
would look. Read said it would ''enable us to be competitive.''
Testifying separately later for AstraZeneca, CEO Pascal Soriot
argued it was ''a little bit more complicated than putting two
pieces of paper together.'' </p>
<p>While neither committee has any formal influence over a
possible takeover, both show how much Pfizer is operating in an
atmosphere of anxiety about its offer of more than $100 billion,
which AstraZeneca has rebuffed. With European and local
elections next week, the bid has been pushed to the center of
British political debate and dominated Prime Minister David Cameron''s questions session in the House of Commons today for
the second week running. </p>
<p>There was little fresh argument today from either side.
Read said there was ''no truth'' in yesterday''s suggestion from
AstraZeneca that a merger would delay the development of life-saving drugs. Such work would be ''ring-fenced,'' he said. </p>
<h2>''Lose Momentum'' </h2>
<p>Soriot replied that mergers cause anxiety, with scientists
''not sure if their job will exist tomorrow.'' In such a
situation, he said, ''you can quickly lose momentum.'' </p>
<p>Jim Dowd, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party,
which has opposed the takeover, again raised Pfizer''s record in
Sweden, where it closed a research center after a takeover.
''Why do people say your word''s not to be trusted?'' he asked. </p>
<p>''People who talk to me don''t say my word''s not to be
trusted,'' Read replied. ''I''d like people to tell me a
commitment Pfizer hasn''t met.'' </p>
<p>Soriot was questioned by Miller about why a merger would be
more disruptive than his own plan to move research from
Manchester, in England''s northwest, to Cambridge in the east.
Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca''s vice president in charge of
development and a former Pfizer executive, said the two
companies had entirely different research structures. </p>
<p>Soriot declined to say whether the government should
intervene to block the takeover. ''I''m a biologist, I just try
to do my job,'' he said. ''I''m not a policy maker.'' </p>
<p>Last to appear before the panel was Science Minister David Willetts, who insisted he was optimistic about the future,
whatever the outcome. </p>
<h2>Sandwich Success </h2>
<p>Asked about Pfizer''s 2011 decision to close its Sandwich
plant in southeast England, he said it had worked out well
thanks to government intervention. </p>
<p>''There was a nightmare scenario where that would end up as
an empty building, with a padlock swinging in the wind,'' he
said. ''We''ve ended up instead with a discovery park with 40
tenants.'' </p>
<p>Willetts argued that while the government was ''pressing
very hard'' for Pfizer commitments, there was no need for
''national pessimism'' because Britain was known as a great
place for science. </p>
<p>''You''d be idiotic if you weren''t doing research and
development in the U.K. -- it''s a great place,'' Willetts told
the committee. </p>
<p>''We''re all proud,'' Tory lawmaker Sarah Newton replied. </p>

specifying the number of jobs. Read said the merger would result
in job cuts and a reduction in total RD spending. </p>

<p>Oil Search Ltd. (OSH), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s
partner in a $19 billion liquefied natural gas export project in
Papua New Guinea, expects shipments to Asia to start shortly
with the initial cargoes sold on the spot market. </p>
<p>The process to load the first LNG tanker has begun, with a
decision on when the ship will leave to be made over the next
few days, Managing Director Peter Botten said today by phone
from Port Moresby, the Pacific nation''s capital. The first gas
is expected to go to Tokyo Electric Power Co., he said. </p>
<p>''The project is a platform for a significant corporate
transformation for Oil Search,'' he said. On the timing for the
first ship to leave PNG, ''we''re being cautious about the date
but at the end of the day it will take place shortly,'' he said. </p>
<p>The gas project in Papua New Guinea will allow Oil Search
to fund expansion opportunities and pay higher dividends, the
Port Moresby-based company has said. Seven other LNG ventures
are going ahead in neighboring Australia to meet Asian demand. </p>
<p>Exxon, whose Australian project started producing LNG last
month and ahead of schedule, expects the Papua New Guinea
development to spur more foreign investment in the country,
Peter Graham, Exxon Mobil PNG Ltd.''s managing director, said
today in an e-mailed copy of a speech he gave in the Pacific
nation. The departure of the first LNG vessel, the Spirit of
Hela, is just days away, he said. </p>
<p>The first series of LNG cargoes from the project will be
sold at spot prices, with the development progressively moving
into contract deliveries, Oil Search''s Botten said. </p>
<h2>Spot Pricing </h2>
<p>''Spot pricing at the moment is pretty healthy,'' he said.
''That could change over the coming months, but we are seeing
good pricing achievable at spot.'' </p>
<p>Northeast Asia spot LNG was at $14.15 per million British
thermal units in the week ended May 5, the New York-based Energy
Intelligence Group said on the website of its World Gas
Intelligence publication. Prices earlier this year had more than
doubled since the Fukushima accident of March 2011, as Japanese
utilities rely on other fuel such as LNG to help replace lost
nuclear power. </p>
<p>Oil Search is also moving ahead with drilling in Iraq''s
Kurdistan region at its Taza oil project, which has attracted
interest from potential partners, Botten said. The company
expects to complete its evaluation of the size of that resource,
in which it has a 60 percent holding, by the second half of next
year, he said. </p>
<p>''There has been strong interest from a number of parties
to potentially join us in Taza,'' Botten said. ''Our view is we
would like to understand what the resource base is before
looking potentially at crystallizing any further value.'' </p>

Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. ''As the global business cycle
shifts into an expansion phase over the next few years we expect
commodity performance to improve.'' </p>
<p>Total returns for the enhanced index may be zero percent
over the next three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
months, according to the bank. It expected the gauge to drop 4
percent over 12 months in an April 13 note. </p>
<h2>Asset Market </h2>
<p>''We continue to believe the commodity super cycle is
over,'' Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president
in New York, said in a telephone interview on March 28. ''That
doesn''t mean that there is going to be an absence of seasonality
and cyclical turns in the asset market.'' </p>
<p>A Barclays survey published in an April 4 report showed 54
percent of investors planned to boost their stake in commodities
in the next 12 months versus 27 percent who did in the preceding
year, according to analysts led by Kevin Norrish. </p>
<p>There has been little clear directionality in commodity
markets over the past month, the Goldman analysts said. Tension
in Ukraine has supported corn and wheat even as global
agriculture stockpiles remain elevated, while weakness in the
Chinese property sector weighed on copper amid a seasonal pick-up in demand, they said. </p>
<p>As growth accelerates, supply and demand fundamentals in
base metals are expected to tighten by the middle of next year,
the bank said. It raised its six-month forecast for nickel to
$22,000 a metric ton from $20,000 amid supply disruptions at
Vale SA''s New Caledonia plant, Indonesia''s ban on ore exports
and tension between Russia and Ukraine. </p>
<p>Goldman kept its 12-month nickel target at $16,000 as
Chinese producers will probably increase blast furnace nickel
pig iron capacity in Indonesia over the next one to two years.
Nickel for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange has
climbed 49 percent this year to $20,728 by 4:33 p.m. in
Singapore today. </p>

<p>Nickel''s roller-coaster ride this
year isn''t over, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
expects the highest prices in two years to prompt expanded
capacity for smelting and discourage purchases by steelmakers. </p>
<p>Prices plunged 11 percent the previous two days, and
probably will fall 15 percent further in 12 months to $16,000 a
metric ton, Goldman forecasts. Nickel had surged this year
following a January ban on ore exports by Indonesia, the world''s
largest supplier from mines, and as threats increased for
economic sanctions against Russia, home to OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel, the biggest producer of refined metal. </p>
<p>Instead, exchange-tracked inventories rose, prompting some
investors to judge the rally was exaggerated. China will
''aggressively'' build blast-furnace capacity in Indonesia to
produce nickel pig iron, a low-grade alternative to refined
metal, Goldman said in a report dated May 14 and e-mailed
yesterday. Waning demand for the metal from makers of stainless
steel is another ''downside risk'' for prices, the bank said. </p>
<p>''High prices will incentivize a substantial build out of
blast furnace and other smelting capacity in Indonesia,''
Goldman analysts Roger Yuan, Max Layton and Jeffrey Currie wrote
in the report. ''Demand destruction could also help to balance
the global market in 2015 if the ban is not relaxed during the
smelter construction period.'' </p>
<p>Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.7 percent to $18,888 at 12:36 p.m. in Tokyo,
trimming its weekly drop to 5.1 percent, the biggest such loss
since February 2013. On May 13, the price reached $21,625, the
highest since February 2012. </p>
<h2>Processing Plants </h2>
<p>With construction taking about 12 months, the effects of
''de-bottlenecking'' will be seen in mid-2015, the Goldman
analysts wrote. Nine nickel-processing plants may be completed
this year in Indonesia, and as many as 40 more by 2017,
according to the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry. The
country imposed the ban in a bid to transform the mineral
industry away from raw-ore sales into higher-value processed
products. </p>
<p>This year''s rally could shrink profits in the stainless
steel industry, encouraging substitution, Goldman said. A 5
percent substitution would be equal to a reduction of as much as
150,000 tons of nickel demand, the bank estimates. </p>
<p>While Goldman expects prices to fall in 12 months, the bank
predicts a gain to $22,000 in three months and six months, as
the risk from demand destruction is in the ''medium term,'' the
analysts said. </p>
<h2>Steel Products </h2>
<p>Stainless-steel products are made with certain
specifications that can''t be altered, making it impossible to
replace nickel in the mix, Jason Martineau, the national sales
manager at Penn Stainless Steel Products Inc. in Quakertown,
Pennsylvania, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Nickel''s open interest, or the number of contracts yet to
be closed, liquidated or delivered, has surged for five straight
months to a record 319,422. The jump is ''reflecting the extreme
nature of change that the nickel market is facing with the
Indonesian export ban,'' David Wilson, an analyst at Citigroup
Inc. in London, said in a telephone interview this month. </p>
<p>Prices may top $30,000 in 2015, according to Citigroup,
which last year correctly predicted that Indonesia would
implement the export ban. </p>
<h2>China Demand </h2>
<p>Chinese stainless-steel demand is weak and few expect a
recovery in prices until next year, Credit Suisse Group AG said
in a report today. Most producers lost money in the first
quarter, according to the bank. </p>
<p>The price gap between locally produced nickel in China and
LME futures narrowed this week, indicating that further
increases in imports of the refined metal are likely, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. </p>
<p>Even as the U.S. and Europe threatened more sanctions after
Vladimir Putin''s incursion into Ukraine and the international
condemnation that followed, it didn''t put a dent in Russia''s
exports of raw materials. The country exported 51,600 tons of
nickel in the first quarter, similar to the same period last
year. </p>
<p>The plunge ''illustrates the extent to which speculation
was apparently responsible for driving up the nickel price,''
Daniel Briesemann, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt,
said in a report. ''The correction process could well continue
for the time being.'' </p>
<p>Copper in London was little changed at $6,878 a ton,
heading for a second weekly gain. The contract for delivery in
July on the Comex in New York was little changed at $3.146 a
pound. In Shanghai, futures for delivery in August slid 0.6
percent to 48,390 yuan ($7,765) a ton. </p>
<p>On the LME, zinc climbed, while lead and tin dropped.
Aluminum was little changed. </p>

<p>Banks are issuing lower-ranked bonds
and preferred securities in the U.S. at the fastest pace since
the financial crisis, capitalizing on yield-starved investors to
satisfy regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>Financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) are meeting demands to raise more capital by
selling $31.8 billion of subordinated debt and preferred shares
this year, with $22.7 billion in March and April alone,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of issuance is
the fastest since 2008. </p>
<p>Lenders need to sell the notes in part because new
regulations designed to make banks safer have rendered a
previously popular form -- called trust-preferred securities --
useless for capital purposes, ruling it must be replaced by
2016. Now that banks'' creditworthiness has improved, investors
are snapping up the offerings because they can pay more than one
percentage point of extra interest over senior bonds that rank
higher for repayment in a bankruptcy. </p>
<p>''From an investor perspective, it is incremental yield in
a historically low-rate environment,'' Pri de Silva, an analyst
at New York-based CreditSights Inc., said in a May 6 telephone
interview. ''The credit profiles of banks are a lot better now
than they were in the pre-crisis days.'' </p>
<h2>Losing Funding </h2>
<p>Wells Fargo in April sold $2 billion of 5.9 percent
perpetual securities after initially marketing the debt with a
higher coupon of as much as 6.125 percent, Bloomberg data show.
The notes offered interest payments of more than two percentage
points above the 3 percent senior notes due in 2021 that the San
Francisco-based bank sold in January. </p>
<p>Subordinated debt and preferred shares are replacing trust-preferred securities, known as TruPS, which were popular before
the crisis in part because interest payments were tax-deductible. About $149 billion were outstanding at the end of
2008, according to Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia data. </p>
<p>Banks could also count TruPS as Tier 1 capital because they
allowed issuers to stop paying interest and were supposed to act
as a buffer against potential losses. Lenders proved reluctant
to suspend payments during the crisis because those that did
risked losing other funding on concerns about their solvency. </p>
<h2>New Regulations </h2>
<p>U.S. regulators, implementing the international Basel III
accord and U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, have ruled that banks with
assets of more than $15 billion can''t count TruPS as Tier 1
capital anymore. They have until 2016 to replace the securities,
and common equity and preferred shares are the main types that
count as Tier 1 capital. Subordinated debt counts as Tier 2
capital, which banks are also required to maintain. </p>
<p>Attention in Europe has focused on additional Tier 1 notes,
a similar-level as preferred shares in the U.S., where issuance
has soared this year to $25.7 billion, Bloomberg data show. A
total of $36.5 billion of the debt is outstanding. </p>
<p>''Under the new rules, there is a space in the capital
structure that could be filled with subordinated debt, common
equity or preferred equity,'' de Silva said. The latter two
''are generally more expensive, so in order to meet that capital
need cost-effectively, they have been issuing subordinated
debt.'' </p>
<h2>Bank Safety </h2>
<p>The issuance comes as confidence in bank creditworthiness
improves. The average cost to protect against defaults by the
six-largest U.S. banks fell this week to the lowest level since
the end of 2007, according to credit-default swaps prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts, a gauge of the banks''
risk, are used to hedge against losses or to speculate on the
ability of companies to meet their obligations. </p>
<p>''Without question, the banks are more stable,'' said
Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Imperial Capital LLC.
''Even under the most extreme economic scenarios, banks should
have enough capital to withstand a shock, so investors are more
comfortable.'' </p>
<p>While subordinated debtholders may not be bailed out in
another crisis, ''people are not particularly worried about that
right now,'' said Kathleen Shanley, a New York-based analyst at
Gimme Credit LLC. </p>
<p>Emboldened by improving bank creditworthiness, investors
are eager to buy their higher-yielding debt after more than five
years of near-zero interest rates from the Fed. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is this year''s biggest bank issuer of the
securities, selling $3.9 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
The New York-based lender sold $1 billion of perpetual
securities on March 5 that pay interest of 6.125 percent for a
decade and then switch to a floating-rate coupon. The notes were
initially marketed with a coupon of as much as 6.25 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>They climbed about 0.1 cent to 101.3 cents on the dollar at
9:18 a.m. in New York, rising for the sixth consecutive day,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>''The way the credit markets have been running, almost
everything that comes is well oversubscribed,'' said Thomas Urano, a money manager at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory
Services Ltd., which oversees about $10 billion. ''The trends
have been favorable for banks to be able to place it.'' </p>

<p>U.K. lawmakers who questioned Pfizer
Inc. executives yesterday have written to the government urging
it to hold the company to account for promises over the future
of AstraZeneca Plc. </p>
<p>Parliament''s Science and Technology Committee said its
members want Pfizer to ''voluntarily strengthen and lengthen''
its promises to keep jobs and research and development in
Britain if the $101 billion proposed takeover goes ahead. </p>
<p>''Science is a long-term enterprise and it requires a
genuinely long-term commitment,'' committee chairman, Andrew
Miller, said in a May 14 letter to Science Minister David Willetts made public today. ''We are not yet convinced that 
this is what Pfizer is offering. The government must be willing
-- and, crucially, able -- to hold Pfizer to account if
necessary.'' </p>
<p>The panel questioned Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot along with other
executives and Willets. They focused on Pfizer''s pledges on RD
and jobs in Britain and the implications for the two companies''
drug pipelines. </p>
<p>The five-year limit on Pfizer''s commitments is not long
enough as the pharmaceutical industry ''measures progress by
decades rather than years,'' Miller said in the letter. He said
the committee wanted more detail on the promises as there could
still be cuts in research by a combined company in which
AstraZeneca would be the junior partner. </p>
<p>''Any threat to AstraZeneca''s research capacity must, to an
extent, be considered a threat to U.K. science,'' he said.
''Further, longer-term guarantees need to be obtained before we
can be confident of Pfizer''s commitment to the U.K.'' </p>
<p>The letter also questioned the wisdom of creating such a
large company when the trend in pharmaceuticals is for
''smaller, more agile operations.'' The merger of the two
companies would also cause disruption and uncertainty in both
companies, it said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) isn''t responsible
for alligators overrunning a rural dump site it owns in
Mississippi, the state supreme court ruled, because the global
oil explorer can''t control wild animals. </p>
<p>The family that felt menaced by the scaly reptiles
infesting a plot next door to their 35-acre property couldn''t
prove where the gators originated, Justice Ann Lamar wrote for
the majority in the court''s 5-4 decision yesterday. The family
had alleged the alligators were brought to the site from
Louisiana by a previous owner who later sold the land to Exxon,
according to the court document. </p>
<p>The Mississippi Supreme Court threw out the family''s 2008
lawsuit, citing a 1950 ruling that no one can be held
responsible for animals ''in a state of nature.'' </p>
<p>The court ruled the alligators -- which numbered 84 when
the state''s wildlife agency counted them in 2007 -- were wild
animals and, as such, not under Exxon''s control. Even if Exxon
had wanted to cull the congregation, it would have been
prevented by state law that designates alligators as a protected
species, making it illegal to hunt or disturb them, according to
the ruling. </p>
<p>The decision reinstates a lower-court ruling in Exxon''s
favor that had been reversed on appeal. </p>
<p>The state supreme court didn''t say what sort of waste was
disposed of at the dump. Exxon was the sole customer of the site
from 1984 to 2001, when the Irving, Texas-based company
purchased it from Rogers Rental  Landfill Company, according to
the court document. </p>
<h2>Horse Incident </h2>
<p>Tom and Consandra Christmas bought the adjacent tract in
2003, even after their real estate agent warned them his horse
had been injured in a suspected alligator encounter, the court
said in yesterday''s decision. The couple said they didn''t
realize the Exxon land was crawling with gators until 2007, when
Tom Christmas went to retrieve a dog that had wandered onto the
site. </p>
<p>Christmas testified that he lost two calves and one dog and
suspected that alligators were responsible, according to the
opinion. He said he was afraid to fish in the ponds due to the
alligators. The couple asked for monetary damages. </p>
<p>Four justices dissented from the ruling, citing testimony
that Exxon assigned staff to feed the 6- to-10 foot reptiles. </p>
<p>Dick Keil, an Exxon spokesman, said the company hadn''t yet
had an opportunity to peruse the ruling and declined to comment. </p>

<p>New Jersey awarded JPMorgan Chase (JPM) 
Co. and RBC Capital Markets $300 million of tax credits over 10
years after the companies pledged to create 1,900 new jobs in
Jersey City, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. </p>
<p>The Economic Development Authority approved annual grants
of $22.5 million for JPMorgan and $7.9 million for RBC at a
meeting today in Trenton. JPMorgan''s project would add 1,000
jobs and retain 2,612, while RBC''s would add 900 positions,
according to their applications. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, in its application, said it has been evaluating
the location of its expanding regional technology and operations
hub. Its options included consolidating multiple New Jersey
facilities into one in Jersey City or relocating most of those
operations to lower-cost locations in Delaware and Ohio. </p>
<p>RBC leases space in five locations in Manhattan with about
2,700 employees. With leases expiring at One Liberty Plaza and
the World Financial Center, it began evaluating options,
including renovating and expanding space in Jersey City and in
Minnesota. While the one-time cost of expanding would be greater
in Minnesota, annual operating costs would be higher in New
Jersey, according to its application. </p>
<p>''Financial services up in the Jersey City and Hoboken area
has always been a sweet spot for us,'' Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, the state''s top economic-development official, said in
an interview. ''It''s a perfect story: As New York''s financial-services sector looks for other places to go, they want to look
some place convenient to New York.'' </p>
<h2>High Earners </h2>
<p>The median salary of $120,000 for the covered positions at
JPMorgan, listed on its application, is more than triple New
Jersey''s median of $35,928, according to the Census Bureau. RBC
listed the median salary at $126,000. </p>
<p>Financial positions have become increasingly coveted as
states look to poach jobs from neighbors and even far-away
locales. Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, today said his
state is actively recruiting New York companies to move there. </p>
<p>''This would not impact the location of our U.S.
headquarters, which remains in lower Manhattan and will continue
to house the majority of our employees,'' RBC spokeswoman Elisa
Barsotti said in a statement. ''We are exploring an upgraded
location to relocate our data center from our ancillary location
at One Liberty Plaza and support function positions.'' </p>
<h2>Two Centuries </h2>
<p>The JPMorgan project is expected to bring a net benefit to
the state of $1.1 billion over the life of the package and will
enlarge the company''s space in Jersey City to more than 1
million square feet, officials said. </p>
<p>''We''ve invested in this community for nearly two
centuries, and this agreement only deepens that commitment for
the long term,'' JPMorgan Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames
said in a statement. </p>
<p>Guadagno, a Republican who serves as the state''s economic
development chief, said New Jersey has aggressively courted
financial-services jobs with a message to decision makers to
keep their New York address and move support jobs to New Jersey. </p>
<p>Jersey City, a community of 254,000 one stop from Manhattan
by train, has worked in the past decade to re-craft itself as
Wall Street West. Mayor Steven Fulop, 37, worked at Citigroup
Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., leaving after the 2001 World
Trade Center attacks to join the U.S. Marine Corps and serve in
Iraq. </p>
<h2>Lifting State </h2>
<p>''Jersey City is leading the state economy in terms of job
creation and is the driving force in lifting New Jersey out of
the recession,'' he said in a statement. </p>
<p>New Jersey has struggled to shake off the lingering effects
of the U.S. recession that ended in 2009. Governor Chris Christie''s administration said yesterday that the jobless rate
slid to 6.9 percent in April, the first time it has dipped under
7 percent since November 2008. The national level was 6.3
percent. </p>
<p>The state has regained 125,700 jobs, or about half of those
lost during the slump. Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers
Economic Advisory Service, said this month that the state isn''t
expected to recover all of them until 2018. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the biggest U.S. drugmaker, issued $4.5
billion and Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen AG raised $3.5
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Offerings of
about $41 billion were the most since $47.3 billion in the five
days ended April 25 and compare with a weekly average of $29.1
billion over the past 12 months. </p>
<p>Issuance rose as yields decreased amid signs U.S. economic
growth is faltering. Industrial production unexpectedly declined
in April and consumer confidence fell in May from a nine-month
high. David Tepper, founder of $20 billion hedge-fund firm
Appaloosa Management LP, said he''s nervous about markets as the
economy isn''t growing fast enough. </p>
<p>''The rates environment has changed a bit from where it was
a couple weeks ago, and that has provided a lot of companies the
opportunity to come to market,'' Jody Lurie, a corporate credit
analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said in
a telephone interview. ''It has let them access the debt market
more attractively.'' </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures widened by 1 basis point this
week to 170 basis points yesterday, up from an almost seven-year
low of 167 basis points on April 22, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate  High Yield Index. Yields
fell to 3.62 percent, the least since May 2013 and down from 3.7
percent on May 9. </p>
<h2>Pfizer, Volkswagen </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s sale included $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent, five-year notes that yielded 48 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds from the
deal, its first since last May, will be used by the New York-based company to repay debt. </p>
<p>Volkswagen, Europe''s largest automaker, issued debt in five
parts including $1.45 billion of 1.25 percent, three-year notes
with a relative yield of 47 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
The sale was its biggest dollar-denominated offering ever, the
data show. </p>
<p>Sales of investment-grade debentures rose to $32.2 billion
from $21.7 billion last week and compared with a weekly average
of $22.2 billion over the past 12 months, Bloomberg data show.
Offerings of speculative-grade bonds fell to $9 billion, from
$10.9 billion last week and compared with a weekly average of
$6.8 billion over the past year. </p>
<p>High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor''s. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has expanded
its workforce outside New York and San Francisco mainly to cut
costs. Its office in Irving, Texas, also aims to boost revenue. </p>
<p>The office, among the firm''s largest in the nation with
about 650 employees, hosted the investment bank''s annual
shareholders meeting today with Texas Governor Rick Perry giving
a speech. In addition to typical back-office functions such as
accounting and information security, the location houses a
commercial real estate lending group and is the headquarters for
the realty-management division. </p>
<p>That group is the descendant of a joint venture named
Archon that Goldman Sachs set up in 1991 with J.E. Robert Cos.
to buy distressed assets from the Resolution Trust Corp. after
the savings and loan crisis. The division, led by partner Tom Dowling, now sources deals and manages real estate investments
for the bank''s special-situations group and property funds. </p>
<p>While the division doesn''t have its own balance sheet, and
instead aids deals by the firm''s revenue-producing units, it
deployed about $7 billion in loans and investments last year,
according to a person with knowledge of its operations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs acquired all of Archon in 2000, and the
business operated as an independent subsidiary for years. It
purchased more than $1 billion of property in the U.S. in some
years, mostly for the bank''s Whitehall real estate funds,
according to a former employee. That activity dropped as the
U.S. property market plunged, and the last Whitehall fund was
raised in 2008. </p>
<h2>Dallas, Bangalore </h2>
<p>Irving, in Dallas''s shadow with a population of about
225,500, is home to businesses including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the
world''s second most valuable company, and CEC Entertainment
Inc., owner of the Chuck E. Cheese pizza chain. Goldman Sachs
also has an office in Dallas with several private wealth
management advisers and one investment banker, managing director
Peter Brundage. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in
November that a quarter of the firm''s employees were located
near Dallas, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Bangalore, India.
That''s increased from 10 percent in 2007 as the bank looks to
cut expenses, he said. The firm hosted its annual meeting in
Salt Lake City last year. </p>
<h2>Pay Approved </h2>
<p>Shareholders elected all of the firm''s nominees for the
board of directors, General Counsel Greg Palm said today,
announcing a preliminary count of the votes. About 83 percent of
votes approved the bank''s executive pay plan, he said. </p>
<p>Like Morgan Stanley''s annual meeting earlier this week,
today''s gathering featured no questions from shareholders and
lasted fewer than 40 minutes. About half the meeting was taken
up by Perry''s speech, which extolled the benefits of companies
moving to Texas. </p>
<p>Blankfein thanked Perry for his support of Goldman Sachs''s
businesses in the state. The CEO didn''t accept a shareholder''s
invitation to move the firm''s headquarters to Texas. </p>
<p>''I think there''s a lot of compelling reasons to move to
Texas and a lot of compelling reasons to stay where we are,
including Newton''s first law of inertia,'' Blankfein said in an
interview after the meeting. </p>
<p>Beyond the meeting, Goldman Sachs is trying to cement ties
to the area. Dina H. Powell, a partner who leads the firm''s
charitable efforts, announced this week the start of the bank''s
10,000 Small Businesses education and funding program in Dallas. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank is unlikely
to begin large-scale asset purchases to stimulate inflation and
such a plan would have limited effect as nations'' borrowing
costs are already low, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>''We doubt that a large-scale asset-purchase program would
have a meaningful impact on yields,'' Goldman Sachs analysts,
including London-based chief European economist Huw Pill, wrote
in a client report. ''With rates at such low levels, it is
unclear how attractive euro-area government yields will look for
investors.'' </p>
<p>ECB President Mario Draghi said on May 8 that the Governing
Council was ready to act at its meeting next month to boost the
currency bloc''s economy. He had previously indicated stimulus
measures being considered included quantitative easing. </p>
<p>With a rally in the region''s sovereign bonds leaving
borrowing costs in the most-indebted nations near record lows,
''the likelihood of a large-scale asset-purchase program remains
small,'' the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report, dated
yesterday. </p>
<p>The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was at 2.95 percent as
of 2:52 p.m. London time after falling to 2.83 percent
yesterday, the least since Bloomberg began collecting the data
in 1993. The rates on similar maturity Italian debt were at 3.05
percent, from a euro-era low of 2.89 percent yesterday. </p>
<p>Consumer prices in the euro area rose an annualized 0.7
percent in April, below half the central bank''s goal of just
under 2 percent for a seventh month. </p>

<p>The U.K. opposition Labour Party''s
business spokesman, Chuka Umunna, took sides in the battle for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), saying the company''s board was right to reject
Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s increased takeover offer. </p>
<p>In a sign of how a possible future Labour government led by
Ed Miliband would be more willing to intervene in takeovers,
Umunna characterized Pfizer as principally interested in
''financial engineering'' and cutting its tax bill, and said
this was a reason to block a takeover. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca shares plunged the most in more than 16 years
today after the company dismissed as too low a 69.4 billion-pound ($117 billion) offer that New York-based Pfizer said was
final. A deal would create the world''s biggest drugmaker. The
offer failed to account for the value of the U.K. company''s
pipeline of experimental medicines and presents risks for
shareholders, AstraZeneca said. </p>
<p>''It is welcome the AstraZeneca board has remained resolute
and sought to act in the best long-term interests of the company
and its vital work in developing new life-saving drugs,'' Umunna
said in an e-mailed statement. ''Pfizer has said today that it
will not seek to launch a hostile bid and must not renege on
this promise.'' </p>
<p>Until May 16, Labour restricted itself to calling for an
examination of whether a takeover would be in the public
interest. Then, in an interview with Bloomberg Television,
Umunna said that if he became business secretary after the May
2015 election and a deal were still going through, he would look
for a way to block it. </p>
<h2>Government Stance </h2>
<p>Vince Cable, who''s business secretary in the current
coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, said today the
government is keeping its options open on the Pfizer offer.
Prime Minister David Cameron said it was a matter for the
companies to resolve themselves and the government should be
neutral. The premier said last week he wants ''further
assurances'' from Pfizer that a deal wouldn''t hit jobs and
research in the U.K. </p>
<p>Miliband said in 2011 Labour should distinguish between
''predator'' businesses and ''producers.'' Umunna later tried to
soften this, saying it didn''t mean identifying companies as good
or bad. </p>

<p>France''s privacy watchdog said more
citizens are asking for help getting their personal information
removed from search engines such as those run by Google Inc. (GOOG) and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), less than a week after the European Union''s top
court ruled on a ''right to be forgotten'' online. </p>
<p>France''s CNIL and Europe''s other privacy watchdogs will
discuss in a June meeting how they can enforce the ruling,
President Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin said today in a conference.
The EU''s top court last week said citizens may ask search-engine
owners to remove information and request that a court or data-protection authority step in if a company doesn''t comply. </p>
<p>''We''ve already received complaints citing the court
decision,'' Falque-Pierrotin said. ''The idea that companies
like Google are too powerful to respect European rules -- we''ve
proven that idea wrong. It''s prompting citizen reactions.'' </p>
<p>While it''s too early to say how the court ruling will be
enforced, more users may ask CNIL to intervene, Falque-Pierrotin
said. Complaints relating to the ''right to be forgotten'' made
up about a third of the requests received last year, she said.
CNIL dealt with 5,640 complaints and 92,351 broader requests
last year, according to its annual report. </p>
<p>CNIL has asked the French government to increase the
maximum amount it can fine for privacy violations, which
currently run from 150,000 euros ($206,000) to 300,000 euros for
repeated offenses, Falque-Pierrotin said. </p>
<p>In the past year, Google has faced privacy problems in
Germany and Italy. France''s CNIL has been among the region''s
more vocal authorities in getting international Internet players
to respect local and European privacy laws. </p>
<h2>Lead Role </h2>
<p>The French watchdog took the lead role for EU authorities
debating measures directed at companies that violate privacy
laws. It fined Google 150,000 euros in January for failing to
give people enough details about how and why it uses their
personal data. </p>
<p>Privacy regulators want to play a bigger role beyond
punitive intervention, she said. CNIL and other European
regulators are in talks with Google on a possible accord over
its privacy policy, with details to be announced ''before
summer,'' she said. </p>

2011, prior to the central bank''s most recent easing cycle. </p>
<p>''In an environment where domestic demand is already
fragile and significant risks remain in the handover from mining
led economic growth, this budget does pose a risk to the near
term outlook,'' Goldman''s Melbourne-based Chief Australia
Economist Toohey wrote in a note to clients dated May 14. ''A
return to the grind of fiscal repair looms large.'' </p>
<p>Walters and Gibbs say the budget cuts and resulting hit to
consumer confidence from the measures, a stubbornly high
currency, rising unemployment as growth remains below trend and
incomplete transition from mining investment will prompt another
move. </p>
<p>''Gee, that''s positive for the Aussie dollar,'' Gibbs cited
foreign investors as saying after the budget release forecast
narrowing deficits, meaning the elevated Aussie will remain a
drag on growth. ''It''s the tightening of conditions leading to
probably another round of job losses and pressure on domestic
demand'' that will drive the RBA to cut again, he said. </p>
<h2>Aussie Dollar </h2>
<p>The Australian dollar has firmed since Stevens switched to
a neutral bias in February, curbing exporters'' competitiveness.
It traded at 92.38 U.S. cents at 12:16 p.m. in Sydney. Swaps
traders see the cash rate moving 3 basis points higher in a
year, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index, down from 8
points yesterday and from 3 points in cuts on March 3. </p>
<p>Even those economists who have abandoned rate-cut calls
recently and now see the central bank remaining on hold for an
extended period don''t necessarily believe it should be. </p>
<p>''It doesn''t reflect any change of view on our part about
the outlook,'' said Merrill Lynch''s Chief Australia Economist
Saul Eslake, who on May 16 switched his rate call to on hold.
''Dropping it doesn''t mean we''ve become a lot more optimistic or
less pessimistic about the economy, just that we now accept the
Reserve Bank is reading things differently from us and it''s
their view that counts, not ours.'' </p>
<h2>''Sharp Fall'' </h2>
<p>Westpac''s Bill Evans, who called the most recent easing
cycle, abandoned his prediction of further rate cuts in March
after stronger-than-expected jobs data and said the central bank
was indicating a ''high hurdle'' for easier policy. </p>
<p>''The sharp fall in the index is clearly indicating an
unfavorable response to the recent federal budget,'' Evans said
today of the sentiment slump. ''Respondents were particularly
concerned about the impact of the budget on their own
finances.'' </p>
<p>NAB''s Alan Oster announced he had dropped his reduction
call on May 12. </p>
<p>Low rates have spurred property prices. House and apartment
prices in the largest cities climbed 11.5 percent in April from
a year earlier, led by a 16.7 percent increase in Sydney. </p>
<h2>Export Boom </h2>
<p>Government data released this month showed Australia''s
exports to China, its biggest trading partner, climbed to a
record A$9.5 billion ($8.8 billion) in March, even as the trade
surplus narrowed to A$731 million for the month. </p>
<p>The RBA maintained its steady view in minutes of the May 6
meeting released yesterday in Sydney. ''Overall growth in coming
quarters was likely to be below trend given expected slower
growth in exports, the decline in mining investment and the
planned fiscal consolidation,'' it said. ''The current
accommodative stance of policy was likely to be appropriate for
some time yet.'' </p>
<p>The nation''s Secretary to the Treasury Martin Parkinson, in
his traditional speech after the budget, said non-mining
industries need to grow more rapidly to keep unemployment low. </p>
<p>''We are seeing some positive signs, particularly in the
household sector,'' he said in Sydney yesterday. ''But with
businesses in the non-resources sectors continuing to exercise
caution in their investment and hiring decisions, the forward
indicators suggest that it will be at least another year or two
before strong broad-based growth takes hold.'' </p>
<p>Evans, when he made his call for the RBA to cut rates in
July 2011, was Australia''s loneliest forecaster at the time. Yet
within a few weeks markets swung to his view. In 2009,
JPMorgan''s Walters was alone in picking Stevens''s decision to
become the first Group of 20 policy maker to boost rates after
the height of the global recession. </p>
<p>''Our job is to forecast what the Reserve Bank will do, not
preach as to what they should do,'' Eslake said. </p>

<p>Jay Rasulo, seen as one of two
possible successors to Walt Disney (DIS) Co. Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger, invokes his company''s well-known characters when
discussing his role as chief financial officer. </p>
<p>''I gotta have a big heart, I gotta love everybody, I''ve
gotta reach out to the world as Woody does in our stories,''
Rasulo said today at the Bloomberg CFO Conference when asked why
he sometimes compares himself to the ''Toy Story'' hero. ''But
on the other hand I''m still counting the money like Scrooge
McDuck.'' </p>
<p>Rasulo said Disney often faces decisions that cost in the
short run and yet build stronger ties with consumers, such as
policing foreign makers of licensed goods. He became finance
chief in 2009, after leading Disney''s parks for about seven
years, when Iger asked him and then-CFO Tom Staggs to switch
jobs. Both men are seen as possible successors when Iger steps
down in 2016. Rasulo didn''t address that issue today. </p>
<p>''It has been an incredible learning and broadening
experience, certainly for me, I''m sure on both sides of it,''
said Rasulo, 58. ''In this role you get to experience the
breadth of the Walt Disney Co.'' </p>
<p>Rasulo, a Columbia University economics graduate who
started out with the company in strategic planning in 1986, said
part of Disney''s success lies in how it deploys capital. </p>
<p>About 65 percent is reinvested in the businesses, such as
theme-park rides, movies or sports rights for the ESPN network,
among the largest contributors to Disney profit, he said. The
company also pays dividends, buys back stock, and seeks
acquisitions that add to its character library or provide new
distribution outlets. </p>
<h2>Cost-Cutting </h2>
<p>Last year, Rasulo, who also has master''s degrees from the
University of Chicago, supervised a company-wide cost-cutting
initiative, designed to make sure the company was adapting to
technological changes in its businesses. That led to hundreds
firings across several divisions. </p>
<p>In March, Rasulo''s boss appointed him to oversee Disney''s
$500 million acquisition of Maker Studios, the money-losing
provider of online short-form videos. </p>
<p>Rasulo often speaks to Disney employees about career
planning, including his own. </p>
<p>''I advise people, just do what''s right in front of you and
good things happen rather than trying to be Machiavellian in
planning the next five steps of your career,'' Rasulo said. ''It
will never turn out the way you think.'' </p>
<p>Rasulo sits about 40 feet from Iger and the two chat all
the time, along with communicating by e-mail, and when traveling
together, he said. </p>
<p>''There''s not a lot of formality to Bob,'' Rasulo said.
''He''s a very free and easy, casual interactor.'' </p>
<h2>28 Years </h2>
<p>When Rasulo joined Disney 28 years ago, the company had
about $2 billion in annual sales and earned most of its profit
from theme parks. The studio, established by Walt Disney in
1923, was struggling, the Disney Channel had fewer than 3
million subscribers, and Rasulo described the consumer products
business as ''fledgling.'' </p>
<p>''We used to get this check from Europe, we never knew what
it was for,'' Rasulo recalled. ''Presumably it was from people
selling consumer products. We never audited anybody.'' </p>
<p>Today, Disney is the world''s largest entertainment company,
with more than $45 billion in sales. More than half its profit
comes from television, including ESPN, the Disney channels and
the ABC television network. </p>
<p>In his free time, Rasulo said he likes to fly fish, a hobby
that provides lessons for life. </p>
<p>''The reason I love fly fishing is because you focus right
on the here and now, and put away all other distractions,''
Rasulo said. ''Otherwise you basically just get cold and wet and
come home with no fish.'' </p>

about $100 billion, or about 25 percent of the total held at the
year''s start, Barclays estimated in February. The GSCI index
rose 3.5 percent this year. </p>
<p>Goldman received inquiries from potential buyers in
November after the London Metal Exchange proposed new rules on
how storage facilities operate, a person briefed on the matter
said at the time. The LME postponed implementation after the
plan, intended to ease aluminum bottlenecks at warehouses, was

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc.-backed
company and American Tower Corp. (AMT) are among those seeking to buy
Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)''s mobile-phone towers in Brazil, according to
people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Cell Site Solutions Cessao de Infraestruturas SA
and American Tower are among potential buyers that have sent
letters of interest to the Italian carrier, said the people,
asking not to be named because the talks are private. Telecom
Italia, which is working with Morgan Stanley to sell the assets,
values them at about 750 million euros ($1 billion), one of the
people said. </p>
<p>Brazilian mobile carriers are farming out the ownership and
maintenance of towers, then leasing space on them, to focus on
adding network capacity as demand for wireless Internet access
increases. Telecom Italia, which is selling about 6,000 towers
in Brazil, has also disposed of other assets and scrapped
dividends to cut debt. </p>
<p>''Wireless-tower divestitures are a necessary tactic for
all phone carriers, which need to recover cash and focus
investments on stronger fiber, fixed-line networks,'' said
Massimiliano Trovato, a media and telecommunications analyst at
Bruno Leoni Institute, an economic think tank. ''This move makes
even more sense for Telecom Italia since I remain convinced the
Italian operator sooner or later will exit the Brazilian market,
and this is a potential first step in that direction.'' </p>
<h2>Expanding Investments </h2>
<p>Telecom Italia, based in Milan, said last week it expects
non-binding offers for the Brazil towers by the end of May. The
company owns a total of about 8,500 towers through its Tim
Participacoes SA (TIMP3) unit. Tim Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo Abreu
said the tower sale process is ongoing, and there aren''t plans
to sell the company itself. </p>
<p>''There is no offer of any kind to buy Tim,'' Abreu said to
reporters in Brasilia today. ''There has been no solicitation
and there are no negotiations.'' </p>
<p>Goldman and JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Gavea Investimentos
Ltda., the Brazilian hedge-fund firm founded by former central
bank president Arminio Fraga, unveiled tower-investment company
Cell Site Solutions last year. Tower companies such as SBA
Communications Corp. (SBAC) and Boston-based American Tower have also
been expanding in the past two years. </p>
<p>Representatives of Telecom Italia, Cell Site Solutions,
American Tower and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. </p>
<p>Telecom Italia shares fell 1.6 percent to 84 cents at the
close in Milan, giving the company a market value of 15.2
billion euros. The shares briefly recovered their losses after
Bloomberg''s report on the interest in the towers before
declining again. </p>
<h2>New Towers </h2>
<p>SBA, based in Boca Raton, Florida, agreed in December to
pay 1.53 billion reais ($693 million) for 2,007 Oi SA towers, or
about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than twice the price it
paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi towers, according to
Wells Fargo  Co. </p>
<p>''SBA would be interested in evaluating the potential to
increase its Brazilian portfolio through additional MA,'' the
company said in an e-mailed response to questions. </p>
<p>Additional capacity is also needed as demand for mobile
services soars, with one tower builder estimating that 6,680 new
units are required this year alone. Goldman, Patria
Investimentos SA -- a firm that includes Blackstone Group LP
among its investors -- and at least six other private-equity
firms are backing five local tower builders to benefit from the
rising demand. </p>

<p>Sweden''s Finance Minister Anders Borg
is urging Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to give up its efforts to take over
drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, arguing the deal would destroy
research and development jobs in Europe. </p>
<p>Borg, who is battling rising unemployment in Sweden ahead
of September elections, criticized the U.S. firm for adopting
what he described as an ''aggressive strategy'' to buy
AstraZeneca, which employs 5,900 people in Sweden. </p>
<p>''It would be very wise of Pfizer to consider to withdraw
from this process,'' he said yesterday in an interview in
Stockholm. </p>
<p>Borg last week urged shareholders to reject Pfizer''s bid,
which he characterized as a ''hostile process'' in part aimed at
cutting Pfizer''s tax burden. AstraZeneca, formed in a 1999
merger between Astra AB and Zeneca Plc, yesterday rejected a
sweetened $117 billion offer from Pfizer. </p>
<p>The takeover bid is likely to fail because British law
prohibits the U.S. firm from improving its offer after declaring
it final, according to people familiar with the transaction.
Pfizer is expected to announce that it will not make a formal
bid by May 26, which is the deadline for the U.S. firm to make
an official offer, one of the people said. </p>
<h2>''Very Aggressive'' </h2>
<p>''It''s a very aggressive and raw strategy that Pfizer has
and I think that undermines Pfizer''s credibility in the long-term,'' Borg said. ''It may create risks for them. We''re very
worried about what this will mean to research and development in
Europe, in the U.K. and Sweden.'' </p>

<p>Argentina is benefiting from the
experience of the world''s largest oil companies as it develops
shale deposits in a bid to gain energy independence, said a
board member of a provincial oil company. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s Argentina unit and provincial-run Gas 
Petroleo del Neuquen SA, or GYP, yesterday reported their
largest shale discovery in southern Argentina''s Vaca Muerta
formation. The Bajo del Choique X-2 horizontal well is producing
770 barrels of oil a day in its first flow test, Exxon said in a
statement. Exxon operates the block and has an 85 percent stake
while GyP owns the remaining 15 percent. </p>
<p>''We are betting on developing the horizontal technology
along with Exxon because we are convinced that is the way to get
greater output despite being costly,'' said GyP Director Gustavo Nagel in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg questions. </p>
<p>Vaca Muerta''s oil production more than tripled in the first
quarter from a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg Industries, boosted primarily by a joint venture
between YPF SA (YPF), Argentina''s largest company, and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
YPF''s output from the Loma Campana area in Vaca Muerta rose to
12,800 barrels a day from 4,200 barrels after investing $1.2
billion in a pilot year with San Ramon, California-based
Chevron. </p>
<h2>Energy Deficit </h2>
<p>GyP has partnerships with 18 additional foreign oil
companies to develop shale in Vaca Muerta, Nagel said. Vaca
Muerta is a mostly untapped 30,000 square-kilometer (11,600
square-mile) region, which holds at least 23 billion barrels of
oil, according to a survey by Ryder Scott. Vaca Muerta has 350
wells, of which 160 are commercially producing, Nagel said. </p>
<p>Argentina will need $300 billion to develop Vaca Muerta
over a six-year period to make the country energy independent
starting in 2020 and keep it producing for as many as 40 years,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) Argentine unit President Juan Aranguren
said on Dec. 10. Argentina posted a record $6.1 billion energy
deficit last year after 20 years of surpluses through 2010. </p>
<p>Shell tripled its investment budget to $500 million this
year for Vaca Muerta, the world''s second-largest shale gas
formation and the world''s fourth-largest shale oil deposit. </p>
<p>Exxon, Shell and Chevron are the three biggest oil
companies by market value. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, said it''s working with China''s government to
evaluate its Windows 8 operating system after the software was
excluded from a government purchasing order. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which continues to provide Windows 7 to
government customers, was ''surprised'' to learn Windows 8 was
shut out of China''s purchase of energy-efficient computers,
Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said in an
e-mailed response to questions. The company learned of the
decision in a notice from the China Central Government
Procurement Center yesterday, she said. </p>
<p>The notice from the procurement center gave no reason for
excluding Windows 8, yet China''s official Xinhua News Agency
yesterday reported it was ''a move to ensure computer security''
after the company ended support for Windows XP. Microsoft
stopped support for XP, which has a 70 percent market share in
China, on April 8, Xinhua reported. </p>
<p>''Microsoft has been working proactively with the Central
Government Procurement Center and other government agencies
through the evaluation process to ensure that our products and
services meet all government procurement requirements,'' Li
said. ''At the same time we are working on the Windows 8
evaluation with relevant government agencies.'' </p>
<p>Part of the reason for the exclusion order is concerns over
Internet safety, Xinhua reported, without citing anyone. The
news agency said that China must be careful after reports of
U.S. spying. Microsoft and other software makers have been
contending with customer concerns following leaks about the U.S.
National Security Agency''s data-collection programs. </p>
<h2>Hacker Threat </h2>
<p>Windows XP users in China are concerned about the threat
from hacker attacks following the end of Microsoft support for
the XP system, Xinhua reported. China''s Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology said last month the end of Windows XP
support brought risks to the nation''s communications networks. </p>
<p>Microsoft has encouraged XP users to upgrade to Windows 7
and Windows 8. </p>
<p>China''s decision to exclude Windows 8 was announced in a
statement dated May 16. Procurements are often not immediately
posted online. </p>
<p>Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), the world''s largest maker of personal
computers, will see no impact from China excluding Microsoft''s
Windows 8 from government procurement as the company has other
software options for customers, Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said on a conference call today. Lenovo, which has its
headquarters in Beijing and Morrisville, North Carolina, has no
plan to make its own operating system, Yang said. </p>
<p>The U.S. indicted five Chinese military officials for
allegedly hacking into the computer networks of U.S. companies
to steal trade secrets. </p>
<p>Following the indictments, China''s Defense Ministry accused
the U.S. of ''hypocrisy and double standards on the issue of
network security.'' China also suspended its involvement in a
cybersecurity working group with the U.S. </p>

<p>Depending on whether you listen to
Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan Chase  Co., the imposition of
martial law in Thailand will either send the baht tumbling to
levels last seen in 2006 or put an end to its losses. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley yesterday reiterated its prediction that the
baht will weaken 12 percent by year-end to 37 per dollar as the
political crisis pushes the country toward a recession. JPMorgan
was more optimistic, confirming an overweight recommendation on
the currency, amid bets the army''s move will help end months of
street protests. </p>
<p>The disparity of opinion on the outlook for the currency
mirrors the mixed signals coming from Thailand''s economy. While
an official report this week showed gross domestic product
shrank in the first quarter, the nation has the biggest
cumulative trade surplus for more than three years, and exports
are rising. </p>
<p>''The market tends to be complacent about Thai politics,
it''s not the first coup,'' Paul McNamara, a London-based
investment director at GAM U.K. Ltd., which manages $129 billion
in assets, said yesterday by e-mail. ''It''s not just noise, the
chances of something terrible happening are rising. But until we
see convincing spill-over to the real economy, I think the
fallout will be limited.'' </p>
<h2>Paring Decline </h2>
<p>The baht is the only one of 12 Asian currencies tracked by
Bloomberg to drop versus the dollar this month, slipping 0.4
percent. It has retreated 4.3 percent since the anti-government
protests started at the end of October, the worst performance in
the region. </p>
<p>The currency fell as much as 0.6 percent yesterday to
32.660 per dollar, before paring its retreat amid speculation of
intervention by the central bank. It climbed 0.1 percent today
to 32.493 as of 1:06 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>''Our target of 37 is very achievable,'' Geoffrey Kendrick,
Morgan Stanley''s head of Asia currency and interest-rate
strategy in Hong Kong, said yesterday in a phone interview.
''The economy is in a massive hole. Thailand is certainly going
to have a technical recession in the first half.'' </p>
<p>Thailand''s army chief declared martial law yesterday,
telling local television that the move wasn''t a coup and would
help end the street protests that led to Yingluck Shinawatra''s
removal as prime minister this month. </p>
<p>The violence has driven away tourists and hurt the economy,
with a May 19 report showing GDP shrank 2.1 percent in the first
quarter, after growing a revised 0.1 percent in the previous
three-month period. </p>
<h2>Airport Shutdown </h2>
<p>Thailand''s last quarter-on-quarter recession was in 2009,
when anti-government protesters shut down Bangkok''s main
international airport for more than a week at the height of the
global financial meltdown. The baht tumbled 17 percent against
the dollar in the five quarters ending March 2009, the sharpest
decline since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. </p>
<p>Money poured out of the country yesterday. Overseas
investors sold $256 million more Thai shares than they bought,
the heaviest net sales since November, and pulled $61 million
from bonds, exchange data show. Global funds have withdrawn
about $1 billion from local debt and equities in May, snapping
two months of inflows. </p>
<p>Others are optimistic about the baht''s prospects. </p>
<p>''I''m not worried about the baht, I''m looking for levels to
buy,'' Rajeev De Mello, who manages $10 billion as the head of
Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., said
by phone yesterday from Singapore. ''The main support of the
baht in the past has really been the trade side. On the investor
side, the people who wanted to get out of Thailand have already
gotten out.'' </p>
<h2>''Baht Appreciation'' </h2>
<p>Westpac Banking Corp., Australia''s second-biggest lender by
market value, expects the baht to strengthen about 3 percent by
year-end to 31.4 per dollar. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 24 strategists is for a decline to 33. </p>
<p>''Foreigners are excessively underweight baht assets, and
covering this positioning on any reduction of political risk
would trigger baht appreciation,'' Daniel Hui, the head of
emerging-Asia currency strategy at JPMorgan in Singapore, wrote
yesterday in a report. </p>
<p>Yesterday marked the army''s most direct involvement in
Thailand''s politics since 2006, when then-premier Thaksin
Shinawatra, Yingluck''s brother, was removed in a coup. </p>
<h2>Surviving Coups </h2>
<p>Thailand has had 11 coups since direct rule by kings ended
in 1932, and the currency has ridden out most of them. Martial
law was last invoked in April 2010, and a month later the baht
had risen 0.3 percent against the dollar, the best performance
in Asia. It was little changed in September 2006, when Thaksin
was ousted. </p>
<p>The country has been without a fully functioning government
since December, when Yingluck called snap elections in a bid to
ease the unrest. To Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
that will lead to a drop in the baht of about 4 percent this
year to 34 per dollar. </p>
<p>''Politics definitely is the biggest risk at present, and
there are negative effects on the economy,'' Khoon Goh, a
Singapore-based senior strategist at ANZ, said in a May 19 phone
interview. ''We''ve already seen portfolio outflows. The risk is
that foreign-direct investment slows down sharply if investor
concern over the political situation intensifies.'' </p>

<p>The global seaborne iron ore glut
will probably be 21 percent bigger than forecast next year as
steel production slows in China, the world''s largest consumer,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The surplus will reach 175 million metric tons in 2015,
compared with a prior prediction of 145 million tons, Goldman
Sachs said in a report dated yesterday. The bank estimates that
output will exceed demand by 72 million tons and prices will
average $109 a ton in 2014, before dropping to $80 next year. </p>
<p>Iron ore has slumped 27 percent this year as economic
growth in China slowed and mining companies from BHP Billiton
Ltd. to Rio Tinto Group in Australia boosted output, shifting
the global seaborne market into a glut. Banks from Standard
Chartered Plc to Credit Suisse Group AG say more Chinese steel
mills will go bankrupt and hurt consumption. </p>
<p>''The market is no longer in balance but in the early stage
of a structural surplus,'' analysts including Christian Lelong
wrote in the report. ''China will not act as the safety valve in
an oversupplied market for much longer.'' </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin fell 1 percent to $97.50 a dry ton yesterday,
the lowest level since September 2012, according to data from
The Steel Index Ltd. The decline in iron ore, Australia''s
biggest export earner, pulled the country''s dollar today to the
weakest level since May 2. </p>
<h2>Record Stockpiles </h2>
<p>While the last decline below $100 in 2012 spurred buyers to
rebuild inventories, boosting prices to about $159 in four
months, this time around expectations of ample supply will
encourage users to keep reserves at a minimum, said Goldman. </p>
<p>''We believe the current downturn could trigger another
destocking cycle of similar scale,'' Lelong, Daniel Quigley and
Amber Cai wrote. ''But the eventual rebound will be far less
robust than previously.'' </p>
<p>Reduced Chinese imports will also offset any impact of
expected supply disruptions in India and a possible strike at
Australia''s Port Hedland, the world''s largest bulk-export
terminal, the bank said. Maritime Union of Australia, which
represents tugboat deckhands at the port, approved unlimited
work stoppages of 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days on May 12. </p>
<p>BHP, the third-largest exporter, won''t be able to make up
shipments lost during a strike, the company''s iron ore president
Jimmy Wilson said in a statement today. The union said May 12 it
hadn''t decided whether to take action. </p>
<h2>Port Strike </h2>
<p>''Disruption in Port Hedland would be costly for the
producers affected and would drive a temporary price rally, but
it would ultimately be washed out by global market
fundamentals,'' Goldman said. </p>
<p>China''s inventory at ports rose 1.8 percent to a record
112.55 million tons in the week to May 16 from a week earlier,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. As
much as 40 percent of inventory at ports may be tied up in
financing purposes, according to Daiwa Securities Group Inc. </p>
<p>''A meaningful amount of iron ore stockpiles in China is
tied to financing, which means an unwinding can be excessive,''
said Doug King, the London-based chief investment officer of the
Merchant Commodity Fund, which returned 15.4 percent from
January to April partly from iron ore. ''Real demand will be
dampened when those stockpiles are sold into the market.'' </p>
<p>China''s economy that creates demand for 69 percent of the
world''s seaborne ore will grow by 7.3 percent this year, the
lowest since 1990, according to a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The Australian dollar touched 92.16 U.S. cents today. It
dropped 0.9 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since March 19. </p>
<p>''Changes in spot iron ore prices affect the currency far
more quickly these days,'' Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange
strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a client note dated yesterday.
''That''s largely due to the demise of annual fixed price iron
ore contracts, and the subsequent shift to quarterly, then to
monthly, then to spot pricing.'' </p>
<p>Shares of BHP fell 0.8 percent to A$37.17 ($34.32) at the
close in Sydney today and Rio, the second-biggest exporter,

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) plan to
keep operating in Russia after President Vladimir Putin''s
government backed away from punishing the payments firms in
response to U.S. sanctions. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard executives met with senior officials
including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and came
away ''very positive'' about finding a solution, Visa''s country
chief, Andrew Torre, said at the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum yesterday. </p>
<p>Russia will consider easing new measures requiring the two
U.S. companies to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to
continue operating, MasterCard Russia chief Ilya Riaby said. At
stake is an estimated $403 million in combined annual revenue
for the two payments networks as well as their foothold in a
market that''s shifting from cash to electronic payments. </p>
<p>After Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at
four Russian banks in response to U.S. sanctions over the crisis
in Ukraine, Russia passed a law creating its own national
payments system and imposing rules for foreign firms that
include fines for denying services and a mandatory security
deposit starting in July. </p>
<p>The government is committed to working with Visa and
MasterCard, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV. </p>
<p>Moiseev said the U.S. companies agreed to create a
''nationally important'' operator within 18 months. Under the
new law, such operators are exempt from having to post
collateral with the central bank, he said. </p>
<h2>More Talks </h2>
<p>The companies have not yet reached a formal agreement and
''look forward to continuing the dialog,'' Paul Cohen, a
spokesman for Visa, said in a statement. MasterCard''s
suggestions on changes to the new law were ''regarded
favorably'' and the company expects a response soon, according
to Seth Eisen, a spokesman. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard have said they get about 2 percent of
their annual revenue from Russia, or about $167 million last
year for MasterCard and $236 million for Visa. The two control
about 95 percent of the payments market in Russia, according to
Morgan Stanley. Visa is based in Foster City, California, and
runs the world''s biggest payments network. MasterCard is based
in Purchase, New York. </p>
<p>The bigger concern may not be the loss of revenue, ''but
the risk of losing the opportunity for domestic processing in
Russia,'' Darrin Peller, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a
research note, adding that 80 percent of transactions in Russia
are done using cash. ''There will likely be a middle ground
reached.'' </p>

boom, according to state-owned oil company YPF SA. </p>

is negotiating a binding deal with YPF to develop an area in
southwestern Argentina''s Vaca Muerta shale formation after

area the size of Belgium that holds at least 23 billion barrels
of oil, according to a survey by Ryder Scott, in a bid to become
energy independent. YPF''s output from the Loma Campana area in
Vaca Muerta rose to 12,800 barrels a day from 4,200 after
investing $1.2 billion in a pilot year with Chevron Corp. </p>
<p>The company, which President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
expropriated from Spain''s Repsol SA in 2012, is also in
conversations with Petroleos Mexicanos, Capurro said, without
disclosing the subject of the talks. Mexico is pushing through
legislation to open up its oil and gas fields, including shale,
to foreign investment. </p>
<h2>New Find </h2>
<p>Petronas''s preliminary deal is to develop a 187-square
kilometer (72 square-mile) area called La Amarga Chica in
Neuquen province, northwest of Loma Campana, where the Chevron
pilot may become a $16 billion project. </p>
<p>YPF announced this week its first unconventional discovery
outside of Vaca Muerta at El Trebol in the D-129 formation. </p>
<p>Capurro called for changes to Argentina''s 1967 hydrocarbons
law to cater to offshore and unconventional operations and
greater environmental protection demands. </p>
<p>''The company thinks some rules of the game should be
revised to include shale,'' she said. </p>

Rosneft, Total SA (FP)''s stake in gas producer OAO Novatek (NVTK) and a gas
project operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) </p>

construction and banking. </p>

undermined a joint venture. </p>
<p>Decura IM Investments LLP is seeking to terminate a 2012
contract under which it would provide ''managed accounts'' and
''algorithmic strategies'' for UBS customers, according to the
bank''s documents at a pre-trial hearing in London today. </p>
<p>UBS has undertaken a ''drastic downscaling and disposal of

a judge as he sought an accelerated trial in the dispute.
London-based Decura argues the bank is now ''unable to market
the services we are providing.'' </p>
<p>UBS, Switzerland''s biggest lender, has cut about 4,000 jobs
since late 2012 and is exiting most debt-trading activities

Hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from the agreement
are at risk and Decura is in a ''position of limbo'' until the
issue is resolved, Fulton said. </p>

<p>Squire Sanders and Patton Boggs LLP
are merging to create a new law firm that will be among the 25
biggest in the world with about 1,600 lawyers in 21 countries. </p>
<p>The announcement that the new firm will be called Squire
Patton Boggs comes two weeks after Patton Boggs agreed to pay
$15 million to settle Chevron Corp.''s (CVX) lawsuit over the firm''s
involvement in obtaining a $9.5 billion judgment against the oil
company in Ecuador. </p>
<p>The combination is part of a trend of ''continuing robust
merger activity'' in 2014 after a ''banner year'' in 2013,
according to data compiled by law firm consultancy Altman Weil.
The organization reported 88 law firm mergers last year, up from
60 in both 2011 and 2012. </p>
<p>The merger will transform the brand of Squire Sanders
''from being an Ohio firm to being a Washington, D.C., firm,''
law firm consultant Peter Zeughauser said yesterday. While
Patton Boggs is known as a ''lobby shop,'' it also has a strong
practice advising Middle Eastern sovereign funds in their
investments around the globe, he said. </p>
<p>Revenue and profitability at Patton Boggs, which has about
400 lawyers, had declined consistently over the past five years,
Zeughauser said. Even after a restructuring improved its
prospects, it ''needed to combine with a stronger firm to be
sustainable,'' he said. </p>
<h2>Failed Efforts </h2>
<p>Zeughauser said he advised Patton Boggs on the
restructuring and in other previous failed merger efforts,
though he hasn''t consulted the firm during the past year. </p>
<p>Jim Maiwurm, Squire Sanders Chairman and Global Chief
Executive Officer, said yesterday in a statement that the
combination with Patton Boggs will create the ''''go-to firm for
public policy work.'''' The merger is expected to take effect by
June 1, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Patton Boggs specializes in government relations, lobbying
and regulatory practices, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Ed Newberry, Managing Partner of Patton Boggs, said Squire
Sanders''s financial markets expertise in North and South
America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East made it attractive.
Squire Sanders has about 1,300 lawyers in 39 offices across 19
countries. </p>
<p>Patton Boggs entertained other offers. It announced in
December that merger talks were called off with Locke Lord LLP. </p>
<p>Dentons, a 2,600-lawyer international firm formed a year
ago through the combination of Salans LLP, Fraser Milner
Casgrain LLP and SNR Denton, said last month that it was
interested in expanding further through a combination with
Patton Boggs. Dentons expressed interest after Patton Boggs had
already announced merger discussions with Squire Sanders in
February. </p>
<h2>Ecuador Case </h2>
<p>In the Ecuador case, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in
New York on March 4 ruled that an attorney from another firm,
Steven Donziger, had resorted to bribery and fraud in procuring
the Chevron judgment in Ecuador that held the oil company liable
for polluting the Amazon rain forest. Donziger is appealing the
decision. </p>
<p>Kaplan''s ruling ''''includes a number of factual findings
about matters which would have materially affected our firm''s
decision to become involved and stay involved as counsel,''
Patton Boggs said in a statement. ''Patton Boggs regrets its
involvement in this matter.'' </p>
<p>On April 29, Kaplan threw out Patton Boggs''s claim that San
Ramon, California-based Chevron maliciously sued the firm for
pursuing collection of the judgment. The law firm, which
provided as much as $15 million to finance the Ecuador
litigation, had sought access to $21.8 million Chevron had been
ordered to post as a bond. </p>
<p>The Chevron case is Patton Boggs LLP v. Chevron Corp., 12-cv-09176, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger,
11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>A 63 percent rally in Qiwi Plc (QIWI) in
less than four weeks may be just the beginning for the
electronic-payment processor as Russia eases restrictions that
could have crimped its revenue, according to OAO Gazprombank and
InvestCafe LLC. </p>
<p>Qiwi''s American depositary receipts have surged to $43.85
on May 23 from a nine-month low of $26.89 on April 28. The ADRs
plunged earlier this year as Russia moved to tighten control of
payment systems and imposed rules that could increase the cost
of doing business for U.S.-based credit card companies including
Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index increased 4.5 percent in its fourth consecutive weekly
gain. </p>
<p>Lawmakers dropped some provisions that could have limited
online payments as they approved anti-money laundering
legislation last month. Visa and MasterCard said on May 23 that
they''ll keep working in Russia after the government agreed to
consider easing demands made on them after the U.S. imposed
sanctions linked to the country''s standoff with Ukraine. </p>
<p>''Traders are shifting their focus to Qiwi''s fundamentals
as the credit card companies'' decision to remain in Russia
signals an improving business environment,'' Sergey Vasin, an
analyst at Gazprombank, said by phone from Moscow on May 23.
''The trend is positive for Qiwi through the end of the year.'' </p>
<p>Vasin said he has begun covering Qiwi and expects to issue
a recommendation and target price next month. </p>
<p>The company works in partnership with Visa, providing co-branded accounts marketed under the name Visa Qiwi Wallet. Those
accounts increased increased 20 percent in the first quarter to
15.6 million, Qiwi Chief Executive Officer Sergey Solonin said
on a May 21 conference call with analysts. </p>
<h2>Growth Forecast </h2>
<p>After Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at
four Russian banks in March as the U.S. imposed sanctions,
Russia passed a law creating its own national payment system and
imposing rules for foreign companies that include fining them
for denying services. Solonin said Qiwi doesn''t expect any of
the new legislation to have much of an impact on its business in
Russia. </p>
<p>Qiwi, which had more than tripled after it was listed in
New York a year ago, expects net profit to increase between 27
percent and 29 percent in 2014, according to its May 21 earnings
statement. Adjusted net revenue increased 46 percent in the
first quarter to 1.9 billion rubles ($55.6 million). </p>
<p>''Investors are focusing on Qiwi''s improved growth forecast
for this year and away from the fading geopolitical risks,''
Timur Nigmatullin, an analyst at Moscow-based research firm
InvestCafe, said by phone on May 22. He raised Qiwi to buy from
hold on May 23, setting a price target at $52.37 per share. </p>
<h2>Analyst Ratings </h2>
<p>Qiwi''s 14-day relative strength index reached a nine-month
high of 80.5 on May 22. When a security''s RSI rises above 70,
it''s a signal to some analysts that it is poised to fall. The
stock has seven buy ratings and three holds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 28 percent advance in the five days
ended May 23 was the biggest weekly gain since its initial
public offering a year ago. </p>
<p>The Bloomberg index of the most-traded Russian stocks in
the U.S. increased to 88.75 on May 23 to complete the longest
streak of weekly gains in 10 months. OAO RusHydro, the renewable
energy producer, led the advance, jumping 19 percent. </p>
<p>United Co. Rusal (486), a Moscow-based aluminum producer,
was little changed at HK$3.24 in Hong Kong trading as of
11:25 a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2
percent. </p>
<h2>Poroshenko Wins </h2>
<p>Russian stocks had gained as concern eased that Ukraine''s
presidential election would be disrupted. President Vladimir
Putin said on May 23 in St. Petersburg that Russia will work
with the next Ukrainian president, even though the vote won''t
meet international standards, after saying he''s withdrawing
troops from the border. </p>
<p>Ukrainians elected billionaire Petro Poroshenko as
president, two exit polls showed yesterday, handing him the task
of stemming deadly separatist violence that''s threatening to rip
the former Soviet republic apart. </p>
<p>Poroshenko garnered more than half of the vote, avoiding a
runoff with as much as 57.3 percent support, according to the
surveys. Ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko came second out of
21 candidates with 12-13 percent backing, the polls showed.
While most in Ukraine''s easternmost regions didn''t vote,
Poroshenko''s success was welcomed in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>The drama in Ukraine will weigh on investors'' risk appetite
and shareholders in Qiwi are exposed to regulatory changes,
according to David Riedel, founder of the Riedel Research Group
Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>''Russian equities will continue to be shunned by most
investors other than the bravest and most adventurous,'' he said
by e-mail on May 23. ''I would be cautious on the enthusiasm for
Qiwi payment system as the regulations and control there can be
implemented very quickly if that avenue is being used to
transfer money to avoid scrutiny.'' </p>
<p>The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, jumped 5.4 percent last
week to $25.72, the highest level since February. </p>

<p>Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) hired Standard
Chartered Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and NCB Capital to market
its debut Islamic bond as companies in the oil-rich kingdom
increasingly tap the debt market for funds. </p>
<p>The banks will manage the potential sale under a 5-billion
riyal ($1.3 billion) sukuk program, Saudi Telecom said in a
statement today. The size of the private local placement will
depend on market conditions, it said in the statement. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabian companies are diversifying their financing
sources as the Arab world''s biggest economy spends billions of
dollars to develop infrastructure. Banque Saudi Fransi, the
lender part owned by Credit Agricole SA, is planning to raise
about 2 billion riyals to bolster its capital base, while Saudi
airliner Flynas is considering a sukuk sale to fund its

the preferred option for many companies, others have started to
venture into sales abroad. Saudi Electricity Co., (SECO) the state-owned utility, last month raised $2.5 billion from sale of two-part sukuk to international investors. </p>
<p>Saudi Telecom''s sukuk plan comes after Mohammad Al
Kharashi, the governor of the state-run Public Pension Agency,
earlier this month said he welcomed more sukuk offerings. The
power utility, majority owned by the government, reported a 54
percent increase in first-quarter profit. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), operator of a $19
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, is
talking to customers in Asia about selling cargoes on the spot
market as demand traditionally rises over summer. </p>
<p>Exxon expects an LNG cargo from the project every four to
six days, Decie Autin, Exxon''s project executive in Papua New
Guinea, said today in a a phone interview. The next shipment
will go to CPC Corp. of Taiwan, she said. The first one has left
the country headed to Tokyo Electric Power Co. in Japan, Exxon
said earlier today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>''There are a few other customers we''re talking to, and
Asia is clearly the focus,'' she said. ''We''ll sell on the spot
market until we''re comfortable we''ve got reliable, sustainable
sales. We''re not seeing any issues with placing our cargoes.'' </p>
<p>Spot LNG prices in northeast Asia fell to $13.50 a million
British thermal units, their lowest since October 2012, in the
week to May 19, according to World Gas Intelligence assessments
of cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks published May 21.
They reached $19.70 in February. </p>
<p>Exxon and its partners, including Oil Search Ltd. (OSH) and
Santos Ltd. (STO), are considering expansion of the development to tap
Asian demand. Exxon is focused on exploration to underpin an
expansion rather than trying to obtain gas from InterOil Corp.''s
Elk and Antelope gas discoveries, Autin said. </p>
<p>Santos rose 1.1 percent to close at A$14.36 in Sydney
trading, while Oil Search climbed 1.1 percent to A$9.40. </p>
<h2>Second Development </h2>
<p>Total SA and InterOil want to build a second export
development in Papua New Guinea based on gas from the Elk and
Antelope fields. Oil Search also agreed earlier this year to
acquire part of those fields. </p>
<p>''It looks like they have a deal, it looks like they''re
building a greenfield facility, and to my knowledge, that''s a
go, and something that''s happening,'' Autin said. ''I don''t know
of a lot of opportunity there'' for Exxon, she said. </p>
<p>Oil Search has contested Total''s agreement to buy part of
InterOil''s project, saying the deal breached its pre-emptive
rights. The possibility of Oil Search blocking Total sparked
speculation Exxon could enter the Elk and Antelope license. </p>
<p>The LNG market will remain tight until at least 2015,
according to the International Energy Agency. Spot and short-term LNG trade increased to 27.4 percent of the total last year
from 25 percent in 2012, according to the International Group of
Liquefied Natural Gas Importers. </p>
<p>Importers typically purchase more spot shipments in June
through September to meet increased power needs amid hotter
weather during summer. </p>
<p>The Exxon project is expected to reach full capacity in
four to six weeks, Autin said. The development has long-term
contracts with four major customers, Tokyo Electric Power, CPC,
Osaka Gas Co. and China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. </p>

<p>The Chinese government is reviewing whether domestic banks'' reliance on high-end servers from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) compromises the nation''s financial security, people familiar with the matter said, in an escalation of the dispute with the U.S. over spying claims. </p> <p>Government agencies, including the People''s Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance, are asking banks to remove the IBM servers and replace them with a local brand as part of a trial program, said the four people, who asked not to be identified because the review hasn''t been made public. </p> <p>The review comes a week after American prosecutors indicted five Chinese military officers for allegedly hacking into the computers of U.S. companies and stealing secrets, while former contractor Edward Snowden''s revelations last June of a National Security Agency spying program already hurt U.S. technology sales in China. Last week, China''s government said it will vet technology companies operating in the country, while the Financial Times reported May 25 that China ordered state-owned companies to cut ties with U.S. consulting firms. </p> <p>Related:</p>

<p>Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman

selling a pre-crisis mortgage security that lost value, said he
won''t file an appeal in the civil case. </p>
<p>''While my lawyers have advised me there are strong grounds
to appeal, I prefer to move forward with my education and close
this difficult chapter of my life,'' Tourre said in a statement
today. ''I look forward to finishing my Ph.D. in economics and
to making meaningful contributions to my field.'' </p>
<p>Tourre, 35, was found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at
which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claimed he
intentionally misled investors in a subprime-mortgage vehicle
called Abacus 2007-AC1. In March, he was ordered to pay more
than $825,000 in penalties. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was one of the government''s most prominent
efforts to fix responsibility for the housing market crash,
which helped precipitate the worst economic downturn since the
1930s. Critics have faulted the SEC for not doing more to police
the abuses that helped lead to the crisis or to pursue top
financial executives they say are responsible. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which paid Tourre''s legal fees, settled SEC
claims over the Abacus transaction in July 2010 for $550
million, a record at the time. No senior Goldman Sachs
executives were questioned in Tourre''s trial. </p>

<p>The biggest proposed deal in drug
industry history is dead. Or, dead for now. </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the largest U.S. drugmaker, yesterday
abandoned its effort to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) for 69.4 billion
pounds ($117 billion), saying the public bid rejected by its
London-based competitor represented ''full value.'' AstraZeneca
said it welcomed ''the opportunity to continue building on the
momentum we have already demonstrated.'' </p>
<p>Under U.K. takeover rules, Pfizer had until 5 p.m. London
time yesterday to make a firm offer. The regulations now require
a cooling-off period of at least three months before talks can
restart, giving both drugmakers time to decide what happens
next. Pfizer hopes AstraZeneca''s investors will push the
company''s board to come to the table, while AstraZeneca faces
pressure to deliver on its promises of a productive roster of
experimental medicines. </p>
<p>''There is quite a decent chance actually that there will
be a deal later this year, most likely I would say after three
months,'' Erik Hultgard, an analyst with Nordea Bank AB in
Stockholm, said in a telephone interview. ''There was quite a
small spread between what the board said they could accept and
what Pfizer actually wanted to pay. There are likely
shareholders on both sides that want this to happen.'' </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world''s
biggest investment bank by revenue, said a pair of wrong-way
bets made by clients at the start of the year is partly to blame
for Wall Street''s trading slowdown. </p>
<p>Some of the biggest wagers included shorting Japan''s
currency and betting that U.S. interest rates would rise more
steeply than those in Europe, according to Daniel Pinto, head of
the New York-based firm''s corporate and investment bank. </p>
<p>''Neither of those trades paid,'' Pinto, 51, said today at
an investor conference in New York. ''Essentially you start the
year with the wrong momentum, where you lose money at the very
beginning, and you ended up with probably a lower risk appetite
than you would have otherwise.'' </p>
<p>JPMorgan warned investors earlier this month that second-quarter markets revenue will probably drop about 20 percent from
a year earlier, after a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income,
currencies and commodities trading in the first quarter. That
would amount to JPMorgan''s worst first half for trading since
the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Another reason for the lackluster results is reduced
volatility, which has dropped to the lowest in 10 to 15 years
for rates, currencies and credit trading, Pinto said. </p>
<p>When ''the market doesn''t move, it''s really difficult to
monetize your flows,'' Pinto said. ''It makes the market more
competitive and margins really tighten because it costs you very
little to provide liquidity, so you provide a lot.'' </p>
<h2>Episodic Trades </h2>
<p>Clients appear to be hesitating in placing the larger
hedges that typically happen earlier in the year, he said. </p>
<p>''You have episodic trades, big hedges, big corporate
trades, that happen along the year,'' Pinto said. ''Particularly
in the first and part of the second, the amount of those trades,
even though the pipeline is very healthy, they haven''t happened.
It looks like they are going to happen later in the year, and
that is a big swing factor.'' </p>
<p>The industry''s shrinking results are being caused more by
low volatility and monetary policy than by new regulations, he
said, adding that investment banks may have to wait until 2016
before revenue improves. </p>
<p>''Probably we will have a flattish year next year, and then
probably with all that we talked about before -- markets will
grow, normalization of interest rates -- all that will sort of
bring revenues up again,'' Pinto said. ''It''s probably a bit
more down the line.'' </p>

<p>Goldman said last week it was exploring the sale of Metro,
joining JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley in cutting back
in commodities as Mercuria Energy Trading SA and Gunvor Group
Ltd. expand. The Federal Reserve has said it''s considering new
limits on trading and warehousing of physical commodities. </p>
<p>''The uncertainty of the regulatory landscape, particularly
in the U.S., means you''re going to see more non-financial, more
lightly or not regulated companies perhaps like Whelan moving
into the warehousing space,'' said Robin Bhar, an analyst at
Societe Generale SA in London. ''There will always be companies
looking at warehousing.'' </p>
<p>Bill Whelan, the president of the company, founded Metro
International Trade Services LLC with Ed Schulak in 1991. Metro
stores most of the aluminum in Detroit LME-licensed warehouses,
according to exchange data. The wait time to withdraw aluminum
from Metro''s warehouses in the city was 683 days, or 98 weeks,
at the end of April, according to an LME report this month. </p>
<p>Whelan Metals may expand beyond Detroit, Whelan said last
year. He wasn''t available for comment today and didn''t return an
e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>BTG Pactual Commodities Warehousing LLC was approved by the
LME to store metals in Detroit in April. Scale Distribution Ltd.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., whose
contrarian call late last year that the yen would rally in the
first half of 2014 has proved prescient, is sticking with its
forecast for a second-half rout. </p>
<p>Tohru Sasaki, the company''s Tokyo-based head of Japan rates
and currency research, said he senses Prime Minister Shinzo Abe''s structural reforms, which include corporate tax cuts, will
bear fruit. That''s the last of the so-called three arrows of
Abe''s road map for breaking the economy free from persistent
deflation and slow growth. The first two are fiscal stimulus and
record monetary easing. </p>
<p>''Global investors are obviously very disappointed in
Abenomics right now, but the third arrow is still moving
forward,'' Sasaki, 46, said by phone on May 23. ''If the
Japanese economy is getting stronger, then Japanese investors
become more confident in the future and take more risks, and
invest more in foreign assets,'' weakening the yen, he said. </p>
<p>Betting on a lower yen has been one of the biggest losing
trades in global markets this year, along with calls for higher
bond yields, as the global economy failed to strengthen as much
as forecast and geopolitical events including Ukraine''s conflict
with Russia flared. The yen -- a haven in times of crisis --
gained 3.1 percent against 10 developed-nation peers tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes this year, while the
dollar and euro have fallen. </p>
<h2>Third Arrow </h2>
<p>The yen failed to extend its almost 17 percent slide last
year versus the basket as the Bank of Japan refrained from
printing more money to expand 70 trillion yen ($687 billion)  of
annual asset purchases and as the impact of government spending
waned. </p>
<p>Abe has also been perceived as slow to reveal his
structural reforms. The nation''s economy will probably expand
1.35 percent this year, compared with 2.5 percent in the U.S.,
surveys by Bloomberg show. The Wall Street Journal quoted BOJ
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda as saying there are limits to the
central bank''s ability to spur growth. </p>
<p>''There has been considerable disappointment in the third
arrow,'' Steven Englander, the New York-based global head of
Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy at Citigroup Inc., wrote
in a note to clients on May 23. </p>
<p>The fell 0.2 percent today to 102.11 per dollar at 12:27
p.m. in New York, compared with this year''s weakest level of
105.44 on Jan. 2. In December, when the median estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for the currency to
depreciate to 104 by the end of June, Sasaki said it would
actually reach 100. </p>
<h2>Easing Expectations </h2>
<p>Sasaki, a former central-bank official, now expects the
currency to finish the year at 106, similar to his forecast in
December and a level unseen since October 2008. Analysts in the
latest Bloomberg survey see it dropping to 107 by Dec. 31. </p>
<p>There''s still a chance the yen will extend gains in coming
weeks, according to Sasaki. While 44 percent of 32 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the BOJ will add to stimulus in
July, including those at JPMorgan, Sasaki said that will have
little power to weaken the currency. Instead, he sees potential
for a lack of action to boost the yen to 97. </p>
<p>''Whatever comes from the BOJ will not be as powerful as
last year, so markets will probably be disappointed, and will be
forced to unwind yen short positions,'' said Sasaki, who worked
at the central bank from 1992 to 2003. ''Even if the BOJ does
something in July, it''s already priced in.'' A short position is
a bet an asset will decline. </p>
<h2>Abe''s Ninja </h2>
<p>The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a drop in the yen versus the dollar
compared with those on a gain -- known as net shorts -- fell to
53,787 on May 20, the least since November 2012, figures from
the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
The net shorts reached 143,822 on Dec. 24. </p>
<p>The BOJ has been buying about 7 trillion yen of sovereign
debt a month since Kuroda started the so-called quantitative and
qualitative easing program in April last year, and refrained
from adding stimulus in a meeting on May 21. </p>
<p>Sasaki expects Abe to make progress on structural reforms,
such as a proposed corporate tax cut and relaxing regulations
for business, that he says will, over time, boost corporate
profits and improve investors'' risk appetite. </p>
<p>''The first and second arrows were big injections of pain
killer but the third arrow is like acupuncture, with many small
needles,'' Sasaki said. ''It takes time and it''s hard to see the
effects but eventually it improves your health.'' </p>
<p>That''s a view shared by Societe Generale SA, which sees the
yen weakening to 110 per dollar in a year as Abe''s changes take
hold and the Federal Reserve reduces stimulus. </p>
<p>''The third arrow is like a ninja -- you cannot see it but
it''s there,'' Takuji Aida, the French bank''s chief economist in
Tokyo, said in phone interview today. ''The growth strategy is
something you will feel the impact of very gradually, over a
long period of time.'' </p>

<p>Saudi Arabia is urging lenders to
boost capital reserves, which are already above those of global
peers including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc, to
support lending growth. </p>
<p>Lending in the oil-rich country is expected to increase
more than 10 percent a year until 2017, according to Arqaam
Capital Ltd. National Commercial Bank this year raised $1.3
billion through bonds, making it the strongest start to a year
for bank issuance since 2007, as Central Bank Governor Fahad Al Mubarak seeks higher capital ratios. </p>
<p>''Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency continues to encourage
Saudi banks to build up higher levels of capital adequacy,'' Al
Mubarak said May 21 in response to e-mailed questions. ''Banks
should anticipate that current and future economic growth will
lead to increased credit demand.'' </p>
<p>The kingdom''s economy is expanding about four times faster
than the euro area as the government spends $130 billion to
build new homes and boost the non-oil economy. Banque Saudi
Fransi is planning to raise about 2 billion riyals ($533
million) to bolster Tier 2 capital, used to cushion against
future losses, two people familiar with the matter said May 13. </p>
<h2>''Well Capitalized'' </h2>
<p>Saudi British Bank, part-owned by HSBC Holdings Plc, and
Saudi Hollandi Bank have also sold Islamic bonds in the past six
months, taking advantage of lower funding costs. </p>
<p>The average yield on Middle East sukuk declined 53 basis
points this year to 4.11 percent, the lowest since June,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. </p>
<p>Some banks ''will raise more capital this year to fully
comply with new regulatory requirements,'' Jamal Al Kishi, chief
executive officer of Deutsche Bank Securities Saudi Arabia, said
yesterday. ''Broadly speaking, banks in Saudi Arabia are well
capitalized.'' </p>
<p>Jeddah-based Bank Al Jazira had a capital ratio of 15
percent at the end of 2013, the lowest of the 11 publicly traded
banks in the kingdom, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That was still higher than JPMorgan Chase''s at 14.5 percent and
Citigroup Inc. (C)''s at 12.3 percent at the end of March. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is following Sweden, which already imposes
some of the world''s strictest bank standards. The Swedish
Financial Services Authority will raise capital requirements
further in order to protect taxpayers from future financial
crises, it said earlier this month. </p>
<p>''SAMA always prefers more capital and is a strong
proponent of countercyclical measures,'' David Dew, managing
director at Saudi British Bank, said in an interview in Riyadh
on May 5. ''Saudi banks are among the strongest in the world.'' </p>

<p>Here''s the problem facing hedge funds investing in the stock market this year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief equity strategist David Kostin: the sand box they like to play in has gotten a lot smaller. </p> <p>For example, equity hedge fund managers tend to have about a quarter of their investments in consumer-discretionary stocks, Kostin told Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg Television''s ''Market Makers'' program today. The dispersion of returns within that group is too small for managers on the prowl for stocks to buy or short, Kostin said. </p> <p>''The opportunity set, the sand box, the swimming pool is very, very small,'' Kostin said. ''It''s been a very difficult year from a stock-selection perspective.'' </p> <p>The biggest gain among consumer-discretionary stocks over the past three months has been a 10 percent advance in Nordstrom Inc. and the biggest loss has been a 17 percent drop in International Game Technology.

<p>Ian Hannam, once a top JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) mining adviser, lost his bid to overturn a market-abuse
fine from British regulators in a win for the watchdog as it
attempts to go after senior bankers. </p>
<p>Hannam''s messages with a potential client ''were not in the
proper course of the exercise of his employment,'' the court
said in a ruling published yesterday, upholding the reasoning
behind a 450,000-pound ($752,000) fine levied by the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority two years ago. The amount of the
penalty will be reviewed separately, the court said. </p>
<p>Hannam, global chairman of equity capital markets at the
time, e-mailed a potential customer in 2008 with details of a
bid for his client, Heritage Oil Plc, as well as news of an oil
find. The Financial Conduct Authority, then known as the
Financial Services Authority, deemed the exchanges insider
information and fined the banker in April 2012 for market abuse,
prompting him to step down from his post in JPMorgan''s Cazenove
unit. </p>
<p>''I am obviously disappointed that the tribunal has
rejected the explanation as to why the two e-mails sent in the
course of advising and assisting my client did not contravene
the rules,'' Hannam, 58, said in an e-mailed statement. ''I was
indeed acting only in the interests of my client.'' </p>
<p>The tribunal asked Hannam and the regulator to submit
arguments on how much the fine should be to determine whether or
not to change the amount of the penalty, the FCA said in an e-mailed statement today in response to the decision. Hannam can
appeal the court''s ruling. </p>
<h2>''Looking Good'' </h2>
<p>Hannam e-mailed Dr. Ashti Hawrami, the Kurdish Regional
Government''s natural resources minister, in September and
October 2008 informing him of a potential third party bid for
Heritage Oil and positive developments in the company''s oil
exploration. The e-mails were sent when Hawrami might have been
interested in taking a stake in Heritage, qualifying the
disclosures as inside information, according to the FCA''s
penalty notice from 2012. </p>
<p>''I thought I would update you on discussions that have
been going on with a potential acquirer,'' Hannam told Hawrami
in the September e-mail, according to the judgment. ''I believe
that the offer will come in in the current difficult market
conditions at ''3.50 - ''4.00 per share. I am not trying to force
your hand, just wanted to make you aware of what is happening.'' </p>
<p>Hannam sent Hawrami another e-mail in October to tell him
Tony Buckingham, Heritage''s chief executive officer, has ''just
found oil and it is looking good.'' </p>
<p>It wasn''t necessary to disclose the information to Hawrami
to keep the Kurdish official interested in Heritage, and Hannam
''gave no consideration to whether he could properly disclose
the information which he did,'' according to the judgment. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said low volatility and interest rates that are
holding in tight ranges have resulted in an ''abnormal'' trading
market. </p>
<p>''The environment for all the firms is quite difficult
right now,'' Cohn, 53, said today at an investor conference in
New York. ''What drives activity in our business is volatility.
If markets never move or don''t move, our clients really don''t
need to transact.'' </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, 60,
said yesterday that second-quarter trading revenue could fall as
much as 25 percent from year-earlier levels, and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent drop earlier this month. Cohn
stopped short of forecasting the decline for New York-based
Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>''We think, at the end of the day, it''s economic in
nature,'' Cohn said of the cause of lower client volume. ''We
don''t have clear vision of economic growth or lack of growth.'' </p>
<p>Cohn said while his firm has been gaining market share
among clients in the trading business, the lack of activity has
kept that from translating into higher revenue. </p>
<p>Low interest rates and the Federal Reserve''s program of
quantitative easing have resulted in reduced volatility, Cohn
said. He pointed to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, a gauge of U.S. stock volatility known as the
VIX, which is trading 40 percent below its historical average.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note traded over the past
three months in its narrowest band in the 35 years, Cohn said. </p>

<p>Brazil''s top economic forecaster is
challenging calls from banks such as JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Deutsche Bank that policy makers will end the world''s longest
tightening cycle, saying faster inflation will motivate them to
boost interest rates for a 10th straight meeting. </p>
<p>Fernando Fix, chief economist at Votorantim Asset
Management in Sao Paulo, estimates central bankers will raise
interest rates by a quarter point to 11.25 percent when the two-day meeting ends today after 6 p.m. local time. That puts him at
odds with the median estimate of 53 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg and traders, who say there''s an 80 percent chance the
central bank will hold the benchmark Selic at 11 percent. </p>
<p>Consumer prices in the world''s second-largest emerging
market have accelerated in the past four months as service costs
push annual inflation to the highest level in 10 months. Policy
makers will continue to raise the benchmark Selic rate today as
faster inflation threatens investment and confidence levels in
Brazil, Fix said. </p>
<p>''The central bank recognizes problems related to the
persistence of inflation,'' he said by telephone. ''It''s
becoming clearer that high inflation is counterproductive for
growth.'' </p>
<p>The central bank''s press office declined to comment on
market expectations when contacted by phone. </p>
<h2>Biggest Increase </h2>
<p>Policy makers have raised the Selic by 3.75 percentage
points since April 2013 to fight inflation that Fix said is
still being fanned by falling unemployment rates and rising
wages. That''s the biggest increase of benchmark borrowing costs
in the past year after Turkey and the longest cycle of monetary
policy tightening in the world. </p>
<p>Annual inflation accelerated to 6.31 percent in mid-May
from 6.19 percent the prior month as education, health care and
housing prices increased. The central bank targets 4.5 percent
inflation, plus or minus two percentage points. </p>
<p>The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent last month, the lowest
since January, while average real income grew from last year. </p>
<p>Industrial production has been weaker, contracting twice in
the first quarter, as economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
economic growth will slow this year to 1.8 percent from 2.3
percent last year. Consumer confidence as measured by the

more than five years. </p>

is helping reduce inflationary pressures, according to Fabio Akira, chief economist for JPMorgan in Brazil. Policy makers
also are aware that boosting the Selic more will hinder Brazil''s
economic expansion, he said. </p>
<p>''Activity numbers are weakening,'' said Akira. ''We are
going to see data that will worsen further.'' </p>
<p>Akira is the best forecaster of Brazil''s economic data
after Fix, according to information compiled by Bloomberg. The
ranking is based on the accuracy of estimates for key economic
indicators over the past two years. </p>
<p>The local currency appreciation also will help relieve
inflationary pressures, Akira said. The real has strengthened
5.6 percent against the dollar this year, the best performance
among 24 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It
depreciated 0.6 percent yesterday to 2.2377 per U.S. dollar. </p>
<h2>Pared Bets </h2>
<p>Traders have pared bets for further tightening as policy
makers such as central bank President Alexandre Tombini and the
institution''s international affairs director, Luiz Awazu Pereira, said at separate events this month that monetary policy
has a delayed impact on consumer prices. </p>
<p>Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015 have
declined 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 10.91
percent since the central bank''s last meeting. The breakeven
rate, based on the difference in yields of inflation-linked
bonds and interest-rate swaps due in 2015, dropped 58 basis
points over the same period. </p>
<p>Jose Carlos de Faria, chief Brazil economist for Deutsche
Bank, agrees with the central bank''s assessment. </p>
<p>''It''s clear that we still haven''t seen the full effect''
of rate increases, said Faria. ''The central bank has provided
signs that it will pause.'' </p>
<p>For Votorantim Asset Management''s Fix, policy makers will
need to increase the Selic by 100 basis points next year to
prevent consumer price increases from breaching the ceiling of
the target range. </p>
<p>''Inflation is still worrisome,'' he said. </p>
<p>(The headline of an earlier version of this story was
corrected to show JPMorgan forecasts no change in the Selic.) </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Satya Nadella said he will seek to focus on businesses
where the company can lead, rather than harp on missed
opportunities in areas like tablet computers and hardware. </p>
<p>''The question is, what is the next thing that is going to
make us better?'' Nadella said in a keynote interview yesterday
at Re/code''s Code conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
''It''s the hunt for what is it that is the inflection point that
matters more than what caused us to miss.'' </p>
<p>In Nadella''s first public interview since replacing Steve Ballmer as CEO in February, he also said he doesn''t plan to
change Microsoft''s plans for Xbox or sell off the Bing search
engine. The company will continue to span both enterprise and
consumer markets, he said. He highlighted Microsoft''s focus on
products that run on any device, as well as the areas of Web-based cloud computing, mobile and business software. </p>
<p>As part of that effort, the Redmond, Washington-based
company also used the conference to unveil a new Skype product
that translates Web-conference conversations in real time. Set
for a test release later this year, the Skype translator was
demonstrated in a conversation between Gurdeep Singh Pall, who
oversees Skype, and a German speaker. The product provides both
a spoken and text translation and will initially be available as
a stand-alone offering before being combined into the Skype
application. </p>
<h2>''Global Product'' </h2>
<p>''Skype is a very global product -- it''s all about
connecting people that are separated by distance,'' Pall said in
an interview. ''One of the biggest barriers that still remains
is really the language barrier.'' </p>
<p>Microsoft isn''t sure how many languages will be included
initially, Pall said. The company will release new languages as
they meet the bar for translation quality. </p>
<p>The software relies on work by Microsoft''s research arm, as
well as the Bing search unit, which has its own translation
product for Web pages and Internet content, he said. The Skype
service needs to use speech recognition to understand the
speaker, machine learning for the translation, and text-to-speech technology to send the translation to the listener. </p>
<p>Since taking over, Nadella has sought to focus the world''s
largest software maker on mobile and cloud products. He has
signaled a desire to shift attention to producing software for
rival operating systems like Apple Inc.''s iOS and Google Inc.''s
Android and has shuffled management in areas like marketing,
business development and the Xbox game console. </p>
<h2>Tablet Event </h2>
<p>A company event earlier this month to release a new Surface
tablet was noteworthy for what the CEO chose not to unveil.
While Microsoft showed a larger model of its Surface Pro, a
planned smaller tablet failed to meet with the approval of
Nadella and his executives and was pulled from the event, people
familiar with the matter said last week. </p>
<p>At the session in New York, Nadella didn''t discuss the
missing device and noted that Microsoft won''t seek to develop
hardware to compete with its partners and will instead focus on
areas where it can develop something unique. His comments
suggest a more selective approach to building devices rather
than going for the largest number of offerings. </p>
<p>In Nadella''s first quarter as CEO, Microsoft posted better-than-projected profit as cloud initiatives and cost controls
begun under Ballmer boosted results. </p>

<p>Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice president found liable for his part in
selling a pre-crisis mortgage security that lost value, said he
won''t file an appeal in the civil case. </p>
<p>''While my lawyers have advised me there are strong grounds
to appeal, I prefer to move forward with my education and close
this difficult chapter of my life,'' Tourre said in a statement
yesterday. ''I look forward to finishing my Ph.D. in economics
and to making meaningful contributions to my field.'' </p>
<p>Tourre, 35, was found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at
which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claimed he
intentionally misled investors in a subprime-mortgage vehicle
called Abacus 2007-AC1. In March, he was ordered to pay more
than $825,000 in penalties. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was one of the government''s most prominent
efforts to fix responsibility for the housing market crash,
which helped precipitate the worst economic downturn since the
1930s. Critics have faulted the SEC for not doing more to police
the abuses that helped lead to the crisis or to pursue top
financial executives they say are responsible. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which paid Tourre''s legal fees, settled SEC
claims over the Abacus transaction in July 2010 for $550
million, a record at the time. No senior Goldman Sachs
executives were questioned in Tourre''s trial. </p>
<p>Tourre lied about the role played by the hedge-fund firm
run by billionaire John Paulson, which helped choose the
securities underlying Abacus then made a billion-dollar bet it
would fail, the SEC said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest ruled in March that
Tourre, who''s in the middle of a six-year economics Ph.D.
program at the University of Chicago, couldn''t seek
reimbursement from Goldman Sachs for $650,000 in civil penalties
and repaying $175,463 of his 2007 bonus, plus interest. </p>

many of his rivals shun. </p>
<p>Gross, who manages the $230 billion Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX)
at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach,
California, is betting five-year Treasuries, which are more
sensitive to changes in the central bank rate than longer-dated
bonds, will do well because markets overestimate how much the

<p>The city of Los Angeles accused
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) of targeting minority borrowers with
predatory loans in a lawsuit filed two days after Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) lost a court bid to dismiss a similar case. </p>
<p>The second-largest U.S. city sued Wells Fargo, Citigroup
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. last year, saying the lenders
engaged in biased practices since at least 2004 by placing
minority borrowers in mortgages they couldn''t afford and driving
up the number of foreclosures in their neighborhoods. </p>
<p>''L.A. continues to suffer from the foreclosure crisis,
from blight in our neighborhoods to diminished revenue for basic
city services,'' City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement.
''We''re fighting to hold those we allege are responsible to
account.'' </p>
<p>The claim against New York-based JPMorgan is the most
recent in a series of lawsuits by municipalities across the U.S.
to hold mortgage lenders responsible for fallout from the
collapse of the housing market. Yesterday, Providence, Rhode
Island, sued Banco Santander SA (SAN)''s U.S. unit, alleging
discriminatory lending in the years after the recession. </p>
<p>In today''s suit and earlier ones by Los Angeles, the city
accuses the banks of historically ''red-lining'' black and
Hispanic areas as no-loan zones. Starting in the late 1990s, the
banks engaged in ''reverse red-lining'' by flooding the areas
with subprime mortgages even when minorities qualified for
better terms, according to the complaint filed today in federal
court in Los Angeles. </p>
<h2>''Fair Terms'' </h2>
<p>In addition, JPMorgan has since 2009 declined to offer
refinancing or loan modification to minority customers on ''fair
terms,'' according to the complaint. </p>

adversarial approach to address city finances impacted by the

<p>Iron ore capped a sixth monthly drop
in the longest losing run on record as rising supplies from
Australia and Brazil spur a global glut. Fortescue Metals Group
Ltd. (FMG) said there could be further losses, with a risk prices may
retreat to the lowest level since 2009. </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Tianjin tumbled
4.1 percent to $91.80 a dry ton, the lowest level in 20 months,
according to data from The Steel Index Ltd. today. The steel-making raw material sank 12.9 percent in May, and has dropped
every month since December in the longest run of monthly losses
since the data series began in November 2008. </p>
<p>Iron ore entered a bear market in March as the biggest
miners including BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO) raised
output, spurring forecasts for a rising global surplus. Slowing
growth and tight credit conditions in China have restricted the
expansion of demand in the world''s largest user. The price drop
validates a forecast from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in November
that the commodity would see a significant decline in 2014. </p>
<p>''We think it is mainly a supply story,'' Christian Lelong,
an analyst at Goldman Sachs in Sydney, said in an e-mail
yesterday in response to questions from Bloomberg. ''Demand is
clearly growing at a slower pace, but supply growth is
particularly strong after years of overinvestment.'' </p>
<p>Iron ore may drop to as low as $80 over the next 12 months,
Fortescue Chairman Andrew Forrest told a conference in Melbourne
today. The benchmark tracked by The Steel Index last traded
below $80 in September 2009. </p>
<h2>Forrest''s View </h2>
<p>''I''m pretty comfortable with the iron ore price
oscillating around the $110 mark,'' said Forrest, who heads
Australia''s third-largest shipper. ''I think it could wander
down to $80, it could wander up to $140.'' </p>
<p>The raw material has lost 32 percent this year compared
with the 2.8 percent advance for the Standard  Poor''s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 commodities and 3.1 percent gain for the MSCI World
Index of equities. </p>
<p>Rio shares declined as much as 4.4 percent to 3,047.50
pence in London, the lowest since October. Stock in BHP
retreated as much as 4.1 percent in London. </p>
<p>Iron ore will average $109 a ton in 2014 and $80 next year,
Goldman forecasts. So far in 2014, it''s averaged $116. The bank
boosted its estimate for next year''s surplus to 175 million tons
from 145 million tons in a May 20 report. </p>
<p>The worldwide seaborne surplus will increase to 79 million
tons this year and 158 million tons in 2015 from last year''s 1
million tons, Morgan Stanley said in a report on May 26. Global
supplies will expand 10 percent in 2014, outstripping the 3.7
percent rise in demand, according to the bank. </p>
<h2>Chinese Economy </h2>
<p>Gross domestic product in China, the world''s largest
steelmaker, will grow 7.3 percent this year, according to a
Bloomberg survey. While that''s set to be the least since 1990,
it''s still more than double expected growth in the U.S. </p>
<p>Premier Li Keqiang said pressures for a downturn are
''relatively large'' and the nation will adjust policy to
support the economy, according to a statement on May 23.
Economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. said that Li''s comments
signaled looser borrowing conditions. </p>
<p>''Even if the government tries to come up with measures to
prop up the economy, the problem for iron ore is oversupply,''
Helen Lau, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong, said by
phone. ''The oversupply issue will outweigh demand recovery.'' </p>
<p>Iron ore prices are unlikely to rise in the next two to
three months because of increasing supplies from imports, high
port inventories and a slowdown in steel-product demand, China''s
National Development  Reform Commission said on May 28. </p>
<h2>Record Stockpiles </h2>
<p>Stockpiles at Chinese ports climbed 0.7 percent to a record
113.30 million tons in the week to May 23 from a week earlier,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co.
Inventories have expanded 31 percent this year. </p>
<p>Shipments from Australia and Brazil are expected to grow 28
percent over the next five years till 2019 to reach 1.3 billion
tons, data from Australia''s Bureau of Resources and Energy
Economics, or BREE, showed in a quarterly report in March. </p>
<p>A union representing tugboat deckhands at Australia''s Port
Hedland deferred a strike on May 22 and said it would apply to
extend the period in which it can take industrial action,
risking disruption to iron ore shipments from the world''s
largest bulk-export terminal. A second union representing
tugboat masters at the port approved work stoppages from two to
72 hours, the Fair Work Commission said today. </p>
<h2>Port Hedland </h2>
<p>Industrial action may hurt exports by miners including
Fortescue  and BHP, which estimated that disruption will cost
users about $94 million a day. Shipments through Port Hedland
made up more than a quarter of worldwide seaborne trade last
year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on figures from
BREE, with 81 percent of the port''s ore going to China. </p>
<p>Surging supplies of seaborne ore will challenge producers
in China, probably forcing some higher-cost capacity in the
country to close, BHP and Goldman said separately on May 7. </p>
<p>Operating costs at about 80 percent of China''s domestic
iron ore mines are $80 to $90 a ton, according to Xia Yang, a
Shanghai-based analyst at Mysteel, China''s biggest steel
researcher. That compares with A$39 ($37) for Rio Tinto, A$41
for BHP and A$56 for Fortescue, UBS AG estimated. </p>
<p>Shares of Perth-based Fortescue have tumbled 24 percent in
Sydney this year. Vale SA (VALE5), the world''s biggest iron ore
exporter, advanced 0.3 percent in Sao Paulo yesterday, trimming
the drop this year to 19 percent. </p>

<h2>Nortel European Units Seek Slice of Asset Auction Cash Hoard </h2>
<p>Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)''s defunct units in the U.K. and
Europe deserve part of the bankrupt telecom company''s $7.3
billion cash hoard because of their technology researchers'' past
work, an investment banker said. </p>
<p>Paul Huffard, a senior managing director at Blackstone
Group LP called to testify by the European units, argued May 28
in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, that the best way to
split the cash is based on the research and development by
Nortel''s regional units. </p>
<p>Using that method, disputed by Nortel''s defunct U.S. and
Canadian components, the U.K. and European units deserve about
18 percent of the cash, Huffard said. </p>
<p>The contingents are in the third week of a six-week trial
over how to divide money raised in auctions after what was once
North America''s largest telephone-equipment maker went bankrupt
in 2009. The money includes proceeds of a patent sale that
raised $4.5 billion. </p>
<p>The units are arguing on behalf of creditors including
bondholders in the U.S. and pensioners in the U.K. and Canada.
Each group is trying to convince a U.S. bankruptcy judge and a
Canadian judge that its method for dividing the money is best. </p>

<p>India is cashing in on the rupee''s
region-beating rally to boost its foreign reserves, prompting
banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to HSBC Holdings Plc to
predict an end to the currency''s gains. </p>
<p>The rupee will reverse this month''s 2.2 percent advance and
tumble more than 3 percent to 61 per dollar by year-end, the
sharpest decline among 11 Asian currencies after the yen,
according to Bloomberg strategist surveys. HSBC forecasts a drop
to 62 by Dec. 31, while Goldman Sachs sees the rupee at 61 in
six months. </p>
<p>Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has used the
stronger rupee to buy foreign currency, pushing reserves above
$300 billion for the first time since 2011 and bolstering the
nation''s defenses against speculators. Currency analysts are
speculating Rajan''s policy will outweigh the foreign investment
lured by the election campaign of pro-business politician
Narendra Modi, who was confirmed as prime minister this month. </p>
<p>''We would caution against the conclusion that positive
politics will translate into large gains for the currency,''
Mallika Sachdeva, a Singapore-based strategist at Deutsche Bank
AG, the world''s second-biggest foreign-exchange trader, said May
28 by e-mail. ''The RBI will be opportunistically buying
dollars. India''s reserves buffer, while large in absolute terms,
is still weak versus regional peers on metrics like import or
short-term debt cover.'' </p>
<h2>Modi Inflows </h2>
<p>Revived confidence in Indian assets during the election
campaign prompted foreigners to pump $14.6 billion into the
nation''s stocks and bonds this year, exceeding inflows of $12
billion in the whole of 2013. The rupee surged almost 5 percent
against the dollar since Dec. 31, the best performance after
Brazil''s real of 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The rupee has already retreated more than 1 percent from an
11-month high of 58.335 per dollar reached May 23 and traded at
59.0462 as of 11:24 a.m. in London. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. says India will have to keep building
its reserves because they''re still only enough to pay for eight
months of imports, the lowest coverage ratio since 1996. </p>
<p>''We expect Governor Rajan to continue to buy foreign
exchange to improve import cover that''s almost halved in the
past six years,'' Indranil Sengupta, a Mumbai-based economist at
the U.S. investment bank, said May 27 by phone. ''We calculate
the RBI needs to buy $80 billion in the next two years to just
maintain that import cover.'' </p>
<h2>Deploying Gains </h2>
<p>India''s not the only developing country to parlay local-currency gains into foreign reserves in anticipation of an end
to the U.S. Federal Reserve''s monetary stimulus program. The 12
emerging markets with the biggest stockpiles outside of China
lifted their combined holdings to $2.97 trillion as of May 26,
about the most since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2008. </p>
<p>India boosted its reserves to $315 billion, $6 billion
short of a record reached in September 2011, as the rupee
rallied from an all-time low of 68.845 per dollar in August. </p>
<p>RBI intervention will merely ''limit the pace of rupee
appreciation,'' Hamish Pepper, a Singapore-based strategist at
Barclays Plc, said in a May 28 client note. </p>
<p>The British bank raised its six-month rupee forecast to 59
per dollar, from 61 previously, citing a strengthening economy
and fund inflows. Nomura Holdings Inc. lifted its year-end
prediction to 57 after the election, from 59.5. </p>
<p>The victory of Modi''s Bharatiya Janata Party stoked
optimism that India will be able to take measures to cut its
current-account deficit, after the nation''s last prime minister
passed the fewest bills for any government to have completed a
five-year term. The shortfall in the broadest measure of the
country''s trade narrowed to $32.4 billion in the fiscal year
ended March from an unprecedented $88 billion in the prior
period. </p>
<h2>Policy Switch </h2>
<p>A 30 percent plunge in the rupee from 2011 through 2013 as
the deficit widened prompted the RBI to prop up the currency
last year by tightening the cash supply, raising interest rates
and selling banks discounted foreign-exchange swaps. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sees the central bank''s influence on the
rupee as being negative this time around. </p>
<p>''The RBI has said that it wouldn''t want the gains on the
current account to be lost due to a strengthening currency,
which would reduce competitiveness,'' Goldman Sachs analysts
including Mumbai-based Tushar Poddar wrote in a May 22 report. </p>
<p>The RBI''s increasing war chest will limit the rupee''s
short-term gains to 57, and the currency will fall to 61 by
year-end as the post-election rally fizzles out, according to
Credit Agricole SA. </p>
<p>''The market has roped in too-high hopes about Modi,''
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at the bank in Hong Kong, said
in a May 27 phone interview. ''There will be disappointment.'' </p>

<p>Ecuador agreed to transfer more than
half its gold reserves to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for three
years to give the government easier access to cash. </p>
<p>The central bank said it will send 466,000 ounces of gold
to Goldman Sachs, worth about $580 million at current prices,
and get the same amount back three years from now. In return,
Ecuador will get ''instruments of high security and liquidity''
and expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million over
the term of the accord. The central bank didn''t detail
additional terms of the transactions, such as any fees or
financing costs paid to Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The deal comes as the South American country''s government,
which defaulted on about $3.2 billion of bonds five years ago,
seeks to cover a budget deficit forecast by the Finance Ministry
to swell to a record $4.94 billion this year. President Rafael Correa said in April he also planned to sell about $700 million
of foreign debt this year in the country''s first international
bond sale since the 2008 and 2009 default. </p>
<p>''Gold that was not generating any returns in vaults,
causing storage costs, now becomes a productive asset that will
generate profits,'' the central bank said in the statement.
''These interventions in the gold market represent the beginning
of a new and permanent strategy of active participation by the
bank, through purchases, sales and financial operations, that
will contribute to the creation of new financial investment
opportunities.'' </p>
<h2>Reserves Drop </h2>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Central Bank President Diego
Martinez didn''t respond to requests made through the bank''s
press office seeking more information on the transaction. </p>
<p>The country''s gold reserves fell by $605 million, or 55
percent, to $493 million in the week ending May 23, according 
to a separate report on the central bank''s website. The bank, 
which was stripped of its autonomy in a 2008 constitutional
referendum, had about 845,000 troy ounces of gold as of April
14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Last year, Goldman Sachs proposed a swap with Venezuela to
provide $1.68 billion in cash to be backed by $1.85 billion of
that country''s gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News
showed. </p>
<p>The deal, which wasn''t completed, would have carried an
interest rate of 7.5 percent plus the three-month London
interbank offered rate. Venezuela would have kept its exposure
to gold, with the nation posting the precious metal or cash to a
margin account if the price fell and Goldman Sachs posting U.S.
dollars if it rose, the documents show. </p>
<p>Ecuador''s deal with Goldman Sachs is a signal the central
bank is short on cash, Vicente Albornoz, the dean of the
Universidad de las Americas business school in Quito, said in a
telephone interview. The funds should help prop up government
spending this year needed to drive economic growth. </p>
<p>''About the only thing that''s clear is that they''re
converting part of their reserves into some sort of cash
equivalent,'' Albornoz said. ''If the government doesn''t find
funds to finance the deficit, it''ll have to cut spending.'' </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $325
million to settle a lawsuit brought by health-care benefit
providers who claimed the drugmaker marketed the epilepsy drug
Neurontin for unapproved uses. </p>
<p>The settlement, which needs approval from a federal judge
in Boston, would end a case over claims that the company''s
Parke-Davis unit schemed to market the drug for unapproved
conditions as early as 1994. </p>
<p>The accord was disclosed in court papers filed May 30 in
Boston federal court, about six weeks after New York-based
Pfizer agreed to a $190 million settlement over Neurontin in a
separate case. </p>
<p>The Boston accord will resolve ''all third-party payer
claims regarding off-label promotion'' and state antitrust
claims over Neurontin sales, Steve Danehy, a company spokesman,
said in a statement. Pfizer didn''t admit wrongdoing, he said. </p>
<p>''After more than ten years of hard-fought litigation, the
parties have reached a settlement that will bring this
litigation to a close,'' lawyers for the benefit firms said in a
memorandum filed May 30. </p>
<p>The companies alleged that Parke-Davis, part of Warner-Lambert Co., paid kickbacks to doctors to encourage them to
prescribe the anti-seizure drug for unapproved uses such as
bipolar and panic disorders. </p>
<p>Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000 and ''deliberately
expanded the promotion of off-label uses,'' lawyers for the
benefits firms said in an amended complaint filed in 2011. </p>
<h2>Unapproved Uses </h2>
<p>Companies including Louisiana Blue Cross/Blue Shield sought
to recover ''billions of dollars'' they paid as a result of a
scheme to market and sell Neurontin ''for a variety of uses for
which it is not approved or medically efficacious,'' according
to the complaint. </p>
<p>The drug is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and pain
from shingles or herpes zoster. </p>
<p>In the other settlement, disclosed in April, Pfizer agreed
to pay $190 million to end a suit over claims it violated U.S.
antitrust law by delaying generic versions of Neurontin. </p>
<p>The drugmaker delayed competition by ''improperly listing
certain patents with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
engaging in illegal promotion and sales of Neurontin for
unapproved uses, filing and maintaining sham litigations with
respect to certain patents, and making misrepresentations to the
patent courts,'' according to the 12-year-old lawsuit. </p>

<p>KKR  Co. (KKR) is shutting its equity
hedge fund, about three years after hiring former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. proprietary trader Bob Howard to run it. </p>
<p>''We have decided to close KKR Equity Strategies and return
capital to investors,'' New York-based KKR said in an e-mailed
statement. ''We would like to thank Bob Howard and the team for
their dedication to the firm and exceptional professionalism in
serving our clients.'' </p>
<p>The $510 million KKR Equities Strategies fund, which was
started in August 2011, was liquidated last week, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. The fund had less
than 20 outside clients who had $337 million invested, money
that will be returned starting this month, the person said. </p>
<p>Howard is the latest former proprietary trader to leave an
investment bank and join the $2.7 trillion hedge-fund industry,
only to struggle with making money and attracting assets.
Pierre-Henri Flamand, who ran Goldman Sachs''s global
proprietary-trading unit before setting out on his own, shut his
hedge-fund firm in 2012 after two years because of losses and as
assets dwindled. </p>
<p>Howard''s fund gained about 15 percent since inception, the
person said. That compares with a 7.1 percent return from equity
hedge funds in the same period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Goldman Alumni </h2>
<p>The dozen employees who made up the KKR Equity Strategies
team were notified of the decision to shutter the fund on May
30, the person said. Most of them worked with Howard at Goldman
Sachs, where he ran the U.S. desk of its principal strategies
group. </p>
<p>Howard joined KKR in 2010 to start its first hedge fund.
KKR gave Howard, a partner at the firm, $100 million to start
the fund, according to marketing documents. </p>
<p>Arvind Raghunathan, 50, the former head of Deutsche Bank
AG''s global arbitrage business who left with his team in 2009 to
start Roc Capital Management LP, shuttered that hedge fund last
year after losing money. </p>
<p>Portman Square Capital LLP, founded by ex-Citigroup Inc.
proprietary-trading unit head Sutesh Sharma, 51, last year
opened with about $100 million, less than a fifth of the amount
originally sought. CEO Andy Mack resigned this year and the firm
is reducing operations. </p>
<p>Flamand closed his Edoma Partners LLC in November 2012, a
little more than two-and-a-half years after starting the hedge-fund firm. Man Group Plc said last month that Flamand will join
the company as a senior money manager. </p>
<h2>KKR Prisma </h2>
<p>KKR said it will be focusing on KKR Prisma, a unit that has
invested more than $10 billion in hedge funds, and the building
of strategic stakes and backing of the firms. Last year KKR
agreed to buy a 24.9 percent stake in Nephila Capital Ltd., a
Bermuda-based firm that makes reinsurance-related investments. </p>
<p>KKR said it will also concentrate on its credit hedge funds
that have about $800 million in assets. The firm last year
bought Avoca Capital to expand its European credit business. </p>
<p>Buyout firms including Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle
Group LP have built hedge fund investment units to diversify
beyond private equity. Blackstone has grown its hedge fund
investing unit, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, into
the world''s largest with $58 billion, according to its website. </p>

<p>The bidding war for Hillshire Brands
Co. (HSH) is proving costly for the Brazilian bankers at JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>After firing Morgan Stanley from a bond sale, Sao Paulo-based JBS SA (JBSS3) pulled JPMorgan from a stock offering because the
two banks are helping Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) counter its bid for
Hillshire, two people familiar with the situation said, asking
not to be identified as the matter is private. </p>
<p>The two investment banks are advising Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson in a $6.2 billion offer for the maker of Jimmy Dean
sausages that trumped a $5.6 billion proposal from JBS, the
world''s largest meat producer. The Brazilian company''s firing of
JPMorgan follows at least a dozen bond sales that the bank
helped manage for JBS since 2006 and a $6.3 billion takeover of
Bertin SA in 2009 where it acted as one of JBS''s advisers. </p>
<p>Tyson, the world''s No.2 meat producer, announced its bid
and said it hired the two New York-based banks two days after
JBS''s May 27 offer, saying JPMorgan is also likely to join
Morgan Stanley (MS) in providing bridge financing for the deal. </p>
<p>Jeremiah O''Callaghan, investor relations director for JBS,
declined to comment, as did Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman
for Morgan Stanley, andVeronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is the No. 2 global deals adviser this year,
handling $394 billion of announced mergers and acquisitions and
trailing only Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is fifth. </p>
<p>JPMorgan ranks second among underwriters of Latin American
dollar- and euro-denominated bonds in 2014, while Morgan Stanley
is 10th, the data show. </p>
<h2>First IPO </h2>
<p>JBS is seeking regulatory approval to sell shares of its
JBS Foods SA unit in what would be Brazil''s first initial public
offering this year. Voting shares of the unit holding JBS''s
Brazilian pork, poultry and food-processing operations will be
listed in Brazil''s Novo Mercado subject to regulatory approval
and market conditions, it said in a May 20 filing. </p>
<p>The unit was formed after JBS agreed to buy Seara food-processing assets from Marfrig Global Foods SA for 5.85 billion
reais ($2.6 billion) in June 2013. JBS hired units of JPMorgan
and Banco Bradesco for a 3 billion-real IPO of the unit, two
people with direct knowledge of the matter said in April. JBS
also hired Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco Santander SA, Grupo BTG
Pactual and Banco do Brasil SA to underwrite the share offering. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. was helping manage JBS''s planned $750
million bond sale, which the meatpacker has temporarily
withdrawn as it seeks a new leading coordinator, according to a
May 29 statement. </p>
<h2>Reviewing Options </h2>
<p>Shares of JBS rose 0.8 percent today to 7.56 reais as of
11:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo. </p>
<p>JBS has spent $17 billion on acquisitions in the past
decade to overtake Tyson in the meat industry. JBS''s Pilgrim''s
Pride Corp. unit offered $45 a share for Hillshire, compared
with Tyson''s $50 offer. </p>
<p>Following Tyson''s May 29 bid, Pilgrim''s is reviewing its
options, according to a person familiar with the matter. It''s
too early to say whether the company will raise its offer, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
deliberations are private. </p>
<p>The acquisition of Hillshire, potentially JBS''s largest
takeover since the acquisition of Bertin in 2009, would boost
the company''s debt levels to at least the highest in four years. </p>

<p>Ecuador, one of only eight countries
to adopt the U.S. dollar as its official currency, swapped gold
with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for liquid assets in a sign the
nation is short on cash, according to Loomis Sayles  Co. </p>
<p>''It does raise a red flag,'' Bianca Taylor, a sovereign
analyst who helps oversee $210 billion at Loomis Sayles, said
yesterday in a phone interview from Boston. ''Whenever a country
needs to sell or monetize its gold reserves, it''s definitely a
signal that the sovereign is strapped for cash.'' </p>
<p>President Rafael Correa is stepping up his search for
financing at home and abroad after borrowing more than $11
billion from China since defaulting on $3.2 billion of foreign
debt five years ago. Ecuador''s use of the dollar means it can''t
finance deficits by printing money like other countries. Correa,
a self-described revolutionary socialist, is now planning to
raise about $700 million in an overseas bond sale this year and
agreed to allow the International Monetary Fund to perform an
economic review for the first time since 2008. </p>
<p>Ecuador''s central bank, stripped of its autonomy in a
constitutional referendum a year after Correa took power in
2007, says it ''invested'' the gold with Goldman Sachs in return
for assets that can be liquidated within seven days. The country
will get the same quantity of gold back three years from now and
expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million from the
deal, it said. </p>
<h2>Productive Asset </h2>
<p>The operation didn''t imply any payment of financing costs
by the central bank to Goldman Sachs, the bank said today in an
e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. The central
bank said it also doesn''t need the liquidity to finance
spending. </p>
<p>''Gold that was not generating any returns in vaults,
causing storage costs, now becomes a productive asset that will
generate profits,'' the central bank said in the statement on
its website disclosing the operation. ''These interventions in
the gold market represent the beginning of a new and permanent
strategy of active participation by the bank, through purchases,
sales and financial operations, that will contribute to the
creation of new financial investment opportunities.'' </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said yesterday the deal wasn''t a sale
and was a normal operation of investing reserves for profit. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>''Puzzling Transaction'' </h2>
<p>The transaction covers 466,000 ounces of gold, according to
the central bank. That''s 1,165 gold bars, worth about $580
million at yesterday''s prices. </p>
<p>A clue to the operation came last week, when the central
bank reported a $605 million drop in its gold reserves to $493
million during the week ending May 23. Net currency reserves
rose by $434 million. At the time the central bank didn''t
explain the change. </p>
<p>It''s not clear what Goldman Sachs plans to do with the
bullion, said George Gero, a vice president and precious-metals
strategist in New York at RBC Capital Markets. </p>
<p>''It''s really a puzzling transaction,'' Gero said yesterday
in a telephone interview. ''The idea that there was a large sale
and you don''t know when it will come out into the market is
probably pressuring prices.'' </p>
<h2>Venezuela Proposal </h2>
<p>Spot gold prices had fallen for five straight days before
today, when they rose 0.1 percent to 1,244.96 an ounce as of
2:31 p.m. in New York. They''re still down 34 percent from a peak
of $1,900.20 an ounce in September 2011. Prices have gained 3.6
percent so far this year and will fall to $1,240 by the end of
the year, according to the median estimate of 34 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Money managers cut their net-long position, or bets on
higher gold prices, by 24 percent in the week ended May 27,
based on U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Short
holdings, or bets on a gold-price decrease, surged 72 percent,
the most in six months, the data show. </p>
<p>Last year, Goldman Sachs proposed a swap with Venezuela to
provide $1.68 billion in cash to be backed by $1.85 billion of
gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News showed. </p>
<p>The deal, which wasn''t completed, would have carried an
interest rate of 7.5 percent plus the three-month London
interbank offered rate. Venezuela would have kept its exposure
to gold, with the nation posting the precious metal or cash to a
margin account if the price fell and Goldman Sachs posting U.S.
dollars if it rose, the documents show. </p>
<p>Ecuador''s transaction with Goldman Sachs ''has nothing to
do'' with the proposed Venezuelan deal, the central bank said in
its e-mail today. </p>
<h2>Financing Options </h2>
<p>Ecuador will probably use the transaction proceeds to
finance public spending, said Martin Castellano, a senior
economist for Latin America at the Institute of International
Finance, a trade association of banks and money managers
including Goldman Sachs. Given the country''s use of the
greenback as its official currency, the government needs to
ensure it has enough liquidity to avoid balance-of-payment
problems, he said. </p>
<p>''The measure reflects the government''s willingness to
pursue whichever financing option is at hand in order to avoid a
fiscal adjustment,'' Castellano said yesterday in a telephone
interview from Washington. </p>

<p>Ecuador President Rafael Correa said
proceeds from a loan obtained from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
after he offered more than half the country''s gold reserves as
collateral will go toward investing in economic growth. </p>
<p>The government, faced with a budget deficit forecast to hit
a record this year, said last week that it ''invested'' 466,000
ounces of gold with Goldman Sachs in return for ''instruments of
high security and liquidity.'' The transaction added to reserves
of ''monetary gold'' and would generate as much as $20 million
in profit, according to a central bank statement. </p>
<p>The gold reserves ''serve as collateral for a loan,''
Correa told reporters today at the presidential palace in Quito.
''With this loan, we can invest in the country.'' </p>
<p>The deal, amounting to 1,165 gold bars worth about $580
million at current prices, comes on top of government attempts
to sell about $700 million of bonds this year in what would be
the nation''s first foreign debt sale since it defaulted on $3.2
billion of its notes in 2008 and 2009. </p>
<p>Ecuador''s government hasn''t sufficiently explained the
operation with Goldman Sachs and the difference between the
central bank''s original statement and Correa''s comments today,
said Luis Fernando Torres, a congressional representative for
Tungurahua province. The government has liquidity problems and
has begun delaying payments to some public officials, he said. </p>
<p>''An investment and a loan are two totally different
things,'' Torres said today in an interview at the nation''s
Congress in Quito. ''This operation is baffling.'' </p>
<h2>$10 Billion </h2>
<p>Correa''s administration is also in talks with China to
finance a $10 billion refinery in the coastal province of Manta,
Strategic Sectors Minister Rafael Poveda said today at the event
in Quito. The government expects to sign a deal for $2 billion
in August, of which $500 million will be for the government''s
discretionary use, he said. </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry forecasts the government will need
about $4.94 billion to cover this year''s budget deficit. The
government has said that if it doesn''t find the funds to finance
the gap, it will cut spending on budgeted infrastructure
projects. </p>

<p>Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Switzerland''s
No. 2 bank, rose the most in two weeks after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) raised its recommendation to buy from neutral. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs analysts also raised their recommendation for
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to neutral from sell, citing the decline in its
stock and its plan to issue shares. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse rose as much as 2.1 percent in trading today
after Goldman Sachs analysts including Jernej Omahen said its
shares were among the most undervalued in the industry. </p>
<p>The rise was the most since Credit Suisse settled a U.S.
investigation of its role in helping Americans evade taxes. The
settlement, announced after the close of trading on May 19,
included a guilty plea and a fine of $2.6 billion. It resolved
the last major litigation issue for Credit Suisse, Chief
Executive Officer Brady Dougan said at the time. </p>
<p>The Swiss bank ''offers one of the highest upsides amongst
our coverage,'' the analysts wrote. ''We therefore upgrade the
shares to buy and add it to our conviction list.'' </p>
<p>Credit Suisse shares were up 1.6 percent to 26.76 francs at
12:20 p.m. in Zurich. At that price, it would have to rise 36
percent to reach the analysts'' 12-month price target of 36.50
francs. Goldman Sachs said its view was based on the bank''s
current strategy. </p>
<p>Weak share performance, low expectations for profitability
and low capital ratios are among factors that increase the
chances of Credit Suisse adjusting its strategy, Goldman Sachs
said. Its analysts see more potential for shares to rise if any
such changes reduce the impact of investment banking on return
on equity. </p>
<h2>Investment Bank </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of Credit Suisse''s
earnings per share for this year to 2.58 Swiss francs ($2.87)
from 2.73 francs, citing a slowdown in debt trading. The mean
estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is 2.11 francs. </p>
<p>The investment bank is weighing on the company''s return on
equity, the analysts said, estimating the drag at about 5
percent. Credit Suisse''s return on equity, a measure of
profitability, was 8 percent in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse says its common equity ratio at the end of
the first quarter would have been 9.3 percent if the U.S.
settlement were factored in. The bank lags 3.9 percentage points
behind the biggest Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN) in this measure, Goldman
Sachs said. </p>
<p>''In our view, an external capital hike remains an option
for CS,'' the Goldman Sachs analysts said. ''Additional source
of capital generation would be welcome.'' </p>

<p>Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt, a small
chain with exotic flavors like gingerbread and kiwi, is facing a
tough technology choice: sink thousands of dollars into new
credit card-reading machines by next year, or run the risk of
fraud by waiting and adopting cheaper mobile-payment services. </p>
<p>By October 2015, Orange Leaf and most of the country''s 6
million small merchants that accept credit cards are supposed to 
be ready to take cards with an embedded chip for extra security 
-- or credit-card networks may consider them liable for some 
fraud in their stores. The new cards require a technology 
called EMV that helps prevent fraud by assigning a unique code 
for every transaction. </p>
<p>Another option is to delay EMV and press ahead with plans
to take payments via mobile devices, often a more convenient
approach that''s less expensive to implement and can even
generate revenue for merchants by using smartphone applications
to build relationships with customers. </p>
<p>''Using a mobile wallet is a better choice right now,''
said Michael Christy, Orange Leaf''s director of information
technology. ''We can control that, and the technical 
requirements are minimal. We want to make sure we save our 
franchisees money.'' </p>
<p>Christy''s choice underscores the dilemma facing millions of
businesses seeking to avoid the data losses that have plagued
Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. -- while aiming to cut
costs and embrace the boom in demand for smartphones that also
offer useful payment methods. While big companies like Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. can afford the costs of EMV, which can run as much
as $1,000 per checkout lane, many smaller businesses are under
pressure to convert to the chip cards just as mobile payments
start to gain popularity. </p>
<h2>Skipping Generation </h2>
<p>''It''s unfortunate,'' said Doug Brown, general manager of
mobile at payment-technology provider FIS. ''Longer-term, it''d
be better if we could just skip a generation and just go to
mobile payments.'' </p>
<p>In five to seven years, more than half of in-store
transactions will be made with mobile phones instead of plastic,
said Brown, whose Jacksonville, Florida-based company helps more
than 14,000 financial companies use payments including EMV and
mobile. </p>
<p>Today, many businesses aren''t ready for EMV. According to
Javelin Strategy  Research, only about one in five businesses
with fewer than 10 employees will be outfitted for the new
technology by next year''s deadline, which the credit-card
companies refer to as the ''liability shift'' because retailers
will need to assume more responsibility when people make
fraudulent transactions in their stores. </p>
<h2>New Equipment </h2>
<p>To begin accepting EMV, stores have to get new equipment to
read the cards'' internal security chips, and a signature or PIN
are typically used to complete a sale. The technology is
considered more secure because EMV cards create a unique code
for each transaction, making them more difficult to hack or
counterfeit than striped cards. All EMV cards also have magnetic
stripes, so they can work on older store payment terminals. EMV
is an acronym for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, the companies
that are pushing its adoption. </p>
<p>While mobile-payment systems vary, they often work by
storing credit-card data on a remote server and scanning a QR
code with a phone. </p>
<p>Orange Leaf, which has 315 stores in the U.S., is rolling
out a mobile-payment system for a quarter of the cost of EMV-capable technology, Christy said in an interview. The Oklahoma
City-based yogurt chain is simply upgrading its current
transaction software so customers can easily use a mobile-phone
app from FIS and mobile-payment startup Paydiant Inc. </p>
<h2>Phasing In </h2>
<p>Orange Leaf''s current payment hardware can last another
four to seven years, Christy said. Like many smaller merchants,
it may make sense for him to wait to phase in EMV as his older
hardware wears out. </p>
<p>Many small businesses don''t see enough fraud to justify
upgrading their hardware and moving to the more secure cards,
Richard Crone, chief executive officer of payment consultancy
Crone Consulting LLC, said in an interview. </p>
<p>''The fraud is tiny, in terms of transactions,'' Crone
said. ''You are talking about a minuscule amount.'' Small
businesses see fraud in 0.03 percent to 0.05 percent of all in-store transactions, he said; that means that a merchant with
$500,000 in annual sales may see less than $250 in fraudulent
sales a year. And the liability shift won''t even apply in some
situations, such as when a customer''s bank hasn''t yet issued an
EMV card. </p>
<h2>Boosting Revenue </h2>
<p>Companies like FIS and Paydiant also help keep mobile
transactions secure by storing and encrypting credit-card
information on behalf of their clients. Some mobile-payment
systems store financial data on the device itself, which could
be more vulnerable to hackers. </p>
<p>Unlike EMV, mobile payments can help merchants boost
revenue. Mobile applications give businesses a way to track
loyalty-card holders, distribute coupons and publish ads. Mobile
apps can also let consumers scan items with their phones and
self-checkout from anywhere in the store. </p>
<p>Mobile payments can work in a variety of ways. Orange
Leaf''s app will let consumers scan a special QR code with their
phone at checkout. Consumers can use a credit card to upload
money to be used through the app. </p>
<p>While many retailers are enthusiastic about mobile
payments, consumers have been slow to embrace them. Starbucks
Corp.''s mobile app now has 10 million users after being
introduced nationwide in 2011, and mobile payments now account
for more than 14 percent of tender in its company-operated
stores in the U.S. and Canada. It takes time to train customers
and employees to use a new payment system. </p>
<h2>Slower Transactions </h2>
<p>EMV cards require their own learning curve and may also
lead to slower transactions since they have to be inserted into
in-store terminals throughout the entire checkout process.
Still, large stores will probably have to upgrade to EMV
technology because they tend to see more fraud. </p>
<p>''They, obviously, have far more to be concerned about, at
least in the initial liability-shift discussion,'' said Greg
Boardman, a senior vice president at Ingenico, one of the
world''s biggest EMV-terminal makers. ''Having said that, the
small merchant doesn''t have the financial resources to absorb a
lot of fraud loss.'' </p>

<p>America Movil SAB (AMXL) and Grupo Televisa
SAB (TLEVICPO) are being permitted by Mexican officials to keep their
current deals to broadcast exclusive sports programming, though
they can''t strike similar agreements in the future for certain

<p>The Federal Telecommunications Institute, or IFT, said a
regulation passed last week that limits the companies'' ability
to acquire exclusive programming rights doesn''t apply
retroactively, the agency said in a statement. </p>
<p>Televisa, which gets about 70 percent of Mexico''s broadcast

many of those games are exclusive. America Movil, which has an

<p>BP Plc (BP/), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) are among two dozen U.S. refiners sued by Vermont Attorney
General William Sorrell and accused of polluting the state''s
groundwater with a gasoline additive. </p>
<p>Sorrell filed the case today in state court in Montpelier,
the capital. The refiners promoted, marketed and distributed
gasoline containing the additive Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, or
MTBE, knowing that it posed ''unprecedented risks'' to
groundwater, Sorrell''s office said in a statement. </p>
<p>''These companies knew years ago that MTBE was a uniquely
bad actor in groundwater, and they ignored the risks and sold it
anyway,'' Sorrell said. ''This lawsuit is about holding them
accountable and ensuring that they -- and not Vermonters -- pay
to clean up our groundwater.'' </p>
<p>The suit is one of scores of claims filed by cities, states
and individuals around the U.S. against oil refiners, retailers
and distributors over MTBE. The U.S. Supreme Court in April
upheld a jury''s $104.7 million damage award against Exxon Mobil
for contaminating New York City wells with the additive. </p>
<p>New York sued oil companies in 2003, alleging they knew the
additive would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil argued that
state laws are pre-empted by the federal Clean Air Act, which
required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce air
pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE to
make it burn more efficiently. </p>
<h2>Exxon Statement </h2>
<p>An Exxon Mobil spokesman, Todd Spitler, said the company is
reviewing the state''s claims. The foundation of MTBE litigation
is flawed because companies are being held liable for including
oxygenates in gasoline that were required by Congress and
approved by regulators, he said by e-mail. </p>
<p>''Companies that complied with the law and regulations to
blend approved oxygenates in gasoline should not be held liable
simply for following a government mandate,'' Spitler said. </p>
<p>There hasn''t been a single recorded case of anyone''s
becoming sick from MTBE water contamination, he said. The
company takes seriously its responsibility to operate in an
''environmentally sound manner'' and works hard to protect the
health and safety of the communities where it operates, he said. </p>
<p>A Chevron spokesman, Braden Reddall, said the company will
''review the complaint once we are served.'' </p>
<p>Carlton Carroll, an American Petroleum Institute spokesman,
declined to comment on the suit. Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for
the American Fuel  Petrochemical Manufacturers, didn''t
immediately respond to requests for comment. </p>
<h2>State Findings </h2>
<p>While MTBE is banned as a gasoline additive in Vermont, the
state''s Agency of Natural Resources continues to oversee
remediation of past releases and keeps finding new contaminated
wells, according to Sorrell''s office. </p>
<p>The state claims violations of its Groundwater Protection
Act and alleges that the refiners used MTBE as an additive
despite knowing it was hazardous and would pollute groundwater,
and that they failed to inform state regulators, resellers or
consumers of the hazards and how to mitigate them. </p>
<p>The case is State of Vermont v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,
Vermont Superior Court, Washington County (Montpelier). </p>

second four-year term. Investors are betting that a new
president will interfere less in state-controlled companies such
as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, bolstering their prospects. </p>
<p>''If the national team ''crashes and burns'' in the Cup, or
if the tournament suffers a major organizational catastrophe,
widespread social discontent could ensue,'' Jorge Mariscal, the
chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS Wealth
Management, wrote. ''However, short-term economic pain and anti-Dilma sentiment could be good for financial markets.'' </p>
<p>The elections, expectations for a Brazil victory as well as
an ''unstable'' social situation evident in street protests over
$11 billion in spending tied to the games, make this year''s
tournament especially important for markets, UBS said. In
addition to how well the team fares, Rousseff''s popularity could
also be hurt by traffic jams and other problems that expose
Brazil''s lack of preparation, Mariscal said. </p>
<p>''Investors should get ready to carefully follow
developments not only inside the soccer stadium, but also on the
streets of Brazil''s largest cities,'' UBS said. </p>
<h2>Goldman Call </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs recommended buying Brazilian assets in a May
28 report, saying history shows a win will boost the country''s
stock markets in the weeks after the final. </p>
<p>The victor country''s equity markets outperform global
stocks by 3.5 percentage points in dollar terms on average in
the first month after winning, ''although the outperformance
fades significantly after three months,'' according to Goldman. </p>
<p>UBS, which looked at the winning nations'' stock markets in
local currency terms since the 1974 World Cup, said the winner
underperformed global equities in the week after the final in
six of eight times, with a median underperformance of 0.7
percent. Considering one-month returns after the World Cup, the
median nation outperformed by 0.7 percent. </p>
<p>While the analysts are split on the effect of a win on the
country''s assets, they agree that Brazil is likely to get a
record sixth title at Rio de Janeiro''s Maracana stadium next
month. UBS called the team as the ''clear favorite,'' joining
Goldman, Danske Bank A/S and Unicredit SpA, who all predicted
the host team will beat Argentina in the final match. </p>
<h2>Support Slips </h2>
<p>Rousseff''s support fell to 34 percent this month from 37
percent in May, according to a Datafolha poll published today on
Folha de Sao Paulo''s website. All of Rousseff''s challengers
together garnered 35 percent, a gap from the front-runner that
is within the two-percentage-point margin of error in the June
3-5 survey. To win in the first round a candidate needs to have
more than 50 percent support, or more votes than all other
candidates combined. </p>
<p>The Ibovespa jumped 3 percent today in Sao Paulo as state-run companies surged after the poll results. Petrobras, as the
state-controlled oil producer is known, added 8.3 percent to
17.68 reais, the biggest one-day advance since March 2013. </p>

<p>Walter Investment Management Corp. (WAC),
the third-largest non-bank mortgage servicer, has been 
expanding while its bigger rivals shrink amid probes from 
regulators. </p>
<p>Walter Investment, which was spun off from a coal-mining
and homebuilding conglomerate in 2009, increased its mortgage
servicing business by 20 percent in the first quarter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg from regulatory filings. Tampa,
Florida-based Walter Investment rose to No. 3 in the period by
surpassing PHH Corp. (PHH) </p>
<p>The business of collecting mortgage payments is undergoing
a transformation as large banks retreat from the $9.4 trillion
market and regulators investigate non-bank servicers. The two
largest non-bank operators, Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) and Nationstar
Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NSM), both lost market share in the first
quarter, while Walter Investment enlarged its loan holdings to
$234 billion, according to company filings. </p>
<p>''The huge shift in servicing from banks to non-banks has
created a landscape that''s rapidly changing,'' said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of research firm Federal Financial
Analytics Inc. in Washington. ''No one can know who the winners
and the losers will be until the dust settles.'' </p>
<p>Walter Investment had a 2.4 percent share of the servicing
market in the first quarter compared with Ocwen''s 4.5 percent
and Nationstar''s 3.9 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Wells
Fargo  Co. led with 18 percent. </p>
<p>Walter Investment''s stock price gained 13 percent to $28.99
from the beginning of May through June 4, exceeding the 11
percent advance by Lewisville, Texas-based Nationstar, which is
majority owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC. (FIG) Atlanta-based
Ocwen, which is controlled by billionaire founder''William Erbey,
gained 3.1 percent in the period. </p>
<h2>Lawsky Probes </h2>
<p>The New York Department of Financial Services is
investigating both Ocwen and Nationstar. The companies about
doubled their holdings of mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs, in
2013, according to company reports. </p>
<p>Ocwen said on Feb. 6 that the department had blocked its
deal to buy $39 billion of servicing rights from Wells Fargo. </p>
<p>''It is appropriate for regulators, where warranted, to
halt the explosive growth in the nonbank mortgage servicing
industry'' to protect homeowners, Benjamin Lawsky, the
department''s head, said a week later in a speech in New York. </p>
<p>Lawsky also sent a letter in February to Ocwen citing his
concerns about potential conflicts of interest among four
companies headed by Erbey that provide mortgage-related services
to each other. </p>
<p>In a letter to Nationstar in March, the regulator said it
was probing the impact of the firm''s rapid growth on homeowners
and asked for data about its servicing. </p>
<h2>Ocwen Shrinks </h2>
<p>Both companies have disputed Lawsky''s comments, saying they
have better performance records than the nation''s biggest banks.
The companies are cooperating with the probes. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Ocwen and Nationstar declined to comment for
this story. </p>
<p>Ocwen''s loan portfolio dropped 3.2 percent to $440.7
billion in the first quarter, and Nationstar''s portfolio fell
7.5 percent to $384 billion. PHH, which also manages car and
truck fleets, declined 1 percent to $225.7 billion, putting it
in fourth place. </p>
<p>''Walter is buying loans, and in the last few months we''ve
seen a slowdown in the acquisitions by Ocwen and Nationstar,''
said Douglas Harter, a director and servicing analyst at Credit
Suisse Group in New York. ''Ocwen and Nationstar will have to
adjust to a different environment where deal sizes are smaller
and there is more focus on integration. That''s going to slow
them down.'' </p>
<p>Two years ago, Walter Investment and other non-banks held
MSRs on less than 2 percent of U.S. home loans. Banks have been
selling these rights since the Federal Reserve began drafting
new rules in 2012 to implement an international banking
agreement known as Basel III aimed at preventing the type of
financial shock seen in 2008. </p>
<h2>New Rules </h2>
<p>The agreement increases the amount of capital banks are
required to have to hold MSRs on their books. Non-banks such as
Walter Investment are not bound by the new rules. </p>
<p>Today, non-banks control a total of about 14 percent of the
market, according to Bloomberg data. In the next two years,
banks probably will sell another $1 trillion in MSRs, according
to Harter. That would push the non-bank share to 24 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Walter Investment is also under scrutiny. In February, the
company disclosed in a filing that the Federal Trade Commission
and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau informed it of a
possible enforcement action. The details have not been made
public. </p>
<h2>Mortgage Settlement </h2>
<p>''We''re currently in discussions,'' said Denmar Dixon,
Walter Investment''s chief investment officer. ''We''d like to
find a resolution to that in the near term. Right now, we can''t
predict when that will come.'' </p>
<p>Joseph Smith, who oversees a $25 billion mortgage
settlement between state and federal agencies and five banks,
said in May that Green Tree Servicing LLC, a unit of Walter
Investment, didn''t use proper procedures in servicing loans it
bought last year from Residential Capital LLC, a company covered
by the agreement. The former ResCap loans make up about 14
percent of Walter''s portfolio. </p>
<p>''This was our first time through the testing,'' said
Dixon. ''We are a pretty compliant shop, and highly rated. This
was layered on top of that. We will be tested again on the
metrics,'' and expect to pass, he said. </p>
<h2>Green Tree </h2>
<p>Compass Point Research  Trading LLC in March ranked Walter
Investment as the top performer among all loan servicers, based
on customer-complaint data from CFPB. Walter had a 0.8 percent
complaint ratio when measured against the amount of delinquent
loans in its portfolio, followed by Nationstar at 1.3 percent
and Ocwen at 2 percent. The average rate for servicers, most of
them banks, was 4.3 percent. </p>
<p>Mark O''Brien, CEO of Walter Investment, has his roots in
the homebuilding industry. He was CEO of PulteGroup Inc. in
2001, when it was known as Pulte Homes, and oversaw the $1.8
billion purchase of Del Webb that created what was then the
nation''s largest residential builder. </p>
<p>O''Brien left Pulte in 2003, saying he was retiring. In
2005, he joined Walter Industries Inc. as a director and in 2009
became head of Walter Investment when it was spun off. </p>
<p>Walter Investment has more than tripled its holdings of
MSRs under O''Brien''s leadership. Last year, the company acquired
servicing rights on more than $125 billion of mortgages from
companies including Bank of America Corp., according to Walter
regulatory filings. </p>
<p>''O''Brien comes from a homebuilder background that includes
financing those home purchases and really knowing those
customers,'' said Credit Suisse''s Harter. ''It''s a good platform
for building a large-scale servicer.'' </p>

<p>David Blitzer had his eye on Addy Loudiadis''s business at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for years. </p> <p>By the middle of 2013, the Blackstone Group LP (BX) dealmaker had his shot. Pressured by regulators to boost capital under new rules, the bank started looking for investors to take pieces of Rothesay Life Ltd., the insurer that Loudiadis heads in London. Blitzer, whose private-equity firm historically has to control companies it buys, was fine taking a minority stake in a Goldman cash cow.

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer services provider, and Epic
Systems Corp. will team up to compete for an $11 billion project
to manage U.S. troops'' electronic health records. </p>
<p>IBM announced its plans to bid today, even before the
Defense Department formally starts the competition for the
information-technology system. Rival bids may come from
Accenture Plc (ACN) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) </p>
<p>The winner gets one of the biggest opportunities in federal
information technology, where new projects are under scrutiny
after the flawed rollout of the Obamacare website. A better
Pentagon system is needed so troops'' health records can be
shared quickly with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is
struggling to reduce backlogs in disability claims. </p>
<p>''I hope people expect results, because this is where we
show up,'' Andy Maner, managing partner for IBM''s U.S. federal
division, said in a phone interview. ''We don''t bid on
everything, but when we do, we want to change the world.'' </p>
<p>The Pentagon''s solicitation for the contract, possibly with
a 10-year duration, may be posted as early as next month, Maner
said. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, already has more than 100
employees working to develop a proposal, he said. </p>
<p>''This has been a thing we''ve had circled for more than
three years,'' Maner said. </p>
<h2>Website Fixes </h2>
<p>The contract may attract bids from companies such as
Dublin-based Accenture and Falls Church, Virginia-based
Northrop, according to Brian Friel, a Bloomberg Industries
analyst. </p>
<p>The U.S. government this year turned to Accenture for help
fixing healthcare.gov, the enrollment website for the federal
health-care overhaul. The company succeeds Montreal-based CGI
Group Inc. (GIB/A), criticized for the website''s early troubles. </p>
<p>Other competitors for the Pentagon program might include
Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Reston,
Virginia-based Leidos Holdings Inc. (LDOS), Friel said. </p>
<p>Northrop built the original system, which is now being
maintained by Leidos, he said. </p>
<p>The planned system, which will replace the older one, will
track U.S. forces'' health records no matter where they receive
care, whether on base, on a ship, in a military hospital or
close to combat. It will handle the health records of 9.7
million beneficiaries, including active-duty military, retirees
and their dependents. </p>
<h2>Epic''s Software </h2>
<p>''Service members, their families and health-care providers
who care for them deserve the best health care our country can
provide,'' Carl Dvorak, president of Verona, Wisconsin-based
Epic, said in a statement. ''They would benefit from an
integrated system that leverages best practices from other large
and successful health-care organizations.'' </p>
<p>Epic''s enterprise software is widely used in the health-care industry, including by Johns Hopkins Medicine, Kaiser
Permanente and the Cleveland Clinic. </p>
<p>IBM and Epic have worked together on other health-care
projects, including for Kaiser. </p>
<p>IBM was the 51st biggest federal contractor in the fiscal
year that ended Sept. 30, receiving $1.2 billion in prime, or
direct, awards, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company ranked 45th in 2012, when it had $1.5 billion in U.S.
contracts. </p>
<p>The IBM-Epic collaboration will be led by Keith Salzman, a
former Army hospital chief medical information officer who is
now IBM''s chief medical information officer, and use technology
from its Watson supercomputer, best known for beating human
contestants on the ''Jeopardy!'' TV game show. </p>
<h2>Claims Backlog </h2>
<p>The Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs have
been pressured by lawmakers, White House officials and veterans
to help fix the VA''s backlog in processing disability claims.
The military has contributed to that bottleneck, some lawmakers
and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have said. </p>
<p>The Pentagon announced in May 2013 that it would build its
own electronic health-records system. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to work with the VA to develop a ''seamless
system.'' </p>
<p>The military''s plan raised concerns among lawmakers and
veterans'' organizations that had pushed the two agencies to
build a single system for current and former troops'' health
records. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs is not alone in questioning the ''new neutral,'' the level at which the Fed benchmark neither stimulates nor slows the economy. The term was coined by Bloomberg News in a March 17 report and then promoted by Gross''s Pacific Investment Management Co.

While Goldman Sachs still doesn''t expect the Fed to begin raising before 2016, it predicts the key rate will reach 4 percent at the end of 2018. </p>

<p>Foreign banks are projected by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to lend less money against commodity
inventories in China amid a probe into metals stockpiles in the
biggest consumer of raw materials. </p>
<p>Claims that single batches of copper and aluminum at
Qingdao Port were pledged as collateral for multiple loans risks
undermining a broader practice in which traders use everything
from iron ore to rubber to get funding. The investigation is
already weighing down copper prices and may curb foreign
exchange inflows to China, according to a report by Goldman. </p>
<p>The probe may affect metals stockpiles at the northeastern
port held by Citic Resources Holdings Ltd., the trader
controlled by China''s largest state-owned company said today.
Standard Chartered Plc said last week it was reviewing financing
to some companies in China and Standard Bank Group started
looking at ''potential irregularities'' with metals at Qingdao.
Citigroup Inc. said it would work closely with authorities and
warehousing companies to resolve any problems for clients. </p>
<p>''The developments in Qingdao are likely to continue the
significant scaling back of FX inflows from foreign banks into
China via commodity financing business,'' analysts at New York-based Goldman said in the report dated yesterday. ''As foreign
banks reduce their exposure to Chinese commodity financing
deals, the profitability of these could be reduced
meaningfully.'' </p>
<h2>Price Drop </h2>
<p>Copper in London may fall to $6,200 a metric ton before the
end of this year, analysts including Roger Yuan and Max Layton
said in a report. Benchmark three-month futures on the London
Metal Exchange slumped 9.7 percent this year and traded at
$6,645 at 5:45 p.m. Shanghai time, putting them on course for
the lowest closing price since May 1. </p>
<p>Currency flows may be affected because Chinese borrowers
often use commodities as collateral to get low interest loans
from overseas lenders in dollars. They then bring the money
onshore to invest in the nation''s higher interest rate
environment before later repaying the sum. </p>
<p>Qingdao Port said in a June 6 statement that public
security authorities were probing alleged fraud involving
material held in its Dagang bonded storage area. </p>
<p>Public security authorities in Qingdao have not responded
to calls by Bloomberg News seeking comment. </p>
<p>''The authenticity of warehouse receipts is critical to the
practice of inventory financing in bonded warehouses,'' Barclays
Plc analyst Sijin Cheng wrote in a report last week. ''Feedback
from trading house contacts suggests that this investigation has
cast a pall on the financing trade as a whole.'' </p>
<h2>Port Shares </h2>
<p>Shares (6198) of Qingdao Port International Co., which listed on
the stock exchange in Hong Kong on June 5, have fallen 3.5
percent from their offer price to $HK3.63 today. </p>
<p>The investigation is into the owner of some metals and a
third party storing them in the Dagang area and not Qingdao Port
itself, according to the June 6 statement. </p>
<p>''The company continues to provide regular port services to
other clients and for all metal ore products, including aluminum
and copper products,'' it said. </p>
<p>Separately, some Chinese banks have raised margins for
letters of credit for iron ore financing to as much as 50
percent from as much as 30 percent previously, said two people
with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Others reduced overall credit available for iron ore
financing and set a cap on credit used in some locations
including Rizhao, a port located about 100 kilometers (65 miles)
southeast of Qingdao, according to the people, who asked not to
be identified because they aren''t authorized to speak publicly. </p>
<h2>Locked Gates </h2>
<p>The Dagang area has been sealed and gates to the area are
chained and padlocked, Reuters reported. The amount of metal
involved in the probe was about 20,000 tons of copper, almost
100,000 tons of aluminum ingots and about 200,000 tons of
alumina, Reuters said, citing a source it didn''t name. </p>
<p>Jiangxi Copper Co., China''s biggest smelter of the metal,
said the problems at Qingdao don''t represent a systemic risk and
won''t hurt demand or production of industrial metals. </p>
<p>As well as industrial metals, Qingdao port also handles
iron ore and agricultural commodities including cotton and
rubber. </p>
<p>Shanghai is China''s biggest port and storage center for
industrial metals. Copper inventories in bonded zones in
Shanghai were estimated to be about 815,000 tons in April by
CRU, a London-based consultant. Citrine Capital Management LLC
said in June that stockpiles in bonded warehouses across China
may be about 900,000 tons. </p>
<p>The probe will make China''s banks ''extremely cautious''
about financing deals, though lenders will continue to help fund
shipments to end-users, Colin Hamilton, Macquarie Group Ltd.''s
head of commodities research, said June 4. </p>
<p>Some copper may be moved from China to LME warehouses in
South Korea, and possibly Singapore and Malaysia, Jeremy Goldwyn, head of business development in Asia for Sucden
Financial Ltd., said June 5. </p>

<p>Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, set a ceiling for how
much it would pay for London-based AstraZeneca and wasn''t
willing to go over that limit, D''Amelio said today at an
investment conference organized by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
While New York-based Pfizer can approach AstraZeneca again after
a U.K. regulatory period ends in six months, D''Amelio said he
couldn''t comment about whether it will do so. </p>
<p>D''Amelio also said Pfizer''s attempt at a mega-merger
doesn''t rule out the possibility the company will instead break
up into smaller parts. AstraZeneca last month rejected a
takeover offer valued at 55 pounds a share. </p>
<p>''In a word it was price,'' that kept the two companies
from sealing a deal, D''Amelio said. ''Any other issues that were
raised during negotiations and conversations I think we were
able to adequately, effectively address those.'' </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer was seeking to lower its tax rate
through the deal by moving its official headquarters to London.
The company also sought to gain from AstraZeneca''s experimental
immune therapy cancer drugs, a new class of treatments that
would have filled a hole in Pfizer''s product portfolio.
AstraZeneca has predicted those products may help raise its
annual sales by 75 percent to $45 billion by 2023. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer-services provider, has joined with Epic Systems Corp. to compete for an $11 billion project to manage U.S. troops'' electronic health records. </p> <p>IBM announced its plans to bid yesterday, before the Pentagon''s official start of the competition. Rival bids for the information-technology contract may come from Accenture Plc (ACN), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) and Leidos Holdings Inc. (LDOS), which said today it is interested in the work. </p> <p>The winner will get one of the biggest opportunities in federal information technology, where new projects are under more scrutiny after the flawed rollout of the Obamacare website. An improved military system is needed so troops'' health records can be shared faster with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is struggling to reduce backlogs in disability claims. </p> <p>''I hope people expect results, because this is where we show up,'' said Andy Maner, managing partner for IBM''s U.S. federal division. ''We don''t bid on everything, but when we do, we want to change the world.'' </p> <p>The Pentagon''s solicitation for the contract, possibly with a 10-year duration, may be posted as early as next month, Maner said. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, already has more than 100 employees working to develop a proposal, he said. </p> <p>''This has been a thing we''ve had circled for more than three years,'' Maner said. </p> <h2>Website Fixes </h2> <p>Leidos, based in Reston, Virginia, has ''unmatched depth and breadth of experience'' in commercial and government electronic health-record systems, Melissa Koskovich, a Leidos spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today when asked about the prospect of seeking the contract. </p> <p>''We look forward to the opportunity to respond to the needs of this important program,'' she said. </p> <p>The contract might also attract bids from companies such as Dublin-based Accenture, Falls Church, Virginia-based Northrop, and Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), according to Brian Friel, a Bloomberg Industries analyst. </p> <p>The U.S. government this year turned to Accenture for help fixing healthcare.gov, the enrollment website for the federal health-insurance overhaul. The company succeeded Montreal-based CGI Group Inc. (GIB/A), criticized for the website''s early troubles. </p> <h2>U.S. Troops </h2> <p>Northrop built the original Pentagon health-records system, which is now being maintained by Leidos, Friel said. </p> <p>The system planned to replace the older one will track U.S. forces'' health records no matter where they receive care, whether on base, on a ship, in a military hospital or close to combat. It will handle the records of 9.7 million beneficiaries, including active-duty military, retirees and their dependents. </p> <p>''Service members, their families and health-care providers who care for them deserve the best health care our country can provide,'' Carl Dvorak, president of Verona, Wisconsin-based Epic, said in a statement. ''They would benefit from an integrated system that leverages best practices from other large and successful health-care organizations.'' </p> <p>Epic''s enterprise software is widely used in the health-care industry, including by Johns Hopkins Medicine, Kaiser Permanente and the Cleveland Clinic. </p> <p>IBM and Epic have worked together on other health-care projects, including for Kaiser. </p> <p>IBM was the 51st biggest federal contractor in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, receiving $1.2 billion in prime -- or direct -- awards, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <h2>Watson Supercomputer </h2> <p>The IBM-Epic collaboration will be led by Keith Salzman, a former Army hospital chief medical information officer who is IBM''s chief medical information officer. It will use technology from its Watson supercomputer, best known for beating human contestants on the ''Jeopardy!'' television game show. </p> <p>The Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs have been pressured by lawmakers, White House officials and veterans to help fix the VA''s backlog in processing disability claims. The military has contributed to that bottleneck, some lawmakers and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have said. </p> <p>The Pentagon said in May 2013 that it would build its own electronic health-records system. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to work with the VA to develop a ''seamless system.'' </p> <p>The military''s plan raised concerns among lawmakers and veterans'' organizations that had pushed the two agencies to build a single system for current and former troops'' health records. </p> <p>', 'IBM-Epic Team Vies for $11 Billion Pentagon IT System', 'By Jonathan D.

<p>Coca production in Peru fell at the
fastest pace in 14 years in 2013 and cocaine prices soared as
the government stepped up eradication efforts, United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime said. </p>
<p>The area under cultivation dropped 18 percent to 49,800
hectares (123,058 acres), Flavio Mirella, head of the agency''s
Peruvian office, said at the presentation of its annual coca
report. The price of pure cocaine made from coca leaves surged
to $1,310 a kilogram, a 15-year high, from $993 in 2012. </p>
<p>President Ollanta Humala increased spending on eradication
and crop substitution after Peru overtook Colombia in 2012 to
become the world''s largest grower of coca leaf. It is not clear
whether the country retains that title as the agency hasn''t yet
published surveys of coca cultivation in Colombia and Bolivia
for 2013. </p>
<p>Coca eradication has been expanded to parts of the country
''previously considered untouchable'' such as the Monzon Valley,
''an area dominated for more than 40 years by drug traffickers
and coca growers, and where the local population traditionally
violently rejected any intervention by the state,'' the report
said. </p>
<p>Peru, Colombia and Bolivia are the world''s biggest
producers of coca leaf, Mirella said. Cultivation in Peru fell
3.4 percent in 2012 after expanding for seven straight years. </p>
<p>The price of cocaine from Peru doubles as it gets to the
border with Bolivia, one of the transport routes for the drug,
Mirella said. On the streets of New York the drug sells at
around $30,000 to $40,000 a kilogram, while in cities in Asia
the price rises to about $80,000 to $100,000. </p>

<p>A four-decade-old U.S. ban on crude
exports should remain until a ''saturation'' point when domestic
refining capacity can''t absorb increased oil production,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>Maintaining the statutory curb on shipments overseas will
deliver the ''highest value'' to the U.S. economy, the bank said
in an e-mailed report today. At current extraction costs, the
export ban may start to weigh on U.S. output growth in coming
years, it predicted. </p>
<p>''The Goldman view is very credible,'' said Sarah Emerson,
managing principal of ESAI Energy Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. ''Refiners are processing increasing output here
and that''s a greater benefit to the economy.'' </p>
<p>Rising production from shale formations has allowed the
U.S., the world''s biggest oil consumer, to import less crude,
fueling speculation that the curb on exports could be lifted. A
1975 federal law bans most shipments overseas, with only
deliveries of refined products including gasoline and diesel
allowed. Supporters of the ban say keeping U.S.-produced oil at
home helps reduce fuel prices for industry and consumers. </p>
<h2>''Optimal Decision'' </h2>
<p>''Keeping the ban in place would be the optimal decision
until saturation is reached to maximize the contribution of the
refining sector,'' said Damien Courvalin, a Goldman analyst in
New York. ''Once saturation is reached, it would then be optimal
to lift the ban as value added from higher production
outperforms value added from the refining sectors.'' </p>
<p>Uncertainty over the future of the ban is probably delaying
investment in U.S. refining capacity, according to Goldman. Oil
companies are seeking ways around it by using simple, one-step
plants capable of turning crude into products for exports. BP
Plc signed on to take at least 80 percent of the capacity of a
new $360 million mini-refinery in Houston that will process just
enough to escape the restrictions. </p>
<p>IHS Inc. last month said the ban should be lifted because
the U.S. will benefit from higher oil production and reduced
gasoline prices. The nation may save an average of $67 billion a
year from its import bill in 2016 and add 964,000 jobs by 2018,
according to the Colorado-based consultant. </p>
<h2>''Premature'' Urgency </h2>
<p>''The urgency of the debate has been premature,'' Emerson
said. ''We aren''t at the saturation point and won''t be for a
long time because there are a bunch of ways refiners are able to
transform these molecules and make products for export.'' </p>
<p>U.S. crude production rose 77,000 barrels a day to 8.46
million last week, the Energy Information Administration said
today. Output reached 8.47 million barrels a day in the week
ended May 23, the most since October 1986, according to the EIA,
the Energy Department''s statistical arm. </p>

<p>The calm that has descended on
financial markets has longer to run if history is any guide. </p>
<p>Having coined the phrase Great Moderation 2.0 to describe
the lull back in April, JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s John Normand is
comparing this moment to periods of tranquility over the past
three decades. </p>
<p>His findings suggest the quiescence is here to stay for a
while, meaning investors may be lulled into taking ever-greater
risks. </p>
<p>The bank''s head of foreign-exchange and international-rates
strategy in London characterizes low volatility in the currency
market as when swings in the Group of 10 major currencies slip
and stay below 7 percent on a trailing three-month basis. </p>
<p>While that happened for 45 business days as of the end of
last week, the average timeframe of similar episodes since the
1980s is 150 days. They ranged in length from three months when
the Federal Reserve paused its easing of monetary policy in 2002
to almost two years during the so-called Goldilocks era of the
late 1990s when the U.S. economy was neither too hot nor too
cold. </p>
<p>''The current undershoot is quiet immature by the
historical norm,'' Normand wrote in a June 6 research note. </p>
<p>More often than not, the Fed is the key. The last market
lull ran for 156 business days and ended in May 2013 with the
''taper tantrum'' when Fed officials began suggesting they would
soon start slowing monthly asset purchases. </p>
<p>''As most would acknowledge, central bank predictability is
bearish for volatility,'' he said. ''The current backdrop is
textbook.'' </p>
<p>This time, the calm may continue unless U.S. inflation data
or wage pressures force the Fed into tightening policy sooner
than markets anticipate or if a geopolitical crisis blows up,
said Normand. A Bloomberg News survey of economists in May
suggested the consensus doesn''t expect the Fed to raise its
benchmark before the third quarter of next year. </p>
<p>Until these risks emerge ''this vol undershoot has further
to run,'' he said. </p>

<p>A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader who helped lead the firm''s bets against subprime
mortgages before the financial crisis asked a court to throw out
an arbitration ruling denying him more than $20 million in
unpaid compensation. </p>
<p>Deeb Salem encountered a ''kangaroo court'' and a
''shocking and blatant miscarriage of justice'' as Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators didn''t allow him to
call some of Goldman Sachs''s top trading executives as
witnesses, he said in a complaint today in New York State
Supreme Court. Salem, 35, said in the complaint that members of
the industry-funded regulator''s arbitration panel called his
case ''ridiculous'' and ''bulls---'' during a hearing. </p>
<p>Salem left the firm in May 2012, a year after a U.S. Senate
subcommittee said he and other Goldman Sachs traders tried to
manipulate prices of derivatives linked to subprime home loans
in 2007 for their own benefit. The subcommittee''s assertions
were based in part on Salem''s discussion of an attempted short
squeeze in his self-evaluation, a finding which Salem said ''put
too much emphasis on ''words,'''' according to the Senate report. </p>
<p>The three-person Finra arbitration panel said in a March 17
decision to dismiss his case that even if the witnesses said
what Salem maintained they would, he hadn''t established a
legally enforceable claim for the bonus money. </p>
<p>''Employees trade their rights to go litigate in court and
get smart judges to review their circumstance in exchange for an
expedited hearing on the merits,'' Jonathan Sack, Salem''s
lawyer, said in a telephone interview. ''Deeb Salem got
neither.'' </p>
<h2>''A Scapegoat'' </h2>
<p>Sack said his client was ''used as a scapegoat'' by Goldman
Sachs after criticism of the firm. Salem left the bank on his
own accord and started at New York-based hedge-fund firm
GoldenTree Asset Management LP a few months later. </p>
<p>His arbitration claim seeks $6.15 million in deferred
compensation, $10 million in ''bonus true-up'' for 2010 and
2011, and $5 million as a pro-rata bonus for his 2012 work. </p>
<p>Martin Zern, chairman of the arbitration panel, didn''t
return a phone message left at a listed number. Tiffany Galvin,
a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said the firm
wouldn''t comment on litigation and Finra''s Michelle Ong declined
to comment. </p>
<p>Company documents show Goldman Sachs traders in 2007 sought
to encourage a ''short squeeze'' by putting artificially low
prices on derivatives that would gain in value as mortgage
securities fell, according to a 2011 report by the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. The idea, abandoned after market
conditions worsened, was to drive holders of such credit-default
swaps to sell and help Goldman Sachs traders buy at reduced
prices, according to the report. </p>
<h2>Short Squeeze </h2>
<p>''We began to encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting
very short again,'' Salem said in a 2007 self-evaluation
excerpted in the report. In interviews with the committee, Salem
denied attempting a short squeeze and ''claimed that he had
wrongly worded his self-evaluation,'' the report said. </p>
<p>The case is Salem v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 651811/2014, New
York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs was among financial firms including Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. sued over more than $1.8
billion in mortgage-backed securities in 2012 by Phoenix Light
SF Ltd., a company based in Dublin that inherited claims from
six legal entities ''that collapsed or nearly collapsed,''
according to court filings. </p>
<p>The entities include WestLB, the 180-year-old German state-owned lender, based in Dusseldorf, that ceased operations in
2012 as part of European Union conditions tied to a 17 billion-euro ($23 billion) bailout after the 2008 financial crisis,
according to a complaint. </p>
<p>Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
worst recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the market for the securities evaporated. </p>
<h2>No Request </h2>
<p>The plaintiffs said Goldman Sachs didn''t share the files
for the loans underlying the securities. Ramos said there were
no allegations that that they asked for them and Goldman Sachs
denied access. </p>
<p>''It does not matter if the failure to seek this
information was because of blind faith in the process of
origination and/or securitization, or if it was attributable to
the desire to quickly get on board of what the investors thought
was a profitable bandwagon,'' the judge wrote. ''The obligation
of a sophisticated investor to inquire cannot be merely
excused.'' </p>

<p>A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader who helped lead the firm''s bets against subprime
mortgages before the financial crisis asked a court to throw out
an arbitration ruling denying him more than $20 million in
unpaid compensation. </p>
<p>Deeb Salem encountered a ''kangaroo court'' and a
''shocking and blatant miscarriage of justice'' as Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators didn''t allow him to
call some of Goldman Sachs''s top trading executives as
witnesses, he said in a complaint yesterday in New York State
Supreme Court. Salem, 35, said in the complaint that members of
the industry-funded regulator''s arbitration panel called his
case ''ridiculous'' and ''bulls---'' during a hearing. </p>
<p>Salem left the firm in May 2012, a year after a U.S. Senate
subcommittee said he and other Goldman Sachs traders tried to
manipulate prices of derivatives linked to subprime home loans
in 2007 for their own benefit. The subcommittee''s assertions
were based in part on Salem''s discussion of an attempted short
squeeze in his self-evaluation, a finding which Salem said ''put
too much emphasis on ''words,'''' according to the Senate report. </p>
<p>The three-person Finra arbitration panel said in a March 17
decision to dismiss his case that even if the witnesses said
what Salem maintained they would, he hadn''t established a
legally enforceable claim for the bonus money. </p>
<p>''Employees trade their rights to go litigate in court and
get smart judges to review their circumstance in exchange for an
expedited hearing on the merits,'' Jonathan Sack, Salem''s
lawyer, said in a telephone interview. ''Deeb Salem got
neither.'' </p>
<h2>''A Scapegoat'' </h2>
<p>Sack said his client was ''used as a scapegoat'' by Goldman
Sachs after criticism of the firm. Salem left the bank on his
own accord and started at New York-based hedge-fund firm
GoldenTree Asset Management LP a few months later. </p>
<p>His arbitration claim seeks $6.15 million in deferred
compensation, $10 million in ''bonus true-up'' for 2010 and
2011, and $5 million as a pro-rata bonus for his 2012 work. </p>
<p>Martin Zern, chairman of the arbitration panel, didn''t
return a phone message left at a listed number. Tiffany Galvin,
a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said the firm
wouldn''t comment on litigation and Finra''s Michelle Ong declined
to comment. </p>
<p>Company documents show Goldman Sachs traders in 2007 sought
to encourage a ''short squeeze'' by putting artificially low
prices on derivatives that would gain in value as mortgage
securities fell, according to a 2011 report by the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. The idea, abandoned after market
conditions worsened, was to drive holders of such credit-default
swaps to sell and help Goldman Sachs traders buy at reduced
prices, according to the report. </p>
<h2>Short Squeeze </h2>
<p>''We began to encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting
very short again,'' Salem said in a 2007 self-evaluation
excerpted in the report. In interviews with the committee, Salem
denied attempting a short squeeze and ''claimed that he had
wrongly worded his self-evaluation,'' the report said. </p>
<p>The case is Salem v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 651811/2014, New
York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Sony Corp. (6758)''s PlayStation 4 beat Microsoft Corp.

<p>Corporate-bond buyers are
increasingly becoming stock pickers. </p>
<p>High-yield debt funds boosted their allocations to equities
to 3.2 percent in March from 3.1 percent in December and 2.1
percent at the end of 2012, Morgan Stanley (MS) data show. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) strategists suggested others do the same, last week
advising investors to cut their credit holdings as yields
dwindle and switch to equities instead. </p>
<p>While the outlook for American businesses still looks
pretty good to investors, they''re growing uneasy about owning
bonds that offer some of the lowest yields in history. That
angst is only made worse by the reduced liquidity that''s
resulted from banks pulling back in debt trading, raising
concern that the market will spiral downward when everyone tries
to sell at once. </p>
<p>''We see credit as relatively over-owned and valued versus
other risk assets,'' JPMorgan strategists led by Jan Loeys wrote
in a June 13 report. ''Investors are beginning to worry about
how the eventual exit will fare in a world of reduced market
making by banks.'' </p>
<p>Equities look more attractive because they haven''t
benefited as much as company debt from the easy-money policies
of central banks across the globe, according to the analysts. </p>
<h2>Trading Drops </h2>
<p>Corporate bonds may also be hurt more in a sell-off because
the biggest dealers are reducing their fixed-income inventories
in response to risk-curbing regulations, causing trading volumes
to drop. </p>
<p>While the size of the investment-grade company-bond market
ballooned 82 percent since the end of 2008, trading volumes only
increased 72 percent in the period, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data.
Since the end of April, an average $13 billion of the debt has
been exchanged each day, compared with $13.8 billion in the
period last year. </p>
<p>That hasn''t mattered much -- at least not yet -- because
central banks have been pumping more and more stimulus into the
global economy, pushing investors into riskier assets. That''s
made for a one-way market in bonds, with few wanting to sell
investment-grade notes that have rallied 61 percent since 2008,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>So, what happens when sentiment reverses? JPMorgan analysts
suggest investors may want to cut their credit positions before
finding out. </p>
<h2>Buying Stocks </h2>
<p>Junk-bond buyers earned 3.46 percentage points more than
benchmark rates to own U.S. speculative-grade securities as of
June 10, the lowest since 2007 and 2.41 percentage points lower
than the two-decade average. That means fewer potential gains
and a smaller cushion against a bear market. </p>
<p>''We are indeed at that point of the cycle where one should
not expect that much more spread tightening,'' the JPMorgan
strategists wrote. ''We prefer to take more risk in equities and
we now cut the size of our U.S. high-yield spread trade by one-third.'' </p>
<p>Managers of junk-bond mutual funds seem to agree. They
increased the proportion of assets that fall outside of
benchmark indexes to 15 percent of holdings as of March from
14.6 percent in December, according to a June 6 report by Morgan
Stanley. They boosted allocations to stocks, securitized debt
and loans, the data show. </p>
<p>While almost all U.S. markets may look expensive right now,
equities may be a better bet than bonds when central banks
start yanking their stimulus. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is introducing a new
Internet-based service that helps companies use data analysis to
predict behavior, in a bid to gain more customers in the fast-growing field of machine learning. </p>
<p>The service lets users more easily build algorithms to
predict purchasing patterns, electricity usage and more. The
work and results can be hosted on the Web through Microsoft''s
Azure cloud offering. The new product, dubbed Azure Machine
Learning, has been in a trial period for about a year and now
has about 100 customers testing it, said General Manager Eron
Kelly. </p>
<p>Microsoft, under new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella,
is trying to boost its focus on cloud software as more companies
gravitate to hosting data and other operations on the Web.
Nadella ran the cloud business before becoming CEO in February.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)''s Web Services business. </p>
<p>Machine learning, which is an artificial intelligence field
that involves constructing systems that automatically analyze
and learn from data, has been on the rise. Even as companies
collect more information, the challenge has been how to extract
value from it. As a result, the market for analysis software is
growing about 18 percent a year and will reach $6.5 billion by
2019, according to Transparency Market Research. </p>
<h2>Data Scientists </h2>
<p>''One of the challenges is as you create more data -- data
in and itself isn''t all that valuable,'' Kelly said. ''It''s the
insights you can create from it, and as the datasets get larger,
it becomes harder to analyze.'' </p>
<p>Microsoft said its new product can be used by full-fledged
data scientists to speed up their work, as well as by analysts
who aren''t trained in the mathematical underpinnings of the
field. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s own retail stores are using the software to
predict fraud, while another unnamed retailer is analyzing past
customer purchases to decide future inventory, said Kelly.

Microsoft hired from Amazon in July 2013. </p>

<p>Neither South Africa''s dominant
platinum union nor the top three producers it has targeted in an
almost five-month pay strike will emerge as winner from the
standoff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The companies will be left with damage to some mines and
delays while they get their workforce back up to speed, while
the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union will fall

said in a June 13 note to clients. </p>
<p>Union members late last week accepted a pay proposal ''in
principle'' from Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS), Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd. (IMP) and Lonmin Plc. (LMI) The AMCU has said it has
conditions to put to the companies before agreeing to a deal. </p>
<p>''We are not expecting any developments until the long
weekend is over,'' Alan Fine, a Johannesburg-based spokesman
representing the producers, said in an e-mail today. June 16 is
a public holiday in South Africa. AMCU Treasurer Jimmy Gama
didn''t answer a call or respond to a text message seeking
comment. </p>
<p>The union''s members have been on strike since Jan. 23 in
support of their demand to more than double basic monthly pay to
12,500 rand ($1,165). The producers'' latest offer includes wage
increases of as much as 1,000 rand. </p>
<p>AMCU members have raised conditions on issues including the
length of the agreement, back pay, increases in living-out
allowances and the reinstatement of jobs, union President Joseph Mathunjwa said at rallies last week. </p>
<h2>''Slightly Improved'' </h2>
<p>''We believe the deal is only slightly improved for workers
compared to the offer which was proposed within a month of the
strike,'' and was accepted by the union because of pressure from
members, Eugene King, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in in the
note. ''Mines will be damaged as panels will have collapsed,
while organizing and retraining workers will take time.'' </p>
<p>The three companies said they have lost 22.8 billion rand
($2.1 billion) in revenue in the longest and costliest strike in
South Africa, source of about 70 percent of the global platinum
mined. </p>
<p>''Lonmin will likely rebound strongly post-strike as
inventory can be converted to cash quickly and the mining
restart will see concentrate coming through'' in the next two
months, King wrote. Impala will be confronted by delays to new
shafts following the strike, he said. </p>

Such attempts are putting some of the biggest transactions under the magnifying glass, and are likely to become more common, especially in high-profile industries like telecommunications and healthcare. </p> <p>''Once in a blue moon, takeovers do spill into the public consciousness, and in terms of doing deals it completely changes the dynamics,'' said Stephen Blackshaw, a partner in London at law firm Sidley Austin LLP.

Director Rajat Gupta, convicted of insider trading in a scheme
masterminded by hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam, joined
his co-conspirator in a Massachusetts federal prison to begin
serving a two-year sentence. </p>
<p>Gupta, 65, reported today to the Federal Medical Center
Devens, where he''s assigned to a minimum-security satellite
camp, said Ed Ross, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Prisons. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year sentence in the

is possible the two could cross paths, Ross said. </p>
<p>Gupta last week failed in a last-ditch effort to remain
free while he appeals his conviction. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg refused to order his continued release on bail. </p>
<p>Gupta today lost his appeal of a $13.9 million civil fine
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal
appeals court in New York upheld the fine and an order
permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of
a public company and from associating with any broker or
investment adviser. </p>
<h2>Highest Profile </h2>
<p>A former McKinsey  Co. managing partner, Gupta is the
highest-profile executive convicted in a U.S. crackdown on
insider trading at hedge funds. Since August 2009, prosecutors
in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara have
charged 86 people with insider trading, with 81 cases resulting
in convictions, mostly through guilty pleas. </p>

<p>The big trend among the young and
restless in New York this summer is to bash Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. interns on Yik Yak, an anonymous social-media app. The big
trend for analysts covering Goldman is to bash the stock. </p>
<p>The average rating on Goldman Sachs shares has fallen to
3.21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that assigns a
score of 5 to ratings of buy or the equivalent, 3 to holds and 1
to sells. Apart from some similar scores earlier this year,
Goldman''s rating has never been lower in data starting in 2006. </p>
<p>Here''s a sample of the ribbing the summer associates are
taking on Yik Yak: ''GS interns clap when the plane lands.''
Here''s a sample of what analysts are saying about Goldman Sachs:
Trading revenue from fixed income, commodities and currencies
will drop 16 percent this quarter, according to Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co.''s Brad Hintz, who on June 5 cut his second-quarter earnings estimates by 8 percent to $3.35 a share. </p>
<p>The slump in Goldman''s ratings, not to mention the 6
percent drop in its stock this year, is a casualty of the
pervasive calm that has overtaken financial markets and sent
measures of volatility in various asset classes to multi-year,
if not record, lows. Citigroup Inc. has warned of a drop of as
much as 25 percent in second-quarter trading revenue and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent decline. </p>
<h2>''Never Move'' </h2>
<p>As Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn said at an investor
conference last month: ''What drives activity in our business is
volatility. If markets never move or don''t move, our clients
really don''t need to transact.'' </p>
<p>Analysts on average predict Goldman''s earnings per share
before unusual items will slide 16 percent this quarter, 2
percent next quarter and 9 percent in the final three months of
the year before rebounding 8 percent in all of 2015. </p>
<p>Goldman''s 3.21 analyst rating ranks the stock 68th among 83
financial stocks in the SP 500 and 14 percent below the average
3.72. Banks less reliant on trading revenue are faring better.
JPMorgan Chase ranks 11th among financials with a 4.3 rating;
Citigroup''s is 4.1; Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo  Co. are
each at about 3.9. </p>
<p>For the entire SP 500, Goldman''s consensus rating ranks it
440th and 16 percent below the average of 3.84. </p>
<p>While Goldman''s shares outperformed the benchmark stock
index by more than 9 percentage points in 2013 and 28 percentage
points in 2012, its 139 percent return including dividends is
far behind the SP 500''s 220 percent return and an almost 300
percent jump for financial shares since the start of the bull
market in 2009. </p>
<p>You can''t blame the summer interns for that. Even if,
according to Yik Yak, they all wait for the light to change
before crossing the street. </p>

<p>Macau will reduce the maximum number
of days that Chinese passport holders with transit visas can
stay in the city to five from seven, in an attempt to prevent
them from abusing the law. Casino shares dropped. </p>
<p>Transit visitors from China who don''t depart for another
destination within the five days will be in violation of the new
rules, effective July 1, and will be penalized upon their next
visit, the city''s Public Security Police Force said in a
statement yesterday. Repeat violations will result in denial of
entry, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Chinese tourists have been driving the revenue of casino
companies in the world''s largest gambling hub, including Sands
China Ltd. (1928) and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) They are
competing for gamblers by adding malls, theaters and restaurants
at their resorts. An improved rail connection and an increase in
hotel rooms are helping draw more vacationing Chinese to Macau
and the country''s only legal casinos. </p>
<p>''We do not think this new policy will have a measurable
impact on gaming revenue,'' Grant Govertsen at investment bank
Union Gaming Group said today. ''It is important to keep in mind
that most high-value casino customers typically come to Macau
about four times per year.'' Most visitors to Macau only stay a
day or two, he said. </p>
<p>Mainland Chinese tourists accounted for two-thirds of the
total visitors to Macau in the first quarter, according to
government data. Travelers to the Chinese city stayed for less
than two days on average in March. </p>
<h2>High-Stakes Segment </h2>
<p> MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) fell 1.4 percent to close at HK$24
in Hong Kong trading, while Wynn Macau Ltd. dropped 2.4 percent
and Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. declined 2.7 percent. Sands
China and SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) dropped 1.4 percent and 1 percent,
while Galaxy lost 1 percent. Hong Kong''s benchmark Hang Seng
Index fell 0.4 percent. </p>
<p>The regulatory change ''aims to prevent Chinese passport
holders from using transit as an excuse to stay in Macau, when
they actually have not gone to their destination,'' the
government department said in the statement. </p>
<p>In 2013, 2.08 million mainland Chinese arriving in Macau
using a transit visa didn''t go on to a third-party country,
representing 11.2 percent of total mainland Chinese visitors for
the year, Union Gaming''s Govertsen wrote in a note last month. </p>
<p>Casino operators in Macau are expanding their footprint in
the city. Galaxy is spending HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion) on the
resort''s second phase in the increasingly popular Cotai area.
The project is slated to add as many as 500 gaming tables and
1,300 rooms at JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels next year. </p>
<p>Macau casino revenue rose 9.3 percent to 32.4 billion
patacas ($4.1 billion) last month, according to data on the
website of the city''s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. </p>

A. Cohen''s family office, hired Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. prime
broker Seiji Onoe to head its Japan operations, said a person
with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Onoe will start his new job at the successor company to
Cohen''s hedge-fund firm SAC Capital Advisors LP in July, said
the person, who asked not to be identified as the information is
private. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Point72 at Sard
Verbinnen  Co. in New York, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Employees are leaving global banks, which are facing
tighter regulatory and public scrutiny on capital, trading
activities and compensation after the 2008 global financial
crisis. Against this backdrop, such moves can be considered
rational career management decisions, whereas seven or eight
years ago they could have been more negatively perceived, said
Paul Smith, the CFA Institute''s Asia-Pacific managing director. </p>
<p>''Opportunities in the banking sector are becoming harder
to come by as traditional forms of financing continue to be
squeezed by a combination of increasing regulation, the need to
deleverage balance sheets and investors'' lack of trust and
confidence in the sector,'' Smith said. </p>
<p>Onoe will oversee the Stamford, Connecticut-based company''s
Japan staff, including fund managers and analysts, in the newly
created position, the person said. He will be responsible for
business development, regulatory compliance, professional
development and performance management of the Japan team, said
the person. </p>
<h2>Millennium Hire </h2>
<p>Among others, Millennium Management LLC hired Kazutoshi Ohkubo, former Barclays Plc head of Japan equities, as chief
executive officer for its business in the country, two people
with knowledge of the matter said in May. </p>
<p>SAC agreed in November to pay a record $1.8 billion and
plead guilty to securities fraud to settle allegations of
insider trading. As part of the settlement, Cohen agreed to
close SAC and return client money. Point72 oversees about $10
billion. </p>
<p>Onoe spent more than 10 years at Goldman Sachs, most
recently as an executive director for prime brokerage sales in
Tokyo. He also worked on the equity sales team, said the person.
Banks'' prime brokerage units provide services to hedge funds
such as clearing trades, lending stocks and cash, and linking
them to potential investors. </p>

and run by Louis Moore Bacon confirmed today. </p>

If the company lets Ziolkowski and his collaborators keep going, it builds goodwill with fans.

<p>Cellectis (ALCLS) shares rose 76 percent,
the most ever, after Pfizer Inc. (PFE) bought rights to the French
company''s experimental CAR-T projects, following Novartis AG (NOVN)
into a new area of cancer immune therapy. </p>
<p>Pfizer will give Cellectis $80 million upfront, plus
milestone payments of as much as $185 million for each product
that hits certain development and commercial targets, the
drugmakers said in a statement today. New York-based Pfizer also
agreed to buy about 10 percent of the French biotechnology
company''s capital through newly issued shares at 9.25 euros
apiece, 49 percent above yesterday''s close. </p>
<p>Cellectis gained the most since the stock began trading in
2007, rising to 10.94 euros in Paris, giving the company a
market value of 274 million euros ($372 million). </p>
<p>The deal sets up a challenge between Pfizer and Novartis,
the world''s two biggest drugmakers. The Swiss company is already
testing a CAR-T therapy, which involves taking T cells from
blood, engineering them to identify proteins on cancer cells,
then putting them into the body to seek and destroy a tumor.
Technology from Cellectis will simplify the delicate process of
engineering those cells, Pfizer said today. </p>
<p>The project is ''an important step toward realizing the
full potential of this technology in harnessing the body''s own
immune system to fight cancer,'' Andre Choulika, chairman and
chief executive officer of Cellectis, said in the statement. </p>
<h2>Bezos Investment </h2>
<p>Juno Therapeutics Inc., founded last year, is also testing
drug candidates with a similar approach. The U.S. biotechnology
company counts Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos among its
investors. </p>
<p>''Immune oncology is a very hot segment,'' Arnaud Guerin, a
Nantes, France-based analyst at Portzamparc Societe de Bourse,
said in a telephone interview. ''Everybody wants to be here. But
it''s a very risky area.'' </p>
<p>The CAR-T technology developed by Cellectis hasn''t been
tested in people yet, Guerin said, so it''s difficult to assess
whether the project will be a success. </p>
<p>Pfizer will pay research and development costs for targets
in the collaboration, and Cellectis is also eligible for tiered
royalties. The Paris-based company will open a site in the U.S.
to work more closely with Pfizer scientists. </p>

immunotherapies. </p>

for 2015 and 2016 from their view in March. </p>

slight move upward.'' </p>

increments at four consecutive meetings since December. </p>

when to raise its benchmark interest rate from zero. At a press
conference in March, she warned against paying too much
attention to the forecasts, which are depicted as dots on a

<p>A change in the composition of the FOMC ''might argue for
more stability and the discussion around the long-term neutral
rate is probably also a reason to expect if at all only a very
small upward move in the 2015 and 2016 dots,'' Hatzius said. </p>

percent this year, valuing the carmaker at 8.16 billion euros
($11.1 billion). Jonathan Goodman, a spokesman at the company,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The carmaker sold 3 billion euros in stock earlier this
year, and brought in Chinese partner Dongfeng Motor Corp. and
the French state as investors, to finance a turnaround. Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Tavares''s strategy includes investing
in hybrid drives, reorganizing operations in South America and
Russian and scaling back the model lineup while turning the DS
badge, currently a unit of the Citroen nameplate, into a full-fledged premium auto brand. </p>
<p>The company, based in Paris, has been unprofitable since
mid-2011, hurt by a contraction in Europe''s car market that led
to a two-decade low in industrywide demand last year. The
company''s sales in the region rose 4.2 percent in May, helped by
demand for the 2008 compact sport-utility vehicle and 308
hatchback. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd. and
PineBridge Investments said South Korean global corporate debt
is still attractive, even as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended shunning yield premiums near a seven-year low. </p>
<p>Borrowers have sold $20.5 billion of international bonds
this year, shy of the record $21 billion in the first half of
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Korea Gas Corp.,
Kookmin Bank and Korea National Oil Corp. are holding investor
meetings this week for possible dollar- or euro-denominated note
offerings, people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>South Korea''s sovereign default risk fell to a lowest since
2008 this month and the won reached the strongest in almost six
years as investors show confidence in Asia''s fourth-largest
economy, which the central bank forecasts will grow at its
fastest pace in five years in 2015. A global hunt for yield has
driven ''profound'' outperformance of Korea credit, making other
Asian bonds seem better value, Goldman Sachs wrote in a report
this month. </p>
<p>''We are active participants in Korean paper,'' Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income in Hong Kong at JPMorgan Asset
said on June 12. ''Korean credit spread levels are still
attractive versus U.S. investment grade,'' he said, adding that
decisions on whether to buy new issues depend on valuations. </p>
<h2>Goldman Warning </h2>
<p>South Korean investment-grade notes yield 2.13 percent on
average, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
That compares with 1.49 percent for corporate bonds from
developed markets, a Merrill Lynch and Pacific Investment
Management Co. measure shows. </p>
<p>The average premium for dollar bonds sold by Korean issuers
over U.S. Treasuries has contracted 37 basis points this year to
124 on June 17. It touched 121 on April 25, the least since July
2007, JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes show. </p>
<p>''The outperformance of Korea has been profound,'' Goldman
Sachs analysts led by Kenneth Ho wrote in a June 12 report. ''We
retain our negative view, because we see better value elsewhere
in Asia investment grade, even though we believe that search for
yield motives will likely keep Korea spreads tight,'' Ho said. </p>
<p>Investors have been seeking extra yield after rates sunk
globally as the world''s major central banks held key lending
rates near zero and enacted unprecedented monetary easing. </p>
<h2>High Quality </h2>
<p>''While credit spreads of Korean bonds may look tight, the
volatility of them is also very low,'' Arthur Lau, head of Asia
ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge in Kong Kong, which oversees
about $71 billion, said in June 13 interview. ''The high credit
quality nature of Korean bonds also appeals to many long-term
investors who are looking for stable and predictable returns.'' </p>
<p>The 90-day historical volatility of Korean sovereign dollar
debt maturing in April 2019 has fallen to 2.82 percent from as
high as 14.46 percent in 2009. </p>
<p>Global investors are seeking higher yields in longer-maturity bonds. The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year
U.S. Treasuries over five-year securities contracted 38 basis
points to 91 this year, Bloomberg-compiled data show. </p>
<p>''Now seems like a good time to sell long-dated dollar
bonds,'' Lee Sang Wook, a spokesperson for Korea Gas based in
Seongnam near Seoul, said by phone on June 17. ''We are
considering sales for refinancing maturing debt and possible
overseas use.'' </p>
<h2>Korea Oil, Kookmin </h2>
<p>Korea National Oil is mulling offshore issuance to
refinance debt, Choi Hong Seok, a spokesperson for the Anyang,
South Korea-based company, said by phone on yesterday. Kookmin
Bank declined to comment. </p>
<p>The won touched 1,015.25 per dollar, the strongest level
since August 2008, on June 10. Its 2.67 percent advance this
year is the second biggest among emerging-market currencies.
Ten-year won-denominated government bond yields have fallen 21
basis points since March 31 to 3.305 percent yesterday. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps insuring South Korea''s sovereign debt
against non-payment for five years fell to 49.5 basis points on
June 6, the lowest close since January 2008, according to data
provider CMA. That compared with 68.5 basis points for China,
whose sovereign debt is rated Aa3 by Moody''s Investors Service,
the same as South Korea. </p>
<p>Foreign-currency corporate bond sales rose 52 percent this
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Demand has been driven by
onshore and offshore investors and a drop in net issuance,
Goldman Sachs said. Borrowers face more than $47 billion of
maturing offshore bonds this year, almost double the $26.7
billion in 2013, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. </p>
<p>Investors in the north-east Asian country increased
holdings of Korean paper to $20.5 billion as of end-March,
compared with $11.95 billion at the end of 2010, according to a
May statement from the Bank of Korea. </p>
<p>''Supply of Korean bonds is expected to be limited this
year,'' PineBridge''s Lau said. ''There may be room for spreads
to tighten further.'' </p>

<p>Traders are scaling back bets for
lower interest rates in Russia over the next three months after
the central bank warned that inflation threatens to drive
borrowing costs higher. </p>
<p>In keeping the benchmark at 7.5 percent two days ago,
policy makers led by Chairman Elvira Nabiullina said they could
raise rates if ''inflation risks materialize.'' The market is
''prematurely'' pricing in cuts from the third quarter as food
drives consumer-price growth to the highest level since 2011,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a June 16 report. The discount
on three-month forward-rate agreements fell to 24 basis points
below the MosPrime rate from 63 at the end of last week as bets
on lower borrowing costs eased, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>While the central bank expects the economy to expand the
least since 2009 this year amid international sanctions slapped
on Russia because of its incursion into Ukraine, inflation
accelerated last month led by food prices after a ban on imports
of pork from the European Union. A rate increase remains a risk
before the central bank ''begins a cautious rate-cutting cycle''
in the fourth quarter, Goldman said. </p>
<p>''The central bank clearly showed that it''s absolutely
indifferent to economic growth, that inflation is its top
priority,''Oleg Kouzmin, an economist for Russia and the
Commonwealth of Independent States at Renaissance Capital in
Moscow, said by phone yesterday. ''There was no rate hike but
the statement was extremely hawkish.'' </p>
<h2>''Toughest'' Statement </h2>
<p>Kouzmin, who worked as a consultant to the central bank''s
monetary policy department until last year, said it was the
''toughest'' statement he''d seen from the regulator. Renaissance
extended its outlook for a rate cut to the fourth quarter of
2014 from the third after the comments. </p>
<p>While the outlook for lower borrowing costs helped reduce
the extra yield on two-year government ruble bonds over Bank
Rossii''s main rate to 67 basis points last week, matching the
lowest gap of the past nine months, the spread was at 70 basis
points as of 6:14 p.m. in Moscow. </p>
<p>The central bank has raised its benchmark by 200 basis
points since February as the standoff with the U.S. and its
allies over Ukraine intensified. Nabiullina told reporters in
Moscow on June 16 she''s ''very concerned'' about economic growth
declining ''steadily'' and an increase in the inflation, now 7.6
percent. Russia''s economy will expand as much as 0.4 percent
this year before recovering ''slowly'' to 0.9 percent next year
and 1.9 percent in 2016, she said. </p>
<h2>Bank Reliance </h2>
<p>''Risks to the policy rate in the short term are to the
upside,'' Goldman economists Clemens Grafe and Andrew Matheny
wrote in the note. ''The government bond curve has been pricing
too many rate cuts over too short of a period of time.'' </p>
<p>Even amid caution about inflation, the central bank would
be too worried about exacerbating the worsening cash shortage
among lenders to raise interest rates, according to Konstantin Nemnov, who helps manage $3 billion as the head of fixed income
at TKB BNP Paribas Investment Partners in St. Petersburg. </p>
<p>Russian lenders have become more reliant on the central
bank for funding as foreign investors are deterred by the
escalating crisis in Ukraine. Central bank loans comprised 8.2
percent of the banking industry''s funding as of June 1, an
increase from 5.4 percent at the start of 2013, its data show. </p>
<h2>Economic Growth </h2>
<p>The ruble is the third-worst performing developing-nation
currency this year, down 4.8 percent versus the dollar. It has
risen 1 percent this month, the second best in emerging markets. </p>
<p>VTB Capital''s chief economist for Russia, Vladimir Kolychev, expects a 50 basis-point rate cut in the fourth
quarter as inflation will dip below 6 percent this year. A
further 50 basis points will follow in the first and second
quarters of 2015, he said by phone yesterday. </p>
<p>''The market is expecting rate cuts this year, but less
than a week ago,'' Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at Danske
Bank A/S in Helsinki, said by e-mail yesterday. ''Now it''s clear
that the central bank is undoubtedly taking a hawkish stance, at
least through the summer.'' </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s asset-management unit bought a San Francisco property from Jamestown
LP in a $415 million deal that includes offices, a hotel and a
development site, said two people with knowledge of the deal. </p>
<p>The purchase of 22 Fourth St. near Union Square closed
today, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
transaction is private. JPMorgan will acquire 430,000 square
feet (40,000 square meters) in two buildings known as Pacific
Place, as well as a land parcel, the people said. Tenants
include the 198-room Hotel Palomar, software maker Intuit Inc.
and retailers Old Navy, Levi''s and the Container Store. </p>
<p>Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. Jamestown, a closely held real
estate investment firm based in Atlanta, confirmed the sale
without naming the buyer or price in a statement today. </p>
<p>San Francisco''s office market is luring property investors
after a surge in leasing demand led by technology companies
pushed rents up 70 percent since 2010, according to Jones Lang
LaSalle Inc. The metropolitan area has California''s lowest
unemployment rate at 4.3 percent and an economy that has added
jobs each month for almost five years, state labor data show. </p>
<p>''It''s a very strong market, with tons of tenant activity
driving investment activity,'' Grant Lammersen, a sales broker
at Cushman  Wakefield Inc. with a waterfront office listing at
188 Embarcadero, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<h2>Salesforce Tower </h2>
<p>Salesforce.com Inc. in April agreed to lease 714,000 square
feet in a skyscraper being built by Boston Properties Inc. that
will be the city''s tallest and named for San Francisco-based
Salesforce, the biggest maker of customer-management software. A
unit of Shenzhen, China-based developer Genzon Property Group
Co. last month bought a majority stake in 225 Bush St. offices
in the financial district, in a deal valued at $350 million. </p>
<p>Pacific Place, two blocks from Union Square''s cluster of
upscale shops and theaters, has 202,000 square feet of offices
fully leased to Mountain View, California-based Intuit''s
Demandforce unit and 200 feet (61 meters) of retail frontage on
Market Street, Jamestown said. The area is the main transit
corridor for city buses and Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, the
regional subway and rail system. </p>
<p>''The addition of a signature tenant like Intuit and its
long-term lease created an attractive investment for a buyer,''
Jamestown Chief Operating Officer Michael Phillips said in the
statement. ''We remain committed to the San Francisco Bay Area
as we are very engaged in the community through our other local
properties.'' </p>

<p>Deeb Salem, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader who said he helped the bank earn more than $7 billion, wants to be paid the almost $5 million difference between his 2010 bonus and what he told his mother to expect. </p> <p>Salem said in an arbitration hearing that he was led to believe that his 2010 bonus would be $13 million, down from a $15 million award for 2009 when he was paid more than Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.

Instead, Salem said his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he received about his 2007 self-evaluation. </p> <p>Salem, 35, said the $8.25 million bonus for 2010 didn''t reflect his contributions, while Goldman Sachs argued he was aware that the firm could pay him whatever it wished and that the company considered his conduct in determining compensation.

<p>After helping Mexico sell 100-year
bonds overseas for the first time in 2010, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. is seeking to do the same for Colombia. </p>
<p>The Andean nation may issue the notes later this year after
the New York-based bank offered to arrange the sale, Finance
Minister Mauricio Cardenas said June 11. Goldman Sachs helped
underwrite Mexico''s offering of dollar bonds due 2110 as well as
its pound-denominated century bonds in March. </p>
<p>Colombia is seeking to exploit soaring demand for its
longer-maturity debt as its economy grows twice as fast as the
regional average and the Federal Reserve reiterates that
interest rates will stay low for a ''considerable time'' after
it stops buying bonds. Yields on Colombia''s $2 billion of bonds
due in 2044, its longest-term notes, have plunged 0.67
percentage point to 4.98 percent since they were issued Jan. 21.
That''s more than the average 0.48 percentage point decline in
long-dated bonds with the same rating. </p>
<p>''Colombia shines in the midst of underperforming economies
in emerging markets, and investors are noticing,'' Mario Castro,
a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc, said by phone from New
York. ''There''s no doubt there''s appetite for Colombia risk, and
Colombia would be getting long-term financing at still very low
yields.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs didn''t answer calls and messages seeking
comment. </p>
<h2>''General Receptiveness'' </h2>
<p>Colombia would use funds from a sale to cover its 2015
financing needs, Cardenas told investors at the June 11
presentation. Goldman Sachs proposed a reference yield of around
5.7 percent for a Colombian 100-year debt offering, he said. </p>
<p>Yields on Mexico''s $2.68 billion of bonds due 2110 have
fallen 0.67 percentage point this year to 5.55 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Mexico, whose BBB+ rating from Standard  Poor''s is one
level higher than Colombia''s, is the only nation to have issued
100-year notes in both dollars and pounds. China and the central
bank of the Philippines sold $100 million of century bonds in
1996 and 1997, respectively. </p>
<p>''There has been a general receptiveness to longer
maturities recently,'' Michael Roche, an emerging-market
strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said by telephone from New
York. ''Institutional investors, particularly pension funds and
insurance companies, generally have a need for longer
duration.'' </p>
<h2>Growth Outlook </h2>
<p>Colombia''s economy will grow 4.5 percent this year,
compared with an average expansion of 2.7 percent in Latin
America, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
The economy expanded 6.4 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, the national statistics agency said today, higher
than the 5.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,882.50 per dollar at the
close today in Bogota. </p>
<p>The country''s sale of 30-year bonds in January attracted
$4.2 billion in bids, according to the government. </p>
<p>The government plans $3 billion in overseas debt offerings
next year. </p>
<p>''Appetite for Colombia''s last bond sale was huge, and that
shows there definitely is willingness to invest in the
country,'' said Nomura''s Castro. Selling a century bond would be
''another step in positioning Colombia in the international
capital market. It''s an exclusive club.'' </p>

<p>Russian stocks have been so volatile
amid the turmoil in Ukraine that it took a bull market to
convince JPMorgan Chase  Co. that it''s time to buy. </p>
<p>The bank''s upgrade from sell yesterday follows a 21 percent
advance in the benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) from its bear-market low in
March. Stocks are rallying as President Vladimir Putin signals
that he''s willing to work with Ukraine''s new leader, reducing
concern that Russia will face more sanctions. Bank of America
Corp., which has had a buy rating on Russian stocks since
September, reiterated its bullish view on June 17. Deutsche Bank
AG strategist John-Paul Smith predicted a rebound six weeks ago. </p>
<p>''The two key catalysts are the fading of the Ukraine
crisis and the shift in positioning,'' JPMorgan analysts
including David Aserkoff and Christian Kern wrote in a report on
June 18. ''Global emerging-market funds are underweight for the
first time since 2009. The emerging-market value trade seems to
be working, which should benefit Russia.'' </p>
<p>The analysts raised their rating on Russian shares to
overweight after cutting it to underweight on March 6 as Putin
began the annexation of Crimea. The Micex entered a bull market
on June 6. The gauge''s 30-day historical volatility, a measure
of price swings, reached a five-year high of 46.2 percent on
April 11. </p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict </h2>
<p>Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko yesterday reiterated a
plan to end fighting in the country''s southeast region after
talks with Putin. The Micex gained for the second day, rising
0.7 percent to 1,504.23 by 8:20 a.m. in New York. The Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in
the U.S. jumped 1.9 percent yesterday. </p>
<p>''Russia still provides better value than other emerging
markets,'' David Hauner, a strategist at Bank of America, said
in a telephone interview from London yesterday. ''The risk
reward is not as high as it was a couple of months ago, but our
view on global equities is positive and Russia will outperform
the market.'' </p>
<p>Smith, the Deutsche Bank strategist who predicted Russia''s
1998 stock-market crash and had been bearish on the country for
more than three years, said in May that investors were
overreacting to the conflict in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Russia''s second-biggest oil producer OAO Lukoil (LUKOY), eastern
Europe''s biggest lender OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) and Russia''s second-biggest
mobile phone company OAO Megafon (MFON) are among JPMorgan''s top
emerging-market stock picks, according to the note. </p>
<p>Aserkoff in London and Kantarovich in Moscow weren''t
available for comment on the timing of their overweight
recommendation when contacted by phone and e-mail outside
regular business hours yesterday. </p>
<h2>''Pretty Negative'' </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley raised Russian stocks to overweight on May 8
before Ukraine elected Poroshenko. Citigroup Inc. has an
overweight recommendation on Russia in its global emerging
markets portfolio, according to a report this month. </p>
<p>Capital Economics Ltd., in an e-mailed research note
yesterday, said it is ''relatively downbeat on the outlook for
Russian equities'' and expects stocks and the ruble to fall. </p>
<p>''Our view on the Russian market is pretty negative,'' Liza Ermolenko, a London-based emerging-market economist at Capital
Economics, said by phone yesterday. ''While the economy is
slowing, no one really knows what is next in the Ukraine crisis
and whether further sanctions against Russia will be approved.
The Russian market is very sensitive to the Ukraine crises, and
there is no quick solution.'' </p>
<h2>International Sanctions </h2>
<p>Ukraine will call a unilateral cease-fire to help end three
months of fighting with pro-Russian separatists, Poroshenko said
in Kiev yesterday. Insurgents will be given a limited window to
lay down their arms, with those who haven''t committed any
serious crimes to be offered an amnesty and safe passage out of
the country, he said. </p>
<p>The U.S. and European Union have imposed sanctions
including travel bans and asset freezes on Putin allies in
Russia and Ukraine to punish the country for its standoff with
Ukraine. Russia''s gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent in the
first quarter from the same period in 2013, the slowest pace in
a year, the Federal State Statistics Service said on May 15. </p>
<p>While the $2 trillion economy was stalling before the
sanctions, the U.S. and EU have warned the nation faces further
penalties if fails to de-escalate the conflict. Ukraine and
Russia are also in conflict over gas, with Russia cutting off
supplies on June 16 because of unpaid bills. The International
Monetary Fund said April 30 that Russia is already in recession. </p>
<p>The Micex trades at 5.4 times estimated 12-month earnings,
compared with a ratio of 15.5 for India''s SP BSE Sensex Index,
10.7 for Brazil''s Ibovespa and 7.6 for the Shanghai Composite. </p>
<p>The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
the index futures, was little changed today, while RTS stock-index futures increased 1.6 percent to 132,920 yesterday. The
Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S.-traded exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose 2.6 percent to
$26.88. </p>

<p>(Corrects headline, lead to show target will be difficult to achieve; Adds comments from Sago in fourth paragraph.) </p> <p>Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Japan Co. said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe''s goal to have women in 30 percent of management jobs by 2020 will be difficult to achieve, citing a lack of candidates. </p> <p>''We now recruit exactly the same numbers of men and women,'' Shigeharu Suzuki, chairman of Daiwa Securities Group, said yesterday in a diversity forum held at Bloomberg''s Tokyo offices. ''That was not the case in the past and unfortunately we are not going to reach the target because we don''t have enough people in the pipeline. Even if we promoted at an even rate, we would be around 15 percent or maybe a touch above by 2020.'' </p> <p>Katsunori Sago, deputy president of Goldman Sachs Japan who is also co-chairman of the bank''s diversity committee in Asia, said his firm faced similar difficulties. </p> <p>''I agree completely with Mr. Suzuki. It''s a difficult proposition,'' Sago said at the same event. ''In an industry where women have been active for a while, 30 percent is a target that is possible to reach. On the other hand, in the financial industry and in manufacturing, the proportion of women is low. It is difficult.'' </p> <h2>Labor Challenges </h2> <p>The comments reflect the challenges for Abe in drawing more women into jobs to maintain a labor force that is forecast to shrink as much as 42 percent by 2060 as the population ages. Japan''s workforce would swell by more than seven million people and output would jump if participation by women equaled that of men, Goldman Sachs said in its latest ''Womenomics'' report on May 6. Gender Equality Minister Masako Mori has said the bureaucracy will only reach Abe''s target by recruiting people from outside. </p> <p>''If people say they can''t do it, then we will never reach it,'' Mori said at the same event in response to the comments by Suzuki and Sago. ''There are all sorts of excuses about why it can''t be done, but I want you to keep on trying.'' </p> <p>Daiwa has introduced support measures for working mothers over the past decade, include extending childcare leave and shorter worker hours for those with children until the third year of elementary school. That has boosted its proportion of female managers to 7.2 percent this year from 2.3 percent a decade ago, Suzuki said, citing documents prepared by Daiwa. </p> <h2>Science Graduates </h2> <p>The target could be harder to reach for companies in other fields, he said. ''If you look at manufacturers, they need science graduates. There are very few women science graduates, so the pool of candidates is not there.'' </p> <p>Mori detailed the government''s efforts to promote women in her presentation, including a push to offer 400,000 more childcare spots by 2018. In a draft growth strategy released on June 16, the government said it would consider a new law detailing strategies for reaching the 30 percent target in national and local government and private business. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s Sago said setting ambitious targets for female participation in the workforce was effective in itself. </p> <p>''I don''t think we should quibble about the actual figure,'' said Goldman Sachs''s Sago, who is leaving his post this month and will serve as an advisory director. ''If you deliberately promote people early or promote unsuitable people in an attempt to look good, it can have a negative effect on diversity in the long term.'' </p> <p>', 'Abe''s Woman Manager Target Difficult to Meet''', 'By Isabel Reynolds and Takashi Hirokawa', 'Jun 19, 2014  4:54 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-19/abe-s-women-managers-target-won-t-be-met-say-daiwa-goldman.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
were among oil companies accused by Pennsylvania of polluting
groundwater with a gasoline additive in lawsuits similar to ones
brought by New York City, New Hampshire and Vermont. </p>
<p>BP Plc (BP/) and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela''s
state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA, also were named in two
complaints made public today in state court that seek damages
for costs to clean up groundwater tainted by Methyl Tertiary
Butyl Ether, or MTBE. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane and Governor Tom Corbett''s office of general counsel filed
the complaints. </p>
<p>''MTBE-related spills over the past 20 years have cost
Pennsylvania hundreds of millions of dollars,'' James Schultz,
the governor''s general counsel, said yesterday in a statement.
''We cannot take the health of Pennsylvania''s waters for granted
and their protection must remain our utmost priority.'' </p>
<p>The Pennsylvania lawsuits follow scores of claims filed by
cities, states and individuals around the U.S. against oil
refiners, retailers and distributors over MTBE. Exxon Mobil,
Chevron and BP were among two dozen U.S. refiners sued this
month by Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court in April upheld a jury''s $104.7
million damage award against Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil for
contaminating New York City wells with the additive. </p>
<h2>Clean Air </h2>
<p>The city sued oil companies in 2003, alleging they knew the
additive would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil argued that
state laws were pre-empted by the federal Clean Air Act, which
required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce air
pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE to
make the fuel burn more efficiently. </p>
<p>Reasonable alternatives to MTBE were available at the time
oil companies jointly promoted gasoline with the additive,
Pennsylvania claims in its lawsuit. </p>
<p>Braden Reddall, a spokesman for San Ramon, California-based
Chevron, said the company hadn''t yet seen the suit and couldn''t
comment. </p>
<p>''BP acted at all times in good faith,'' said Scott Dean, a
spokesman in Houston for the London-based company. ''BP plans to
defend itself against the allegations. </p>
<p>Todd Spitler, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said the company is
reviewing the claims, although ''''such litigation is flawed in
that energy companies are being held liable not for spilling
gasoline, but for simply including oxygenates in gasoline as
required.'''' </p>
<h2>Second-Guessing </h2>
<p>''''If a company spills gasoline in Pennsylvania, it is
required to clean it up, as should be the case,'''' Spitler said.
''''These cases are about second-guessing decisions made by state
and federal regulators to rely on MTBE-blended gasoline to
reduce air pollution. We take very seriously our responsibility
to operate in an environmentally sound manner.'''' </p>
<p>Fernando Garay, a Citgo spokesman, didn''t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania wants the companies held liable for
manufacturing a defective product, creating public nuisances and
negligence. The complaint also seeks punitive damages for
''''wanton, malicious, oppressive and fraudulent conduct,''''
according to the filing. </p>
<p>The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Exxon Mobil
Corp., 140602881, Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County
(Philadelphia). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is planning a
sale of U.S. home-loan bonds without government backing, adding
to evidence that the market for the securities is beginning to
pick up steam. </p>
<p>The deal will be tied to $303.7 million of prime 15-year
mortgages, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction who asked not to be identified without authorization
to speak publicly. While most of the loans had original balances
larger than the current threshold for jumbo mortgages, the
market''s focus since its revival, 14.5 percent of the debt is
smaller than $400,000, the person said. </p>
<p>Premium Point Investments LP''s WinWater Home Mortgage LLC
yesterday completed its first non-agency bond transaction, a
deal tied to about $250 million of jumbo loans, and Citigroup
Inc. (C) is planning a similar $219 million offering. After reviving
from the paralysis caused by the 2008 financial crisis the debt
helped spark, issuance of non-agency securities had slowed after
the middle of last year as banks seek jumbo loans to hold as
investments and bond buyers pay less for the debt. </p>
<p>''We''re seeing repeat and new issuers attempt to bring the
market back,''Michele Patterson, a senior director at Kroll
Bond Rating Agency, said in a telephone interview. ''We are not
at last year''s levels, and we don''t anticipate getting to last
year''s levels. I think the second half will probably be about
the same as the first half'' of the year in terms of sales. </p>
<h2>September Collapse </h2>
<p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>While total issuance of non-agency securities tied to new
loans jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in
2012, sales collapsed after September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance totals about $1.8 billion this
year. Sales peaked at $1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006. </p>
<p>Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
$625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. </p>
<p>The average age of the loans in the JPMorgan transaction is
about one year, with 5.2 percent of the mortgages older than 30
months, the person said. First Republic Bank originated 55
percent of the mortgages, while JPMorgan''s bank made 38 percent,
the person said. </p>
<h2>Loss Protection </h2>
<p>The amount of loss protection for investors known as credit
enhancement, totaling 5.5 percent for part of the AAA portion of
the transaction, is the lowest yet seen by Kroll, which was
founded after the crisis and has been hired to grade the deal,
Patterson said. The inclusion of only mortgages with terms of 15
years or less, a first since the credit seizure, improves the
quality of the transaction because the loans typically perform
better than 30-year debt, she said. </p>
<p>Some other AAA portions of the deal have 10 percent
enhancement, the person said. Most of WinWater''s top-rated bonds
carried 15 percent of credit enhancement, with a smaller amount
offering a buffer of 8.25 percent. The safety margin is provided
by features such as some bonds losing principal amid losses on
the underlying loans before others. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is set to
get bonds with more than double the interest rate local Japanese
banks will receive on loans when Aiful Corp. (8515) refinances. </p>
<p>The consumer lender, which postponed repayments to avoid
bankruptcy in 2009, said June 13 it will exchange part of 161.7
billion yen ($1.6 billion) of debt for notes bearing an 8
percent coupon. While that''s in line with U.S. notes with
similar credit scores, it''s among the highest for Japanese bonds
in the past 15 years, data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch show. Domestic banks will extend new loans
at about 3 percent, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Local banks are accepting lower interest because they have
collateral on loans to Aiful, while the debentures won''t be
secured. The consumer lender is seeking to refinance for a
second time in five years as Bank of Japan stimulus lowers
funding costs and the burden of refunding customers for excess
interest-rate charges declines. </p>
<p>''A coupon of 8 percent looks very attractive,'' said
Taketoshi Tsuchiya, a senior executive at Mizuho Securities Co.
who heads a team dealing with distressed fixed income. ''We''ve
had a number of requests from overseas hedge funds saying they''d
like to buy the bonds if they come on the market.'' </p>
<h2>Informal Agreement </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Aiful have reached an informal agreement
that the U.S. bank will apply to swap loans for notes, according
to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. Aiful triggered
Japan''s first auction to determine the payout of credit-default
swaps when it obtained lender approval to postpone repayment on
280 billion yen in 2009. </p>
<p>Japanese banks may be avoiding the risk of default by
extending loans with collateral, according to Junichi Shimizu, a
Tokyo-based credit analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. </p>
<p>''While the principal on loans gradually decreases as
payments are made, corporate bonds are repaid at one go, so
there''s the risk of a default depending on the business
environment,'' Shimizu said. </p>
<p>Only one yen bond offered by bankrupt Takefuji Corp. had a
higher coupon in the past 15 years than the Aiful notes to be
issued to Goldman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Takefuji''s securities issued overseas in 2009 paid 10 percent. </p>
<h2>Debt Repayment </h2>
<p>Aiful will obtain a loan from Japanese banks of a little
under 80 billion yen with which it will repay part of its
outstanding debts, according to a person familiar with the
matter. Foreign creditors including Goldman Sachs will exchange
more than 30 billion yen in liabilities for the new bonds due at
the end of April 2020, according to the person. </p>
<p>Aiful will also postpone repayment of 52.7 billion yen of
existing loans, it said in a statement on June 13. </p>
<p>''In difficult negotiations, we were compelled to accept
tough terms on the bonds,'' said Kenichi Hashimoto, an Aiful
spokesman. ''Realistically, there''s not such a big difference
between the rate and that being charged in secondary markets.'' </p>
<p>The extra yield on Aiful''s 1.99 percent bonds due in
October 2015 was 7.4 percentage points over sovereign notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Tokyo-based lender
is graded CCC+ by Japan''s Rating  Investment Information Inc.,
or the equivalent of seven steps below investment level. </p>
<p>U.S. corporate bonds with CCC or lower ratings had an
average yield of 8.8 percent, while it was 9.2 percent for
global notes with such scores, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data. </p>
<h2>BOJ Stimulus </h2>
<p>Borrowing costs have fallen in Japan as the BOJ buys about
7 trillion yen of sovereign bonds a month to spur inflation. The
benchmark 10-year debt yield has dropped 15 1/2 basis points, or
0.155 percentage point, to 0.58 percent this year. The yen has
gained 3.3 percent in 2014 to 101.93 per dollar as of 5:06 p.m.
in Tokyo, after tumbling 18 percent last year. </p>
<p>An investment unit of Goldman Sachs held 14.5 billion yen
of Aiful''s debt, while a unit of Barclays Plc (BARC) had 9.4 billion
yen at the end of March, according to material provided by Aiful
to shareholders. The company''s single largest creditor was the
banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc., the
documentation showed. </p>
<p>Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment on the plan, as did Kyota Narimatsu, a
spokesman at Barclays in Japan, and Hiroshi Kashimoto at
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. </p>
<h2>Credit Event </h2>
<p>Aiful''s December 2009 agreement with creditors to delay
debt repayment resulted in a dispute over whether the action had
caused a so-called restructuring credit event. Buyers of Aiful
credit-default swaps, which insure bondholders against
nonpayment, had to wait three months for the International Swaps
 Derivatives Association to rule that the plan had triggered
payouts. </p>
<p>Sellers of credit-default protection agreed in 2010 to pay
holders 66.125 yen for each 100 yen of insured debt, in Japan''s
first credit default auction, according to bid administrators at
the time. </p>
<p>Aiful racked up 636.1 billion yen in net losses in the
eight years ended March 31 as a crackdown on coercive lending
practices and court rulings forced Japan''s consumer lenders to
repay billions of dollars in overcharged interest. </p>
<p>That regulatory action led to the bankruptcy of Takefuji
with 433.6 billion yen of liabilities. </p>
<p>Aiful recorded a profit of 30.5 billion yen in the 12
months ended March 31, its biggest in eight years and the third
in succession. Interest repayments fell for a fourth year last
fiscal year, dropping 57 percent to 33.1 billion yen from three
years earlier. </p>
<p>''As the business environment is improving, banks can
increase their recovery rate by continuing to support Aiful and
its turnaround,'' said Shintaro Niimura, a credit analyst at
Nomura Securities Co., Japan''s largest brokerage. ''For
investors rationally seeking a profit, they''re emphasizing
better repayment terms.'' </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management and
Invesco Asset Management say China''s cooling property market is
an opportunity to boost dollar bond holdings as the government''s
targeted stimulus benefits the largest developers. </p>
<p>Chinese real-estate companies accounted for six of the 10
best-performing Asian notes in the past three months, according
to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The yield on 2018 debt
of China Overseas Land  Investments Ltd., the nation''s largest
developer by market value, dropped to 3.35 percent last week,
from a record 4.31 percent on Feb. 5, while that on similar-maturity bonds of China Vanke Co. fell to 3.95 percent, from an
all-time high of 5.07 percent on March 20. </p>
<p>''We will pick the winners from these trends,'' said
Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income at JPMorgan Asset,
which oversees $39 billion in emerging-market debt. ''Although
sales and prices are falling along with margins, we have
identified the larger developers are gaining market share and
executing well.'' </p>
<p>Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to safeguard this year''s
growth target of 7.5 percent, fueling bets the government will
encourage increased lending to selected projects and relax
restrictions in the real-estate market. Larger developers may
benefit from industry consolidation as smaller builders face a
funding squeeze with a record amount of property trusts maturing
next year and prices falling in the most cities in two years. </p>
<h2>Softening Prices </h2>
<p>Home prices declined in 35 of China''s 70 cities last month
from April, the most since May 2012, official data showed June
18. In the financial center of Shanghai, prices decreased 0.3
percent, the first drop in two years, while they fell 0.2
percent in the southern business hub of Shenzhen. </p>
<p>''Softening prices are good because they imply there isn''t
a bubble anymore,'' said Ken Hu, Hong Kong-based chief
investment officer of fixed income for Asia Pacific at Invesco,
which manages $787 billion globally. ''We pick developers with
high turnover and those who tend to build smaller-sized flats.
Profit margin isn''t that key to bondholders like us. Our
approach is to buy on dips.'' </p>
<p>Developers including Vanke that cut prices by 10 percent to
15 percent achieved good sales volume, Deutsche Bank AG analysts
led by Hong Kong-based Tony Tsang wrote in a June 13 report.
Vanke, headquartered in Shenzhen, recorded a 16.2 percent
increase in sales value in the first five months of 2014 from a
year earlier, it said in a June 3 statement to the Shenzhen
stock exchange. </p>
<h2>Taking Advantage </h2>
<p>Larger industry players are able to tap overseas capital
markets for funds. Sales of dollar bonds by Chinese companies
totaled $91 billion in 2014, compared with $89 billion in the
previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Smaller builders, which rely on property trusts for
financing, have to repay 203.5 billion yuan ($32.7 billion) in
2015, according to research firm Use Trust. That''s almost double
the 109 billion yuan due this year. China''s banking regulator
said on June 6 it will monitor developer finances, a sign of
concern defaults may spread after the March collapse of Zhejiang
Xingrun Real Estate Co., a builder south of Shanghai. </p>
<p>''It won''t be surprising to have a few defaults in the
sector in an economic slowdown, given you have thousands of
developers and many of them are small ones,'' BOCI''s Wang said.
''The bigger ones, especially those listed, can take advantage
to lower their funding costs as the industry consolidates.'' </p>
<p>China South City Holdings Ltd. (1668), which runs logistics parks
for industrial materials, sold 1 billion yuan of five-year bonds
at a coupon of 7.5 percent in the interbank market on May 9. It
plans to use the proceeds to repay short-term bank loans.
Greenland Holding Group has hired banks to arrange investor
meetings from today for a potential dollar bond offering,
according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<h2>Borrowing Costs </h2>
<p>Vanke''s bond borrowing costs dropped to 3.45 percent on a
weighted average last week, compared with 5.5 percent in the
first quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It also managed to extend the average maturity of its notes to
3.95 years, from 2.43 years in 2011. </p>
<p>Slowing growth is causing declines in the yuan and onshore
interest rates. The Chinese currency has fallen 2.8 percent
against the dollar this year, the worst performance in Asia. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has dropped 52
basis points to 4.04 percent in the same period as investors
sought safe havens. Gross domestic product will probably expand
7.3 percent this year, the slowest pace since 1990, according to
a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<h2>Prolonged Downturn </h2>
<p>The downturn in the property market will be more prolonged
this time than in previous corrections, Tom Byrne, senior vice
president at Moody''s, said at a June 19 conference in Shanghai.
Broad price cuts are likely to come in late August or in
September when more new projects are set to be introduced, UBS
AG Hong Kong-based analyst Eva Lee wrote in a report last week. </p>
<p>Moody''s revised its credit outlook for Chinese developers
to negative from stable on May 21. The Shanghai Stock Exchange
Property Index, which tracks 24 real-estate companies listed in
the city, has slumped 6.3 percent this year, exceeding the 4.2
percent decline for the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. </p>
<p>''Overall, the housing market is cooling in some parts,
like in third- or fourth-tier cities,'' said Chang at JPMorgan
Asset. ''But we do see a silver lining. There''s actually a
healthy pickup in transactions at specific locations after some
discounting.'' </p>
<h2>''Minor Stimulus'' </h2>
<p>The nation has introduced measures to help the real-estate
industry, which JPMorgan Chase  Co. says poses the biggest
near-term risk to growth in the world''s second-largest economy.
The People''s Bank of China told 15 banks in May to improve
efficiency of service, give timely approval and distribution of
mortgages to qualified buyers. The southeastern city of Fuzhou
has removed home-purchase limits for buyers who make one-time
payments, the Securities Times reported on June 18, citing sales
people from two developers. </p>
<p>The government may announce additional ''minor stimulus
measures'' after Premier Li said in London last week that the
nation will maintain a minimum growth rate of 7.5 percent,
according to a China Securities Journal commentary on June 20.
The PBOC may release more targeted steps to prevent expansion
from falling short of the goal, it added. </p>
<p>''Policy makers are actually putting out more measures to
support this sector,'' said Arthur Lau, Hong Kong-based head of
Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which
oversees about $71 billion. ''I think, volume-wise, it could
catch up a little bit in the second half, especially those who
are not aggressively buying land. There is still a wide
selection, even within this sector.'' </p>

<p>A Norwegian oil-workers union said
it''s ready to go on strike over pensions in a move that
threatens to cut oil production from Exxon Mobil Corp.''s
platforms in the North Sea by more than 60,000 barrels a day. </p>
<p>A court in Oslo today ruled that a strike notice by the
Safe union that would affect three Exxon platforms is legal,
clearing the way for a walkout, according to the group''s leader,
Hilde-Marit Rysst. While the union is yet to decide on a public
mediator''s proposal that seeks to bridge differences with
employers, it will do so by the June 27 midday deadline, she
said by phone today. </p>
<p>''Everything is set'' for a strike, Rysst said. The
mediator''s proposal, endorsed by the Norwegian Oil and Gas
Association, which represents employers in wage negotiations,
''is not good enough,'' she said. </p>
<p>A strike would set Safe apart from two other unions that
reached wage agreements in talks that covered 7,615 offshore
oil-platform workers. In 2012, workers from all three unions
walked out in their longest action, disrupting oil and gas
production until the government intervened to stop companies
imposing a full lockout that would have halted output from
western Europe''s largest producer. </p>
<p>The conflict centers on pension terms for 31 Safe-affiliated workers at Exxon, the world''s largest oil company by
market value. While the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association argued
that the issue isn''t relevant for industry-wide wage talks, the
Oslo court ruled Safe''s strike notice is legal. </p>
<h2>Union Threat </h2>
<p>The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association could meet with Safe
again this week after last week''s state-backed mediation, though
there are no talks planned yet, the oil-industry lobby group''s
spokeswoman Eli Ane Nedreskaar said by phone. Exxon declined to
comment on talks with the union as it''s represented by the
Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, spokesman Knut Riple said. </p>
<p>Safe has threatened to take out 154 of its members from
Exxon''s Balder, Ringhorne and Jotun platforms, shutting down
production that reached 61,000 barrels of oil in April,
according to figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. A
strike would also halt production at Det Norske Oljeselskap
ASA''s Jette field, which goes through Jotun and amounted to
2,000 barrels of crude a day in April. </p>

<p>Steven Cho, a former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. currency trader, plans to start a macro hedge fund, a
strategy attracting investors seeking to profit from diverging
global economic trends. </p>
<p>Cho''s New York-based Kings Peak Asset Management LP is
scheduled to start in the fourth quarter, according to four
people with knowledge of his plans, who asked not to be named
because the fund is private. Cho, who was global head of spot
and forward trading of G-10 currencies at Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. He left in April after 18 years at the
bank. </p>
<p>Macro funds, which make bets on stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities, have underperformed the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index every year since 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, in part because central banks have depressed interest
rates, making it harder to profit from discrepancies between
countries. Firms including Tudor Investment Corp. and Mariner
Investment Group LLC, which deploy the strategy, have forecast
divergence in monetary policies as some economies grow faster
than others. </p>
<p>''Central banks can''t all keep doing the same thing in
tandem,'' said Maggie Ralbovsky, a managing director at Wilshire
Associates, which advises hedge funds and their investors. ''The
macro market, because of the divergence in conditions in
different countries, is very prime for this kind of strategy.'' </p>
<h2>Volatility Index </h2>
<p>While some funds expect increased divergence, they may have
to be patient. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said today
policy makers can wait for the economy to absorb more slack
before increasing interest rates and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair
Janet Yellen said last week the Fed expects interest rates to
stay low for a ''considerable time.'' </p>
<p>That''s caused volatility to plunge across stocks, bonds and
currencies. The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index fell to a
record low 5.5 percent on June 19 from 11.8 percent a year ago.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures price swings in stocks, tumbled 12 percent on June 18
to close at 10.6, the lowest level since February 2007. </p>
<p>Still, investors are seeking returns derived from
macroeconomic themes and less correlated to the stock market,
according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. That''s
contributing to an increase in hedge-fund startups overall, with
289 in the first quarter, compared with 244 in the prior three
months. Industry assets have increased to a record $2.7
trillion. </p>
<h2>Bankers Leave </h2>
<p>Top bankers and traders have exited the biggest Wall Street
firms for more lucrative jobs at hedge funds, as regulation has
intensified following the 2008 financial crisis and lower
returns have pushed banks to cut the amount of revenue they set
aside for compensation. </p>
<p>Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
bank''s currency business had ''difficulty managing inventory''
in the third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income
trading revenue since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Banks are also facing at least a dozen regulators
investigating allegations that traders colluded to rig
benchmarks in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market. Cho''s
resignation was unrelated to the currency probe and he left on
good terms, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter, who asked not to be named because the information is
private. </p>

<p>Commodities are poised to decline
5.5 percent over the next 12 months after climbing amid tensions
in Iraq, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>Energy prices will be 5 percent lower a year from now,
precious metals will drop 15 percent and agricultural products
will retreat 10 percent, the bank said in an asset-allocation
report dated yesterday. Commodities will decline 4 percent in
the next three months, according to the report. </p>
<p>''Despite the negative return we forecast after the recent
rally driven by events in Iraq, we stay neutral commodities due
to the hedging benefits they offer against these risks,''
Goldman analyst Jeffrey Currie in New York said in the report. </p>
<p>Brent crude reached a nine-month high in London on June 19
after Iraqi insurgents captured the northern city of Mosul and
advanced to towns just north of Baghdad, sparking concern oil
output might be interrupted in OPEC''s second-largest producer.
Gold futures touched the highest price since April 15 today in
New York trading. </p>
<p>Today Brent fell as much as 0.5 percent after Iraqi forces
regained control of the Baiji refinery in the north from
Islamist militants, and fighting has yet to spread to the south,
home to more than three-quarters of the country''s crude output.
Saudi Arabia was the only producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries that pumped more oil than Iraq
last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Larger Stockpiles </h2>
<p>Still, risks in energy are ''skewed to the upside in an
environment of heightened geopolitical risks and very limited
OPEC spare capacity,'' the Goldman analyst wrote. Precious
metals will drop amid rising real interest rates, while
agriculture prices are set to decline as inventories increase,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>Commodity prices as measured by the Standard  Poor''s GSCI
Enhanced Commodity Index rose 3.4 percent so far this month and
are up 7.1 percent in 2014. </p>
<p>Goldman forecast May 14 the enhanced index might have zero
total return in three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
months. The bank projected a 4 percent drop over 12 months in an
April 13 note. </p>

<p>UBS AG (UBSN) is a better bet than its
Zurich neighbor Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) even though it''s more
exposed to legal risks, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
analysts. </p>
<p>UBS could nearly quadruple its litigation reserve to 7
billion Swiss francs ($7.8 billion) by 2016 and still have a
common equity ratio of 13 percent, Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan, banking analysts at JPMorgan in London, said in a note
today. They included a dividend yield of 10.3 percent in this
estimate. </p>
<p>UBS had 1.8 billion francs in reserve for legal matters at
the end of the first quarter. </p>
<p>By contrast, Credit Suisse reported a common equity ratio
of 10 percent at the end of March. Factoring in a $2.6 billion
fine to settle a U.S. tax-evasion case in May, that figure drops
to 9.3 percent, the lowest of the 17 global investment banks
tracked by Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<p>''On litigation, in our view CSG appears better placed than
UBS,'' Abouhossein and Ranjan said in their note. ''However, UBS
has sufficient cushion in our estimates to take litigation
charges.'' </p>
<p>Credit Suisse will generate 48 percent of investment
banking-related revenues from equities in 2015, according to
Abouhossein and Ranjan, compared with 68 percent at UBS. As a
result, the analysts said they ''see UBS business mix as much
more attractive.'' </p>
<p>That makes Switzerland''s second-largest bank more dependent
on fixed income, an area of investment banking that the analysts
said is shrinking. </p>
<p>UBS, Switzerland''s biggest bank, also has more estimated
future revenue from ''asset-gathering-geared activities''
relative to total income. Credit Suisse will have 55 percent of
revenue from these businesses in 2015, the analysts estimate,
compared with 68 percent for UBS. </p>
<p>''UBS again is more attractive than CSG,'' Abouhossein and
Ranjan said. </p>
<p>UBS also has an advantage in wealth management because of
its stronger position in Asia, which they view as the fastest-growing region, and in the U.S., the men said. </p>

<p>The era of slowing global inflation looks to be over. </p> <p>Three years of worldwide disinflation is ending, in the eyes of economists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. Their estimates show global consumer prices accelerated 2.65 percent in May. </p> <p>That''s the fastest pace since April 2012 and the level they''d targeted for the end of 2014. It marks a 0.6 percentage point jump since February, when the 2 percent rate was the lowest since November 2009. </p> <p>It''s not just food and energy costs.

The hunch at the biggest U.S. bank is that companies are regaining pricing power as manufacturing strengthens, said David Hensley, an international economist at JPMorgan in New York. </p> <p>The analysis may surprise those investors who spent the year pushing up bond prices. It may also grate on economists such as Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who yesterday bemoaned ''inflation hysteria'' on Wall Street. </p> <p>''We definitely have seen the turn,'' said Hensley in an interview.

<p>Two stockbrokers were charged with
insider trading tied to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)''s
$1.2 billion acquisition of software company SPSS Inc., in a
probe that has already yielded three guilty pleas. </p>
<p>Daryl Payton, 38, and Benjamin Durant III, 37, pleaded not
guilty to one count of conspiracy and five counts of securities
fraud in an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court. The
two men, arrested this morning in New York by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, were each released on $250,000 bond set by
U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger. </p>
<p>Payton and Durant were part of a group of friends who
traded on the IBM tip, the U.S. said. When the SPSS deal was
announced on July 28, 2009, the pair met with three other co-conspirators at a New York hotel to discuss a cover story,
according to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. </p>
<p>''Benjamin Durant and Daryl Payton not only acquired inside
information about a corporate acquisition and made illegal
profits from it, but they colluded with others to conceal their
crime,'' Bharara said in a statement. </p>
<p>Peggy Cross-Goldenberg, a lawyer for Durant, and Jim Roth,
an attorney for Payton, declined to comment about their clients
after court. </p>
<p>The arrests are the latest in a federal crackdown by
Bharara''s office and the FBI on insider trading at hedge funds,
technology companies and so-called expert networking firms.
Payton and Durant are among at least 88 people who have been
charged since 2009, with 81 having been convicted, most after
guilty pleas. </p>
<p>Payton, Durant, David Weishaus and Thomas Conradt were
employed as brokers at Euro Pacific Capital Inc., according to
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>

<p>''They all worked together at the same brokerage firm here
in New York City and they all made a substantial amount of money
on inside information, hundreds of thousands of dollars,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Zach said today at the arraignment. </p>
<p>Payton and Durant were also sued by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, which alleged the two made more than
$290,000 in illegal profit. </p>
<p>After getting the tip from an associate at the New York law
firm representing IBM, Trent Martin passed the information to
his roommate, Conradt, the SEC said. Conradt immediately shared
the information with Weishaus, a friend, who tipped off his co-workers Payton and Durant, according to the U.S. </p>
<p>Martin, Conradt and Weishaus all pleaded guilty last year
and await sentencing. </p>
<h2>41% Jump </h2>
<p>Payton and Durant bought securities in SPSS in the days
leading up to the announcement of the acquisition. When the deal
was made public, the software company''s stock rose by 41 percent
in a day, earning Durant $53,000 in illegal profit and Payton
$243,000, the SEC said. </p>
<p>After Euro Pacific was subpoenaed in November 2009 by the
SEC as part of its investigation, Payton, Durant, Conradt and
Weishaus were questioned by the broker and later fired, said
Andrew Schiff, director of marketing for the company. </p>
<p>''The firm has been cleared by the SEC and Finra and had
control systems in place to detect this kind of conduct,''
Schiff said in a phone interview. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold bonds tied
to about $304 million of U.S. home loans without government
backing, adding to signs of life in the market. </p>
<p>The transaction included $171 million of top-rated
securities paying a 3 percent coupon, which were sold at 102.2
cents on the dollar, according to a person with knowledge of the
offering who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly. That''s about 1.5 cents on the
dollar less than comparable benchmark Fannie Mae-guaranteed
bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The notes are unlike other recent deals because they''re
backed almost entirely by 15-year mortgages, which are often
taken by ''more financially secure'' borrowers relative to more
common 30-year loans, according to a presale report by Standard
 Poor''s. The average size of the mortgages, at about $558,000,
was also smaller than the $850,000 in previous JPMorgan deals
since the 2008 financial crisis, SP said. They were mainly
''jumbo'' loans, it said. </p>
<p>The transaction''s contracts included an ''untested and
rigid'' process for forcing JPMorgan or other originators of the
underlying loans to buy back misrepresented debt, SP said.
Seeing that ''the framework is more restrictive than those in
other recent prime transactions, we imposed additional loss
coverage requirements in our review.'' </p>
<p>While issuance of non-agency securities tied to new loans
jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in 2012,
sales collapsed after September, Bloomberg data show. Issuance
totals about $2.1 billion this year, and Citigroup Inc. (C) has been
also planning a sale this month. Offerings peaked at $1.2
trillion in both 2005 and 2006. </p>
<p>Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
$625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top

pharmaceutical companies. </p>
<p>Kathy Elsesser and Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, co-heads of
the retail team, will lead the new group with Marshall Smith,
who runs the health-care unit, according to an internal memo
obtained today by Bloomberg News. David Wells, a spokesman for

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
marketing a new type of bond designed to give investors access
to top-rated assets as the supply of covered bonds and other

<p>The 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of notes are
provisionally rated AAA by Standard  Poor''s and will be sold

are secured by fixed-income assets and offer investors three

<p>Goldman is seeking to meet investor demand for the safest
assets as AAA rated bonds become harder to find in Europe.
Redemptions of covered bonds and U.K. RMBS are outpacing new

<p>AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), in its pursuit of
drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP), has hired some of the same advisers that
Pfizer Inc. worked with in its failed push for AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN)
They''re trying to learn from the experience. </p>
<p>Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie''s chief executive officer,
yesterday made clear that a hostile bid is an option for his
company, a move Pfizer ruled out. AbbVie''s effort also differs
in that it''s appealing directly to Shire shareholders early,
offering what it calls a significant premium to win their
support to pressure its board or prepare the ground for a
hostile offer, according to people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>This year''s boom in health-care takeovers is giving
companies and their banks, lawyers, and public-relations firms
plenty of real-life experience to draw upon. AbbVie is being
advised on its $46.5 billion bid by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as well
as PR firm Brunswick Group, both of which also worked with
Pfizer on AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>''They don''t want to back themselves into a corner,'' Navid Malik, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London, said of
AbbVie. </p>
<p>Gonzalez''s team is trying to keep debate focused on the
strategic logic of a deal, rather than on using Shire''s Irish
legal domicile to escape U.S. taxes -- a topic that came to
dominate the Pfizer-AstraZeneca transaction, said one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because talks are
private. </p>
<p>However, they''re also stressing that tax benefits could
enable bigger payouts to investors in the future. The pitch:
that a combination would enrich Shire shareholders beyond what
the company could achieve alone. </p>
<p>Shire, for its part, has said the bid undervalues the
company, and that it has strong prospects on its own. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for AbbVie and a spokesman for Brunswick
didn''t immediately return calls seeking comment. A JPMorgan
spokeswoman declined to comment. </p>
<p>North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie heads into possible
negotiations with advantages Pfizer lacked. Unlike AstraZeneca,
Shire doesn''t have a large workforce or substantial research
base in the U.K. that politicians will fight to keep under local
control, as they did in AstraZeneca''s case. </p>
<h2>No History </h2>
<p>And AbbVie, spun off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) last year,
has no history of past acquisitions to defend. Pfizer''s record
of presiding over large-scale layoffs after buying companies
including Wyeth and Pharmacia Corp. helped rally British
politicians and unions to AstraZeneca''s side. </p>
<p>Shire, domiciled in Dublin for tax purposes and with
management offices in Basingstoke, England, has rejected three
takeover offers from AbbVie. The companies are at odds over how
to benchmark Shire''s shares, with AbbVie arguing Shire''s share
price has been inflated since the AstraZeneca deal highlighted
the attractiveness of U.K. and Irish-domiciled health-care
companies. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), Deutsche Bank AG, Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR),
Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are advising Shire. </p>
<h2>Final Offer </h2>
<p>AbbVie CEO Gonzalez''s statement yesterday that he would
keep a hostile bid on the table contrasted with Pfizer''s
approach. </p>
<p>Pfizer on May 18 said its latest $117 billion proposal for
AstraZeneca was final and that it wouldn''t try to woo
shareholders directly. Under U.K. takeover rules, deeming an
offer final makes it nearly impossible for it to be further
increased. That''s another pitfall AbbVie is keen to avoid, two
of the people said. </p>
<p>Those pledges marked the end -- at least for now -- of what
would have been the industry''s biggest-ever acquisition, raising
questions about Pfizer''s tactics. </p>
<h2>Parliament''s Reaction </h2>
<p>Separately, AbbVie is trying to head off concerns that set
off a heated public debate over AstraZeneca, one of the people
familiar with the situation said. </p>
<p>Members of Parliament in the U.K. expressed reservations
over Pfizer''s history of large transactions followed by firings
and the shutdown of research facilities. </p>
<p>In response, Pfizer promised to locate 20 percent of its
global research workforce in Britain. That in turn fuelled
concern from public officials in the U.S. and Sweden, where
AstraZeneca also has significant operations, and exacerbated
animosity between the two companies. </p>
<p>Shire employs fewer than 500 people in the U.K. and only
about 100 in Ireland. CEO Flemming Ornskov and Phil Vickers,
Shire''s research head, work in the U.S., and other top managers
are joining them there. </p>
<p>In a message to its employees yesterday, AbbVie said no
jobs would be lost in the Chicago area in a Shire deal, and the
combined company would be managed from there. AbbVie is also
arguing that a deal would strengthen Shire''s research and
development capacity and give it global scale. </p>
<h2>Political Scrutiny </h2>
<p>Buying Shire would give AbbVie a growing stable of
treatments for rare diseases. The U.S. company is dependent on
the rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira for about 60 percent of
sales. </p>
<p>Gonzalez yesterday stressed the strategic advantages he
believes a transaction would bring to both companies in areas
such as rare diseases, neurosciences and ophthalmology. He also
pointed to the common ground between AbbVie and Shire. </p>
<p>''Both strategically and culturally, there is great
alignment between our companies,'' he said. They ''are both
specialty-focused biopharmaceutical companies, pursuing similar
strategies, targeting diseases of high unmet medical need.'' </p>
<p>While AbbVie has said the proposed deal would cut its tax
rate by almost 10 percentage points, in its 39-page slide deck
presentation to Shire investors the word ''tax'' surfaces only
on page 20. </p>

<p>Manitowoc Co. (MTW), the maker of cranes
and commercial-food appliances, said it held several discussions
with Relational Investors LLC and will consider the activist
fund''s proposal to break up the company. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is advising Manitowoc, the
Wisconsin-based company said today in a statement. Relational
has amassed an 8.5 percent stake in Manitowoc, according to a
filing yesterday. The shares rose as much as 12 percent, the
most since January. </p>
<p>Relational, co-founded by Ralph Whitworth and David Batchelder, wants the company to spin off its food-service
business, responsible for ice makers and freezers, from its
industrial business, which makes and services cranes and boom
trucks. The fund sees the separation enhancing capital
allocation and strategic flexibility, and attracting more
focused shareholders. Relational may seek board representation
next year. </p>
<p>''The stand-alone crane business would be significantly
more cyclical and not have the smoother cash flows of the
foodservice business,'' Charles Brady, a Boston-based analyst at
BMO Capital Markets, said in a report today. </p>
<p>The food-service unit, which accounted for 38 percent of
revenue, has an implied enterprise value of $3.9 billion based
on the valuation of industry peers, Karen Ubelhart, an analyst
at Bloomberg Industries, said in a report today. </p>
<h2>Higher Margins </h2>
<p>Manitowoc climbed 11 percent to $32.93 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day gain since Jan. 31. </p>
<p>Founded in 1902, Manitowoc sold $4 billion in crane
equipment and commercial food coolers and heaters in 24
countries last year. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Glen E. Tellock already has announced efforts to cut $80 million in
costs to improve margins. </p>
<p>''Manitowoc will likely focus on improving its operational
efficiencies in cranes and food service while it assesses the
longer-term merits of any potential spin,'' Larry De Maria, a
New York-based analyst for William Blair  Co., said by e-mail
today. ''It appears that the activist investors are dug in, and
this process could take some time.'' </p>
<p>Relational, based in San Diego, first disclosed a small
holding of Manitowoc in February 2013. While the fund held talks
with management in January, the Manitowoc board hasn''t yet
agreed to meet, yesterday''s filing shows. The fund also is
seeking measures to boost profit margins. </p>
<p>Relational manages about $6 billion and regularly presses
for changes in public companies such as separating diverse
businesses and finding ways to operate more efficiently. </p>
<p>Relational also has recently targeted other industrial
companies including tool and equipment manufacturer SPX Corp. (SPW),
machinery builder Illinois Tool Works Inc. and hazardous waste
disposer Clean Harbors Inc. </p>
<h2>Hess, Bunge </h2>
<p>Activist investors tend to buy at least 5 percent of a
company''s stock and flag their intention to actively engage
executives and directors by disclosing their holding in a 13D
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Relational also holds stakes in energy group Hess Corp. (HES),
agricultural commodity processor Bunge Ltd., snacks supplier
Mondelez International Inc. and x-ray maker Hologic Inc. among
others, according to its most recent holdings disclosures. </p>

<p>Since Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
bought a stake in Dong Energy A/S last year, the utility''s
hybrid debt has soared to a record, boosting investor returns as
the Danish firm uses the cash to rebuild its business. </p>
<p>Investors holding Dong''s 4.875 percent bond due 3013 have
enjoyed a 14 percent return since the debt was issued in July
last year and a 5.5 percent note maturing in 3005 gained 4.6
percent. Creditors holding Vattenfall AB''s 5.25 percent
perpetual note received 4.3 percent in Sweden''s biggest utility
over the same period. </p>
<p>''Bringing in Goldman was a good idea,'' Finance Minister
Bjarne Corydon said in an interview at Denmark''s parliament in
Copenhagen. </p>
<p>Half a year after Goldman''s purchase of a stake in state-held Dong split the minority coalition of Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, investors are benefiting from the transaction.
The Wall Street bank''s $1.5 billion purchase of an 18 percent
stake was part of a deal, made together with pension funds ATP
and PFA, that helped cauterize losses after Dong failed to turn
a profit on natural gas projects. </p>
<h2>Put Option </h2>
<p>Goldman, which bought the stake through its European
merchant banking unit in a company named New Energy Investment
S.a.r.l., has already seen the value of its stake grow. </p>
<p>Horsens, Denmark-based utility Insero this month exercised
a put option to sell a 1.8 percent stake in Dong to Denmark for
942 million kroner. That price values all of Dong at more than
50 billion kroner. </p>
<p>Dong was valued at 31.5 billion kroner ahead of Denmark
selling shares worth 13.1 billion kroner to Goldman, pension
funds ATP and PFA and a group of shareholders in February. </p>
<p>Insero''s price was based on a 2005-2006 valuation with
added interests minus dividends, Peter Brixen, the head of the
unit that manages the ministry''s stake, said in an e-mailed
reply to questions. Other minority holders, such as SEAS-NVE and
Syd Energi A/S, which control more than 10 percent, were also
able to sell shares at the same terms at Insero. </p>
<p>The yield on Dong''s 3013 hybrid bond eased to about 2.8
percent this week, compared with 5.238 when it was issued in
July last year. Its spread to the government yield curve has
narrowed to about 264 basis points from a high of 355 basis
points in January, a month after the government split. </p>
<h2>Popular Protest </h2>
<p>Goldman became the target of a popular protest in Denmark
after it emerged in December that the investment bank will
receive some veto rights over how Dong is managed in exchange
for its capital injection. Goldman has said it plans to follow
the current management''s strategy. </p>
<p>Dong explores for oil and natural gas in the North Sea and
is the world''s biggest builder of offshore wind turbine parks.
The company said yesterday net losses are narrowing and debt
shrinking after it completed a program of cuts and asset sales. </p>
<p>According to Jakob Magnussen, an analyst at Danske Bank
A/S, Dong''s hybrid bonds have also benefited from a general
appetite from investors for yields and ''risk-taking.'' </p>
<p>He recommends investors to buy into Dong''s two most recent
hybrid bonds with call options in 2018 and 2022, respectively,
as the bonds carry a limited risk to get extended. </p>
<p>''Dong has very solid financial metrics,'' Magnussen said.
''They''re actually much better than the company''s long-term
targets, so we''re expecting them to increase their leverage in
the coming quarters. They want to lower their funds from
operations to net debt margin to 30 percent from 55 percent
currently after they received new equity from Goldman and the
other shareholders.'' </p>

<p>Corporate bond sales worldwide capped
the busiest first half of a year on record as borrowers take
advantage of investor demand stoked by central banks''
unprecedented stimulus measures. </p>
<p>Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which sold a
combined $14 billion yesterday, pushed offerings during the
first six months of 2014 to $2.29 trillion, beating the previous
peak of $2.28 trillion issued during the same period in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday was the
busiest day since June 10 in the U.S. </p>
<p>Central banks'' actions to depress short-term lending rates
have impelled institutional investors to seek higher-yielding
company debt. While the European Central Bank cut its main
refinancing rate to a record-low 15 basis points on June 5, the
U.S. Federal Reserve is holding its benchmark rate near zero
into a sixth year. </p>
<p>''The demand for these corporate bonds is so strong it''s
outstripping the record supply,'' said Brian Reynolds, chief
market strategist for brokerage firm Rosenblatt Securities Inc.
in New York. ''Institutional investors like insurance companies
and foundations are buying more aggressively now than ever in
order to reach their yield targets.'' </p>
<h2>U.S. Issuance </h2>
<p>Oracle, the largest maker of database software, issued $10
billion of bonds yesterday in the second-biggest dollar-denominated corporate bond offering this year, while Goldman
Sachs sold $4 billion of notes, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yesterday''s offerings in the U.S. totaled $15.9
billion, Bloomberg data show. The year''s biggest corporate issue
in the U.S. was a $12 billion sale from Apple Inc. in April, the
data show. </p>
<p>Issuance is accelerating as borrowers take advantage of
yields approaching historic lows and the extra yield investors
demand for the risk of holding corporate bonds instead of
government securities is at about the least since 2007, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes show. </p>
<p>The U.S. corporate bond market is off to its fastest pace
for the first half of the year with more than $880 billion sold,
up from $789 billion in the same period last year, Bloomberg
data show. </p>
<p>Investment-grade offerings reached $683.2 billion for the
first half, beating the previous record of $655.4 billion set in
the same period in 2009, Bloomberg data show. Yesterday''s high-grade sales of $14.75 billion were the most since $16.1 billion
on May 12, the data show. </p>
<h2>High Yield </h2>
<p>Speculative-grade sales also reached a record for the first
half, with $196.8 billion that topped the previous high of $184
billion in 2013, the data show. High-yield, high-risk bonds are
rated below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service and less than BBB-at Standard  Poor''s. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>U.S. corporate bonds have generated returns of 5.9 percent,
or 12.2 percent annualized, which would be the last decade''s
second best year after 2009. In the first half of that year,
issuance surged as banks sold securities backed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.''s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
and credit markets began to unfreeze after the financial crisis,
reviving investor confidence. </p>
<p>In Europe, companies are debuting a record amount of bonds
as investors demanding higher yields show greater tolerance for
untested borrowers who are seeking to diversify funding as banks
curtail lending. </p>
<p>''It reflects the reduced ability of European banks to make
business loans,'' said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody''s
Capital Markets Research Group. ''Non-financial companies are
being forced to enter the bond market to secure capital''
because they can''t rely on banks for loans, he said. </p>
<p>Sales of junk bonds in Europe exceeded $100 billion this
year for the first time, up from $56 billion in the first half
of 2013, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>''The record global bond issuance has a European accent,''
said Lonski. </p>

<p>Venezuelan bonds are posting the
world''s best returns after a surge in the price of oil, the
country''s biggest export. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley say buyers are unwise to bet $115-a-barrel crude can fix
a broken economy. </p>
<p>The government''s dollar-denominated notes have gained 5.9
percent since rebels took over swaths of northern Iraq on June
11, stoking concern that crude production will be hurt and
pushing Brent oil prices over $115 for the first time since
September. While the return was more than 14 times the average
for emerging-market debt, the extra yield of 8.63 percentage
points that investors demand to own Venezuela''s bonds instead of
U.S. Treasuries is still the highest in the world. </p>
<p>Any extra cash generated by the OPEC member''s oil exports
is likely to be siphoned off to pay for imports of consumer
goods amid shortages of drinking water, toilet paper and
medicine that have sparked anti-government protests, according
to Daniel Volberg, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
After currency devaluations and energy output declines,
President Nicolas Maduro is struggling to prop up an economy
posting the world''s fastest inflation and facing the worst
growth prospects outside Equatorial Guinea, according to the
International Monetary Fund. </p>
<p>''The level of macroeconomic dysfunction is so deep that
the story really isn''t about oil prices anymore,'' said Alberto Ramos, the chief Latin American economist at Goldman Sachs in
New York. ''Unless policies change dramatically, I''d be
concerned even with the oil price at $150.'' </p>
<h2>Currency Controls </h2>
<p>Since Maduro succeeded his mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, in
March 2013, the economy''s stagnation has deepened as currency
controls impeded imports and factories shut down. The number of
cars built in Venezuela fell 77 percent in the first five months
of this year as automakers including Ford Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. froze production while American Airlines Inc. (AAL) and
Air Canada have cut back flights to the country because of
difficulty getting money out. </p>
<p>Still, the nation has kept paying its debt. </p>
<p>Venezuelan dollar bonds have returned 19 percent this year,
the best performance among developing countries, as suppressed
interest rates in the U.S. and Europe boosted demand for higher-yielding assets. The average yield on Venezuela''s dollar debt is
the highest in the world at 11.16 percent, 0.8 percentage point
more than lower-rated Argentina, which faces default as soon as
July 30. </p>
<h2>Bank Meetings </h2>
<p>Venezuela will continue to meet its obligations, Rafael
Ramirez, the economy vice president, said June 27. Officials are
meeting representatives of Bank of America Corp. Citigroup Inc.,
Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs in Caracas
to discuss debt, Ramirez said. </p>
<p>Venezuela''s Finance Ministry didn''t respond to e-mail
messages sent yesterday seeking comment on the government''s
debt-payment policies. </p>
<p>Drew Benson, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in New York
declined to comment, as did Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for
Deutsche Bank in New York. Press officers at Bank of America,
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs didn''t respond to requests for
comment. </p>
<h2>Economic Fundamentals </h2>
<p>This year''s rally in the bonds doesn''t ''make sense given
the direction fundamentals are going in Venezuela,'' Volberg
said. </p>
<p>The country''s international reserves fell 18 percent in the
last 12 months to $21 billion on June 27. Arrears to importers
and their banks may be worth as much as half the central bank''s
reported reserves, Volberg said. </p>
<p>Annual inflation reached 61 percent in May after the
government carried out its biggest devaluation since the
introduction of currency controls in 2003. The economy will
probably contract this year and next by as much as 1 percent,
according to the IMF. </p>
<p>While higher oil provides some benefits, signs that Maduro
is turning toward more pragmatic policies after four months of
unrest across the country may be more encouraging to investors,
according to Bank of America. </p>
<p>Last month Maduro fired Planning Minister Jorge Giordani, a
long-term advocate of currency controls who taught Chavez
economics in jail in the early 1990s. The country plans to merge
its three official foreign exchange rates, Ramirez told
investors in London in June. </p>
<h2>Exchange Rate </h2>
<p>The rates range from 6.3 bolivars per dollar to 50 bolivars
per dollar. On the black market, the bolivar trades at 72.18 per
dollar. The government is likely to unify exchange rates at
about 25 per dollar, according to Bank of America. </p>
<p>The cost to the government of exchanging its oil dollars
for bolivars at the official rate is the equivalent of 10
percent of gross domestic product, and authorities make that up
by printing money, according to Francisco Rodriguez, an
economist at Bank of America in New York. </p>
<p>''Venezuela has a source of revenue it can use and with
unification it would pretty much solve its fiscal problem,''
Rodriguez said by phone yesterday. </p>
<p>The country''s oil exports are falling as production wanes
at state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Oil sales declined 8.4
percent last year to $114 billion, the company said June 27.
Output sank about 11,000 barrels a day in 2013 to a total of 2.9
million. </p>
<p>Technical indicators based on historical prices also
indicate the Venezuelan bonds may have risen too far, too fast.
The 14-day relative strength index on dollar bonds has been
above 70 since June 19, indicating they''re the most overbought
in two months. </p>
<p>''The question is how long the markets are willing to give
Venezuela a free pass and how long this process can go on before
you have a more disorderly adjustment,'' Volberg said. </p>

<p>Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker
Matthew Korenberg, the subject of a years-long insider-trading
probe tied to Galleon Group LLC, was told he won''t be sued by
regulators. </p>
<p>John Hueston, a lawyer for Korenberg, said in a telephone
interview that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
which was ready to file a civil complaint 18 months ago,
officially ''de-authorized'' his client as a lawsuit target.
Hueston said it''s ''extraordinary'' for the SEC to be persuaded
to drop a case it was ready to proceed with. </p>
<p>''Too often cases are filed and reputations are ruined
before mistakes of fact and judgment are realized,'' Hueston
said. ''There has been real cost here.'' </p>
<p>The SEC has had mixed success in trials over insider-trading allegations. It lost a jury verdict last month against
STEC Inc.''s former chief executive officer, Manouchehr
Moshayedi, whom it accused of making $134 million from insider
information. That was its third loss since October out of four
such cases to go trial. </p>
<p>More than 20 people have been convicted of insider trading
tied to the investigation of Galleon Group and the fund''s co-founder, Raj Rajaratnam. He was convicted in 2011 and is serving
an 11-year prison sentence for masterminding one of the most
sprawling insider-trading schemes in a generation. His brother
Rengan is on trial for insider trading. </p>
<h2>Abbott Acquisition </h2>
<p>The SEC and U.S. prosecutors were investigating Korenberg
for insider trading involving Abbott Laboratories Inc.''s
acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics Inc. in 2009. </p>
<p>After a separate investigation, ex-Baltimore Orioles third
baseman Doug DeCinces was charged with making $1.3 million in
profit from insider information about that transaction. </p>
<p>The DeCinces case isn''t connected to Korenberg''s, Hueston
said. A parallel criminal investigation of Korenberg was
previously closed, according to the lawyer. </p>
<p>Korenberg left Goldman Sachs at the end of 2012 and has
been focused on defending against the allegations, Hueston said.
He was a banker at Goldman in San Francisco and now lives in the
Philadelphia area, Hueston said. </p>

About 23 percent fewer female vice presidents were promoted to managing director of the bank relative to their male counterparts, they said. </p> <p>Those statistics are attributed to an analysis of Goldman Sachs pay data by Henry S. Farber, a Princeton University economist. His samples included all associates and vice presidents in the firm''s New York class from 2003 to 2011 and throughout the U.S. from 2005 to 2011, according to a court filing yesterday. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs has denied the women''s claims and is fighting the case.

The start date for employees who worked in New York City would be July 7, 2002. </p> <p>Denise Shelley, a vice president who left the firm in 2009, said in a court filing that men at Goldman Sachs repeatedly called women ''bimbos,'' mocked a new hire who had won a beauty pageant and took clients to strip clubs. Shelley said in the filing that she sat on the steering committee of the firm''s network for women and, after joining colleagues at a bar, was called a ''party girl'' by a managing director. </p> <p>The case is Chen-Oster v.

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
biggest energy company by market value, will invest $1 billion
to increase diesel production at its Antwerp refinery . </p>
<p>The company will add a delayed coker unit at the 320,000
barrel-a-day refinery in Belgium that will convert high-sulfur
oil to diesel for use in trucks and ships, the Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon has spent $2
billion in the past decade on expansions in the refinery
including a 130 megawatt power plant and hydrotreater unit that
reduces sulfur from fuels, the company said. </p>
<p>''The investment addresses an industry shortfall in
capability to convert fuel oil to products such as diesel,''
Exxon said in the statement. The expansion ''is the first of
several being evaluated to further strengthen strategic
refineries in Europe to more successfully face the challenging
industry environment.'' </p>
<p>Exxon''s announcement comes after Total SA (FP), the biggest
refiner in western Europe, reported a 10 percent decline in
profit in the quarter ended March 31 on smaller crude-processing
margins caused by overcapacity. European refinery margins shrank
to $6.60 per metric ton of crude processed in the three months
from $26.90 a year earlier, Total said in April, citing its
European Refining Margin Indicator. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software maker, is among companies embroiled in a European Union
inquiry into Luxembourg''s tax treatment of multinational firms,
according to three people familiar with the EU''s review. </p>
<p>The European Commission has quizzed Luxembourg about how it
taxes Microsoft''s intellectual property, said one of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
Competition regulators also asked questions about McDonald''s
Corp. (MCD)''s taxes in Luxembourg, two of the people said. Amazon.com
Inc.''s tax affairs there are also being looked at, the Financial
Times reported yesterday, citing an EU official. </p>
<p>Amid a global crackdown on tax avoidance, EU competition
regulators last month opened a probe into suspected tax breaks
for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in Ireland, Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) in the Netherlands
and Fiat Finance  Trade SA in Luxembourg, the bloc''s richest
country in per capita terms. </p>
<p>''We are in constant contact with the European Commission
on all these tax issues and Luxembourg is pretty confident in
the way it handles its taxation issues and so we''re going to
monitor the information with the commission and hand over the
information that is requested,'' Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg
Finance Minister, said today on CNBC. </p>
<p>The scrutiny of Luxembourg is also a potential
embarrassment for Jean-Claude Juncker, who is primed to become
the next president of the commission -- the EU''s executive arm
in charge of the investigation. Juncker, who led Luxembourg
until last year, helped the country win a reputation as an
attractive location for international companies. </p>
<h2>Member States </h2>
<p>''The commission continues to gather information about
certain tax practices in several member states,'' Antoine Colombani, spokesman for Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said. ''However we will not make any comment on whether
specific companies may or may not be covered by this information
gathering exercise.'' </p>
<p>Sabina Gockel, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Brussels,
declined to comment. Joanna Kwiatkowska, a spokeswoman for
McDonald''s in the U.K., didn''t immediately respond to calls and
an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Natasha Bertaud, a spokeswoman for Juncker at the
commission, said the former Luxembourg premier also has no
comment. Lawmakers at the European Parliament are scheduled to
vote on his appointment later this month. </p>
<p>Lucien Michels, a spokesman for Luxembourg''s finance
ministry, declined to comment on Amazon''s possible involvement
in the tax inquiry. He didn''t immediately respond to e-mailed
questions concerning other companies. </p>
<h2>French Unit </h2>
<p>McDonald''s denied earlier this year a magazine report that
it avoided paying taxes related to more than $3 billion of
revenue in France since 2009, saying inspections by fiscal
authorities at its French unit were routine. </p>
<p>The EU''s investigations of Apple, Starbucks and Fiat
Finance focus on so-called transfer-pricing arrangements on
taxing commercial transactions between company units. </p>
<p>The commission has said it will continue a wider inquiry
into those deals, including information gathering from the U.K.,
Belgium, Cyprus and Malta. Governments can be ordered by the
European Commission to claw back unfair aid. </p>
<p>The EU has also sought details from Belgium, Spain, France,
Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the U.K., Cyprus and Malta
on so-called patent boxes, which allow tax reductions on income
from patents. </p>
<p>The EU request for information on Amazon relates to whether
Luxembourg''s tax decisions on the company complied with state-aid rules, the FT said. Amazon''s press office in the U.K. didn''t
respond to a call for comment. </p>

<p>Longer-term Treasuries rose, pushing 10-and 30-year yields lower amid speculation an uptick in inflation and acceleration in the U.S. job market won''t be enough to pressure the Federal Reserve into raising rates soon. </p> <p>The yield on the 30-year bond dropped for the first time in four days even as a report last week showed U.S. employers added more jobs in June than forecast and the unemployment rate dropped to an almost six-year low. The difference between the yields on five-year notes and 30-year bonds narrowed to 1.70 percentage points before the Fed releases minutes of its June meeting on July 9. The U.S. will sell $61 billion in notes and bonds this week. </p> <p>''Even though data has been looking a little better, the jury is still out on if it will lead to momentum in the second half,'' said George Goncalves, the head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of the 22 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. ''The back end is a comfortable place for investors to be.'' </p> <p>The 30-year bond yield dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.44 percent at 5 pm New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.375 percent bond maturing in May 2044 rose 19/32, or $5.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 27/32. </p> <h2>Market Yields </h2> <p>The 10-year yield fell three basis points to 2.61 percent after rising 10 basis points last week. The five-year yield was little changed at 1.73 percent while the three-year yield rose one basis point to 0.97 percent. </p> <p>This week''s note and bond sales will consist of $27 billion of three-year Treasuries tomorrow, $21 billion of 10-year notes on July 9 and $13 billion of 30-year debt on July 10. </p> <p>''Aggressive buyers want to move out the curve a bit,'' said Guy Haselmann, an interest-rate strategist in New York at primary dealer Bank of Nova Scotia. He forecasts the 30-year yield will drop below 3.29 percent before the end of summer, and under 3 percent by year-end as investors ''question people''s rosy outlook for growth and inflation.'' </p> <p>The difference between the yields on five-year notes and 30-year bonds touched 1.67 percentage points on June 18, the narrowest since September 2009. During the period, it widened to as much as 3.11 percentage points in November 2010. </p> <h2>Global Markets </h2> <p>The extra yield that 10-year Treasuries offer over their Group-of-Seven counterparts expanded one basis point to 72 basis points, almost the most since April 2010. </p> <p>''Treasuries still look attractive against a lot of comparable markets,'' said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich  Co. </p> <p>The U.S. is recovering after contracting at a rate of as much as 8.3 percent at the worst of the recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. The economy added 288,000 jobs in June, compared with the 215,000 projected by a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent, a six-year low. </p> <p>Policy makers have kept their target for overnight lending between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. The central bank will publish the minutes of its June 17-18 meeting on July 9. </p> <p>Traders see about a 78 percent chance officials will raise the key rate from near zero by September 2015, fed funds futures show. That''s up from 56 percent at the end of May. </p> <h2>Fed Watch </h2> <p>''The front end will re-price to a level consistent with when the market thinks the first rate hike will take place,'' Haselmann of Scotia said. ''We have no better visibility than the Fed.'' </p> <p>The central bank will increase its benchmark interest-rate target in the third quarter of 2015, rather than the first three months of 2016, according to a report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The bank joins JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in moving up its Fed estimates. </p> <p>The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY) dropped 0.15 percent in the month ended July 4. The Bloomberg Global Developed Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV) gained 0.8 percent, reflecting trader expectations for Europe and Japan to keep borrowing costs at record lows. </p> <p>In the relative calm that is the market for U.S. Treasuries, a sense of unease over a vital cog in the financial system''s plumbing is beginning to rise. </p> <p>The Fed''s bond purchases combined with demand from banks to meet tightened regulatory requirements is making it harder for traders to easily borrow and lend certain desired securities in the $1.6 trillion-a-day market for repurchase agreements. That''s causing such trades to go uncompleted at some of the highest rates since the financial crisis. </p> <p>Such failures to deliver Treasuries have averaged $65.6 billion a week this year, reaching as much as $197.6 billion in the week ended June 18, Fed data show. Uncompleted trades averaged $51.6 billion in 2013, and $28.8 billion in 2012, according to the Fed. In those cases, the borrower pays a 3 percent penalty. </p> <p>', 'Longer-Term Treasuries Rise as Jobs Growth Doesn''t Sway Fed View', 'By Susanne Walker and Cordell Eddings', 'Jul 07, 2014  5:09 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-07/treasuries-fall-after-goldman-sachs-brings-forward-fed-forecast.html') LIMIT 1;

<h2>Collegium Gets Patent on Abuse-Prevention Drug Formulation </h2>
<p>Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc., a Massachusetts-based
pharmaceutical company, received a patent on a drug formulation
aimed at preventing abuse of some drugs, such as opioids. </p>
<p>Opioid abuse is a growing problem and efforts to design
abuse-resistant or abuse-deterrent formulations have been
largely unsuccessful, the company said in the patent. </p>
<p>Patent 8,758,813, issued June 24, covers a formulation that
prevents the immediate release of a substantial portion of the
drug, even if the tablet is crushed or chopped, with the
resulting material placed in water, snorted or swallowed. </p>
<p>This is accomplished by bonding the drug to fatty acids
that constitute as much as 15 times the molecular weight of the
active ingredient or by dispersing the drug within
microparticles composed of a material that is either slowly
soluble or insoluble in water. </p>
<p>Collegium applied for the patent in April 2013 with help
from San Francisco''s Cooley LLP. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) is turning to the
bond market to raise money that will allow the coal miner to pay
off a revolving loan that restricts its borrowing capacity. </p>
<p>Walter sold $320 million of debt in an add-on to its $650
million of 9.5 percent, first-lien notes due October 2019,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It will use the money
to repay borrowings on its revolving lines of credit, according
to a regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>The new notes, part of a deal initially offered to
investors in September 2013, were sold at 99 cents on the dollar
to yield 9.74 percent, Bloomberg data show. The securities
traded at 101.5 cents on the dollar yesterday to yield 9.12
percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>The paydown will terminate the loan, ridding the
Birmingham, Alabama-based company of a corresponding leverage
test that prevented the highly indebted coal miner from
accessing the full amount of the revolver, according to Srihari Rajagopolan, a credit analyst at UBS AG. </p>
<p>The company will be left with $77 million of revolving
credit, down from $314 million before the transactions, and $43
million will be accounted for by letters of credit, according to
a statement from Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<h2>''Unsustainable'' Debt </h2>
<p>The new notes would add to Walter''s debt load, which
included $2.92 billion of long-term borrowings on March 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Standard  Poor''s
lowered its credit rating to CCC+ from B- on June 27, saying in
a ratings statement that Walter had an ''unsustainable'' amount
of debt because of the low price of the metallurgical coal it
produces. </p>
<p>Executives of the coal miner told bondholders and lenders
on a private teleconference today that after the notes were
sold, it would have no more capacity under its credit agreement
to sell first-lien debt, according to two people on the call who
asked not be named because it wasn''t public. Walter would also
give up its ability to issue new second-lien bonds if it acts on
an option to pay interest with more debt on its $350 million of
11 percent notes due April 2020, said the people. </p>
<p>The company told investors today that it would continue
considering requests to swap debt for equity, the people said.
Chief Financial Officer Bill Harvey didn''t immediately respond
to a phone message left for comment about today''s call. </p>
<h2>Debt Swap </h2>
<p>Walter swapped $35 million of its 9.875 percent of $520
million senior unsecured notes due 2020 for $3.15 million in
common stock during the first quarter this year, Harvey said
during in a public conference call on May 1. </p>
<p>Speculation that shares could be diluted helped send
Walter''s stock down 8.6 percent to $5.62 today. Shares have
dropped 66 percent this year. </p>
<p>Walter executives on today''s call laid out several cost-saving measures they expect to undertake. The company plans to
save at least $20 million in annual capital expenditures from
the $130 million it previously told debt investors it would
spend, the people said. </p>
<p>Walter began idling its Canadian mines in April after the
global benchmark price for metallurgical coal fell to a six-year
low of $120 per metric ton. The money-saving measure resulted in
a charge of about $7 million related to severance costs,
according to today''s filing. </p>
<h2>Force Majeure </h2>
<p>The coal miner said today it plans to assert a force
majeure defense against Ridley Terminals Inc. that would allow
it to skirt an otherwise obligatory payment set forth in a
logistics contract with the coal transportation company. It has
an agreement with Ridley requiring a minimum yearly throughput
in British Columbia of 4 million metric tons of coal. </p>
<p>Walter''s maximum cost for not using the terminal is C$25
million ($23.4 million). The force majeure defense is based on
''certain geological conditions'' affecting the idled Wolverine
mine, according to the filing. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Ridley declined to comment. </p>
<p>Maple Leaf Loading Ltd., which transported Walter''s
metallurgical coal from the now-idled Brule Mine to its
processing plant, has been placed into receivership by its
creditors, Walter said in the filing. As a result, Walter is
looking for an alternative transporter. </p>
<p>Moody''s assigned a B3 rating to the new notes today, while
reducing Walter''s corporate family rating to Caa2 from Caa1. </p>
<p>Before lenders agreed on July 7 to grant a temporary
reprieve of the loan''s leverage test, Walter was unable to
borrow more than $94.1 million on its $313.8 million of
revolving credit lines, according to a May 6 regulatory filing. </p>
<p>The company expects to retain access to short-term capital
through a new $62.1 million portion of the revolving loan that
it expects lenders to agree to today, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The company''s $450 million 8.5 percent notes due in April
2021, which are junior to the new notes, traded today at 56.5
cents on the dollar to yield 20.7 percent, compared with 59
cents on July 3, Trace data show. </p>

<p>Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) got a boost from
soccer''s World Cup in the second quarter, with sports fans
drawing higher advertising spending and clamoring for satellite
subscriptions. </p>
<p>Operating profit rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier to
7.62 billion pesos ($585 million), leaving out depreciation,
amortization and other expenses, according to a statement
yesterday from the world''s biggest Spanish-language broadcaster.
That surpassed the 7.5 billion-peso average of analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Televisa, which had rights to all 64 World Cup matches
through its Sky satellite unit, is relying on exclusive content
to draw viewers and advertisers. The growth helps compensate for
the revenue Televisa was forced to give up last year, when new
regulations required the company to offer up its two most
popular broadcast channels to other cable and satellite
companies for free. </p>
<p>While the World Cup effect aided Televisa, the tournament
is only temporary. Sky''s subscriber growth is likely to be
milder in the future, executives said today on a conference
call. Televisa shares dropped 2.9 percent to 89.69 pesos at the
close in Mexico City. </p>
<p>Satellite users grew by 203,262 in the second quarter,
compared with the 140,000 average estimate of three analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. The company ended the quarter with 6.4
million satellite customers, up 13 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a growth rate of 14 percent in the first quarter. </p>
<h2>Telecom Bill </h2>
<p>Cable connections -- Internet, video and phone -- totaled
5.4 million, an increase of 190,000 from the prior quarter,
compared with the 150,000 average estimate. Video customers were
up 6.9 percent from a year earlier, up from 6.5 percent in the
first quarter. </p>
<p>Last weekend, Mexico''s Senate approved measures that also
force the broadcaster to publish its advertising rates and stand
by them regardless of who the customer is. The bill has been
sent to the lower house of Congress for approval. </p>
<p>''While there are factors that benefit Televisa''s
operations in 2014, such as the dynamism of Sky and Cablevision,
the implementation of must carry, must offer and stronger
regulation could limit the company''s growth,'' Valeria Romo, an
analyst with Banco Monex SA, said in an e-mailed report today. </p>
<p>Net income jumped to 2.21 billion pesos, or 77 centavos a
share, from 1.83 billion pesos, or 63 centavos, lifted by
improved results from investments in Univision Communications
Inc. and Grupo Iusacell SA. Total sales climbed 7.1 percent to
19.3 billion pesos, in line with analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Mobile Mergers? </p>
<p>Iusacell, Mexico''s third-largest mobile-phone company, has
struggled to compete with billionaire Carlos Slim''s America
Movil SAB, which controls 70 percent of the market. Televisa is
interested in mergers in the mobile industry to better compete,
though it''s awaiting the outcome of the telecommunications bill
to make investment plans, executives said on the conference call
today. Iusacell is co-owned by Televisa and billionaire Ricardo
Salinas. </p>
<p>Sales from the content business, which includes broadcast
and cable networks as well as syndication, rose 4.4 percent in
the quarter to 8.61 billion pesos. In May, Televisa''s president
of content, Jose Baston, said the company was in negotiations to
develop shows for video-streaming provider Netflix Inc. That
month, the broadcaster also announced a five-year programming
deal with Sony Pictures. </p>
<h2>Subscriber Growth </h2>
<p>Advertising sales climbed 6 percent to 6.26 billion pesos
as companies spent more for World Cup spots. The tournament also
increased Televisa''s costs, with the content unit''s profit
margin falling 3.3 percentage points to 46 percent. The World
Cup normally stretches from the end of the second quarter to the
beginning of the third. Mexico''s national team bowed out at the
very end of the second quarter, with a June 29 loss to the
Netherlands. </p>
<p>Televisa shares have climbed 14 percent this year on
optimism that the new telecommunications laws will help it
compete with America Movil for Internet and phone users. </p>

<p>Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader
Julien Grout was granted a court review of a U.K. regulator''s
decision to drop him from a probe into a $6.2 billion trading
loss before he was allowed to respond to the allegations. </p>
<p>Richard Lissack, Grout''s lawyer, told the London court
today that the decision by the Financial Conduct Authority was
''irrational and unlawful.'' The FCA dropped its probe into
Grout because of pending U.S. charges, Lissack said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan agreed in September to pay about $920 million to
settle U.S. and U.K. investigations into the losses stemming
from Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman who became known as the London
Whale for the size of his positions. The U.S. also filed
criminal charges against Grout and Javier Martin-Artajo, who
oversaw synthetic credit trading at the bank''s chief investment
office in London. </p>
<p>''The next stage in Mr. Grout''s investigation would have
been the issuing of a preliminary investigation report by the
FCA addressing the specific allegations against him which,
importantly, would be Mr. Grout''s first opportunity to fully
understand the case against him and to respond to it,'' lawyers
for Grout said in court documents. </p>
<p>The FCA report into the trading loss at JPMorgan has drawn
objections from at least three of the New York-based bank''s
former employees. </p>
<h2>FCA Challenges </h2>
<p>Grout is making another challenge to the FCA at a different
court later this month, claiming he can be identified in its
final report on the London Whale loss. Martin-Artajo asked the
tribunal last month for more time to challenge the regulator''s
findings. </p>
<p>Achilles Macris, another JPMorgan executive, won a
challenge against the regulator in April, claiming he should''ve
been allowed to respond to the FCA''s findings before they were
published in the September settlement with JPMorgan. </p>
<p>The U.S. has started proceedings to extradite Martin-Artajo
from Spain. Grout, who wasn''t in court, ''is in France, as a
French national he is, as it were, safe there,'' Lissack said. </p>
<p>Grout won''t face a fair trial in the U.S. if he is tried in
absentia, Judge Andrew Collins said when granting the judicial
review to be heard later this year. </p>
<p>The FCA decided to drop its probe into Grout in December,
the regulator said in court documents. </p>
<p>It was ''not a proportionate use of resources to continue
the investigation'' into Grout given the U.S. investigation,
Paul Stanley, a lawyer representing the FCA, said in the filing. </p>

<p>Bank of Japan officials see buying
exchange-traded funds based on the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 as a
future option to boost the impact of unprecedented easing and
encourage companies to deploy cash for investment, according to
people familiar with the central bank''s discussions. </p>
<p>Including funds that track the index would broaden the
range of shares in the BOJ''s ETF purchases, which now target the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average and the Topix index, said the people
who declined to be named because the talks were private. An
increase in funds tracking the JPX-Nikkei 400, higher liquidity
and vibrant trading in futures would be required before any
decision to add the new benchmark to the bank''s ETF program, the
people said. </p>
<p>With capital expenditure at late-1980s levels, the
challenge for Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is to get companies to
pour record cash into investments that could strengthen a
recovery and spur inflation. Buying funds based on the JPX-Nikkei 400, a brainchild of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
that selects members based on profitability and use of cash,
would signal that the BOJ is on board with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe''s bid to raise the growth potential of the world''s third-biggest economy. </p>
<p>''Buying the JPX-Nikkei 400 would send a clear message that
the BOJ wants to encourage business investment,'' said Masaki Kuwahara, an economist at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. ''This
would also show that the BOJ is hand in hand with the government
as Abe is trying hard to push companies to use their cash to
strengthen the economy.'' </p>
<h2>GPIF Invests </h2>
<p>The JPX-Nikkei 400 was down 0.3 percent at 10:06 a.m. in
Tokyo, bringing its year-to-date decline to 2.1 percent. </p>
<p>The BOJ targets a 1 trillion yen ($9.8 billion) annual
increase in its ETF holdings, as part of monetary easing aimed
at generating 2 percent inflation. </p>
<p>The JPX-Nikkei 400, which started in January, picks
companies that use cash efficiently and have management that is
focused on creating value for investors, Japan Exchange Group
Inc. and Nikkei Inc. said in November 2013. </p>
<p>The Government Pension Investment Fund, the world''s
largest, revamped its Japanese stock investment strategies in
April, adding the new index as one of its benchmarks. </p>
<p>The people said the BOJ must be careful to avoid distorting
market prices, and some said it usually takes a year to assess a
new market. </p>
<h2>Record Cash </h2>
<p>Japanese firms boosted their cash stockpile to a record 232
trillion yen at the end of March, according to BOJ data last
month, underlining the difficulty Abe faces a year and a half
into his drive to reflate the economy. </p>
<p>The BOJ will keep its monetary policy unchanged at its July
14-15 meeting, according to all 34 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Thirty-eight percent predict additional easing
this year, dropping from 58 percent last month. </p>
<p>Kuroda has said encouraging companies and households to
make investments is a key transmission channel for the central
bank''s stimulus to achieve a goal of stable 2 percent inflation. </p>
<p>Abe plans to cut the corporate tax rate in stages from the
fiscal year starting April, lowering it below 30 percent in a
few years, to boost Japan''s competitiveness and attract foreign
investment. </p>

<p>Wall Street banks are racing to
simplify their swaps holdings before new rules make it more
costly to own the derivatives starting in 2017, according to a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive. </p>
<p>They''re doing so increasingly through a process known as
compression, said Andy Hudis, a managing director at Goldman
Sachs who runs the credit valuation adjustment desk in London.
Through this technique, offsetting transactions are eliminated
so that a bank can reduce, say, 100 trades into 10 that give the
identical position. </p>
<p>Swaps helped cause and intensify the 2008 financial crisis
given the opaque entanglements they created among banks. In
response, global regulators took a series of steps to reduce
risk, including boosting the amount of money they have to set
aside to guarantee the transactions. Compression can help them
reduce that burden, while also reducing market complexity. </p>
<p>''For dealers, this is an extremely important topic right
now,'' Hudis said today during a presentation sponsored by
Bloomberg Markets magazine and LCH.Clearnet Ltd. Compressing
swaps to reduce the outstanding value in notional terms for
banks is among the top three goals among Wall Street firms now,
he said. Notional values don''t represent actual money that has
changed hands and determine payment flows under swap contracts. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C), Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) were the five largest
U.S. swaps dealers as of Dec. 31, according to the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency. Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP
runs a swap-execution facility where the derivatives trade.
Since 2003, more than $400 trillion in notional value of
interest-rate swaps has been compressed, according to TriOptima,
an ICAP Plc division that pioneered the technique. </p>
<h2>Market Safeguards </h2>
<p>Improving the safety and structure of over-the-counter
derivatives was a central goal of global regulators after swaps,
the largest segment of the $710 trillion market, helped cause
the financial crisis and then worsened its aftermath. Netting
down swaps by compression is encouraged in both the Dodd-Frank
Act in the U.S. and the European Market Infrastructure
Regulation legislation. </p>
<p>''So now it''s the law,'' Stephen O''Connor, chairman of the
International Swaps  Derivatives Association, the industry''s
lobbying and trade group, said during the same presentation
today. ''While the law generally gets people''s attention,'' the
new capital rules from the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision are what is really driving the demand, he added. </p>
<p>While compressing trades has been around for over a decade,
''there is a new sense of urgency from market participants,'' he
said. </p>
<h2>More Capital </h2>
<p>That''s because under Basel III rules starting in 2017,
banks will face higher capital requirements for their swaps
activity related to the amount of leverage they use in day-to-day operations and the cash and securities they deposit at
clearinghouses that''s used in case of a default. </p>
<p>For example, a bank with swaps worth $1 trillion in
notional value on its books could face $180 million in minimum
capital charges under the leverage ratio in some cases, said Dan Maguire, global head of LCH.Clearnet''s SwapClear service. </p>
<p>''That''s a pretty sizable amount,'' he said, speaking
during the presentation today. </p>
<p>International regulators are trying to safeguard trades and
bring more openness to a market whose secrecy and sheer size
overwhelmed authorities in 2008. Where swaps had been one-on-one
deals before, now they would be backstopped by third parties in
clearinghouses that ensure everyone can pay, with the aim of
avoiding emergency bailouts and panic. Basel is made up of
regulators from 27 of the world''s largest economies and sets
international bank supervisory guidelines. </p>
<p>If banks hadn''t been netting down their trades since 2003
some in the industry estimate there could now be $1 quadrillion
of the contracts outstanding, according to ISDA''s O''Connor. </p>
<p>''If that number even exists,'' he said. </p>

extent as the year goes through.'' </p>
<p>The pound declined 0.1 percent to 79.57 pence per euro at

<p>Petroleos Mexicanos is beating global
oil producers from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to Chevron Corp. in the
bond market as lawmakers move closer to approving rules to lower
the company''s taxes. </p>
<p>Dollar-denominated debt from Pemex, as the state-owned
company is known, has returned 8.3 percent this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 6
percent gain for 372 securities from integrated oil companies
globally, a 1.3 percent return on debt issued by Exxon, the
world''s biggest energy company by market value, and a 3.3
percent advance on Chevron notes. </p>
<p>Congress is debating rules this week to implement the most
sweeping constitutional changes to the nation''s energy policies
in seven decades. The government is seeking to reduce Pemex''s
tax burden, the highest among the world''s top integrated oil
companies, and open the energy industry to more foreign
investment to reverse nine years of output declines. Pemex,
which last month had its credit rating lifted to the highest
ever by Moody''s Investors Service, paid $66 billion in taxes,
equal to 54 percent of its sales, in 2013. </p>
<p>''It''s a sign of the trust that the market is putting in
the government''s ability to deliver on its promises,'' Joe Kogan, an emerging-market strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia who
recommends buying Pemex debt, said in a telephone interview from
New York. ''The positive is reforms that make Pemex more
competitive such as a lower tax burden, ability to work with
foreigners, better corporate governance.'' </p>
<h2>Foreign Investment </h2>
<p>President Enrique Pena Nieto pushed through changes to
Mexico''s charter in December that will let foreign companies
drill for oil in the country for the first time since 1938.
Exxon and Chevron, along with Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Repsol
SA, have expressed interest in Mexican oil fields, which contain
about 113 billion barrels of prospective reserves. The reforms
may add $20 billion to foreign-direct investment as soon as
2015, according to Bank of America Corp. </p>
<p>Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, declined to comment on
the performance of Pemex''s debt. </p>
<p>Isabel Ordonez, a spokeswoman for Chevron, the world''s
third-largest energy company by market value, declined to
comment on the state oil company''s bond rally. </p>
<p>Pemex officials didn''t respond to an e-mail and phone call
seeking comment on the performance of the company''s bonds and
investor speculation that the legal changes would reduce its tax
burden. </p>
<h2>Bond Yields </h2>
<p>Yields on Pemex''s bonds due in 2044 have declined 0.83
percentage point this year to 5.32 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Lawmakers will vote on the specific regulations for opening
the industry and establishing Pemex''s new tax structure within
the next month, Senator Jorge Luis Preciado, head of the
opposition National Action Party in the Senate, said this week. </p>
<p>Mexico City-based Pemex has said the reforms may lower its
taxes by $10 billion annually. Its effective tax rate rose to
124 percent last year, the highest among integrated oil
companies globally that disclosed financial statements, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate reflects the company''s
income tax expense divided by pretax income in a 12-month
period. </p>
<p>Mexico is seeking to reduce its reliance on crude revenue,
paring the percentage of its federal budget that comes from oil
to 27 percent by 2018, from 34 percent. </p>
<h2>Pemex Outlook </h2>
<p>''Pemex has the potential to be a much more efficient and
bigger company,'' David Bessey, who helps manage $28 billion in
emerging-market debt including Pemex bonds at Prudential
Financial Inc., said in a telephone interview from Newark, New
Jersey. </p>
<p>Michael Roche, a fixed-income strategist at Seaport Global
Holdings LLC, said the benefits from the energy-law overhaul are
already reflected in Pemex''s bonds, leaving little room for
further gains. </p>
<p>The rally is nearing ''exhaustion'' and additional advances
will be ''small,'' Roche said by phone from New York. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own Pemex''s 2044 bonds
instead of similar-maturity debt from Shell has narrowed 0.47
percentage point this year to 1.02 percentage points, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Mexico''s peso dropped 0.1 percent to 12.9989 per U.S.
dollar at 7:31 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Moody''s raised Pemex''s rating to A3, the fourth-lowest
investment grade and in line with Mexico, on June 19, saying the
legal changes should help improve the company''s corporate
governance and access to exploration and production technology. </p>
<p>''Investors take a look at the Pemex credit and they tie it
very closely to what they think about Mexico,'' Prudential''s
Bessey said. ''The energy reform is clearly a positive.'' </p>

<p>Copper prices will ''grind lower''

<p>Competition to arrange global bond
sales in Asia is heating up as Chinese banks take advantage of
their compatriots'' dominance of fundraising in the region. </p>
<p>Bank of China Ltd.''s 3.7 percent market share ranked 10th
in the first half as Chinese lenders comprised seven of the top
30 sale managers, the highest on record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC Holdings Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. were the top three arrangers, even as
Chinese issuers accounted for more than 50 percent of the $106.4
billion-equivalent of issues denominated in either dollars, euro
or yen in Asia ex-Japan. </p>
<p>''The market has definitely become more competitive and
you''ve seen the new entrance of Chinese banks,'' said Mark Follett, the Hong Kong-based head of high-grade debt capital
markets for Asia ex-Japan at JPMorgan, whose 8.6 percent market
share trailed HSBC''s 12.8 percent and Citigroup''s 10.8 percent.
There''s ''still a clear separation between the top five or six
players and the rest,'' he added. </p>
<p>Banks from Asia''s largest economy have raised their share
of underwriting business to 9 percent from 4.4 percent five
years ago as Chinese companies involve them in their offshore
push. Dollar, euro and yen bond sales in Asia will set another
record in 2014, beating 2013''s $137 billion, the top five ranked
arrangers say. Sales of bonds in yuan outside China are also
heading for an all-time high. </p>
<h2>Leading Role </h2>
<p>''We aim to maintain the leading role in the offshore
renminbi market and all the Chinese issues, leveraging our
relationships in the Dim Sum market into the G3 currencies,''
Tony Wang, deputy general manager for global markets at Bank of
China (Hong Kong) Ltd., said in a July 10 interview. ''There are
more Chinese companies expanding in overseas markets and picking
Hong Kong as a funding platform. As a Chinese bank with
international experience, we''re able to understand their needs
and the global dynamics.'' </p>
<p>China''s influence in the region''s international bond market
has grown, with the country''s borrowers making up 60 percent of
sales last quarter versus 47 percent the first three months of
2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China''s 10 biggest
issuers make up 13 percent of JPMorgan''s Asia Credit Index,
which covers 324 companies around the region, Moody''s Investors
Service said in a June 23 report. </p>
<h2>Global Footprint </h2>
<p>''This is further amplified when taking into account the
level of state ownership that exists behind many of the
country''s bond issuers,'' said Laura Acres, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Moody''s. ''The China-based sub-index is skewed toward
real estate, oil and gas and quasi-sovereigns, which together
account for 20.4 percent of total exposure.'' </p>
<p>China Petrochemical Corp., the parent company of Asia''s
largest oil refiner, raised $5 billion in April in the biggest
offering of notes in the U.S. currency by an Asian issuer in
more than a decade. The amount matched a sale in November 2003
by Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled
by Li Ka Shing, Asia''s richest man. </p>
<p>That same month, Cnooc Ltd., China''s largest offshore
explorer, sold $4 billion of bonds and Tencent Holdings Ltd.,
Asia''s biggest Internet company, priced $2 billion of debt,
making it the busiest month on record for dollar bonds in the
region. </p>
<p>Some banks counter that as transaction sizes swell, bond-sale managers increasingly need a global footprint. </p>
<h2>HSBC No. 1 </h2>
<p>''Asian deals are being distributed more globally,
especially in the high-grade space where we''ve seen U.S.
investors in particular increasing their appetite for Asia,''
said Hital Desai, a Hong Kong-based director in the Asia debt
syndicate team at Bank of America Corp.''s Merrill Lynch unit.
''Having a global distribution platform really allows us to
connect the dots for both issuers and investors.'' </p>
<p>Bank of America ranked fifth the first six months of the
year, with a 6.9 percent market share that lagged Deutsche Bank
AG''s 7.4 percent. The next highest ranked Chinese bank after
Bank of China was Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
with 1.6 percent, followed by Citic Securities Co. with 1.1
percent. </p>
<p>HSBC has held the No. 1 place since 2010, helping to
arrange 11.4 percent of sales in all of 2013 and 13.9 percent in
2012. </p>
<p>''Issuers across the region look to us for our consistency,
innovative financing ideas and the full global reach of our
platform,'' said Alexi Chan, the head of HSBC''s Asia-Pacific
debt capital markets team. ''We''re on track for another record
year in Asian G3 currencies, assuming the current stable market
conditions continue.'' </p>
<h2>More Banks </h2>
<p>Along with deal size, the list of banks on larger trades is
also getting longer. China Petrochemical, known as Sinopec
Group, picked 13 banks to underwrite its bond offering this year
compared with 10 in 2013. </p>
<p>The flow from Chinese borrowers looks set to continue into
the second half as property developers press on with their debt
offensive. Shenzhen-based Redco Properties Group Ltd., rated B,
five levels below investment grade, by Standard  Poor''s, began
bond-investor meetings in Hong Kong and Singapore last week,
people familiar with the matter said. The company hasn''t tapped
the U.S.-currency market previously, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>''With ongoing low rates, the second half is going to be a
busier one for high yield,'' said Deutsche Bank''s Singapore-based Jacob Gearhart, the head of global risk syndicate for
Asia. ''I also wouldn''t rule out the class of 2011, five-year
non-call three, issuers seeking to refinance.'' </p>

RapidAdvance, one of the companies Mandis invested in, was sold in September to Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert''s private-equity firm. </p> <p>Businesses that take the loans often have bad credit, little collateral or maxed-out credit cards. Borrowing at high rates can trigger bankruptcy instead of growth for entrepreneurs who lack alternatives. The unlicensed brokers who target them with cold calls are paid more the higher rates go. </p> <p>''This is like a payday loan for a business,'' said Pat Fossett, a bankruptcy lawyer in Corpus Christi, Texas, making a comparison to costly cash advances for workers. ''Unless they''re making a large profit to pay that high interest, they''re shooting themselves in the foot.'' </p> <h2>Olive Branch </h2> <p>The way Mandis describes it, while some of his business-lending competitors may take advantage of borrowers in distress, he''s driven by something loftier than profit. </p> <p>''There''s this obligation to try to do something to solve a problem in America in my own way,'' he said. ''Providing capital to people to grow their businesses and to give jobs to people is I think a good thing.'' </p> <p>Mandis said he''s funding Kalamata entirely with his own money and that he chose the name because of his family''s Greek heritage to evoke an olive branch extended to customers. </p> <p>Sheila Stiles was one of his first. Her family has collected used motor oil from auto shops in Tennessee and turned it into fuel for more than 60 years. She said they try to run Goins Waste Oil Co. by Christian principles. With business dropping, they took a Kalamata loan in November because they didn''t want layoffs before Christmas. </p> <h2>''Like Family'' </h2> <p>''Everybody here is family except for two people, and they''re like family because we''ve known them all our lives,'' said Stiles, the Chattanooga-based company''s treasurer. ''The way they present it, it''s so tempting, especially when you know you''re in such a bind.'' </p> <p>Stiles said she sought out Lendio, an online platform that matches borrowers and lenders, which referred her to Kalamata. Goins borrowed $122,000, agreeing to pay back $165,920 in about 11 months, according to a copy of the contract. While Stiles was aware of the loan terms, she said they turned out to be more onerous than she thought. Goins furloughed employees so it could afford the sums that Kalamata took daily and then weekly from the company''s bank account, she added. </p> <p>''I don''t think it''s fair,'' Stiles said. ''He''s taking advantage of the small-business owners because of the interest rate that he charges.'' </p> <h2>''Pretty Aggressive'' </h2> <p>The Goins contract shows a rate of 36 percent. When calculated as an effective annual percentage rate -- like the ones credit-card or mortgage loans are legally required to disclose -- it would jump to 72 percent, said Marco Lucioni, a vice president at nonprofit lender Opportunity Fund. The U.S. Truth in Lending Act requires that rate be stated on loans to consumers, not businesses. </p> <p>''Every time you make a payment you''re reducing the amount of money you had available to work with,'' said Lucioni, whose nonprofit group helps entrepreneurs find affordable loans. ''When I''m telling you a dollar amount you have to pay on a daily basis, that''s always going to sound so little and affordable. Don''t fall for these gimmicks.'' </p> <p>Asked about his rates, Mandis said more than 20 percent ''would be high for us.'' The Goins case was an exception because the borrowers run a seasonal business, he said. </p> <p>After Stiles and Mandis were interviewed for this story, Stiles complained to Kalamata. The company told her she could pay back the loan more slowly, lowering her payments by about $1,000 a week, she said in a second call. </p> <p>''Although we had no legal obligation to do so, we did this without imposing any penalty,'' Mandis said. ''We hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards and compliance with applicable lending laws.'' </p> <h2>Forever Yogurt </h2> <p>Mandy Calara, who runs the Forever Yogurt frozen-yogurt chain in Chicago, said his Kalamata loan worked out. He borrowed to cover payroll and rent in November when harsh weather cut demand. Calara said he found Kalamata through another online platform called Biz2Credit and doesn''t remember the terms of his deal. He didn''t have time to apply for a bank loan, he said. </p> <p>''It''s sort of the best of the bad loans,'' Calara said. ''It was still pretty aggressive as far as what our deal was.'' </p> <p>Mandis said he wants to make his company the first that small-business owners call when they need financing. So far, Kalamata is still a small business itself, with two employees in Bethesda, Maryland. It has provided $6 million, he said, to borrowers including a Georgia gas station, a Florida doctor and a donut shop in Illinois. </p> <h2>''Eye-Popping'' </h2> <p>Kalamata sued the owner of a New Jersey liquor store for defaulting after borrowing $100,000 in February. The eight-month loan, which shows a 17 percent rate in its contract, effectively costs 53 percent a year, according to Opportunity Fund''s Lucioni. </p> <p>''When you put it in a percentage, it sounds big and eye-popping, but you need to have a relative sense of it all,'' Mandis said. ''Should we let that company just go bankrupt?'' </p> <p>Mandis said the rates are justified because the businesses are risky, post little collateral and can''t get the money elsewhere. Borrowers have an average of $3.4 million in annual revenue and 25 employees, he said. </p> <p>What Kalamata does isn''t subprime lending because the term refers only to consumers, Mandis said, and its customers are businesses. The people who own the companies have credit scores on average well above subprime, he added. Sometimes the money he advances isn''t really a loan at all, he said, it''s financing. </p> <h2>Usury Laws </h2> <p>That''s the legal position most new small-business lenders take. Rather than advancing money at interest, they''re buying a portion of someone''s future sales at a discount, they say, and therefore don''t have to follow state usury laws that cap interest rates or be licensed by state regulators. </p> <p>Kalamata''s rates are relatively low for the industry, according to Rohit Arora, co-founder of Biz2Credit, who said rates have topped 200 percent. Arora said he tries to avoid lenders who charge more than 30 percent. </p> <p>''It''s both an ethical thing, but also every state has a usury law,'' said Arora. ''Right now, it''s not very clearly defined on how much small-business lending is covered.'' </p> <p>Jared Hecht, the 27-year-old co-founder of Fundera, an online loan marketplace that''s planning to work with Kalamata, said the industry is ''in the first inning.'' </p> <p>''Ultimately, the good side will be that small-business owners should theoretically be able to run a competitive process and get the lowest rates,'' he said. </p> <h2>Codename ''Professor'' </h2> <p>Mandis has long positioned himself in some of Wall Street''s most profitable businesses. He joined Goldman Sachs''s mergers and acquisitions department in 1992 after graduating from the University of Chicago, where he was written up in the New York Times for disarming a gang member as part of a student patrol group. The story said he went by the codename ''Professor.'' </p> <p>He switched to the firm''s Special Situations Group, whose bets with the bank''s own money became so profitable that its head quit because his $70 million pay wasn''t enough, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2007. </p> <p>Mandis, who describes his career as a search for meaning and challenges, left Goldman Sachs in 2004 for a hedge fund, then advised consulting firm McKinsey  Co. and was chief of staff to Citigroup Inc. (C)''s president after its bailout. </p> <p>''If I''m choosing something to do, there has to be some intellectual curiosity related to it, because that''s how I''m driven,'' Mandis said. </p> <p>He enrolled in 2009 at Columbia University, where his work for a Ph.D. in sociology formed the basis for his book. He also teaches at the university''s business school and has tutored Harlem teenagers in financial responsibility. In a 2010 CNN segment about Mandis, one of the high school students compared their sessions to taking singing classes with Beyonce. </p> <h2>''The Opportunity'' </h2> <p>In ''What Happened to Goldman Sachs,'' Mandis described how the firm adopted a legalistic approach that enabled it to make more money. Unlike Greg Smith, the Goldman Sachs banker who quit in 2012 and wrote a New York Times editorial calling the firm toxic, Mandis said he isn''t blaming anyone for what he calls a slow cultural drift. </p> <p>''Of course, the sense that one is doing God''s work or serving a higher purpose can easily transmute into a holier-than-thou attitude and an excuse for any behavior,'' he wrote in the book. </p> <p>Mandis recalled asking colleagues about small-business loans while working at Citigroup. Some were skeptical. </p> <p>''They had heard the rates or they''d heard the word ''subprime'' associated with it somehow,'' Mandis said. ''People didn''t want to talk about it, focus on it. I also thought that was the opportunity.'' </p> <h2>''Hank Who?'' </h2> <p>He went on his tour of the industry in 2012 with Brian Nicholson, a vice president at Stripes Group. Nicholson, who joined the New York private-equity fund after co-founding a luxury menswear company named for a Cary Grant character, said the two of them stood out. </p> <p>''Steve and I walk into a merchant-cash-advance business in midtown, and it''s a total boiler room with folks dialing for dollars,'' said Nicholson, 32, who wouldn''t name the company. ''Steve, in his tweed jacket, sweater and tie, begins talking about his tenure at Goldman and being a resource for ''Hank'' during the financial crisis. The CEO responds, ''Hank?'' as in ''Hank who?'' It was a bizarre situation.'' </p> <p>Mandis worked on special projects for Henry ''Hank'' Paulson, the Goldman Sachs chief executive officer appointed Treasury Secretary by President George W. Bush, according to his book''s author note. </p> <p>He also went downtown to one of the biggest loan brokers, Yellowstone Capital LLC. Its red-walled offices in the financial district used to be home to an illegal currency-trading shop run by a professional poker player. </p> <h2>Blue Blazer </h2> <p>Wearing a blue blazer, Mandis walked into a call center full of salesmen in jeans and t-shirts, according to David Glass, the firm''s co-founder, whose stint at a Long Island stock brokerage in the 1990s helped inspire the movie ''Boiler Room.'' Mandis said he had millions of dollars to invest in the industry and mentioned he taught at Columbia, Glass said. The meeting didn''t go well, he added. </p> <p>''Most new players come into the business with high-finance backgrounds and have trouble adjusting to guys like me,'' Glass said. </p> <p>Mandis wouldn''t describe his visit to Yellowstone except to say that he met people who ''would not traditionally work at a Goldman Sachs or a McKinsey.'' </p> <h2>''Bad Feeling'' </h2> <p>One of the lenders he invested in was Bethesda, Maryland-based RapidAdvance, which makes businesses sign over as much as 45 percent of their credit-card receipts in exchange for $15,000 or $18,000, according to lawsuits filed by RapidAdvance against borrowers who defaulted. </p> <p>Mandis, who declined to say how much he invested, decided RapidAdvance could reach more clients with a catchy TV spot. He wanted the man who made the ads for J.G. Wentworth, a company that promises quick cash to lawsuit winners. </p> <p>Mal Karlin, who made those spots, said he was reluctant to get involved because his small ad firm is bombarded by e-mail offers from lenders. </p> <p>''Once they offer me money, I know it''s going to be an exorbitant rate,'' he said. ''I had a bad feeling about it.'' </p> <p>Mandis''s resume persuaded him, he said. The banker invited the goateed director to his Park Avenue co-op to pitch ideas last year. Karlin was taken aback when the client''s wife and two young daughters were waiting. </p> <p>''My worst nightmare is for a kid to have an idea for a commercial,'' Karlin said. ''Everybody thinks that they''re an advertising expert because they watch television.'' </p> <h2>Broadway Ditty </h2> <p>The family wasn''t wowed by his ideas. The director tried again when Mandis was teaching in Madrid, singing a Broadway ditty into the phone for him. The former banker stopped him. </p> <p>''I like that,'' Mandis told Karlin. </p> <p>In the spot, which aired last year, RapidAdvance delivers sacks of cash after a hairdresser, mechanic and chef dance in unison and sing the company''s praises. </p> <p>Mandis said he''s proud of his work at that lender and his new firm. Kalamata''s website features a family history and a photo of him in a sweater and tie. </p> <p>''What I thought I would do with Kalamata is say, ''Here''s who I am, I''m a real person,'''' he said. ''You have to have the values and the brand that people will come back to.'' </p> <p>', 'Steven Mandis, a Nasty Neighborhood''s Mr. Rogers', 'By Zeke Faux and Max Abelson', 'Jul 10, 2014 12:00 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-10/how-a-goldman-sachs-ethicist-became-a-high-rate-lender.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>European sugar prices that are
already the lowest since 2011 will stay low with production
quotas ending in 2017, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>White, or refined, sugar in the European Union averaged 574
euros ($781) a metric ton in April, the lowest since September
2011 and 21 percent lower than a year earlier, according to data
from the European Commission, the EU''s executive arm. In 2017,
the EU will end caps on how much sugar domestic producers, which
mostly use beets, can sell. </p>
<p>''Lower sugar prices are here to stay as we expect the
pending change in regulation to result in an increase in sugar
supply from Europe when quotas are abolished,'' Katherine Tait,
an analyst at Goldman, said in a report dated yesterday. ''This
was a driver of the rapid deterioration in prices over the last
six months as the market adapts to the change.'' </p>
<p>Suppliers in Europe, particularly in the U.K., are becoming
more competitive on price to gain access in ''key markets,''
Tait said. Goldman said in September EU sugar prices will fall
to 500 euros in 2017-18. </p>
<p>The EU will produce 18 million tons of sugar in 2014-15, 7
percent more than 16.83 million tons in the 2013-14 season
started Oct. 1, the French crop office FranceAgriMer said
yesterday. In the U.K., the new beet crop for 2014-15 is making
''very good progress,'' according to Associated British Foods
Plc. (ABF), which owns British Sugar, the nation''s only beet
processor. </p>
<p>Sugar prices have declined globally with supplies set to
exceed demand for a fourth year in 2013-14 at 4.4 million tons,
according to the London-based International Sugar Organization. </p>
<p>White, or refined, sugar for delivery in October fell 0.9
percent to $455 a ton by 2:51 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) and CBS Corp. (CBS) are being asked for information by U.S. antitrust officials probing Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s planned purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc., according to three people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>The Justice Department has reached out to the companies as it investigates whether the cable-industry merger is anticompetitive, said the people, who asked not to be named because the review isn''t public. </p> <p>While none of the companies has publicly opposed the acquisition, some have said they want the U.S. to ensure that Comcast won''t favor its own programming over their content if the merger is approved. Other media companies have also been approached, one of the people said. </p> <p>Among other issues, the antitrust division is asking about most-favored-nation clauses, one of the people said. The contracts are used by Philadelphia-based Comcast and other pay-TV providers to ensure competitors can''t get better content-licensing deals with programmers. </p> <p>Media companies can help inform the Justice Department''s assessment of whether the Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination risks hurting competition, said Amanda Wait, an antitrust attorney at Hunton  Williams LLP in Washington. </p> <h2>''Expanded Footprint'' </h2> <p>''One of the big questions in the Comcast-Time Warner deal is how the expanded footprint of the cable company is going to affect its ability to deal with these content providers,'' Wait said. </p> <p>The Justice Department has been looking at most-favored-nation clauses, which stipulate that pay-TV operators such as Comcast can match subsequent deals networks get for their programming, for at least two years. In 2012, the antitrust division sent civil investigative demands, similar to subpoenas, to DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. about the agreements as part of a broader probe into whether pay-TV companies were squeezing out Internet-video competitors, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News at the time. </p> <p>Most-favored-nation contracts were also targeted in the Justice Department''s 2012 lawsuit against Apple Inc. (AAPL) and five publishers over prices of digital books. </p> <h2>Individual Deals </h2> <p>Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Vice Chairman Michael Burns criticized most-favored-nation clauses in April, saying contracts originally created to help smaller cable-TV companies compete now benefit larger players. The agreements prevent Lions Gate from doing individual deals, such as a promotion with one distributor, he said. That means consumers pay more, according to Burns. </p> <p>Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, said in February it would spend $45.2 billion for No. 2 Time Warner Cable. In addition to the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission is also reviewing the deal. The FCC yesterday started its nonbinding 180-day clock for finishing the review. The Justice Department, which considers the effects on competition, could sue to block the acquisition, approve it with conditions or clear it without requiring changes. </p> <p>''We''re all trying to figure out consolidation, what does it mean for all of us in the industry,'' Discovery Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav said at Allen  Co.''s media retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, this week. </p> <h2>Higher Rates </h2> <p>Netflix Inc. and Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite TV provider, oppose the deal. Netflix, the video-streaming service, has said Comcast is already dominant enough to capture ''unprecedented fees,'' and would gain more leverage combining with Time Warner Cable. Dish argues Comcast will extract lower prices from programmers, leading to higher rates for smaller competitors. </p> <p>Comcast already won approval for its acquisition of NBCUniversal from the Justice Department in 2011. The company agreed to certain conditions as part of the deal, including making sure NBC''s shows would be available on fair terms to pay-TV rivals such as Dish and DirecTV. Abiding by net neutrality rules were also a condition of the agreement. </p> <p>The Justice Department could extend those same terms as part of any approval for Comcast''s purchase of Time Warner Cable, one of the people said. </p> <p>Officials with Comcast, Disney, CBS, Discovery and the Justice Department declined to comment. </p> <h2>Equal Footing </h2> <p>CBS Chief Executive Officer Les Moonves told Bloomberg in May that equal access for his broadcast and cable channels on Comcast systems was an issue the company was studying. </p> <p>''I am sure the DOJ will prevent NBC from getting any advantage or at least we assume so,'' Moonves said on Bloomberg TV on May 15. ''We will be equally competitive with them on that basis.'' </p> <p>21st Century Fox Inc. Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey told Bloomberg News in May his company wants to make sure its online programs could be viewed on an equal footing with those of other services. </p> <p>The Justice Department is using the interviews with the media companies to understand the issues in the merger and guide the investigation, said one of the people. Discussions with the companies will probably be ongoing, the person said. </p> <p>The Justice Department typically has informal talks with third parties and then later can gather testimony under oath, according to Wait, the antitrust lawyer. </p> <p>''They have a very complicated industry they''re trying to understand,'' Wait said. ''They''re seeing a deal they may want to challenge in the future, so they''re starting to put their ducks in a row in the event they decide to do that.'' </p> <p>', 'Disney, CBS Queried by U.S. in Comcast Merger', 'By David McLaughlin, Christopher Palmeri and Edmund Lee', 'Jul 11, 2014  6:00 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-11/disney-cbs-said-to-be-queried-by-u-s-in-comcast-merger.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s asset
management unit intends to quadruple its holdings of European
commercial property in need of renovations or new tenants as
well-occupied buildings in good condition become too expensive. </p>
<p>The company plans to raise its ownership of
''opportunistic'' properties in the region to about 4 billion
euros ($5.4 billion) over three years, according to Peter Reilly, the company''s head of European real estate. During that
time, the New York-based investor will acquire less lower-risk,
or core, real estate. </p>
<p>''In the next three years our buying activity will probably
be 80 percent opportunistic, whereas through 2012 it was 80
percent core,'' Reilly said in an interview. ''Our buy activity
shifts as the capital market shifts.'' </p>
<p>Investors like JPMorgan Asset Management, which holds about
$63 billion of real estate, rushed to the safety of Europe''s
most stable income-producing properties after the financial
crisis. Firms are now flocking to riskier office buildings,
shops and warehouses as prices for the safest assets in Europe
climb to their highest level since 2007. </p>
<p>Almost 60 percent of investors were searching for riskier
properties at the end of the first quarter, up from 47 percent a
year earlier, according to a study by London-based research firm
Preqin Ltd. The proportion of buyers seeking the highest quality
buildings with tenants in place dropped to 35 percent from 56
percent. </p>
<h2>International Investment </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Asset Management owns about 3 billion euros of
core properties in Europe, including offices, shops and
warehouses in the U.K., France and Germany, Reilly said. The
majority of its property holdings, about $45.5 billion excluding
real estate investment trusts, is in the U.S. Europe is second
at about $7.8 billion and Asia trails with around $1.1 billion. </p>
<p>Buying properties in need of investment to reach their
earnings potential is easier now because banks are more willing
to sell underperforming loans tied to real estate than they had
been in the aftermath of the financial crisis, he said. </p>
<p>''Conversations with banks are more productive today than
they were a couple of years ago,'' when there was a big
difference between asking prices and bids, Reilly said. ''That
should accelerate through 2015.'' </p>
<p>Banks will sell loans with a face value of 83 billion euros
this year, 30 percent more than in 2013, as they clean up their
balance sheets to focus on new business, according to data
compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan unit will focus on buying offices in large
cities including Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and
the English cities of Birmingham and Manchester. High prices in
London make it difficult to find profitable deals there, he
said. </p>
<p>''We like troubled assets in really good markets,'' he
said. ''So when you fix the asset, you''ve got a core property.'' </p>

<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index will
climb 4.2 percent to 2,050 by the end of 2014 as economic growth
picks up, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by David Kostin forecast, boosting an earlier projection of 1,900. </p>
<p>Stocks with lower valuations will outperform the market
before the Federal Reserve begins tightening interest rates, the
strategists wrote. Goldman Sachs''s year-end projections for the
SP 500 in 2015 and 2016 remained unchanged at 2,100 and 2,200,
respectively. </p>
<p>''We expect the equity rally will continue, but the
trajectory will be shallow,'' the group wrote in a note to
clients dated July 11. ''Domestic economic growth is
accelerating, and earnings will continue to rise, but further
P/E multiple expansion is unlikely.'' </p>
<p>Kostin''s new forecast makes Goldman Sachs the fourth most-bullish out of 19 Wall Street firms tracked by Bloomberg. The
SP 500 has been trading above Kostin''s previous year-end
forecast of 1,900 for almost two months amid growing optimism
that the economy was accelerating following a first-quarter
slowdown. </p>
<p>The SP 500 trades for 18.1 times its companies reported
earnings, the highest level since March 2010. </p>
<p>Lower-valuation stocks and those with weak balance sheets,
low returns on capital and low margins will lead the market''s
gains before the Fed''s interest rate tightening, Kostin wrote. </p>
<p>''Viewed in relation to bonds, the U.S. equity market still
appears attractively valued,'' the Goldman group wrote. </p>
<h2>Stocks Rebound </h2>
<p>U.S. stocks advanced today, with the SP adding 0.5 percent
to 1,977.10 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average climbed 111.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,075.42. The
Russell 2000 Index jumped 0.5 percent after its worst weekly
decline in more than two years. </p>
<p>The SP 500 rebounded today following its worst week since
April amid signs of financial stress in Europe and speculation
by firms including Raymond James  Associates Inc. that stocks
may be due for a pullback. </p>
<p>Improving macroeconomic data prompted Goldman economists
earlier in the month to predict the Fed will increase interest
rates in the third quarter of 2015, compared with an earlier
forecast for the first quarter of 2016. The Fed will lift its
benchmark rate to 4 percent by 2018, Goldman wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman is ''quite confident that the U.S. economy is
accelerating to an above-trend pace,'' chief economist Jan
Hatzius wrote in a report. </p>

<p>Apple''s landmark deal with IBM today is likely to set off yet another round of "this wouldn''t have happened under Steve Jobs" hand-wringing. In this situation, the case for that is pretty clear.</p><p>The rivalry with International Business Machines goes back to the beginning of Apple, and the late co-founder seemed to hold the grudge throughout his career. On the day Tim Cook announced a collaboration with IBM to create business software for the iPhone and iPad, here''s a look back at five examples of Jobs taking jabs at the century-old tech company.</p><p>"Welcome, IBM. Seriously." In 1981, Steve Jobs placed a print advertisement "welcoming" IBM to the PC market. It was, of course, tongue-in-cheek and meant to highlight IBM''s relatively late entry to an important industry. IBM ended up having a strong run in PCs but abandoned the business in 2005 when it sold the division to China''s Lenovo.</p><p>Jobs Gives IBM the Finger. The vintage photo of a young, rebellious Jobs is beloved by Apple die-hards. It resurfaced recently when Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Jobs on the Macintosh, posted it online.</p><p>1984. The iconic commercial, which portrayed Big Blue as the ominous Big Brother from the George Orwell novel, aired during the 1984 Super Bowl. Jobs loved the ad, created by its longtime agency Chiat\Day. Apple''s board didn''t, and preferred to not antagonize IBM.</p><p>Here''s how Jobs introduced that ad in a 1983 speech before it was shown on TV for the only time: "It appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope to offer IBM a run for its money. Dealers, initially welcoming IBM with open arms, now fear an IBM-dominated and controlled future. They are increasingly and desperately turning back to Apple as the only force that can ensure their future freedom. IBM wants it all and is aiming its guns on its last obstacle to industry control: Apple. Will Big Blue dominate the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was George Orwell right about 1984?''''</p><p>Dark Ages. In a 1985 interview with Playboy magazine, Jobs said, "If for some reason, we make some giant mistakes and IBM wins, my personal feeling is that we are going to enter sort of a computer Dark Ages for about 20 years. Once IBM gains control of a market sector, they almost always stop innovation. They prevent innovation from happening."</p><p>The Switch to Intel. During Jobs''s absence from Apple, the company switched to a type of processor made by IBM called the PowerPC. Under Jobs, Apple embarked on a multiyear effort to transition to Intel chips. "Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal computers in the world, and looking ahead Intel has the strongest processor roadmap by far,'' Jobs said in a statement when he announced the switch in 2005. "It''s been ten years since our transition to the PowerPC, and we think Intel''s technology will help us create the best personal computers for the next ten years.''</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
to resubmit its capital plan this year after falling below a
minimum leverage ratio, used that experience as motivation to
cut lending through repurchase agreements. </p>
<p>The bank reduced total assets by $56 billion to $860
billion as of June 30, the lowest level since 2009. Goldman
Sachs is cutting back on businesses that have low return on
assets and $25 billion of the reduction came in the firm''s
''matched book'' repo lending, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said today in a conference call with analysts after the
New York-based firm reported second-quarter results. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is facing pressure to reduce assets as the
bank is below the 5 percent minimum ratio in the proposed
supplementary leverage ratio, which measures equity capital
compared to assets unweighted by risk. In March, it also had to
reduce the amount of capital it planned to return in the Federal
Reserve''s stress test, known as CCAR, after dropping below the 4
percent minimum of a separate requirement. </p>
<p>''We identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with
a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings
potential,'' Schwartz said. ''One of the significant inputs into
the process obviously was CCAR.'' </p>
<p>In a matched book, banks rely on repurchase agreements and
securities lending to fund clients while using the same
collateral and terms to borrow themselves, often overnight. </p>
<h2>Repo Failures </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s asset reductions also affect other secured
financing for clients, Schwartz said. While the firm didn''t
release a full balance sheet with its quarterly results today,
it had $355.9 billion in secured client financing and secured
financing agreements at the end of March, which represented
about 40 percent of its assets. </p>
<p>The bank hadn''t seen a pressing need to cut back on the
low-margin secured loans before the leverage ratio and stress
test because they were viewed as a low risk way to help clients,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm''s
discussions. Clients have been understanding of Goldman Sachs''s
decision to pull back, said the person, who asked to remain
anonymous because the talks were private. </p>
<p>Recent changes in borrowing rates and so-called failures in
the $1.6 trillion-a-day repo market suggest other participants
have trimmed their matched books, the person said. Failures to
deliver Treasuries in repo trades have increased this year and
repo rates on some debt have fallen as low as negative 3
percent. </p>
<p>''A lot''s been written about the repo markets,'' Schwartz
said on the call. ''Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the
matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets,
but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves,
because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple
constraints.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s ratio under the proposed supplementary
leverage ratio is 4.5 percent and will reach 5 percent as the
firm reduces certain fund stakes to comply with the Volcker
Rule, Schwartz said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reported a surprise increase in second-quarter profit as fixed-income revenue fell less than many analysts projected and investment-banking fees rose. </p> <p>Net income climbed 5 percent to $2.04 billion, or $4.10 a share, from $1.93 billion, or $3.70, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $3.09 average estimate of 25 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, has pledged not to overreact to a trading slump that''s now in its fifth year as he positions the firm to pick up market share from other banks that are pulling back. Blankfein is also relying on underwriting stocks and bonds, which accounted for 14 percent of revenue in the second quarter, the highest portion since 2000. First-half investment-banking fees climbed to a record. </p> <p>''We''ve got a strong beat here, primarily revenue-driven, and Goldman is a little more resilient than expected,'' Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Group Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview. </p> <p>Related: JPMorgan Profit Beats Estimates on Trading, Shares Climb</p><p>Goldman Sachs climbed 1 percent to $168.59 at 12:42 p.m. in New York. The stock dropped 5.8 percent this year through yesterday, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. (INDU) </p> <p>Revenue rose 6 percent to $9.13 billion. Compensation, the firm''s biggest expense, climbed to $3.92 billion, or 43 percent of revenue, the same percentage as a year earlier. </p> <h2>Equity Investments </h2> <p>The biggest surprise compared to many analysts'' estimates was the gain on the firm''s equity investments in its Investing and Lending segment, which totaled $1.25 billion. That was almost double the $650 million expected by Barclays Plc''s Jason Goldberg. </p> <p>While Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said that business has repeatedly been a strong performer, Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co., said investors value such revenue at lower multiples than that of other units because it''s so unpredictable. </p> <p>''They had a very good quarter in principally selling some assets in their private-equity portfolio,'' said Kenneth Leon, an analyst who covers the financial industry for SP Capital IQ. ''It was the lumpy transactions that really made the revenue stand out.'' </p> <h2>FICC Results </h2> <p>Fixed-income, currency and commodity trading revenue was $2.22 billion, surpassing estimates of $1.79 billion from Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., and $2.1 billion from Goldberg at Barclays. </p> <p>The 9 percent second-quarter drop in bond-trading revenue, excluding an accounting adjustment, beat the 24 percent decline predicted by Burnell. JPMorgan Chase  Co. today posted a 15 percent drop in fixed-income revenue. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s revenue from the equities division declined 11 percent from a year earlier to $1.63 billion, excluding accounting adjustments. That compared with Hintz''s $1.54 billion estimate and Goldberg''s $1.71 billion projection. </p> <p>While the trading performance was better than expected, it still marked the lowest first-half revenue since the financial crisis in 2008. The bank earned a 10.9 percent return on equity in the quarter, a third of the level before the financial crisis. </p> <h2>''Abnormal'' Trading </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, 53, said in May that the current environment is ''abnormal'' and features trading clients that are the least active in years. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield maintained the smallest range in 35 years in the three months ended in May. </p> <p>''If markets never move or don''t move, our clients really don''t need to transact,'' Cohn said. </p> <p>The firm has cut 10 percent of its fixed-income workforce since 2010 and reduced the risk-weighted assets in that business by $90 billion in the past two years. It has also relied on other businesses for growth. </p> <p>Second-quarter revenue from investment banking, the business run globally by Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, climbed 15 percent to $1.78 billion. That compared with JPMorgan''s $1.77 billion in investment-banking revenue and Citigroup''s $1.34 billion. </p> <p>The Goldman Sachs figure included $506 million of financial-advisory revenue, including fees for takeover advice, an increase of 4 percent. Revenue from underwriting climbed to $1.28 billion in the quarter, including $730 million from debt underwriting and $545 million for equity offerings. </p> <h2>MA Advice </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs held the top spot among arrangers of global equity, equity-linked and rights offerings in the first half, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranked first in advising on announced mergers and acquisitions and fifth in underwriting U.S. bonds, the data show. </p> <p>Investing and Lending posted total second-quarter revenue of $2.07 billion, up from $1.42 billion a year earlier. </p> <p>The firm has about $8 billion of stakes in private-equity funds that it must cut to comply with the Volcker Rule, which limits the amount banks can invest in such funds, Schwartz said. </p> <p>Revenue from asset management, run by Timothy O''Neill and Eric Lane, rose 8 percent to $1.44 billion. Total assets under supervision climbed $59 billion during the quarter to $1.14 trillion. </p> <p>', 'Goldman Posts Surprise Profit Gain on Trading, Deal Fees', 'By Michael J.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has created the
first U.S. index of its type to measure returns of
collateralized loan obligations, which are on pace for a record
year of issuance. </p>
<p>The CLOIE gauge will be available for use today, according
to Gloria Kim, the head of global index research at the bank in
New York. The measure will allow users to track the price and
total return of CLOs and their debt portions, according to the
bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan forecasts that as much as a record $100 billion of
the funds that bundle junk-rated loans into securities with
ratings as high as AAA may be sold in the U.S. this year. There
has been $66.6 billion arranged in 2014, according to data from
the bank. CLOs helped finance some of the biggest leveraged
buyouts during the last credit boom. </p>
<p>This is the ''first time anyone has tried to create a
realistic index with rules that track the price performance and
total return'' of CLOs, Rishad Ahluwalia, global head of CLO
research at JPMorgan in London, said in a telephone interview.
''We want to challenge the market to improve transparency and
while this will evolve over time, we want to help move it
forward as the market develops.'' </p>
<p>The CLOIE tracks floating-rate CLO securities for deals
dating back to 2004, according to information from the bank.
Additional sub-indexes are divided by ratings AAA through BB.
Pricing for the index is provided by PricingDirect Inc., an
affiliate of JPMorgan, according to the bank. </p>
<h2>''Transparent Benchmark'' </h2>
<p>''For a while we wanted to create a transparent benchmark
for investors that tracked returns,'' Ahluwalia said. </p>
<p>The AAA rated portion of CLOs raised after the credit
crisis has returned 1.07 percent this year, according to the
JPMorgan CLOIE Index. That compares with 0.31 percent for all of
2013 and 3.86 percent in 2012. </p>
<p>The CLO measure follows the introduction of the JPMorgan
Asset-Backed Securities Indices in 2013, according to the bank. </p>
<p>CLOs pool high-yield corporate loans and slice them into
securities of varying risk and return, typically from AAA
ratings down to B. The lowest portion, known as the equity
tranche, offers the highest potential returns and the greatest
risk because investors are the first to see their interest
payouts reduced when loans backing the CLO default. </p>

That compares with 4.9 percent sales growth estimated for the broader information-technology group. </p> <p>While PC shipments declined in 2012 and 2013, some markets, such as the U.S., are seeing growth again as companies upgrade Intel-based PCs to get newer versions of Microsoft''s Windows. </p> <p>Intel, the world''s biggest chipmaker, raised its forecast for second-quarter sales last month on improving business demand for PCs, to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Analysts are projecting, on average, revenue of $13.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Santa Clara, California-based company may report revenue of more than $14 billion for the third quarter, projections show, surpassing that threshold for only the second time ever. </p> <h2>Microsoft Jobs </h2> <p>Microsoft is projected to post sales of $22 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in June, according to the average of analysts'' estimates. The Redmond, Washington-based software maker in recent quarters has been benefiting from increasing sales in its newer Internet-based programs for the cloud. Since much of Microsoft''s Windows and Office software is used on desktop computers, a recovery in those products could bolster results. </p> <p>''A stabilizing PC market could, we believe, drive higher than expected Windows sales,'' said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft. </p> <p>Much of the focus will be on what Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella reveals about the financial and staffing implications of his first mission memo, issued last week. </p> <p>Microsoft is planning its biggest round of job cuts in five years, in divisions such as engineering and marketing, as well as areas of overlap with Nokia Oyj''s handset business, which it acquired this year. The restructuring -- which may be announced as soon as this week -- may end up being the biggest in Microsoft''s history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, two of the people said. Some details are still being worked out, two of the people said. </p> <p>Nadella declined to comment about job cuts or any specific steps resulting from the note, saying he''d discuss implementation when Microsoft reports earnings. </p> <p>The cuts could involve 5 percent to 10 percent of a workforce that swelled to about 127,000 employees with the addition of Nokia, according to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Securities who has a buy rating on Microsoft. </p> <h2>Apple Products </h2> <p>Apple, the world''s largest technology company by market value, will also report on July 22. Apple''s stock has gained 20 percent this year on investor optimism about a new batch of products on the horizon. Pent-up demand for bigger-screen iPhones will lead to record sales later this year, according to Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. who has a buy rating on Apple. </p> <p>Analysts project Cupertino, California-based Apple will post an 8 percent rise in net income to $7.45 billion as sales climb to $37.8 billion, fueled by steady demand for the iPhone, which accounts for about half the company''s revenue. </p> <p>The rebound in PCs has coincided with a slowdown in sales of Apple''s iPads as the market becomes increasingly saturated. Bigger smartphones are also partly responsible for the drop and sales of larger iPhones could cut further into tablet purchases, Walkley said. </p> <h2>IBM Challenges </h2> <p>While Microsoft, Intel and Apple are waiting to see if consumer demand will pick up in the second half of the year, technology companies that depend on corporate spending are contending with the growth of cloud computing. Customers are increasingly storing data and software on the Web, rather than on their own hardware, curbing the need for servers and mainframes from International Business Machines Corp. and other computer makers. </p> <p>IBM, reporting on July 17, is projected to post its ninth straight quarterly sales decline, according to the average of analysts'' estimates, as it faces weaker demand for hardware and waning sales in developing countries like China. </p> <p>To meet profit targets, CEO Ginni Rometty is moving IBM''s focus to cloud services and data analytics, while offloading less profitable businesses, such as its low-end server unit. Lenovo Group Ltd. has agreed to buy that division for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S. national security review. She''s cut jobs and reduced the Armonk, New York-based company''s tax rate to help boost earnings. </p> <h2>Web Sales </h2> <p>The transition to mobile computing remains both an opportunity and a challenge for Web companies that depend on advertising to fuel sales. With ads command lower prices on mobile devices than they do on desktop computers, Google Inc. (GOOG) has is boosting the volume of ad sales. The Mountain View, California-based Web-search giant, which will report earnings on July 17, is projected to post second-quarter sales, excluding revenue passed to partners, of $12.3 billion, an 11 percent increase from a year earlier. </p> <p>In the first quarter, Google''s average price per click on an ad slipped 9 percent even as the number of hits on the promotions rose 26 percent. While Google''s search engine is a common tool for surfing the Web on desktop computers, alternative applications are attracting users on smartphones and tablets. EMarketer Inc. predicts that Google''s share of the U.S. mobile-search ad market will decline to 64 percent in 2016, from 83 percent in 2012. </p> <h2>Mobile Ads </h2> <p>U.S. ad spending on tablets and smartphones, meanwhile, will rise 83 percent this year, according to EMarketer. </p> <p>Facebook is faring better in mobile ads, and is projected to make up 22 percent of the market this year, up from 5.4 percent in 2012, according to EMarketer. Ad sales on tablets and smartphones now deliver a majority of Facebook''s ad business, after contributing almost nothing a few years ago. </p> <p>''Facebook has become one of the leaders in adapting to the most important Internet industry trend,'' Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He has the equivalent of a buy rating on Menlo Park, California-based Facebook. </p> <h2>Yahoo, Alibaba </h2> <p>Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)''s report today will provide an update on its turnaround under CEO Marissa Mayer, who has been at the helm for two years. She''s seeking to expand content and ad deals following earlier efforts to attract users and better staff. </p> <p>After adjusted sales fell 1 percent last year, Yahoo said revenue expanded by 1 percent in the first quarter, and analysts on average predict the Sunnyvale, California-based company will match that gain in the second quarter. </p> <p>Still, investors will keep their focus on Yahoo''s stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the largest Chinese e-commerce company, which is set to hold an initial public offering. Yahoo is projected to bring in about $10 billion from the deal, and shareholders will look for any comments on how much of that, after taxes, will be distributed through buybacks or dividends. Yahoo also could use the money to make acquisitions. </p> <p>''The outcome of the highly anticipated Alibaba IPO in August, the tax treatment of the proceeds and use of the new cash are likely to drive the stock short-term,'' Youssef Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, wrote of Yahoo in a note on July 11. He has a buy rating on Yahoo. </p> <p>', 'Microsoft, Intel to Benefit as Businesses Upgrade PCs', 'By Ian King, Dina Bass and Adam Satariano', 'Jul 15, 2014 12:01 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-15/microsoft-intel-to-benefit-as-businesses-upgrade-pcs.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), chasing Sony Corp. (6758)
for dominance in the U.S. video-game console market, said sales
of its Xbox One doubled last month from May, after it added a
lower-priced version of the machine. </p>
<p>''Over the past month, we''ve seen a strong spike in
interest in our Xbox One console options, including the new $399
offering,'' the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a blog
today. </p>
<p>Microsoft introduced a cheaper machine on June 9 after
struggling to convince gamers that the $499 price tag of the
console is justified. Since both the Xbox One and the
PlayStation 4 were introduced in November, marking a new
generation of gaming consoles, Microsoft''s machine has trailed
Sony''s in sales. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft used an entire presentation at
the E3 conference in Los Angeles to focus on hard-core players,
who were alienated by the Xbox One''s debut that focused on non-game entertainment. </p>
<p>The two companies are now gearing up for the year-end
holiday season. Starting in August with the release of Madden
NFL 15, new blockbuster titles will start being released for the
Xbox One, Microsoft said today. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which said
a jump in European deals helped it post record underwriting
revenue in the second quarter, is holding its board of directors
meeting this week in Germany, the Continent''s largest economy. </p>
<p>Chairman Lloyd C. Blankfein and the other directors are
traveling to Frankfurt and Berlin, according to two people
briefed on the trip who requested anonymity because the details
weren''t public. The board met with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann yesterday and will meet with other top German officials
this week, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s 13-member board of directors has typically
held a meeting annually outside of the U.S., traveling in past
years to Brazil, Russia, India and China. The New York-based
bank opened its office in Frankfurt in 1990, the year that
Germany last won the World Cup soccer tournament before taking
the title again this week in Brazil. The firm''s analysts
predicted in May that Brazil would win. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the second-ranked underwriter of equity
offerings in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, behind Deutsche
Bank AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It advised
Volkswagen AG, Europe''s largest carmaker, on its takeover of
truck producer Scania AB, the second-largest deal this year

<p>Monika Schaller, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined

<p>U.S. stocks advanced, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to an all-time high, as companies from Time Warner Inc. to Intel Corp. rallied amid deals and earnings reports. </p> <p>Time Warner surged 17 percent as Rupert Murdoch''s 21st Century Fox Inc. made a takeover bid that was rebuffed. Intel jumped 9.3 percent as its third-quarter sales forecast fueled optimism the personal-computer market is emerging from a two-year slump. International Business Machines Corp. rose 2.1 percent after agreeing with Apple Inc. to develop applications for corporate users of wireless devices. </p> <p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) added 0.4 percent to 1,981.57 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow increased 77.52 points, or 0.5 percent, to a record 17,138.20. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies fell 0.2 percent, after slumping 1 percent yesterday amid Federal Reserve concerns over valuations. </p> <p>''I think Yellen might have derailed a few things yesterday, but today it''s back to earnings again and rightfully so,'' Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co., which oversees $2 billion, said in a phone interview. ''Earnings season is a big deal and you have a couple of big names that have looked good with many, many to come.'' </p> <p>Fed Chair Janet Yellen said today that asset valuations in general aren''t out of line with historical norms, after a central bank report yesterday indicated prices for smaller social-media and biotechnology companies are substantially stretched. </p> <h2>Historical Norms </h2> <p>''I''m not seeing alarming warning signals,'' Yellen said in response to questions from the House Financial Services Committee. While some asset values ''may be on the high side and there may be some pockets where we see valuations becoming stretched,'' in general ''price equity ratios and other measures are not outside of historical norms,'' she said. </p> <p>The SP 500 has rallied 7.2 percent this year amid better-than-estimated corporate earnings and central bank stimulus. The U.S. economy is showing signs of recovering from a 2.9 percent contraction in the first quarter. </p> <p>Data today showed U.S. industrial production climbed 0.2 percent in June, capping the strongest quarter in almost four years. The Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book business survey released today that economic growth was modest to moderate in the latest period as all 12 of its districts reported stronger consumer spending and expanded manufacturing. </p> <p>Equity futures climbed as a report showed China''s economic growth accelerated for the first time in three quarters. Gross domestic product rose 7.5 percent in the April-June period from a year earlier, beating the 7.4 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. </p> <h2>''More Comfort'' </h2> <p>''You''re starting to see the economy and leading indicators move in the direction that most people expected to start the year,'' Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer of U.S. Trust in New York, said in a phone interview. That''s leading to better-than-forecast earnings for economically sensitive companies, he said, while increased merger activity is ''emblematic of a corporate sector that has more comfort in the next couple of years.'' </p> <p>Fourteen companies in the SP 500 including EBay Inc. and Yum! Brands Inc. are reported second-quarter results today. Profit by the gauge''s members increased 4.5 percent in the quarter, and revenue rose 3.1 percent, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <h2>Intel Jumps </h2> <p>Intel climbed 9.3 percent to $34.65, the highest level since 2002. The PC market has shown signs of improvement this year as corporate spending picked up and U.S. shipments returned to growth. Intel''s outlook indicates demand is starting to recover among consumers, who may be buying laptops and desktops again after years of opting for smartphones and tablets instead. </p> <p>Intel also added $20 billion to its stock-repurchase program, including $4 billion planned for the third quarter. </p> <p>Time Warner surged 17 percent, the most since 2000, to $83.13 for the largest gain in the SP 500. Murdoch''s Twenty-First Century Fox is willing to pay more than $85 a share for Time Warner, according to people with knowledge of the matter, a sign the company is undeterred after being rebuffed in an initial offer. Fox shares fell 6.2 percent. </p> <p>IBM gained 2.1 percent. The deal with Apple enables the iPhone maker to expand beyond individual customers and add more corporate clients through IBM''s sales force. IBM gets a boost in its effort to sell software and services to companies seeking to manage workers'' wireless devices. Apple shares fell 0.6 percent, reversing an earlier rally of 1.9 percent. </p> <p>International Game Technology jumped 9.2 percent. Rome-based Gtech SpA agreed to buy the world''s biggest slot-machine maker for $4.7 billion. </p> <h2>''Daily Event'' </h2> <p>General Electric Co. rallied 1.5 percent. The company is in talks with potential acquirers about selling its century-old household appliances business, said people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>''This MA just seems to have taken off, not that it was dead before, it just seems to be almost a daily event,'' said Timothy Ghriskey, chief investment officer at New York-based Solaris Asset Management LLC, in a phone interview. ''A bid for something like Time Warner, that''s big news. A takeover environment creates a lift to the markets. Everyone is looking for the next big name.'' </p> <h2>Internet Stocks </h2> <p>The Russell 2000 (RTY) fell, extending its loss to 1.2 percent over that period and erasing its gain for the year, after the Fed said valuations for smaller social-media and biotechnology companies are substantially stretched. Small-caps and Internet shares were the biggest victims of a market retreat earlier this year as investors dumped the best performers of the bull market amid concern valuations advanced too far. </p> <p>The Dow Jones Internet Composite Index slid 0.5 percent today. Pandora Media Inc. retreated 1.8 percent, after a 1.2 percent loss yesterday. Groupon Inc. declined 1.6 percent. </p> <p>Yahoo! Inc. fell 5.1 percent as the U.S. Web portal reported second-quarter earnings and sales that fell short of analysts'' estimates. </p> <p>The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index declined 1.3 percent after tumbling 2.3 percent yesterday. </p> <p>Seven of 10 main industries in the SP 500 advanced today. Energy companies increased 1.6 percent for the largest gain. Technology shares jumped 1 percent. </p> <p>The SP Supercomposite Homebuilding Index rose 1.9 percent. Homebuilder confidence in July rose more than forecast to the highest level in six months as growing payrolls brightening the outlook. PulteGroup Inc. and D.R.

<p>Commodities from iron ore to copper
and Brent crude will drop over the next five years as global
supplies climb, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
highlighted oil''s recent losses as a sign of increased output. </p>
<p>There will be substantial declines in some metals, energy
and bulk commodities, analysts including Chief Currency
Strategist Robin Brooks wrote in a report. The period of
continued year-on-year price rises for most commodities is over,
they said in the report, which was dated yesterday. </p>
<p>Banks from Citigroup Inc. to Deutsche Bank AG have called
an end to the commodities super-cycle, when China''s surging
demand combined with supply constraints to more than double
prices in the 12 years through 2010. Raw materials rallied this
year from three annual losses as a lack of rain in Brazil lifted
coffee and a ban of ore exports from Indonesia spurred a rally
in nickel. The drop in energy prices since last month showed the
impact of higher global output, Goldman said in the report. </p>
<p>''A prolonged period of elevated commodity prices has
catalysed a supply response,'' the analysts wrote. ''We do not
expect a collapse in global commodity prices. But we do
anticipate substantial declines.'' </p>
<p>Copper was forecast to drop to $6,600 a metric ton over
five years, while iron ore was seen at $80 a ton and Brent may
be $100 a barrel, according to Goldman. The steel-making raw
material was at $98 a dry ton in Tianjin, China, today, and
copper traded at $7,123 on the London Metal Exchange today.
Brent was 33 cents higher at $106.35 on the ICE Futures Europe. </p>
<h2>''Looser Supply'' </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials climbed
3.4 percent this year. That compares with a 0.9 percent drop in
the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index and 5.3 percent advance in the
MSCI All-Country World Index of equities. </p>
<p>''Against a looser supply backdrop, commodity prices should
be much less sensitive to fluctuations in global growth than
they were,'' Goldman said in the report, entitled ''Emerging
Market Forex and the End of the Commodity Market Super-Cycle.'' </p>
<p>Goldman said in a January report the cycle that spurred
higher commodities prices is reversing as increased U.S. shale
oil output keeps energy prices low, and that would eventually
drive raw materials into a bear market. The new cycle would be
the opposite of the super-cycle, it said then. </p>
<p>U.S. production of crude, along with liquids separated from
natural gas, surpassed all other countries this year with daily
output exceeding 11 million barrels in the first quarter, Bank
of America Corp. said in a report July 4. Output climbed as
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling help producers to
pull record volumes of crude out of shale formations. </p>
<h2>Oil Supplies </h2>
<p>Brent rallied to as much as $115.71 a barrel last month as
military gains in Iraq by an al-Qaeda breakaway group stoked
concern that oil supplies from the region may be disrupted.
Prices posted a third weekly loss in the period to July 11, with
Iraqi shipments unaffected and Libya moving to boost exports. </p>
<p>''Less than a month has passed since geopolitical risks in
Iraq pushed up oil prices on concerns over a potential oil
supply shock, and the market seems to have absorbed the related
risks reasonably well,'' Goldman''s analysts wrote. ''The
expansion in oil supply over the past few years -- primarily
from the expansion of U.S. shale production -- has minimized the
consequences from past disruptions in Libya and Iraq.'' </p>
<p>Iron ore entered a bear market in March on prospects for a
glut as supplies surged. Rio Tinto Group (RIO), the world''s second-largest mining company, said today iron ore production in the
three months to June gained 11 percent, while Fortescue Metals
Group Ltd. said its shipments were 57 percent higher on year. </p>
<h2>Surplus Market </h2>
<p>''We remain bearish on iron ore, and expect a surplus
market to drive the longer-term price down,'' the Goldman
analysts wrote in yesterday''s report. ''We see limited upside
for agricultural commodities over the longer run.'' </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank said last month commodity prices will remain
subdued for years as many of the factors and fears that drove
the super-cycle have dissipated. Citigroup said in April 2013
that death bells would ring for the commodity super-cycle. </p>
<p>''Our long-term commodity forecasts suggest that
fundamentals for commodity currencies will deteriorate,'' the
Goldman analysts wrote. ''Relative shifts in terms of trade
between commodity importers and exporters will be a key input to
currency determination over the coming years.'' </p>

<p>Somewhere up there, Steve Jobs has just begun furious work with a bunch of dearly departed programmers on a virtual-reality software called iLive that will restore him among the quick so that he can smack Tim Cook. </p> <p>''All this,'' he''ll screech, ''all this I built out of warfare with IBM, and this is how you do me?'' </p> <p>That is surely what many others are envisioning this morning after waking up to the news that Apple will add IBM business software to iPads and iPhones. IBM recognizes that computers are increasingly becoming something you carry, not something you sit in front of, and Apple is realizing, what -- that people want to use Excel spreadsheets on their iPhones? How is that going to work? </p> <p>There are few corporate rivalries to match the IBM-Apple enmity. Writing in the week immediately following the now-legendary Super Bowl ad for Apple''s Macintosh personal computer, Newsweek referred to their competition as ''almost a holy war.'' </p> <p>But like most beliefs, standards, oaths and solemn vows, throw a little money at them and people will see a different side. Apple''s iThings will continue to be expensive gadgets/tools/toys until they figure out how to make them capable of running the world. IBM''s software isn''t going to be worth either the 1s or the 0s if it''s not on the best mobile devices. So it had to happen. </p>

<p>The bank reduced total assets by $56 billion to $860
billion as of June 30, the lowest level since 2009. Goldman
Sachs is cutting back on businesses that have low return on
assets and $25 billion of the reduction came in the firm''s
''matched book'' repo lending, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said yesterday in a conference call with analysts after
the New York-based firm reported second-quarter results. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is facing pressure to reduce assets as the
bank is below the 5 percent minimum ratio in the proposed
supplementary leverage ratio, which measures equity capital
compared to assets unweighted by risk. In March, it also had to
reduce the amount of capital it planned to return in the Federal
Reserve''s stress test, known as CCAR, after dropping below the 4
percent minimum of a separate requirement. </p>
<p>''We identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with
a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings
potential,'' Schwartz said. ''One of the significant inputs into
the process obviously was CCAR.'' </p>
<p>In a matched book, banks rely on repurchase agreements and
securities lending to fund clients while using the same
collateral and terms to borrow themselves, often overnight. </p>
<h2>Repo Failures </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s asset reductions also affect other secured
financing for clients, Schwartz said. While the firm didn''t
release a full balance sheet with its quarterly results
yesterday, it had $355.9 billion in secured client financing and
secured financing agreements at the end of March, which
represented about 40 percent of its assets. </p>
<p>The bank hadn''t seen a pressing need to cut back on the
low-margin secured loans before the leverage ratio and stress
test because they were viewed as a low risk way to help clients,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm''s
discussions. Clients have been understanding of Goldman Sachs''s
decision to pull back, said the person, who asked to remain
anonymous because the talks were private. </p>
<p>Recent changes in borrowing rates and so-called failures in
the $1.6 trillion-a-day repo market suggest other participants
have trimmed their matched books, the person said. Failures to
deliver Treasuries in repo trades have increased this year and
repo rates on some debt have fallen as low as negative 3
percent. </p>
<p>''A lot''s been written about the repo markets,'' Schwartz
said on the call. ''Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the
matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets,
but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves,
because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple
constraints.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s ratio under the proposed supplementary
leverage ratio is 4.5 percent and will reach 5 percent as the
firm reduces certain fund stakes to comply with the Volcker
Rule, Schwartz said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)''s second-quarter sales topped analysts'' estimates, getting
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty closer to her profit
goals. </p>
<p>While revenue fell 2 percent from a year earlier to $24.4
billion -- the ninth straight quarterly drop -- declines for
products like mainframe servers and markets such as Brazil and
China were less severe than earlier this year, IBM said today in
a statement. The result surpassed the $24.1 billion that
analysts projected on average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings rose to $4.32 a share, 1 cent
higher than analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Rometty is banking on a strong second half of the year to
hit her targets for the company''s performance even as IBM adapts
to an industrywide shift to cloud computing, an area that
expanded 50 percent in the first six months of the year from the
same period in 2013. The company reiterated its projection for
2014 adjusted earnings of at least $18 a share. </p>
<p>IBM is contending with technology customers that
increasingly seek to store data and software on cloud-computing
networks, rather than on site. That''s limited clients'' need for
IBM''s servers and mainframes, making it more difficult to reach
profit targets. The company had said before today that it
expected mainframe sales to improve into next year. </p>
<p>IBM aims to reach $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015,
up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a pledge instated by former Chief
Executive Officer Sam Palmisano and sustained by Rometty, who
succeeded him in 2012. </p>
<p>Shares of Armonk, New York-based IBM fell 1.4 percent in
late trading. </p>
<h2>Profit Goal </h2>
<p>To meet this year''s projections, Chief Financial Officer
Martin Schroeter said in April that IBM would be 38 percent
toward its profit goal by the end of the second quarter. That
implied second-quarter earnings this year of $4.21 to $4.39 a
share, compared with the $4.32 a share reported today. </p>
<p>Revenue from emerging markets slid 7 percent in the second
quarter, compared to an 11 percent fall in the three months
prior. Sales to Brazil, Russia, India and China also pared
losses, declining 2 percent, compared with an 11 percent drop
last quarter. </p>
<h2>Chinese Market </h2>
<p>The company has faced difficulties in the Chinese market as
tensions over cyberhacking have risen between China and the U.S.
The Chinese government is reviewing whether domestic banks''
reliance on high-end servers from IBM compromises the nation''s
financial security, people familiar with the matter said in May.
IBM said then that it wasn''t aware of any government policy
recommending against use of its servers. </p>
<p>Sales of mainframe servers, the workhorse machines
corporate customers have used for decades to run their crucial
computing tasks, decreased 1 percent -- an improvement from the
40 percent decline in the first quarter. IBM had said it
expected those sales to improve because more customers were
preparing to upgrade their mainframes. </p>
<p>As Rometty tries to navigate the company through the
industry''s changes, she has shifted IBM''s own focus to cloud
services, along with data analytics, in which the company helps
clients mine the digital information they collect to identify
trends. Rometty has also tried to offload less profitable
businesses -- like the low-end server unit that Lenovo Group
Ltd. agreed to buy for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S. national-security review. </p>
<h2>Watson Technology </h2>
<p>In a deal unveiled this week, IBM will help develop more
than 100 mobile-centric applications for businesses catered to
Apple Inc.''s iPhones and iPads to help workers do more with the
devices than check e-mail or calendars. The companies foresee
corporate customers increasingly using handheld devices for
daily workplace tasks like supply chain management and human
resources functions. </p>
<p>Separately, IBM is spending more than $1 billion to create
a new group around its Watson technology, which lets customers
use plain English to analyze large troves of data. To remake its
cloud business, Rometty bought provider SoftLayer Technologies
Inc. in 2013 for $2 billion and this year committed an
additional $1.2 billion to bolster its data centers and
offerings. </p>
<p>''Their success is going to be tied to the cloud over the
next five to 10 years,'' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR
Capital Markets. ''It''s more of a strategic focus of the
company.'' </p>
<h2>Cloud Growth </h2>
<p>Cloud offerings delivered as a service are now at an annual
run rate of $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion as of the
first quarter. That''s still a fraction of IBM''s total $100
billion in revenue last year. </p>
<p>As it reshapes itself, IBM will still have to rely on its
older global business services and software units, which
together make up about three-quarters of sales. To boost
earnings in the meantime, Rometty has also sold debt to fund
share buybacks, laid off workers and slashed the company''s tax
rate. </p>
<p>IBM ended the quarter with $9.7 billion in cash on hand,
even with the end of March, after spending $1.1 billion on
dividends and $3.7 billion on share buybacks. </p>
<p>Net income climbed to $4.1 billion, or $4.12 a share, from
$3.2 billion, or $2.91 a share, a year earlier. </p>

<p>John Chen''s turnaround plan for BlackBerry Ltd. just got a reality check. </p> <p>Shares of the company, which had surged 54 percent under Chen''s leadership this year, slumped the most since November yesterday after Apple Inc. (AAPL) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) unveiled a pact to collaborate on business services. </p> <p>The deal puts BlackBerry''s nascent recovery at risk by encroaching on a key component of the new chief executive officer''s overhaul: shifting the company from flagging smartphone sales toward software-based services for corporations, which generate higher margins. </p> <p>''You''ve got quite a few bigger enterprise entities now vying in the space where BlackBerry dominated,'' Amitabh Passi, a San Francisco-based analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said by phone yesterday. He listed U.S.-based companies VMware Inc. (VMW) and Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS) as challengers and questioned whether Google Inc. (GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will intensify their efforts on business services too. ''It changes the competitive dynamic.'' </p> <p>Since taking over as CEO in November, Chen had been winning over investors with a turnaround strategy that has included cutting costs, selling most of the company''s property in Canada, and building revenue in business services and its BBM instant messaging service to compensate for declining handset sales. </p> <p>The Waterloo, Ontario-based smartphone maker reported an adjusted loss of 11 cents a share in its fiscal first quarter on June 19, ahead of the analysts'' average forecast of a 25-cent loss. </p> <h2>Growth Path </h2> <p>''Right now, everything that I''m doing is judiciously starting to lay the groundwork for revenue growth for next year,'' the 59-year-old Chen said in a conference call at the time. The odds of a turnaround are 80-20, up from a previous prognosis of 50-50, Chen said in May. </p> <p>The stock had responded positively, with the U.S.-listed shares nearly doubling through yesterday since a low in December. Shares sold short on the stock dropped to 24.3 million as of July 16, the lowest level since 2012, compared with 63.5 million in March 2013, according to data compiled by Markit Ltd. </p> <p>Options traders had also been betting Chen''s strategy would lead to further gains in the stock. </p> <p>One-month put options calling for the stock to drop 10 percent cost 5.2 points less than calls betting on a 10 percent gain on July 7, the biggest spread ever for the price relationship known as skew, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Seven of the 10 contracts with the highest ownership are bullish, and January $10 calls have the highest open interest, data show. </p> <h2>Business Apps </h2> <p>The rally came to a halt yesterday, with the stock tumbling 12 percent in New York to close at $9.97. It dropped another 2.6 percent to $9.71 in New York today. </p> <p>The Apple-IBM deal announced July 15 is designed to get more iPhones and iPads into corporate hands and more IBM services such as analytics, data storage and supply-chain management onto mobile devices. The companies will also create industry applications. </p> <p>''You can''t provide apps without a secure infrastructure underneath,'' Passi at UBS said. </p> <p>BlackBerry is a ''clear leader'' in the business market with the most secure devices, software, servers and network, Lisette Kwong, a spokeswoman for BlackBerry, said yesterday. </p> <p>''Enterprises should think twice about relying on any solution built on the foundation of a consumer technology that lacks the proven security benefits that BlackBerry has always delivered,'' Kwong said in an e-mail. </p> <h2>Cost Competition </h2> <p>''Short sellers may re-initiate positions in BlackBerry,'' said John Stephenson, CEO at Stephenson  Co. Capital Management Inc., in an e-mail. ''I view this as an incremental negative. Much of the easy lifting has been done in real estate sales and tax credits. Also, after the run that the stock has had, many investors are looking to take money off the table.'' </p> <p>BlackBerry may have trouble keeping up technologically with Apple while keeping its services affordable, Stephenson said. </p> <p>''Many firms are abandoning the BlackBerry platform as the cost of the server is just too great,'' he said. ''BlackBerry has the better corporate security, although Apple''s iPhone 5S has biometrics, which helps close that gap.'' </p> <p>Still, Apple and IBM have to prove they can develop products together and win over business customers. </p> <h2>Negative Bucket </h2> <p>While their alliance is ''incrementally concerning'' for BlackBerry, there aren''t enough specifics about the pact at this stage to really judge the threat it poses, Passi said. </p> <p>Luciano Orengo, a fund manager at Manulife Asset Management Ltd. in Toronto, sold his positions in BlackBerry several years ago as the company''s earnings deteriorated. The recent rally in shares doesn''t pique his interest. Unlike cyclical stocks such as commodities producers, technology companies that fall behind tend to stay behind and ultimately disappear, he said. </p> <p>''BlackBerry is a company that''s slowly dying, and today''s news that Apple and IBM are partnering on the business side is another drop into the negative bucket,'' he said. His firm manages about C$292 billion ($272 billion). ''Technology is a treadmill. You have to keep innovating, keep growing share. I can''t look at that company and three years from now tell you whether it''ll be here or not.'' </p> <p>', 'Apple-IBM Deal Snaps BlackBerry Rally on Turnaround Doubt', 'By Eric Lam and Christina Pellegrini', 'Jul 17, 2014  4:52 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-17/apple-ibm-deal-snaps-blackberry-rally-on-turnaround-doubt.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) lost
their bid to dismiss more than 30 lawsuits by retailers seeking
potentially billions of dollars in damages over fees for
processing transactions. </p>
<p>Merchants including Target Corp. (TGT) and Macy''s Inc. (M) pursued
their cases after dropping out of an earlier $5.7 billion
settlement over the charges known as swipe fees. Today, a
federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, refused to throw out those
lawsuits. He also rejected Visa''s request to dismiss a similar
lawsuit filed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) seeking at least $5
billion in damages. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Gleeson said his decision was ''in
large part driven by the requirement that I accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true'' because the cases were in
the early stages of litigation. It isn''t a ruling on the merits
of the complaints. </p>
<p>Gleeson in December approved the card companies'' settlement
with merchants nationwide following years of antitrust
litigation over the fees. </p>
<p>Dozens of large retailers appealed the approval of the
accord. Many also dropped out of the deal and filed their own
lawsuits, contending it wasn''t enough compensation for the
hundreds of billions of dollars in fees paid. </p>
<h2>''Market Power'' </h2>
<p>In a revised complaint filed this month, Target and Macy''s
said the card companies ''have obtained and maintained market
power in the market for merchant acceptance of credit cards''
causing merchants ''to pay excessive interchange fees.'' </p>
<p>Wal-Mart alleged in its complaint that ''Visa''s monopoly
power has enabled it to dictate price and inhibit competition.''
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer announced in April that
MasterCard will handle transactions for store-branded credit
cards. MasterCard isn''t named in Wal-Mart''s swipe-fee complaint. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard argued that the merchants'' claims for
damages should be barred by legal releases in an earlier
settlement in 2003. They also said the claims should be thrown
out because the merchants don''t directly pay fees to banks that
issue Visa and MasterCard branded cards. The fees are deducted
from payments merchants receive after processing. </p>
<p>Separately, Gleeson also denied requests by Wal-Mart and
another group of merchants to dismiss lawsuits filed against
them by the card firms seeking to stop their litigation over the
fees in its tracks. The request the card firms are making in
those cases is ''properly invoked,'' Gleeson said. </p>
<h2>''Tactical Advantage'' </h2>
<p>''We''re not seeking an unfair tactical advantage, we''re
seeking finality,'' said Michael Shuster, a lawyer for Visa,
during the hearing today. </p>
<p>Paul Cohen, a spokesman for Foster City, California-based
Visa, declined to comment on the judge''s rulings. </p>
<p>''Judge Gleeson''s ruling was at the earliest stage of the
case,'' Seth Eisen, a spokesman for Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard, said in an e-mail. ''We look forward to putting this
matter behind us and continuing to work productively with the
merchant community.'' </p>

Global services sales, which typically make up more than half of IBM''s business, slid 1 percent to $13.9 billion. Software revenue was up 1 percent from a year earlier to $6.5 billion, a slowdown from 2 percent growth in the prior quarter. And even with the improvement in the mainframe business, total hardware sales dropped 11 percent. </p> <h2>Licensing Model </h2> <p>When companies move to cloud computing, software and data can be stored on remote servers, instead of installed on premise. In the past, many software offerings were sold to customers in a licensing model, where clients pay upfront for the right to use the tools for an allotted amount of time. With cloud-based services, many offerings are pay-as-you-use, giving customers the opportunity to be more efficient and lower the total payments. </p> <p>While IBM''s cloud business is growing, the fear is that it could take revenue away from its traditional sales model, said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. </p> <p>''How much of that is new wins and how much is cannibalistic? You don''t know how much of that is coming from cannibalizing their own software versus net new stuff,'' he said. </p> <p>Services revenue, meanwhile, has been hurt as customers put pressure on IBM to lower its fees. </p> <h2>''Pricing Pressure'' </h2> <p>''Our performance continues to reflect pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects,'' IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said about the company''s outsourcing business on the earnings conference call. </p> <p>IBM''s contract signings for services -- an indicator of expected future revenue -- fell 33 percent from a year earlier to $11 billion, driven by declines in new business for consulting and outsourcing. That falls short of the 6.2 percent gain from rival Accenture Plc. </p> <p>The fall in contract signings could drag on IBM''s services revenue in the second half of the year, said Anurag Rana, an analyst for Bloomberg Industries. </p> <p>Before results were released yesterday, IBM shares had climbed 2.6 percent this year, supported by the company''s repurchases, which brought the number of shares in circulation under 1 billion at the end of June -- the first time they''ve been below that threshold at the close of a quarter since at least 1999. </p> <h2>More Buybacks </h2> <p>IBM ended the quarter with $9.7 billion in cash on hand, little changed from the end of March, after spending $1.1 billion on dividends and $3.7 billion on share buybacks. </p> <p>Net income climbed to $4.1 billion, or $4.12 a share, from $3.2 billion, or $2.91 a share, a year earlier. </p> <p>As Rometty tries to shift IBM''s own focus to cloud services and data analytics, she has also tried to offload less profitable businesses -- like the low-end server unit that Lenovo Group Ltd. agreed to buy for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S. national-security review. </p> <h2>Apple Deal </h2> <p>In a deal unveiled this week, IBM will help develop more than 100 mobile-centric applications for businesses catered to Apple Inc.''s iPhones and iPads to help workers do more with the devices than check e-mail or calendars. The companies foresee corporate customers increasingly using handheld devices for daily workplace tasks like supply chain management and human resources functions. </p> <p>Separately, IBM is spending more than $1 billion to create a new group around its Watson technology, which lets customers use plain English to analyze large troves of data. To remake its cloud business, Rometty bought SoftLayer Technologies Inc. in 2013 for $2 billion and this year committed an additional $1.2 billion to bolster its data centers and offerings. </p> <p>''Their success is going to be tied to the cloud over the next five to 10 years,'' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ''It''s more of a strategic focus of the company.'' </p> <p>', 'IBM''s Nine-Quarter Sales Slump Overshadows Cloud Growth', 'By Alex Barinka', 'Jul 18, 2014  4:23 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-18/ibm-s-nine-quarter-sales-slump-overshadows-cloud-growth.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Spain''s bonds outperformed their
Italian equivalents for a fourth-straight day as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its forecast for growth in the Iberian nation
and Societe Generale SA said it''s Europe''s ''star performer.'' </p>
<p>Spanish 10-year (GSPG10YR) securities were set for their first weekly
advance this month as SocGen analysts recommended buying the
debt instead of German bunds. The increased optimism about
Spain''s economy, which shrank for nine consecutive quarters
through June 2013, contrasts with its fortunes during the euro-area debt crisis, when concern that the currency bloc would
splinter pushed borrowing costs above 7 percent. </p>
<p>Spain is ''the star performer in Europe, and probably will
remain so for a while,'' Marc-Henri Thoumin, a fixed-income
strategist at SocGen in London, wrote in a client note dated
yesterday. Spanish bonds ''should catch up further as sentiment
improves,'' he wrote, referring to the yield spread to bunds. </p>
<p>Spanish 10-year yields fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.61 percent at 4:24 p.m. London time, set
for a decline of 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, this
week. The price of the 3.8 percent security due in April 2024
rose 0.16, or 1.60 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,351) face amount to
110.12. </p>
<p>The Spanish economy will grow 1.2 percent this year and 1.6
percent in 2015, Goldman Sachs economists led by London-based
Huw Pill wrote in a the note dated yesterday. That compares with
previous predictions of 0.9 percent and 1.2 percent,
respectively. The Bank of Italy forecasts Italian gross domestic
product will increase 0.2 percent in 2014 and 1.3 percent next
year, it said in an economic bulletin today. </p>
<p>Spain''s 10-year yield was 18 basis points below the rate on
similar-maturity Italian debt. The spread widened two basis
points today and has increased from less than 12 basis points at
the end of last week. In 2012, the Spanish securities yielded as
much as 116 basis points more than Italy''s. </p>
<p>The Spain-Germany 10-year (GDBR10) spread narrowed two basis points

<p>The largest job cuts in Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s history are a recruiting opportunity for Seattle-area rivals, who see them as a chance to snatch talent. </p> <p>In a measure of the Redmond, Washington-based company''s lessening dominance of a regional software industry it all but created, technology executives say the cuts may only dent a frenzied job market driven by companies from Amazon.com Inc. to Zillow Inc.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it will
eliminate as many as 18,000 jobs, the largest round of cuts in
its history, as Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella integrates
Nokia Oyj''s handset unit and slims down the software maker. </p>
<p>The restructuring, amounting to about 14 percent of its
workforce, includes 12,500 Nokia factory and professional
positions -- half the number of employees added in the
acquisition. At Microsoft, cuts will be in sales, marketing and
engineering. The reductions are expected to be completed by June
30, 2015, and will result in a pretax charge of $1.1 billion to
$1.6 billion, Microsoft said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Nadella, who took over from Steve Ballmer in February, is
retooling the company''s structure as it seeks to compete with
nimbler rivals offering mobile and Internet-based software and
services. He''s also working to wring a promised $600 million in
annual savings from Microsoft''s Nokia deal, which added 25,000
workers in April, bringing the total to about 127,100. </p>
<p>''Microsoft needs to be a leaner tech giant over the coming
years in order to strike the right balance of growth and
profitability around its cloud and mobile endeavors,'' said
Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co. who rates
Microsoft stock the equivalent of a buy. The cuts are roughly
twice as big as Wall Street expected, Ives said in a note. </p>
<p>The shares rose 1 percent to $44.53 at yesterday''s close in
New York. They have advanced 19 percent this year. </p>
<h2>Streamline Management </h2>
<p>The company started with 13,000 cuts yesterday, and the
majority of eliminated workers will be notified in the next six
months, Nadella said in an e-mail to employees. Microsoft will
also have fewer layers of management and will make changes to
its outside vendor staff, he said. </p>
<p>''The first step to building the right organization for our
ambitions is to realign our workforce,'' he wrote. </p>
<p>Last week, in his first mission statement, Nadella said the
Redmond, Washington-based software maker needs to become more
focused and efficient and requires changes to its engineering
teams. He pledged updates on the new plans later this month, and
said he would provide more details when the company reports
earnings on July 22. </p>
<p>Microsoft investors are likely to view the cuts as a
positive sign, illustrating that Nadella is trying to get costs
and headcount under control and that he understands the
challenges facing Microsoft, Ives said. </p>
<h2>Earnings Growth </h2>
<p>''We view this as another step in the right direction from
the Street''s perspective,'' he said in an interview. ''Nadella
is not wearing rose-colored glasses.'' </p>
<p>The reductions may add 30 cents a share to Microsoft''s
profit in fiscal 2016, estimated Kirk Materne, an analyst at
Evercore Partners Inc., who rates Microsoft the equivalent of a
buy. </p>
<p>The company has needed to cut costs. Analysts on average
estimate that profit before certain items increased 1 percent in
the fiscal year that ended last month, after a decline in fiscal
2013 and little growth the prior year. </p>
<p>Given the stock''s gains in recent months on optimism about
Nadella''s plans, it''s time for the company to post earnings
growth that validates that enthusiasm, said Brent Thill, an
analyst at UBS AG, who recommends buying the stock. Microsoft
spends far more on product development and research than rivals
such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) and gets a smaller return for
that investment, he said. </p>
<p>''They have been spending on a lot of things that haven''t
come to fruition,'' he said. ''The Nadella era will be about
putting more money on bigger hits and not sprinkling a little
everywhere.'' </p>
<h2>Mobile Focus </h2>
<p>In appearances at company and technology events since he
took the helm, Nadella has reiterated that the company''s
priorities are mobile and cloud products, as he works to shift
Microsoft away from its longtime core business of software for
personal computers. Nadella has signaled a desire to produce
software for rival operating systems, like Apple''s iOS and
Google''s Android, and has shuffled management in areas like
marketing, business development and the Xbox game console. </p>
<p>While Microsoft has implemented smaller, intermittent job
cuts in individual businesses -- for example, trimming a few
hundred positions in advertising sales and marketing in 2012,
and some marketing jobs across the company earlier that same
year -- the 39-year-old company has only undertaken a
companywide restructuring affecting thousands of workers once
before, in 2009, at the start of the recession. Over the course
of that year, the company cut 5,800 jobs, or about 5 percent of
its workforce at the time. </p>
<h2>Cost Savings </h2>
<p>When Microsoft agreed to acquire Nokia''s device unit in
September, the software maker pledged $600 million in yearly
cost savings in the 18 months after the deal closed. While this
week''s layoffs are the company''s biggest ever, excluding the
12,500 positions being eliminated at Nokia, the 5,500 job cuts
at Microsoft are smaller than those in 2009. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s engineering teams have traditionally been split
between program managers, developers and testers. Now, with new
cloud-based methods of building software, it often makes sense
to have the developers test and fix bugs instead of a separate
team of testers, Nadella said in an interview last week after
releasing his memo. </p>
<h2>Nokia Shift </h2>
<p>The Nokia business, now part of Microsoft''s devices group,
will also undergo some product changes as Microsoft ends output
of phones running Google''s Android operating system and targets
the ''more affordable smartphone segments,'' wrote devices group
chief Stephen Elop, formerly the CEO of Nokia, in an e-mail
posted on Microsoft''s site. </p>
<p>Microsoft will switch the Nokia X, which uses Android, to
the Windows Phone operating system to broaden its products in
the cheaper smartphone category. It will also align future high-end smartphone releases with major products from Windows and
Microsoft''s applications team, Elop said. </p>
<p>The company will also combine what had been two units at
Nokia -- Smart Devices and Mobile Phones -- into one under
executive Jo Harlow. Phone engineering will be based in Salo,
Finland, for high-end devices, and Tampere, Finland, for cheaper
ones. Engineering work in Oulu, Finland, will be scaled down. </p>
<p>Engineering in Beijing and San Diego will see cuts, and
phone production will be focused mainly in Hanoi. Nokia will
shift repair and manufacturing operations from Hungary. The cuts
may affect 1,100 employees in Finland and about 1,800 in
Hungary, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>Elop''s memo was derided by publications from New York
magazine to the Guardian, which titled a blog ''How not to cut
12,500 jobs,'' for starting with the greeting ''Hello There,''
and failing to get to the job cuts until the 11th paragraph of
14. </p>
<h2>TV Programming </h2>
<p>In the Xbox business, the company will shut down an
ambitious effort to create original television programming, just
one month after the debut of its first show. The Xbox
Entertainment Studio will close in coming months, Xbox chief
Phil Spencer said in an e-mail to employees. </p>
<p>Nancy Tellem, the ex-CBS executive brought in to lead the
effort two years ago, will stay on with some of her team to
complete shows in production, such as a ''Halo'' series, the
company said. Tellem was hired by former CEO Ballmer to draw
more entertainment consumers to Xbox by getting into original
programming, like Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. </p>
<p>As the technology industry increasingly shifts toward
mobile computing and cloud-based services, other technology
companies have also sought to keep up by streamlining and firing
workers. Hewlett-Packard Co. in May disclosed 16,000 more job
cuts after reporting an 11th straight quarter of declining
sales, on top of 34,000 in staff reductions already announced.
International Business Machines Corp. also started dismissing
workers earlier this year as part of a $1 billion restructuring
to help it adapt to the industry''s changes. </p>

<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the behemoths of the U.S. mortgage market, are surrendering more business to nonbank lenders. </p> <p>The nation''s two largest originators made 21 percent of home loans in the second quarter, the smallest combined share in more than a decade, down from 30 percent a year ago, according to regulatory filings. They''re ceding ground to companies like Quicken Loans Inc., which grabbed the No. 3 spot from Bank of America Corp. in the first quarter, and LoanDepot.com LLC, whose share surged more than three-fold in the following period. </p> <p>Big banks are exercising caution to avoid losses if their home loans sour and government-controlled Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac force them to repurchase the mortgages. This week, JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon escalated the buyback issue between lenders and the government, saying he questioned whether his bank should end its decades-old relationship with the Federal Housing Administration, a last resort for lower-income Americans seeking mortgages. Nonbank lenders, hungry for mortgages to service, are expanding rapidly to fill the void left by banks. </p> <p>''Mortgage banking may just be a smaller players'' game now,'' said Paul Miller, a banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in Arlington, Virginia. ''They''re able to be more flexible.'' </p> <p>JPMorgan, the No. 2 U.S. mortgage lender, reported this week that its second-quarter originations fell 66 percent to $16.8 billion, the lowest quarterly result since at least 2005, compared with the year-ago period. The New York-based bank''s share of the market dropped to 5.4 percent in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, from 8.1 percent in the first period. JPMorgan''s market share averaged 10 percent in the prior five years. </p> <h2>JPMorgan Threat </h2> <p>Much of the decline came from a falloff in FHA lending, Dimon said on the bank''s call with analysts. Banks have been in a dispute with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA over rules that force the firms to repurchase mortgages that go bad. </p> <p>''Our FHA volume was way down and we studied FHA and based upon the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that we''ve lost a tremendous sum of money in FHA,'' Dimon said. ''The real question to me is should we be in the FHA business at all and we''re still struggling with that.'' </p> <p>JPMorgan''s loss of market share is part of its long-term plan to pull back from the mortgage business and focus on making loans to the most creditworthy borrowers, said Miller. </p> <h2>Wells Drops </h2> <p>''They''re making a strategic decision to shrink,'' Miller said. ''They don''t want to do marginal loans they could end up paying the piper on. They''re saying we paid a lot of money and we''re done with it.'' </p> <p>Wells Fargo last week reported that originations fell 58 percent to $47 billion from a year earlier, the lowest second-quarter result in more than a decade. The San Francisco-based bank''s market share declined to 15.2 percent in the second quarter, based on data compiled by Bloomberg, from 15.9 percent in the first period. The bank''s share averaged 23 percent in the prior five years. </p> <p>Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf said on a conference call last week that the bank wants to lend to more borrowers even if they don''t have pristine credit. He said Wells Fargo just needs clarity about what triggers a buyback demand. </p> <p>Bank executives are having meetings with Melvin L. Watt, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, about the rules, Stumpf said. FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, known as government-sponsored enterprises. Earlier this year, Watt introduced a sunset provision so lenders are not responsible in some cases if loans go sour after three years. </p> <h2>LoanDepot Advantage </h2> <p>''You have low rates on one side encouraging borrowing and you have put-backs from the GSEs on the other side that make lenders less willing to lend money,'' Stumpf said. ''The goal is to get more credit appropriately to borrowers who want to own homes and who can afford homes.'' </p> <p>Nonbank lenders like LoanDepot.com that started after the housing crash in 2007 or didn''t make subprime loans are not burdened with the buyback issue, said Anthony Hsieh, chief executive officer of LoanDepot.com. The online lender, which is backed by private-equity firm Parthenon Capital Partners, began in 2010 in compliance with new mortgage regulations compared with established banks that had to adapt to the changes, Hsieh said. </p> <p>''We had a clean canvas to build our organization post crisis in a new world of much heavier regulatory scrutiny,'' said Hsieh, a former president of LendingTree.com. ''The biggest banks have a much smaller footprint than before and that creates a lot of opportunity for nonbank lenders.'' </p> <h2>Share Soars </h2> <p>LoanDepot.com, which collects payments on the majority of mortgages it makes, originated $3 billion in loans in the second quarter, a 58 percent jump from a year earlier, according to Hsieh. The Foothill Ranch, California-based firm''s market share rose more than threefold to 1.1 percent in the second period, Hsieh said. </p> <p>Hsieh said the firm is selling products that are compliant with qualified mortgage guidelines, such as debt-to-income ratios below 43 percent. The company will soon announce an offering for loans without government backing to help sustain its rapid growth, he said. </p> <p>Stonegate Mortgage Corp. (SGM), which was founded by Jim Cutillo and his wife Barbara in 2005, survived the subprime meltdown by avoiding these risky loans. The Indianapolis-based firm has been ratcheting up its market share by expanding to states such as California and Virginia, said Cutillo, who was a director for GMAC Residential Funding. </p> <h2>Wholesale Business </h2> <p>The lender and servicer, whose biggest investor is private-equity firm Long Ridge Equity Partners, last year hired a team from Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. to expand its wholesale business -- lending through mortgage brokers. </p> <p>The company''s mortgage origination volume, which includes FHA loans, jumped 27 percent to $2.4 billion in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Cutillo plans to build the firm''s business in jumbo loans in places like Washington with more expensive real estate. </p> <p>''If all the big players were deconsolidating and some small and mid-sized players didn''t have enough capital to build size and scale in any industry, wouldn''t you think there would be a huge opportunity?'' Cutillo said. ''We''re arbitraging that and filling a big void the banks have left.'' </p> <h2>Refinance Plunge </h2> <p>Plaza Home Mortgage Inc. mostly provides wholesale lending -- a business that banks like Wells Fargo exited. Plaza Home Mortgage has been able to increase its originations by working with brokers who focus on purchases. </p> <p>That''s paid off as refinancing has waned, said Kevin Parra, Plaza''s co-founder. Refinancing, a traditional mainstay for banks, fell in April to the lowest level since 2008, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. </p> <p>The San Diego-based firm benefits from established relationships with mortgage brokers who in turn work with local realtors, Parra said. </p> <p>''As the market has moved from refis to purchases, service becomes a bigger factor, and brokers will use us because they know us and trust we will get them to close on time,'' said Parra. </p> <p>Plaza Home originated $1 billion in mortgages for purchases in the second quarter compared with $780 million a year earlier, and increased its total market share to 0.6 percent, said Parra. </p> <p>The market-share gain of small lenders is increasing financial risks for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to a report yesterday from the FHFA''s Office of Inspector General. The companies, which were on the brink of insolvency in 2008 and seized by the government, buy mortgages from lenders and package them into securities that are sold to investors. </p> <h2>''Limited Capacity'' </h2> <p>''Some smaller lenders and nonbank mortgage companies have limited financial capacity,'' the report said. If loans later prove to have errors in them, the companies may lack the ability to make good on buyback demands, resulting in losses for taxpayers, it said. </p> <p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have recovered almost $100 billion from lenders stemming from buyback demands since the 2008 financial crisis, the report said. </p> <p>Banks may focus more on mortgage lending once there''s more clarity around buybacks and the housing recovery regains momentum, said Hsieh of LoanDepot.com. </p> <p>''Wells will always be the 800 pound gorilla, but the nonbank upstarts will make headway and some will be here to stay,'' said FBR''s Miller. </p> <p>', 'JPMorgan in Rules Dispute Cedes Loan Share to Nonbanks', 'By Kathleen M.

<p>U.S. bond yields are likely to stay
at historically low levels until an uneven economy begins to
normalize and there''s a steady increase in inflation, JPMorgan
Chase  Co.''s John Normand said. </p>
<p>Investors ''have just a lot of reservations about the
durability of the expansion,'' said Normand, JPMorgan Chase''s
London-based head of foreign-exchange and international rates
strategy, in an interview on Bloomberg Radio''s ''Surveillance''
with Tom Keene and Michael McKee. ''Eventually, people''s fears
will be relieved if we can go through two or three quarters of
decent growth in the U.S. But it''s a very slow and tedious
process.'' </p>
<p>Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.46 percent today in New
York. They averaged 3.40 percent over the past decade, reaching
a high of 5.32 percent in June 2007 and a low of 1.38 percent in
July 2012. </p>
<p>Normand said that, taking a ''very simplistic'' approach to
calculations, the 10-year yield may approach 4 percent in a
normalized economy, figuring 2 percent economic growth in real
terms and 2 percent inflation. </p>
<p>''You''re not going to get there in one month or one quarter
or even one year,'' Normand said. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve will probably raise interest rates for
the first time since 2006 once inflation stays around 2 percent
for two to three quarters, Normand said. Projections for higher
consumer prices won''t be needed. </p>
<p>''You just need a move to, say, two-ish, or sticking at two
for a while before it begins to look like central banks have
money too easily priced,'' Normand said. </p>
<p>The Fed''s preferred gauge of inflation, the personal
consumption expenditures deflator, has failed to reach the
bank''s 2 percent target for more than two years. It rose to 1.8
percent in May. The central bank has maintained the benchmark
rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. </p>

<p>Russia''s parliament is preparing new rules in a bid to cut its reliance on foreign technology suppliers after U.S. sanctions against some of the country''s largest companies, a move that could hurt sales at vendors such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) </p> <p>The State Duma, Russia''s lower house of parliament, is drafting a bill to require government agencies and state-run enterprises to give preference to local providers of software and hardware, according to a document from the commission for strategic information systems obtained by Bloomberg News. The paper addresses criteria for tender processes such as favoring products that don''t have imported, licensed components. </p> <p>''This all has to do with sanctions,'' Andrey Chernogorov, executive secretary of the commission, said in a phone interview. ''Given the current international tensions, substituting imports with local software and hardware becomes the key to ensuring self sufficiency.'' </p> <p>The Obama administration on July 16 tightened sanctions on Russian banks, energy and defense companies to punish the country over its interference in Ukraine. On the following day, the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet caught in the military conflict, killing all 298 people on board, sent the Ukraine crisis into a new phase and raises the prospect of further sanctions. </p> <h2>H-P, Oracle </h2> <p>Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP), IBM, Microsoft, Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Germany''s SAP SE had combined revenue of 285 billion rubles ($8.1 billion) from Russia last year, according to estimates by the Russian Academy of Sciences that are included in the commission''s document. Hewlett-Packard and IBM together accounted for almost 78 percent of the figure. About 77 percent of the total sales were contracts from the government and state-controlled companies, it said. </p> <p>Spokesmen for IBM and Oracle in the U.K. declined to comment on the planned law. Representatives for Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, SAP and Cisco didn''t immediately return phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. </p> <p>Hewlett-Packard slipped 0.5 percent at 9:48 a.m. in New York trading. IBM fell 1.2 percent, Microsoft lost 0.5 percent, Cisco dropped 0.1 percent and Oracle rose 0.3 percent. SAP lost 0.5 percent in Frankfurt trading. </p> <p>The commission accelerated preparation for the bill after reports that American technology companies may cut off services to Russian banks and companies to comply with U.S. sanctions, Chernogorov said. The proposal may be submitted for a parliamentary vote in September, he said. </p> <h2>Rosneft, VEB </h2> <p>Among Russian companies the U.S. imposed lending curbs on last week are energy giants OAO Rosneft (ROSN) and OAO Novatek (NVTK) as well as Vnesheconombank and OAO Gazprombank. Since sanctions against Russia were first announced in March, President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called for substituting imports with domestic production to limit the threat to Russia''s economic growth. </p> <p>With the lack of regulations in post-Soviet Russia that govern the award of technology contracts, foreign vendors account for 67 percent of software used in the country and about 90 percent of hardware, according to the commission. Foreign software may have hidden capabilities such as ''bugs'' and ''backdoors,'' giving suppliers access to confidential data, Chernogorov said. </p> <p>Russia''s Communications Ministry is among agencies seeking to cut dependence on foreign vendors as it develops its e-government initiative, a unified database of personal data used to provide online services such as granting a license permit or assigning a child to school. </p> <h2>Local Production </h2> <p>''The idea of supporting local IT production is justified,'' said Nikolay Komlev, executive director of the Russian Association of Computer and IT Enterprises, which represents multinationals such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard as well as Russian vendors. ''Still, its implementation proposed by State Duma may give a competitive advantage to not the most efficient companies.'' </p> <p>Russia''s largest IT companies with annual revenue exceeding $1 billion include NCC, Lanit, Technoserv, NVision Group and IBS Group Holding Ltd.

<p>Yuzo Kano quit Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) twice: once for a rival bank, the second time to open
Japan''s first bitcoin exchange since the collapse of Mt. Gox. </p>
<p>When Kano, 38, left his job as a derivatives and
convertible bonds trader in December, bitcoin had climbed to a
record $1,151. Three months later, it was worth half that after
a $530 million heist at Tokyo-based Mt. Gox bankrupted what was
once the virtual currency''s largest exchange. </p>
<p>''That''s one less competitor for us, but it also left many
Japanese with a very negative impression of bitcoin,'' Kano said
in an interview in Tokyo on July 17. ''We already had a company
then and felt it was up to us to rebuild the trust.'' </p>
<p>Since Mt. Gox closed in February, acquiring the digital
currency in Japan meant going to the city''s only bitcoin ATM
machine or arranging a person-to-person deal. Kano''s bitFlyer
website allows anyone with a Japanese bank account to buy and
sell the coins. The service began in April and eschews the
trading options used by other exchanges in favor of a simple
interface that would appeal to beginners, Kano said, declining
to give subscriber numbers. </p>
<p>While Mt. Gox, operated by a Frenchman residing in Tokyo,
catered mostly to foreigners, its bankruptcy was widely covered
by domestic media. That has tended to scare off Japanese
individuals, who Kano says are already averse to risks. Not so
the nation''s government. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) reported profit that fell short of estimates in the fiscal fourth quarter, weighed down by the acquisition of Nokia Oyj''s handset unit, where about 12,500 jobs will be cut. </p> <p>Net income in the period that ended June 30 was $4.61 billion, or 55 cents a share, including adjustments related to Nokia, the company said in a statement today. Analysts were predicting, on average, profit of 60 cents a share, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding the Nokia-related items and taxes, profit would have been 66 cents a share, beating the average prediction for 64 cents. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who took over in February, is struggling to cut costs at Nokia after Microsoft completed its 5.44 billion euro ($7.33 billion) acquisition of the mobile-phone operations in April. Microsoft''s main software business topped estimates, owing to strength in Internet-based cloud programs and corporate computer applications. </p> <p>Related: Microsoft CEO, Seeking Growth, Tells Managers: Step It Up</p><p>''Nokia continues to be the black cloud over Microsoft,'' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co. who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock. ''This is the first quarter before the cost cuts. That''s why Nadella took the ax out.'' </p> <p>The shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft rose 1.3 percent in extended trading following the report. They were little changed at $44.83 at the close in New York. The stock climbed 1.7 percent last quarter, compared with a 4.7 percent increase in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p> <h2>Nokia Challenge </h2> <p>The Nokia numbers underscore the challenges facing Nadella and his lieutenants as they seek to halt the decline of the handset business and turn it into an asset that can aid Microsoft''s mobile efforts. </p> <p>''Satya has taken a number of exciting steps both to reposition the company and to energize it,'' Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview. </p> <p>Nadella will cut more costs and prioritize core areas, he said on a conference call today. He also pledged to make the money-losing Bing search engine profitable by fiscal 2016. Nadella said MSN websites, retail stores and hardware production are now considered supporting efforts, where costs will be watched carefully. Hood said Microsoft''s new phone unit, formerly the Nokia handset business, is on track to break even on an operating basis in 2016 as well. </p> <p>Microsoft plans to cut operating costs for the current fiscal year to $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion, Hood said. </p> <h2>Cloud, Enterprise </h2> <p>At the same time, cloud and enterprise software performed well, with revenue doubling for the Web-based versions of Office and Microsoft''s Azure cloud-based service for hosting applications. Commercial cloud products now have an annual run-rate of $4.4 billion, Hood said. Corporate demand for personal computers helped shore up sales of Office and Windows to businesses, with companies signing multiyear licensing deals. </p> <p>''Cloud looked strong -- core PC seemed to get an uplift from improving PC demand,'' Ives said. ''Office 365 and Azure continue to be pillars of strength. I would call this in-line results.'' </p> <p>Unearned revenue, which comes from sales of multiyear deals that will be recognized in the future, was $25.2 billion for the quarter, compared with the $24.5 billion average analyst projection, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <h2>Restructuring Efforts </h2> <p>In addition to a plan to cut a total of 18,000 jobs as the company integrates Nokia, Nadella has discontinued unpromising products and placed more emphasis on cloud-computing software delivered via the Web. The restructuring will result in $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion in charges in the current fiscal year, according to Microsoft. </p> <p>''The company as a whole is galvanized around Satya''s strategy,'' Hood said. </p> <p>Microsoft is also seeing signs of improvement in the PC market, which drives sales of Windows and Office software. PC shipments declined 1.7 percent in the second quarter, a smaller drop than estimated as businesses upgraded their equipment. Demand in the U.S., Europe and Canada also helped to make up for a drop in Asia, researcher IDC said earlier this month. </p> <p>Intel Corp. also released results last week that topped analysts'' projections. Microsoft''s Hood said the company is seeing similar trends to those reported by Intel. </p> <p>''The strength in the enterprise and the comments on the refresh would seem to bode well for Microsoft continuing to have uptake with enterprise sales,'' said Michael Shinnick, a fund manager at South Bend, Indiana-based Wasatch Advisors Inc., which has $19 billion under management. </p> <p>', 'Microsoft''s Quarterly Profit Hurt by Nokia Acquisition', 'By Dina Bass', 'Jul 22, 2014  6:52 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-22/microsoft-revenue-misses-estimates-on-weak-demand-from-consumers.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>CIT Group Inc. (CIT)''s $3.4 billion purchase 
of OneWest Bank, orchestrated by two former executives of Goldman 
Sachs Group Inc., combines two casualties of the financial crisis. 
CIT shares surged the most since it emerged from bankruptcy in 
2009. </p>
<p>John Thain, who was president of Goldman Sachs from 1999
until 2004, will continue as chief executive officer of New
York-based CIT, which said today it will acquire the firm known
as IndyMac Bancorp before its 2008 collapse. CIT filed for
bankruptcy in 2009 after losses on subprime mortgages led to a
$2.33 billion U.S. bailout that was never repaid. </p>
<p>Since those failures, both CIT and OneWest, whose chairman
is former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin, emerged as
profitable lenders. Thain reversed a 2012 loss of $588.6 million
with a $681.6 million profit last year. OneWest, backed by
billionaires John Paulson and George Soros, hired Goldman Sachs
this year to find a buyer while it also prepared for a possible
initial public offering. </p>
<p>''All of the things that needed to be fixed coming out of
the bankruptcy have in fact been fixed,'' Thain, 59, said in an
phone interview. ''We are starting to grow.'' </p>
<p>CIT climbed 11 percent to $48.90 at 11:45 a.m. in New York,
and earlier touched $49.92. Thain bought 40,000 shares of CIT on
May 15 at $41.54, 48 cents above the stock''s 52-week low,
boosting his total to 443,000 shares, regulatory filings show. </p>
<h2>FDIC Takeover </h2>
<p>IndyMac made mortgages to people without verifying their
income, which prompted the Federal Deposit Insurance Insurance
Corp. to take control of the lender in 2008. IndyMac is the
second-largest U.S. commercial bank failure on record, behind
the collapse of Washington Mutual Inc. </p>
<p>Shareholders of IMB Holdco LLC, OneWest''s parent company,
will receive $2 billion in cash and 31.3 million shares of CIT
common stock, which is valued at $1.4 billion at a price of
$44.33, CIT said today in a statement. Both boards of directors
approved the transaction, which requires regulatory approval. </p>
<p>Mnuchin will become CIT''s vice chairman and join the board
of the combined company, as will OneWest director Alan Frank,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>''The transaction diversifies and lowers the cost of CIT''s
deposits, broadens the products we can offer to our middle
market clients, is accretive to earnings and return on equity,''
Thain said in the statement. </p>
<h2>Stock Buyback </h2>
<p>CIT expects the transaction to add 20 percent to earnings
per share in 2016, according to the statement. The company also
said today that its board approved a stock repurchase of as much
as $500 million through the first half of next year. </p>
<p>CIT''s takeover of OneWest is the biggest financial services
industry deal announced this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Since the financial crisis there has been a dearth of
takeovers among large lenders, and regulators have held up
transactions including MT Bank Corp.''s merger with Hudson City
Bancorp Inc., originally announced in August 2012. </p>
<p>''Financial institutions are much better capitalized today
than they were prior to the crisis,'' Thain said in the
interview. ''We are in a good regulatory spot in terms of how
they perceive us, so there''s nothing that I can think of that
would not allow this deal to get approved.'' </p>
<p>The OneWest transaction uses more than $1 billion of excess
capital, including the $500 million of share buybacks, and
results in a Tier 1 common ratio of 12.5 percent to 13 percent,
CIT said today in a presentation. CIT''s Tier 1 common equity
ratio was 16 percent at the end of the first quarter. </p>
<p>''They needed to unlock their excess capital -- they were
way over-capitalized,'' Mike Mattioli, an analyst at John
Hancock Asset Management in Boston, said in an interview. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is financial adviser to CIT, and
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz is legal counsel. Goldman Sachs,

<p>The day Satya Nadella became Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s chief executive officer, he invited several dozen vice presidents to breakfast and had a simple, calm admonition for them: ''Can you step it up?'' </p> <p>The engineer''s tone was a departure from the yelling and wild gesticulations favored by his salesman predecessor Steve Ballmer and the razor-sharp interrogations of co-founder Bill Gates. Nadella''s approach underlines the low-key and analytical style he brings as CEO since starting the job in February, as he seeks to revamp the world''s largest software maker. Nadella has unveiled plans to cut more than 18,000 jobs, killed unpromising products and boosted sales of computing tools delivered via the Internet, while seeking to reduce the company''s reliance on software installed on personal computers. </p> <p>''He''s one of those people where you just hate to say no to the guy,'' Jeff Teper, Microsoft''s head of corporate strategy, said of Nadella in an interview in March. Teper hired Nadella into the company in 1992. ''Steve and Bill are a lot more confrontational -- they challenge you to bring your A game. With him it''s more like ''well I don''t want to disappoint the guy, let me work a little bit harder here.'' He''s incredibly smart, he''s gracious, but he''s also super-demanding.'' </p>

<p>Point72 Asset Management LP, the
firm that manages billionaire Steven A. Cohen''s money after he
shut down hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP, hired Scott Braunstein from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s asset management unit. </p>
<p>Braunstein, 50, joins as a money manager and will work with
Anna Yaeger at the firm''s EverPoint Asset Management LLC unit in
New York, according to an employee memo sent today. He spent 12
years at JPMorgan Asset Management covering healthcare stocks
with a focus on biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. Braunstein is
the brother of JPMorgan''s vice chairman and former Chief
Financial Officer Doug Braunstein. </p>
<p>Cohen, who is worth $11 billion, according to the Bloomberg
Billionaire''s Index, closed SAC Capital after the firm agreed
last year to pay a record $1.8 billion and plead guilty to
securities fraud to settle allegations of insider trading. His
Stamford, Connecticut-based firm has suffered from departures of
money managers, including Gabriel Plotkin, who plans to leave
this year to start his own hedge-fund firm. </p>
<p>Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Point72 at Sard
Verbinnen  Co., declined to comment on the memo. A message left
at Braunstein''s home phone wasn''t immediately returned. </p>
<h2>Fund Co-Manager </h2>
<p>At JPMorgan, Braunstein was a co-portfolio manager of its
Global Healthcare Fund with Anne Marden. The fund, which started
in October 2009, returned an annual average 24 percent in the
past five years, beating 86 percent of rivals. Braunstein told
New York-based JPMorgan in June that he was quitting, according
to a statement on the company''s website. </p>
<p>Before JPMorgan, Braunstein worked at Deutsche Bank AG and
was previously a doctor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine
and Cornell University, according to the employee memo. He
starts at Point72 in October. </p>
<p>Investments in healthcare stocks was one of the areas that
led to the criminal charges against former money managers at SAC
Capital. Mathew Martoma, this year was found guilty of using
tips about drug trials to profit in what prosecutors described
as the biggest insider trading case. </p>
<p>Cohen''s firm said in March that it hired Kimberlee Frasso
as a compliance officer focusing on health care, and in April
added Vincent Tortorella as chief surveillance officer. </p>

<p>Banco Espirito Santo SA, which has
slumped since disclosing accounting irregularities at an

<p>Portugal''s second-biggest bank by market value increased as
much as 20 percent to 50 euro cents and traded at 47.9 euro
cents as of 4:29 p.m. in Lisbon trading. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs holds a 2.8 percent stake in Banco Espirito
Santo after acquisitions July 15 and D.E. Shaw, a New York-based
hedge-fund firm, owns 2.7 percent of the stock as of July 14,
according to separate regulatory filings from Banco Espirito
Santo yesterday after the market close. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said today that it ''entered into positions
in Banco Espirito Santo by virtue of its facilitation of client
transactions,'' according to an e-mail sent to Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>''This purchase passes on some security to the market and
can open the door for other institutional investors,'' said Juan
Dieste, a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon. </p>
<p>Banco Espirito Santo will probably raise private funds to
boost capital, Bank of Portugal Governor Carlos Costa said July

interest in the lender. The bank has lost about half its market
value since disclosing May 20 that there were ''irregularities
in the accounts'' of a related company, Espirito Santo
International. </p>
<p>Costa has also tried to reassure depositors and investors
that Banco Espirito Santo can withstand any losses that may
result from Grupo Espirito Santo, which indirectly controls a 20
percent stake in the bank. The concern stems from two companies
within that group missing payments on commercial paper. </p>
<p>Banco Espirito Santo has hired Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to provide

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was awarded
about $14.6 million by a London judge in a dispute with a
Singapore-based investor over shares it held as collateral on a
loan. </p>
<p>James Hong Gee Ho, former executive director of Blumont
Group Ltd. (BLUM), who''d initially sued Goldman Sachs for failing to
get the best price on his shares after a margin call, was
ordered to pay the money by Judge David Mackie today. The amount
included principal and interest on the loan. </p>
<p>Hong was one of several Singapore executives who got into
payment disputes with Goldman Sachs after shares of Blumont,
Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. (LIGO) plunged during a stock
rout in October. </p>
<p>Hong didn''t appear in court after Goldman Sachs''s legal
team notified a law firm that had represented him that Goldman
would ask to have the case dismissed, said Rebecca Loveridge, a
lawyer representing the bank. </p>
<p>The law firm that had represented Hong, Wiggin LLP, didn''t
return a telephone message and Hong didn''t respond to an e-mail
sent to Blumont''s office in Singapore. </p>
<p>Loveridge said Hong''s lawsuit was a ''tactic'' to delay
paying the money he owed. She said Hong hadn''t shown any
interest in continuing the claim and a question had arisen about
whether Wiggin continued to represent him. His original suit
against the bank said Goldman Sachs failed to obtain the best
price for his shares, Loveridge said. </p>
<h2>''Ludicrous'' Figure </h2>
<p>''Goldman Sachs vigorously denied those claims,'' Loveridge
said. ''There was never any dispute that he entered into that
agreement.'' </p>
<p>The judge declined to order Hong to make a payment toward
an estimated 1 million pounds ($1.7 million) in fees and costs
that Loveridge had requested because he said Goldman Sachs''s
lawyers hadn''t presented evidence. </p>
<p>That figure was ''ludicrous,'' Mackie said. ''You want the
court to make an order of a million pounds? There''s been no
trial.'' </p>

<p>Europe''s return to favoring natural
gas for power generation for the first time in almost three
years will be short-lived as Russian and Norwegian gas imports
will be needed for winter, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>An excess of gas in storage is driving ''efficient'' power
plants in the U.K. to use more of the fuel at the expense of
coal, the bank said in a report dated yesterday. Power plants in
the U.K., Europe''s biggest gas market, can consume supplementary
inventories before the winter if prices for the fuel are at an
average discount of 5 pence a therm (9 cents a million British
thermal units) to coal, it said. </p>
<p>Price-induced coal to gas switching is ''likely to only be
a summer phenomenon in Europe,'' analysts including London-based
Daniel Quigley said in the report. ''Beyond the summer, we
continue to expect European gas to return to a 2013-like
dynamic, requiring relatively high imports from Russia and
Norway to compensate for 11 billion cubic meters a year of
production cuts from the Dutch Groningen gas field.'' </p>
<p>Front-month gas on the U.K.''s National Balancing Point fell
46 percent this year to 37.15 pence a therm as Europe''s mildest
winter in seven years left high inventories, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices may fall to average 33 pence
in the next three months in order for coal to gas switching to
balance the market, Goldman forecasts. </p>
<p>Prices may decline further if balancing the market requires
power plants in northwest Europe to also switch to gas, the bank
said. That could happen if U.K. generators don''t switch to using
gas quickly enough or due to ''strong'' growth in renewables.
Prices would need to drop below 30 pence a therm before gas-fired units in northwest Europe could compete with coal on a
large scale. </p>
<h2>Price Forecasts </h2>
<p>U.K. gas prices will probably average 34.2 pence in the
third quarter, which will be ''sufficient to correct its storage
overhang,'' Goldman said. While the usage of gas at the expense
of coal in Germany starts to be profitable at 32 pence, prices
need to fall further to ''kick-start this demand in the short
run,'' according to the report. </p>
<p>Northwest European inventories have an excess of 4 billion
cubic meters (142 billion cubic feet) of gas over 2012 levels,
the bank said. Without coal-to-gas switching or an escalation in
tensions between Russia and Ukraine the surplus will be 2.7
billion cubic meters above 2012 levels at the end of October, it
said. It would take 24 million cubic meters a day of incremental
demand through October to alleviate the glut. </p>
<p>The U.K. has spare gas-fired power capacity to increase
demand for the fuel by 40 million cubic meters a day, according
to the report. Switching to gas for European power generation to
deplete excess gas inventories would result in thermal coal
demand loss of about 5 million metric tons, which could add
further pressure on prices already trading ''near a multiyear
low,'' the bank said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is putting its Watson natural-language technology to the
test with consumers on a wide scale for the first time. </p>
<p>On the website of financial-services firm USAA, military
customers will be able to use IBM''s tool to ask questions and
seek advice on transitioning back to civilian life. Famous for
being a ''Jeopardy!'' game-show champion, Watson analyzes
information and can answer questions in conversational English. </p>
<p>The USAA deal gives IBM its biggest test yet of whether
consumers will embrace Watson, a technology that''s become a
bigger focus of the company''s investments and marketing. IBM
sees data analytics tools like Watson as a source of growth to
counter declining demand for hardware that has led to nine
straight quarters of falling sales. </p>
<p>''Traditional methods of providing advice and information
aren''t scaling,'' John Gordon, vice president of IBM''s Watson
Group, said in an interview. ''This is a fundamentally different
approach.'' </p>
<p>While Watson has previously been available to consumers in
some limited tests, such as a mobile application for home cooks,
this is the first service to be widely available, Gordon said. </p>
<p>IBM and USAA, based in San Antonio, worked for about nine
months to develop the tool to answer questions specific to
customers leaving the military, like whether to seek out
veteran''s benefits or how to buy a home, said Eric Engquist,
assistant vice president of military transitions at USAA. More
than 150,000 military members transfer to civilian life a year,
Engquist said. </p>
<h2>Behavior Change </h2>
<p>While persuading customers to turn to a technology for life
coaching will ''certainly'' require a change in behavior, the
tool could give customized, 24-hour access that wasn''t possible
with USAA''s website or its employees, Engquist said. It could
also be a test for expanding Watson''s use more broadly at USAA. </p>
<p>As sluggish demand for computer servers has hurt sales, IBM
has focused on more profitable, faster-growing areas such as
data analytics and cloud computing while selling hardware
businesses. </p>
<p>Last year, IBM boosted its expected sales from the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with an
earlier forecast of $16 billion. The company said in January
that it will spend $1 billion to create a new division around
Watson to help spur growth. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s private-equity arm and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are considering
joining Gavea Investimentos Ltda. in a bid for Brazilian
medical-services company Fleury SA (FLRY3), people with knowledge of the
matter said. </p>
<p>In joining Gavea, the two investors would be wading into a
bid for a company that has been on the market for more than six
months. Fleury, which has a market value of about 2.6 billion
reais ($1.2 billion), said in March that it was in exclusive
talks with Gavea. </p>
<p>The deal has been held up, as Gavea''s partners in Instituto
Hermes Pardini Ltda. -- a closely held medical lab company that
would be merged with Fleury -- have sought a greater role in the
combined company, three people said, asking not to be identified
discussing private information. It''s still possible that a deal
won''t be reached, the people said. </p>
<p>Rising incomes in Latin America''s most populous country
mean more people are leaving the public health system in favor
of private care. That''s prompting investors to seek ways to
profit from the growing pool of health-care consumers, spurring
deals including the takeover of Amil Participacoes SA by
UnitedHealth Group Inc. last year. </p>

Pardini declined to comment. Gavea, JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s
Brazil private-equity and hedge-fund unit, owns a 30 percent
stake in Hermes Pardini. </p>
<p>Shares of Sao Paulo-based Fleury have retreated 10 percent
this year as the deal has dragged on. Amid the negotiations,
Fleury also posted a net loss in the fourth quarter and missed
sales estimates, further dragging on the stock. </p>
<h2>Pardini Family </h2>
<p>The Pardini family, which controls Hermes Pardini, wants a
higher valuation for their company and a greater role in running
the combined business, the people said. Aurea Pardini, a member
of the family, recently retained financial adviser Greenhill 
Co., while other Pardinis are working with Moelis  Co. to
negotiate those points, the person said. </p>
<p>The family stake at Hermes Pardini could be valued at 1.5
billion reais, one person said. </p>
<p>Banco Itau BBA SA is lining up a four-bank syndicated loan
for Gavea, Goldman and ADIA, one person said. JPMorgan Chase 
Co. is advising Core Participa''''es SA, the holding company that
controls Fleury. Any acquirer of Fleury would have to make an
offer to buy out the minority shareholders'' stakes at the same
price paid to the controlling stakeholders. </p>

comment. Exame earlier reported that the Pardini family is

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s largest
payments network, posted a fiscal third-quarter profit that beat
analysts'' estimates as card spending increased. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended June 30 rose 11
percent to $1.36 billion, or $2.17 a share, from $1.23 billion,
or $1.88, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
company said today in a statement. The average estimate of 30
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for adjusted profit of $2.10. </p>
<p>Visa is benefiting as consumers globally replace cash with
credit and debit cards. Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf,
49, has focused on strengthening relationships with retailers,
developing technologies to enable digital payments and working
with governments to expand the firm''s reach outside the U.S. </p>
<p>''Visa''s business is characterized by recurring revenues,
high incremental margins, low capital expenditures and high free
cash flow,'' Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. analyst,
wrote in a July 23 note. The company is ''a relative safe haven
against macro uncertainty.'' </p>
<p>The shares rose 0.7 percent to $222.74 at 4 p.m. in New
York and have gained 0.3 percent this year. MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
second-largest payments network, has slid 7.2 percent since Dec.
31. </p>
<p>Discover Financial Services, the fourth-largest payments
network, said July 22 that profit rose 7 percent to $644 million
as card spending increased. American Express Co., the biggest
card issuer by purchases, is scheduled to report earnings on
July 29, with MasterCard following two days later. </p>
<h2>Russia Tensions </h2>
<p>After the U.S. imposed sanctions against Russia in March,
Russian President Vladimir Putin recommended his country create
its own payments system. Visa -- which generates about 2 percent
of its revenue from Russia -- said the tensions may trim
''several pennies'' from this year''s earnings. </p>
<p>The company this month introduced Visa Checkout, which it
said will allow consumers to make purchases faster online. The
product replaces V.me, a digital wallet that Scharf described as
''not friendly'' for clients in a May conference call. </p>
<p>''Visa is late to the quick checkout game,'' Huang said in
a July 16 research note. ''But it is one of only a few companies
that could establish critical mass given its payment share,
marketing budget and brand equity.'' </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may need to pay
more than the $4.5 billion it offered to settle investor claims
over faulty mortgages packaged into securities before the U.S.
housing crash, a report prepared for bond trustees shows. </p>
<p>Trustees should reject the accord struck last November with
a group of bondholders for 16 of the 330 deals included, and
it''s a ''close call'' for three others, according to the report
posted online this week by Daniel Fischel, president of Compass
Lexecon, which is among firms hired by the securities
administrators to help evaluate the offer. </p>
<p>''Based on the reports by the expert advisors, there exists
a meaningful possibility that trustees may not accept the
proposed settlement offer for all 330 trusts,'' Nomura Holdings
Inc. analysts including Paul Nikodem and Pratik K. Gupta wrote
yesterday in a research note. </p>
<p>JPMorgan negotiated the proposed settlement with 21
institutional investors including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Pacific
Investment Management Co. in a bid to move past legal troubles
tied in part to the housing crisis. The accord was announced the
week before the largest U.S. bank agreed to a record $13 billion
settlement with government agencies over faulty mortgage
securities. </p>
<h2>Extended Deadline </h2>
<p>Trustees including Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo  Co. and
Bank of New York Mellon Corp. must decide whether to accept
JPMorgan''s proposal by Aug. 1. The deadline has been pushed back
at least twice from an original date of March 16. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment, as did Jen Hibbard of Wells Fargo, Kevin Heine of Bank of New York and Renee Calabro of Deutsche Bank.
Kathy Patrick, a lawyer at Gibbs  Bruns LLP representing the
investors who negotiated the deal, didn''t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Hedge fund Fir Tree Partners has said it will seek to
continue separate lawsuits over some of the securities. Law firm
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan LLP is also representing a
group of investors objecting to the agreement for at least some
deals, according to Fischel, also a professor of law and
business emeritus at the University of Chicago Law School. </p>
<h2>Improper Servicing </h2>
<p>The accord sparked claims that JPMorgan and Bear Stearns
Cos., which it bought in 2008, needed to repurchase mortgages
whose quality was misrepresented, as well as pay for mishandling
loans once they''re made. Another expert, Boston Portfolio
Advisors Inc., said in its report the improper servicing boosted
losses by $4 billion and disclosed that many of the loans are
already managed by a separate ''subservicer,'' limiting the
benefits to investors of transfers to such entities as called
for by the deal, according to Nomura. </p>
<p> Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. bank, has
faced opposition in court over an $8.5 billion settlement that
it reached in 2011 with bondholders represented by Gibbs  Bruns
and Bank of New York, as the trustee for more than 500
transactions. A New York state judge largely approved the deal
in January, though the ruling is being appealed by investors
seeking a bigger payout. </p>
<p>The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said this month it
would pay $650 million to American International Group Inc., one
of the objectors to the agreement that had also filed a separate
suit over mortgage securities created by Countrywide Financial
Corp., the lender bought by Bank of America in 2008. </p>
<h2>No ''Windfall'' </h2>
<p>While the proposed JPMorgan settlement is relatively small,
compared with other mortgage-bond agreements, evidence from
markets suggest that it wouldn''t be a ''windfall'' for the bank,
Fischel wrote. </p>
<p>The amount offered represents 6.6 percent of past and
potential losses on loans underlying the bonds, compared with
10.8 percent in the Bank of America deal, Barclays Plc analysts
estimated in November. After a $55 million payment by Wells
Fargo to an individual bond trust this year, investors recovered
32 percent of past and future losses, according to Nomura. </p>
<p>Fatan Sabry, an economist at National Economic Research
Associates Inc., wrote in a report for trustees that JPMorgan''s
planned payment exceeds potential losses from violations of so-called representation and warranties under several estimation
methods. </p>
<p>Anthony J. Carpinello, a former New York State Supreme
Court justice, said in a report that the statute of limitations
for all the 330 deals has been extended, which could bolster any
separate demands from investors reluctant to take part in the
accord, according to Nomura. JPMorgan contends that the
extension only applies to some of the deals, according to a
website set up by trustees. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) will supply cloud services to the government of
California, letting more than 400 state and local agencies save
money by pooling their computing resources. </p>
<p>IBM will store data and software on remote servers in a
service called CalCloud, available to all state and local
government bodies, the company said today in a statement. The
arrangement lets agencies pay only for the computing workload
they need. </p>
<p>IBM is counting on cloud computing for growth after nine
straight quarters of declining revenue, dragged down by weak
demand for hardware and falling sales in markets like China.
Cloud technology has been a conundrum for the Armonk, New York-based company because it can reduce demand for hardware, since
companies rent computing power rather than assembling their own
data centers. </p>
<p>The company competes for cloud-computing clients with
Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., to which IBM
lost a $600 million contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency last year. </p>
<p>Because government customers have additional data-security
needs, they''ve been slower than corporations in moving to the
cloud because it means surrendering some control over managing
the technology. IBM said it designed CalCloud to comply with the
requirements of the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security
and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. </p>
<p>''CalCloud is an important step towards providing faster
and more cost-effective IT services to California state
departments and ultimately to the citizens of California,''
Marybel Batjer, secretary of the Government Operations Agency,

<p>Iron ore extended losses to the
lowest level in a month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
increasing production from Australia and Brazil will deepen a
global glut every year through 2018. </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent iron content at the Chinese port of
Tianjin fell 0.7 percent to $93.60 a dry ton today, the lowest
since June 24, according to data from The Steel Index Ltd. The
raw material will average $80 in 2015 from $107 this year,
Goldman said in a report, reiterating previous forecasts. </p>
<p>Prices tumbled 30 percent in 2014 as companies from Rio
Tinto Group to BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) increased output, betting
higher volumes will more than offset falling prices. Citigroup
Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley see lower rates
through 2016 as supply expands. A manufacturing gauge in China
climbed to the highest level in 18 months today, signaling a
potential recovery in demand from the world''s biggest user. </p>
<p>''The large scale of supply that is entering the market
this year will add downward pressure to iron-ore prices,''
Gerard Burg, senior Asia economist at National Australia Bank
Ltd. in Melbourne, said by e-mail. ''The increase in demand from
China should be less than the increase in supply.'' </p>
<p>Global seaborne output will exceed demand by 72 million
tons this year, 175 million tons in 2015 and 323 million tons in
2018, Goldman said. The size of the surplus, which has led to
the shuttering of some Chinese mines, will put high-cost
seaborne producers at risk, it said. </p>
<h2>Seaborne Output </h2>
<p>''China will not absorb every ton of incremental seaborne
supply,'' Goldman analysts including Sydney-based Christian Lelong wrote in the report. ''A material amount of seaborne
capacity will eventually have to close.'' </p>
<p>The economy of China, which purchases about 70 percent of
the world''s seaborne ore, is forecast to expand 7.4 percent this
year, the weakest pace since 1990, a Bloomberg survey shows. The
government has set a target of about 7.5 percent. </p>
<p>BHP, the world''s biggest mining company, had a 19 percent
increase in iron ore output to 56.6 million tons in the three
months ended June from a year earlier. Rio Tinto (RIO) boosted output
by 11 percent to 57.5 million tons in the period. The companies
say their low-cost output will displace marginal Chinese supply. </p>
<p>The biggest Chinese closures may be in Hebei province as
it''s the largest producer and its marginal costs are higher than
in most other provinces, according to Goldman. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
price forecast for nickel as the market is swinging to a deficit
next year following an ore-export ban in Indonesia. </p>
<p>The bank''s 12-month estimate is now $22,000 a metric ton,
up 38 percent from the previous projection of $16,000, analysts
led by Max Layton wrote in a report. They increased zinc and
aluminum by at least 11 percent to $2,500 a ton and $2,100 a
ton, respectively, saying iron ore, gold and copper have ''the
greatest downside'' among the mining commodities. </p>
<p>Goldman joins Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. in boosting
the outlook for nickel, already the best-performing base metal
on the London Metal Exchange this year, as supplies are
declining after the Indonesian restriction in January. The
global nickel market will be in deficit of 201,000 tons next
year from an estimated 20,000 ton surplus this year, with demand
exceeding supply for aluminum and zinc this year, Goldman said. </p>
<p>''Nickel is being boosted by the attempts of a large
producer (Indonesia) to encourage value-add capacity
domestically,'' the Goldman analysts said in the report dated
yesterday. ''We have raised out already bullish zinc, nickel and
aluminum forecasts, and lowered our copper forecasts, reflecting
a quick-than-anticipated shift in the relative fundamentals of
these commodities.'' </p>
<p>The ban by Indonesia, which accounted for more than 20
percent of global nickel supply in 2013, is unlikely to be eased
until the second half of 2015, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Nickel for delivery in three months on the LME rose 0.7
percent to $19,180 a ton by 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 38
percent this year. The metal touched $21,625 a ton on May 13,
the highest since February 2012. </p>
<h2>Indonesian Ban </h2>
<p>Earlier this month, Bank of America Corp. raised its 2014
forecast to $18,616, citing the ban and the possible reduction
of Chinese nickel pig iron output. Citigroup raised its 2014
average forecast to $18,550 and Morgan Stanley said the metal
will average $17,640 this year and $19,346 next year. </p>
<p>The global aluminum market has moved into deficit of
579,000 tons this year, with the gap increasing to 619,000 tons
next year, while zinc will have deficit of 154,000 tons in 2015,
according to the Goldman report. </p>
<p>''A cyclical upswing in demand in combination with low
supply growth, following years of underinvestment in new
capacity outside of China, has seen zinc and aluminum
outperform'' in the first half of 2014, said the Goldman
analysts. </p>
<p>Goldman cut the 12-month estimate for copper to $6,200 a
ton from $6,600 previously due to rising production and exposure
to weak property market in China. </p>
<p>Among precious metals, palladium remains the preferred
metal, with prices averaging $925 an ounce in 2015 and rising to
$1,000 in 2016, according to the bank. It reiterated a call for
gold to drop to $1,050 by the end of 2014 as the U.S. economic
recovery accelerates. </p>

<p>Russia''s surprise interest rate
increase paves the way for policy makers to widen the band in
which the currency trades and reduces the need to intervene,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The ruble has tumbled almost 4 percent against the dollar
in the past month, the worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after President Vladimir
Putin''s annexation of Crimea spurred violence along the border
with Ukraine. Bank Rossii boosted the one-week auction rate to 8
percent from 7.5 percent yesterday and may keep raising
borrowing costs as currency weakness spurs inflation, according
to a central bank statement. </p>
<p>The decision gives the bank room to make its exchange-rate
policy more flexible as it moves towards a free-floating rate by
year-end, according to New York-based Goldman Sachs. Enabling
the ruble to strengthen will aid the central bank in its fight
against price increases. </p>
<p>The surprise rate change makes it likely that the central
bank ''will proceed with further steps towards introduction of
currency flexibility in the short term, with a decision to
reduce the cumulative interventions needed to shift the
intervention corridor, for example, likely as early as next
week,'' economists led by Clemens Grafe at Goldman Sachs in
Moscow wrote in a note yesterday. </p>
<h2>Wider Band </h2>
<p>The central bank widened the corridor within which it will
not intervene to 5.1 rubles, up from 3.1 rubles last month. It
is required to buy or sell dollars to keep the ruble inside that
range. It aims to abolish the band by year-end. </p>
<p>Russia spent $30.7 billion between Feb. 28 and May 8 to
stem the ruble''s decline. Since then, it hasn''t sold dollars to
support its currency. The country''s foreign reserves fell $39
billion to $472 billion in June, according to central bank data. </p>
<p>Consumer prices grew 7.8 percent from a year earlier in
June, the most since August 2011. Inflation slowed on an annual
basis to 7.5 percent as of July 21, the central bank said,
adding that it will probably decelerate to a range of 6 percent
to 6.5 percent by year-end. </p>
<p>The ruble slipped 0.5 percent to 35.1435 per dollar
yesterday, extending its decline this year to 6.5 percent. </p>
<p>Russia''s policy makers are aiming to let the ruble decline
because a weaker currency will increase the government''s revenue
from energy exports, according to Ian Hague, who helps manage
$1.1 billion including Russian stocks as the founding partner of
New York-based Firebird Management. </p>
<p>''We expect the ruble to depreciate,'' Hague said in a
phone interview yesterday. ''They are just plugging the holes.'' </p>

Seven banks, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG, agreed to pay a total of almost $8 billion last year to settle claims they made misrepresentations about mortgages underlying securities bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the lead-up to the credit crisis. </p> <p>The $800 million figure would surpass Goldman Sachs''s $550 million payment in 2010 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission suit over the marketing of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation dubbed Abacus 2007-AC1. </p> <p>Still, Goldman''s cost could be lower than what rival banks paid, as a percentage of the face value of securities bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA said in its original suit that the two companies bought $11.1 billion from Goldman Sachs, and an $800 million settlement would be 7.2 percent of that total. Some banks have settled at amounts that represented between 12 percent and 20 percent. </p> <h2>JPMorgan, BofA </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley in February agreed to pay $1.25 billion as part of a settlement over $10.6 billion in securities.

<h2>Percentages </h2>
<p>The former Goldman Sachs employees cited their own
percentages in court filings. They claimed female vice
presidents earned 21 percent less than men, and female
associates made 8 percent less. About 23 percent fewer female
vice presidents were promoted to managing director relative to
their male counterparts, they said in their complaint. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs asked U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to
rule that Chen-Oster and Orlich should pursue their claims
individually, rather than as representatives of all female
Goldmans Sachs associates and vice presidents. Plaintiffs have
more leverage in class actions because they can pool legal
resources, more easily forcing a settlement. </p>
<p>The bank argued that the women haven''t shown a general
policy of discrimination or evidence that women were affected
negatively as a class. Their allegations are individual claims
that don''t apply to the other women, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<h2>Denials </h2>
<p>The bank also specifically denied many of the allegations
in the complaint, including claims that male employees took
clients to strip clubs. </p>
<p>The firm said it prohibits employees from business outings
involving ''sexually oriented entertainment, such as
entertainment at topless bars or lap-dancing bars.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also submitted statements from female
employees who said they haven''t been discriminated against or
subject to harassment. </p>
<p>The firm said it has conducted diversity training programs
for 20 years. </p>
<p>''I have never heard anyone even mention the
possibility of going to a strip club,'' Samantha Davidson, an
extended managing director, said in a written declaration. ''I
do not feel excluded from social events, such as events with
clients and informal get-togethers after work with co-workers,
including golf events.'' </p>

<p>When hurricanes come barreling toward land, people, airplanes and ships are relocated to avoid destruction. Now some of the world''s biggest technology companies are making advances in figuring out how to quickly move large amounts of critical data and software out of harm''s way, too. </p> <p>ATT Inc. (T), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), and Applied Communications Sciences have created a prototype technology to reduce the time needed to connect remote networks from days to seconds. Part of a seven-year program from the U.S. government''s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the latest innovation from the partnership could allow large amounts of information and software to be more quickly shifted between private and public data centers, as well as between cloud services from different providers. </p> <p>Moving data and software to another location could be crucial in coping with events like natural disasters and terrorist attacks as governments and companies have become increasingly reliant on servers, both on premise and in remote locations, to handle their information. The U.S. Department of Defense has expressed interest in the research, IBM said in an e-mail. </p> <p>''The key idea here is to have a highly dynamic backbone network,'' said Adel Saleh, a research professor in electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a former DARPA project manager. ''If the network is under physical attack or cyberattack, you can recover from this quickly.'' </p> <h2>Remaining Hurdles </h2> <p>While many companies and governments already keep data remotely to have redundant systems, the companies'' prototype would let them reconfigure on the fly to handle changes in needs, such as computing bandwidth. </p> <p>The ability to use capacity only when needed could also make cloud computing less expensive, Saleh said in a phone interview. </p> <p>The partnership between ATT, IBM and ACS is a part of a DARPA program called Coronet that was started in 2007 to protect networks against catastrophic failures, in order to help keep the Internet and government services up and running. </p> <p>The technology is still in the proof-of-concept phase, said Dave McQueeney, vice president of computing as a service at IBM Research. Changes would have to be made to optical fiber networks -- including the addition of new switches -- for it to be adopted more broadly, he said. Work also needs to be done within cloud systems to accommodate the connections, McQueeney said. </p> <p>If these changes are made, the technology could be used in military technology infrastructures and eventually for commercial use. </p> <p>''Every client I talk to doesn''t want to put all of their IT in one place,'' McQueeney said. ''One of the long poles of the tent that needed to get solved was very, very rapid provisioning of huge amounts of bandwidth. Now we can have a vision of a multiple-cloud, hybrid environment where the networking is likely not the main bottleneck.'' </p> <p>', 'IBM, AT&amp;T Build Technology to Move Data Fast in Disaster', 'By Alex Barinka', 'Jul 28, 2014  3:00 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-28/ibm-at-t-build-technology-to-move-data-fast-in-disaster.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>It''s game on in China, as Microsoft Corp.''s (MSFT) Xbox One becomes the first entertainment console to hit the market after the end of a 13-year ban. </p> <p>Microsoft today began taking orders for its new game console from online retailer JD.com Inc. (JD) via Tencent Holdings Ltd.''s (700) mobile-messaging applications. The pair of Chinese Internet companies hold exclusive rights to pre-sell the locally made Xbox One until July 30, JD.com said in a news release. The console is slated to ship nationwide in September. </p> <p>Microsoft was the industry''s first big player to start production in the country after the Chinese government last year allowed console sales in the new Shanghai free-trade zone and opened up an estimated $10 billion market. The first Xbox didn''t even exist in 2000, when the Communist Party banned game systems over concern they would be bad for kids. It was released a year later. </p> <p>''The potential market for Xbox in China is huge, there''s a lot of prospects for growth,'' said Bill Fan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Securities Co. ''Tencent could cooperate with Microsoft on games in the future, and Xbox can utilize Tencent and JD.com''s distribution channels to generate more sales.'' </p> <p>Tencent shares rose 3.2 percent to close at HK$128.90 in Hong Kong. Microsoft has gained about 19 percent this year, compared with a 7 percent rise for the SP 500 Index. Microsoft shares rose 0.2 percent to $44.50 in New York yesterday. </p> <h2>Entry Points </h2> <p>The Xbox One pre-orders on JD.com require a deposit of 499 yuan (US$81), and will only be available to those who use the Chinese versions of Tencent''s WeChat and QQ mobile-messaging apps. </p> <p>JD.com spokesman Josh Gartner wouldn''t disclose the number of Xbox Ones the company was selling nor the price. </p> <p>''Launching Xbox One sales in China through JD.com''s Weixin and Mobile QQ entry points underscores the strength of these platforms with young and sophisticated Chinese consumers,'' Du Shuang, vice president of JD.com, said in the news release, using the Chinese name for Tencent''s WeChat. </p> <p>JD.com will begin directly accepting pre-orders for the new Xbox through its website and its exhibition booth at the ChinaJoy Expo in Shanghai on July 31, the company said. </p> <h2>Trade Zone </h2> <p>Game consoles were included on the list of items to be liberalized before Shanghai''s free-trade zone before its creation last September. </p> <p>Around the same time, Microsoft formed a $79 million joint venture with BesTV New Media Co. (600637), a unit of Shanghai Media Group Inc., to begin making Xbox consoles in the free-trade zone for the Chinese market. BesTV invested $40.3 million for a 51 percent stake in the enterprise, while Microsoft put in $38.7 million, according a September filing. </p> <p>The State Council, China''s cabinet, has since temporarily lifted the ban nationwide and announced plans to draft new rules on their sale. The country''s video-game industry will generate about $10 billion in sales next year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. </p> <p>Sony Corp. (6758) has similarly agreed to form two ventures with the Shanghai Oriental Pearl (Group) Co., to start making PlayStation consoles in China. Nintendo Co. plans to expand in emerging markets with new devices starting next year, the company''s president, Satoru Iwata, said on May 8. </p> <p>Microsoft has been chasing Sony for dominance in the U.S. video-game console market. It introduced a lower-priced version of its Xbox One costing $399 on June 9 to narrow a $100 price difference with the PS4. </p> <p>Duncan Clark, the Beijing-based chairman of BDA China Ltd., which advises technology companies, said Tencent and JD.com were well-positioned to benefit from the lifting of the ban. ''For Xbox, Tencent is the most established games distributor, and, for JD, it''s logistics, shipping and quality control,'' Clark said.

<p>Nickel and palladium are set to
outperform iron ore and soybeans as supply outlooks for
commodities diverge amid a tentative acceleration in global
economic growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The bank kept its 12-month recommendation for commodities
at neutral, analysts including Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report
dated yesterday. They expect the total return for the Standard 
Poor''s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index to be 0.1 percent in 12
months helped by positive roll yields. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. said last month that interest is returning
to the asset class as Societe Generale SA called commodities a
''really mixed bag'' across the sectors. Raw materials are
already trading independently, with a ban on ore exports from
Indonesia spurring a rally in nickel, while expectations for a
deepening global glut have sent iron ore into a bear market. </p>
<p>''While cyclical recovery tends to see rising commodity
demand, prices will likely largely be determined by more
structural supply factors,'' the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.
''Accordingly, not all boats are expected rise with the tide
created by continued improvement in global macroeconomic data.'' </p>
<p>Commodities as measured by the enhanced index added 2.4
percent this year as global equities increased 5.6 percent and
the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose 3.5 percent.
Shortages are seen nickel, zinc, aluminum and palladium, while
most other raw materials including copper, iron ore, oil and
soybeans, are expected to be in surplus, Goldman says. Nickel
fell 1.2 percent today and palladium advanced 0.4 percent. </p>
<h2>Increasing Allocations </h2>
<p>''We''ve seen increasing allocations from asset managers
this year and some new fund interest come into commodities,''
Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president in New
York, said in a phone interview June 24. ''We''ve seen
geopolitics and weather really come to the fore this year.'' </p>
<p>Societe Generale is overweight agriculture, and energy to a
slightly lesser extent, and massively underweight precious
metals, according to Michael Haigh, head of commodities
research, in a June 17 interview. </p>
<p>While financial markets have reacted favorably to signs of
macroeconomic acceleration in both the U.S. and China, with the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index reaching a record, commodity indexes
have remained mostly flat on expectations for increases in
supplies in most raw materials, the Goldman analysts said.
Nickel, zinc, aluminum and palladium do not fit into this view
as deficits are predicted over the next three years, they said. </p>
<h2>Carry Return </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley also expects nickel, zinc and palladium to
advance. While nickel ''may have run ahead of itself,'' a
shortage next year may keep its uptrend intact, analysts
including Joel Crane said in a report yesterday. Zinc will
continue to outperform as the shortfall intensifies and solid
supply and demand fundamentals support palladium, they said. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI enhanced index has rebounded in 2014 from two
years of losses as key markets are in backwardation, a structure
where short-term supplies cost more than later deliveries, which
has provided so-called positive carry and continued to generate
returns, according to Goldman. </p>

<p>China should allow economic growth
to slow to below 7 percent to reduce reliance on investment
spending, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s Ha Jiming. </p>
<p>Achieving Premier Li Keqiang''s target of 7.5 percent gross
domestic product growth for this year could further aggravate
imbalances and a rate ''below 7 percent'' is roughly what China
needs, said Ha, the Hong Kong-based vice chairman and chief
investment strategist at Goldman''s investment management
division for China. Next year, ''I hope the target could be
lowered to reflect the need for economic rebalance,'' he said. </p>
<p>The ruling Communist Party, which last year laid out the
broadest economic changes since the 1990s, has been drawn back
into providing greater support for the economy as expansion is
threatened by a plunge in property construction and weaker home-price gains. The government has brought forward spending, cut
reserve requirements for some lenders and lowered taxes, helping
drive a gauge of manufacturing to an 18-month high. </p>
<p>''It''s very difficult for China to strike a balance between
short-term growth and long-term reform needs,'' Ha said in an

China wants to lower the share of investment in GDP over the
medium term, growth should not exceed 7 percent.'' </p>
<p>The risks embedded in the current Chinese growth model are
being exacerbated the longer the government seeks to maintain
growth at 7.5 percent, Angus Bell, an investment manager at
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said yesterday in the same
interview. Goldman Sachs AM invests or advises on assets worth
more than $900 billion, according to its website. </p>
<h2>Slower Growth </h2>
<p>Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict that Chinese
GDP will expand by 7.4 percent this year, the slowest pace since
1990. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its forecasts
to 7.4 percent for this year and 7.1 percent for 2015, the
Washington-based fund said this month. </p>
<p>China''s leaders are seeking to rebalance the economy away
from exports and domestic investment, toward services and
consumption. To put the nation on a more sustainable growth
path, the government needs to prevent further excesses in
production capacity, debt and housing supply, according to Ha. </p>
<p>''In the first half of this year, I would say the focus was
on safeguarding growth,'' said Ha. ''Given that the stimulus
policies are taking effect and growth is likely to be maintained
at the targeted level of 7.5 percent, in the second half of this
year some reform measures as announced a year ago could be put
in place.'' </p>
<h2>Housing Market </h2>
<p>Liberalization of interest rates and the currency and a
loosening of some regulations on foreign and domestic investors
will probably be among the initial changes considered, he said. </p>
<p>The key risks in China that concern Goldman Sachs Asset
Management center around housing, which is an important source
of demand for various industries and linked to local and central
government revenues, Bell said in Sydney. </p>
<p>Authorities are currently seeking to avert a collapse of
the real-estate market after data showed housing prices fell in
55 of 70 cities last month from May, the most since January 2011
when the government changed the way it compiles the statistics. </p>
<p>UBS AG estimates real-estate accounts for more than a
quarter of final demand in the economy when including property-generated needs for goods including electric machinery and
instruments, chemicals and metals. </p>
<p>''The size is very big compared to many other countries,''
said Ha, who predicts that home sellers will start to outnumber
buyers as China''s baby-boom generation retires. ''That
demographic inflection point will have very significant
implications for the Chinese property market and related
industries.'' </p>

<p>Iraq''s semi-autonomous Kurds,
sparring with the nation''s central government over their right
to export crude, may almost double oil production next year and
triple it this decade, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>The Kurdistan Regional Government could bolster output to
about 540,000 barrels a day by the end of 2015 if it can expand
pipeline capacity and surmount marketing constraints, analysts
including New York-based Head of Commodities Research Jeff
Currie said in a report yesterday. The KRG and authorities in
Baghdad have clashed over the Kurds'' attempts to sell oil
independently, including over a tanker currently anchored off
Galveston, Texas. </p>
<p>Iraq will be the biggest source of new capacity this decade
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the group
responsible for 40 percent of the world''s oil, according to the
International Energy Agency. Brazil will the second-largest
source of supply growth outside OPEC after North America,
boosting output by 48 percent to 3.1 million barrels a day by
2019, the IEA predicts. </p>
<p>''With Brazil and South Iraq, it''s the largest growth
potential in the industry outside North America,'' Michele Della Vigna, the bank''s head of European energy research, said in an
interview in London yesterday. ''There will be enough buyers of
Kurdish crude in the market. The greatest uncertainty at this
point in time surrounds the payment mechanism to the producers
and security of installations and pipelines.'' </p>
<p>Reaching 540,000 barrels a day by the end of 2015 will
require that Kurds have access to the main export pipeline to
Turkey''s port of Ceyhan, and that the Baiji refinery is
restarted, Goldman Sachs said. Output will be limited to 110,000
barrels a day at the end of next year if those conditions aren''t
met. </p>
<p>Production could exceed 1 million barrels a day by the end
of the decade, Goldman''s Della Vigna said. The Kurds are
producing about 280,000 barrels a day currently, according to
the report. </p>

<p>Don''t fight the People''s Bank of China. </p> <p>That''s the advice to investors from Adrian Mowat, the Hong Kong-based chief Asia and emerging-market strategist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) who raised his rating on Chinese stocks to neutral from underweight in a report dated yesterday. He said shares will rally through October after the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) entered a bull market on July 28. </p> <p>China''s central bank presided over a bigger-than-estimated surge in new credit in June and has cut reserve requirements for some lenders, while local media reported the PBOC set up a 1 trillion yuan ($162 billion) lending facility with the China Development Bank to fund housing projects. The signs of monetary easing, along with accelerated government spending and gains in manufacturing industries, have spurred mutual fund managers to boost Chinese stock holdings to record highs, according to a July 28 report from HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) </p> <p>''The scale of monetary stimulus since June is a surprise,'' Mowat wrote. ''All these changes indicate a more aggressive approach to driving growth.'' </p> <p>Mowat is joining bulls, including Standard Chartered Plc''s Erwin Sanft and Templeton Emerging Markets Group''s Mark Mobius, who predict the rally will extend as low valuations lure investors and the government supports growth. Bears such as Bank of America Corp.''s David Cui say stimulus is delaying the economy''s shift toward a more sustainable model driven by consumption and services. </p> <h2>Winning Streak </h2> <p>The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell less than 0.1 percent to 11,119.32 at the close in Hong Kong, snapping a sixth straight day of gains. China''s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) of mainland shares slipped 0.1 percent, paring the biggest monthly advance since 2012. </p> <p>Aggregate financing was 1.97 trillion yuan in June, the PBOC said on July 15, compared with the median estimate of analysts for 1.425 trillion yuan. New local-currency loans were 1.08 trillion yuan and M2 money supply grew 14.7 percent from a year earlier. </p> <p>Premier Li Keqiang said in June that authorities will ''ensure'' a minimum annual economic growth rate of 7.5 percent.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost its challenge
to a U.S. government search warrant ordering the software giant
to produce e-mails of an unidentified customer stored in a data
center in Ireland. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan today
upheld a federal magistrate''s decision requiring the company to
turn over e-mails in a drug investigation. Preska delayed the
effect of her ruling to give Microsoft time to appeal. </p>
<p>Preska rejected Microsoft''s argument that the warrant,
which requires the company to provide investigators with the
contents of the customer''s MSN.com Web-based e-mail, calls for
an illegal search and seizure outside the U.S. The nation in
which the customer lives wasn''t disclosed. </p>
<p>The judge delivered her ruling from the bench after a two-hour hearing, endorsing an April decision by U.S. Magistrate
Judge James C. Francis IV. Today''s ruling sets up an appeal that
may help dictate how courts apply legal protections to
electronic data, particularly information stored by Internet
service providers outside the U.S. </p>
<p>''Congress intended in this statute for ISPs to produce
information under their control, albeit stored abroad, to law
enforcement in the United States,'' Preska said. ''As Judge
Francis found, it is a question of control, not a question of
the location of that information.'' </p>
<h2>Stored Communications </h2>
<p>During the hearing, lawyers for both sides argued over the
reach of the Stored Communications Act, or SCA, part of the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The SCA allows
law enforcement agents to obtain information through subpoenas,
court orders or warrants, depending on the records sought. </p>
<p>''The only issue that was certain this morning was that the
district court''s decision would not represent the final step in
this process,'' Microsoft''s general counsel, Brad Smith, said in
a statement after the hearing. ''We will appeal promptly and
continue to advocate that people''s e-mail deserves strong
privacy protection in the U.S. and around the world.'' </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft argued that the
government should be required to get the e-mails through
procedures dictated by a law-enforcement treaty between the U.S.
and Ireland. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner told Preska that the
treaty process, which can be complicated and time-consuming,
isn''t legally required. </p>
<h2>''Right Here'' </h2>
<p>''We don''t need to go to a foreign country to get the
records,'' Turner said. ''The provider is right here.'' </p>
<p>E. Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Microsoft, argued that
the government is seeking to ''conscript Microsoft here in the
United States to search files abroad.'' He said that if other
countries required Microsoft to provide them with e-mails of
customers located in the U.S. ''we would consider that an
astounding infringement of our sovereignty.'' </p>
<p>''That is a very, very dangerous principle that the
government is articulating,'' Rosenkranz said. </p>
<p>Rosenkranz told Preska that officials in China this week
demanded a password to seek e-mail information in the U.S. </p>
<p>''Mr. Turner, what do you say to that?'' Preska asked.
''It''s pretty scary.'' </p>
<p>Turner said concerns about what other countries may do
should be addressed ''through political and diplomatic
channels,'' not by ignoring the terms of the SCA. </p>
<h2>Company Support </h2>
<p>Preska also heard arguments from lawyers representing ATT
Inc. (T), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Cisco Systems
Inc. (CSCO), which supported Microsoft''s position. </p>
<p>''Today''s decision is a major blow not just for Microsoft,
but for the entire U.S. cloud-computing industry,'' Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist for the American Civil
Liberties Union, said in a statement today. ''If these companies
wish to regain the trust of their global customers, they must
embrace security technologies such as cloud cryptography, which
can provide real privacy protections where the law does not.'' </p>
<p>The case is In the Matter of a Warrant to Search a Certain
E-Mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 13-mj-02814, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s plan to build a
natural gas shipping terminal on Canada''s Pacific Coast faces
mounting challenges with the exit of its partner, Apache Corp. (APA) </p>
<p>The proposal to liquefy the fuel in Kitimat, British
Columbia, the first to get export approval in Canada, was
already delayed by prior ownership changes including the
departures of Encana Corp. and EOG Resources Inc. It''s among
more than a dozen Pacific Coast liquefied natural gas export
plants being considered by companies seeking higher prices for
the fuel in Asia, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Petroliam
Nasional Bhd. </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, probably won''t
pursue Kitimat LNG on its own, given the cost overruns at its
Gorgon project in Australia, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst with
Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. The cost to build Gorgon, where
Chevron has partners including Exxon Mobil Corp., surged to $54
billion from an estimate of $37 billion in 2009. </p>
<p>''The odds increase that there will be no Kitimat,'' Gheit
said in a phone interview today. ''I would not think that they
would be interested in going it alone. They had a bad experience
in Australia with Gorgon and their co-pilots were Exxon, the
best in the business.'' </p>
<p>Apache, facing pressure from activist hedge fund Jana
Partners LLC to cut spending and focus drilling in the U.S.,
heeded the investor''s advice today by announcing it will exit
the Canadian project and will sell its stake in the Wheatstone
LNG facility under construction in Australia. </p>
<p>Apache gained 1.4 percent to $102.66 at the close in New
York after earlier rising to $104.57, the highest intraday since
March 2012. Chevron fell 2.5 percent. </p>
<h2>''World Class'' </h2>
<p>Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for Chevron, declined to comment
on Apache''s departure from the project. </p>
<p>''I don''t think the complete exit by Apache has an impact
on Kitimat going forward one way or the other,'' Apache Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Steve Farris said today on a
conference call with investors. ''It is a world-class project
with world-class reserves.'' </p>
<p>Chevron and Apache had already been seeking a buyer to
acquire part of their interests in Kitimat LNG to defray costs.
The project, the first to receive an LNG export license from
Canada''s National Energy Board in 2011, has yet to be
sanctioned. </p>
<h2>Petronas Plan </h2>
<p>Petroliam Nasional, known as Petronas, plans to be the
first to decide whether to proceed with a Canadian LNG export
project. The Malaysian state-owned company is targeting a
decision on the C$9 billion ($8.3 billion) to C$11 billion
proposal by the end of this year. </p>
<p>Kitimat LNG was initially considered by Calgary-based
developer Galveston LNG Inc. as an import terminal last decade
and the concept was switched to an export facility after vast
supplies of gas from shale across North America flooded
continental markets. Galveston attracted Apache as a partner and
was later acquired by EOG. Encana joined the project in 2011. </p>
<p>Chevron announced it would enter Kitimat LNG the following
year, when Encana and EOG sold their stakes to focus on
producing onshore fuels. The project was delayed after Chevron
joined as the partners reorganized roles, undertook additional
studies and sought more partners to spread costs. </p>
<p>Kitimat LNG''s early export license gave it a head start on
the other Canadian proposals, and it succeeded in lining up
pipeline approvals and aboriginal support. </p>
<h2>Buyers Search </h2>
<p>After that, the project struggled to find buyers for its
gas. Apache''s departure now pushes Kitimat LNG lower on the list
of the plants that may be built, Ed Kallio and Cameron Gingrich,
directors at Solomon Associates LLC''s Ziff Energy division in
Calgary, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>''They were having issues finding markets, unlike Shell and
Petronas,'' Kallio said. </p>
<p>By losing Apache, Chevron may attract a partner with
experience developing LNG and contacts in the market that missed
the first wave of investment in Canada, said Uday Turaga, chief
executive officer of ADI Analytics in Houston. </p>
<p>''I don''t think there will be a dearth of suitors who may
want to take Apache''s place,'' Turaga said in a phone interview.
''It''s going to be a bit of rough weather for the project until
additional partners can be lined up.'' </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a metallurgical
coal producer that hasn''t been profitable in two years, said it
has enough liquidity to survive the weak market for the
steelmaking ingredient and that industry efforts to cut excess
supply are working. </p>
<p>Walter had $563.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and
available funds under its credit facilities at the end of the
second quarter, the company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>''There''s no liquidity concerns in our company at this
point,'' Chief Executive Officer Walter J. Scheller III said in
a conference call. There will be no ''fire sale'' of assets, he
also said. </p>
<p>Walter is among metallurgical-coal producers contending
with global prices for the commodity that are at a six-year low
because of cooling Chinese demand and new mines coming on line.
Shares of the Birmingham, Alabama-based company have slumped 66
percent this year and Standard  Poor''s said last month that
Walter''s level of debt is ''unsustainable.'' </p>
<p>In April, the company started idling Canadian mines that
produced 3.6 million tons of coal in 2013. Industrywide, about
20 million tons of metallurgical-coal cuts have been announced
this year, helping to reduce excess supply, Scheller said. </p>
<p>''Given the projects that are coming online and the
announced cuts, I think we might be pretty close to balanced
once it all works its way through,'' he said. </p>
<p>Most mining companies believe that 10 million to 15 million
tons of additional cutbacks are needed to achieve a balanced
market, Michael Dudas, an analyst for Sterne Agee  Leach Inc.,
said in a July 28 note. </p>
<h2>Forecast Cut </h2>
<p>Walter''s second-quarter net loss widened to $151.4 million,
or $2.33 a share, from $34.5 million, or 55 cents, a year
earlier. Excluding one-time items, the loss was $1.97 a share,
worse than the $1.69 average of 18 analysts'' estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales dropped 14 percent to $378.4 million,
beating the $376.6 million average estimate. </p>
<p>The company reduced its metallurgical-coal sales forecast
for this year to 9.5 million to 10.5 million tons, from 10.5
million to 11.5 million tons previously. Walter said the main
reason was the shutting in June of its principal coal
transportation provider at the Brule mine in Canada. </p>
<p>The company''s $350 million of 11 percent second-lien notes
due April 2020, dropped 5.5 cents on the dollar today to 71.75
cents to yield 19.4 percent at 12:26 p.m. in New York, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. Walter shares fell 2.2 percent to
$5.75 in New York. </p>

level in almost five years, raising the stakes as it seeks to
pursue crude deposits in Russia. </p>
<p>The world''s largest energy company dropped 4.2 percent to
$98.94 at the close in New York, the biggest slide in almost
three years, after reporting second-quarter earnings that beat
analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>The company''s oil and gas output decreased 5.7 percent to
the equivalent of 3.84 million barrels a day, the lowest since
the third quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Exxon had been expected to post quarterly output
equivalent to 3.96 million barrels, based on six analysts''
estimates. Crude from Exxon wells in Europe and Asia dropped,
while gas production faltered in every region in which the
company does business except Africa and the South Pacific. </p>
<p>Exxon is going after crude in Russia''s Arctic regions in an
effort to extract some of the largest oil reserves and reverse a
trend of declining production for the company. Its allocating
$39.8 billion to capital projects this year, including hundreds
of millions for an exploratory well in Russia''s Kara Sea, as
part of a 29-year agreement signed with Moscow-based OAO Rosneft (ROSN)
in 2011. </p>
<p>Sanctions threaten to halt that progress after the U.S. and
European Union said July 29 they would restrict the export of
technologies for energy production to Russia. The oil-producing
nation holds an estimated $8 trillion worth of crude
underground. </p>
<h2>Profit Rise </h2>
<p>Exxon is awaiting further details on U.S. and EU sanctions
to determine any effects, Vice President David Rosenthal said on
a conference call today. He declined to comment on how the
recently completed Berkut platform, a joint venture with Rosneft
of Russia''s Far East coast, was financed. </p>
<p>''Because these new oil technology sanctions imposed by
Europe and the U.S. governments do impose some restrictions on
Arctic drilling technology, it may have an effect on these
Arctic drilling plans,'' Pavel Molchanov, a Houston-based
analyst for Raymond James  Associates Inc., said in a phone
interview before the results were released. Molchanov rates
Exxon the equivalent of a buy and doesn''t own the shares. </p>
<p>The lower production figures came as the company reported
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Excluding one-time
items, per-share profit was 19 cents more than the $1.86 average
of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income climbed 28
percent to $8.78 billion, or $2.05 a share, from $6.86 billion,
or $1.55, a year earlier, the Irving, Texas-based company said
in a statement today. </p>
<h2>Higher Prices </h2>
<p>Earnings were driven by higher fuel prices. Brent crude
futures, a global benchmark, rose 6 percent from a year earlier
to average $109.76 a barrel in the second quarter. Natural gas
futures prices in New York rose 14 percent to average $4.579 per
million British thermal units. </p>
<p>Exxon''s performance has trailed competitors and the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index for the past year, gaining 7.3
percent, less than half of the SP''s move. The company, which
has a market value of $432 billion, has 14 buy ratings from
analysts, 13 holds and five sells. </p>

<p>A fired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) banker
won 66,163 pounds ($111,700) of damages from law firm Mishcon de
Reya after his lawyers there failed to file a legal document on
time. </p>
<p>Judge Ingrid Simler found that Russell Chweidan lost an
opportunity to challenge a decision in his employment claim at
the U.K. Employment Appeal Tribunal in 2009 because lawyers at
Mishcon missed a filing deadline. Simler based the award on
Chweidan having an 18 percent chance of success in the dispute
with the bank and a probable claim value of 357,575 pounds, plus
interest. </p>
<p>''The breach of duty was the effective cause of these lost
opportunities,'' Simler said in her ruling at the U.K. High
Court today. ''There was sufficient time to enable the cross-appeal to be lodged with the EAT before the deadline.'' </p>
<p>Chweidan, 50, who was fired as an executive director by
JPMorgan in 2008, brought a claim against the New York-based
lender, in which Mishcon represented him. He initially prevailed
on grounds of disability discrimination and unfair dismissal,
and was awarded about 600,000 pounds. JPMorgan appealed.
Chweidan''s lawyers at Mishcon missed the deadline for his cross
appeal, the discrimination finding against the bank was
overturned on appeal and Chweidan was awarded 68,000 pounds for
unfair dismissal, according to the ruling. </p>
<p>''The only claim the judge found in favour of the claimant
was the one that Mishcon de Reya had candidly accepted'' at an
early stage, the law firm said in an e-mailed statement. ''All
of Russell Chweidan''s other claims were rejected and,
consequently, he has only received a fraction of the
compensation that he sued for.'' </p>
<p>Chweidan, who is now head of G3 credit trading at Bank of
China International Ltd. in London, said he couldn''t immediately
comment on the judge''s ruling. </p>

<p>Calling for a correction in equities at the right time is about as easy as brushing your teeth with your mustache. Yet that didn''t stop many market watchers in July as U.S. benchmark indexes clung to records. </p> <p>From Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Alan Greenspan, a fear of heights spread this month as the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index closed in on its third year without a significant dip. The benchmark gauge of volatility reflected the concern, with the VIX jumping 34 percent for its biggest monthly gain since January yet still holding well below its lifetime average. </p> <p>Many potential catalysts were proffered. However, as the final trades of the month hit the tape, none of them have yet proven to be the smoking gun. An interest rate spike caused by the slow drain of the Federal Reserve punch bowl? Treasury 10-year yields held pretty flat below 2.6 percent. An oil shock as the world goes up in flames? Both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude lost more than 5 percent. </p> <p>But wait! Corn is poised for its biggest monthly decline in almost three years! What calamity could be causing this 13 percent drop and is it the catalyst everyone''s been waiting for to knock the chip off the stock market''s shoulder? Well, as Bloomberg News describes it, the reason for the drop is ''expectations supplies will be ample amid an outlook for a bumper harvest in the U.S., the top grower.'' </p> <p>OK fine. Whatever. </p> <h2>Long Time </h2> <p>The main rationale for many of the correction predictions is based on the logic that, well, corrections happen. And we haven''t had one in a long time. </p> <p>Yet the fundamentals are sort of getting in the way. U.S. gross domestic product surged 4 percent last quarter, earnings are up 10 percent for the SP 500 companies that have reported results for the latest quarter and sales have increased 4.9 percent. Signs of growth sent the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index up 1.9 percent in July, its biggest monthly gain in a year. </p> <p>Meanwhile across the pond, euro-area government bonds were up for a seventh straight month and headed for their longest streak of gains in nine years after weak data signaled the European Central Bank will have to soldier on with stimulus. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index is headed for a 1.8 percent July drop, its worst month since January, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 1.5 percent in July. </p> <h2>Yield Curve </h2> <p>And not all was flat in the Treasury market. Thirty-year bonds had a nice rally, while five-year notes fell. That sent the yield spread, or curve, between them to the lowest since 2009. That is likely a sign that people are taking this whole Fed tightening thing seriously, if not necessarily worried about inflation. </p> <p>Stocks are falling pretty sharply this morning as the month draws to an end, and there are new catalysts to blame: the Bank of Portugal''s order that Banco Espirito Santo SA must raise capital; Argentina''s default; a handful of lousy earnings reports from some big names. </p> <p>Ten-year Treasury yields surged 10 basis point yesterday and took an early jump today, then came back down to make a cool Sears Tower formation in the daily chart. </p> <p>Today''s drop has left the SP 500 down about 0.6 percent for July, which would mark its first monthly decline since January. However, dips have been bought reliably, so check back at the end of the day to see where the chips fall for July. </p> <p>It does make you wonder if this is the beginning of the correction that will fulfill all the pundit prophecies? Who knows. One thing is sure: people will likely obsess over it in August, just like they did in July. Oh, and in June too... </p> <p>''Investors and analysts of all shades and sizes are obsessed with the idea of a correction,'' Birinyi Associates Inc. wrote in a note to clients at the end of June. ''We have always held that these efforts to foretell a correction are in vain.'' </p> <p>Anyway, come to think of it, there are some people who could brush their teeth with their mustache if they want: those with dentures. Hey, no one said coming up with market metaphors was any easier. </p> <p>', 'Goldman to Greenspan Catch Equity Acrophobia in Flat July', 'By Michael P.

<p>A plan to start direct trading
between the won and China''s yuan will hurt the South Korean
currency by slowing the inflow of dollars, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said in a report. </p>
<p>Governments of the two Asian countries agreed on July 3 to
make their currencies mutually exchangeable in Seoul later this
year. The plan supports Goldman''s prediction that the won will
drop to 1,050 per dollar by the end of 2014, from 1,025.65
today, Kwon Goohoon, a Seoul-based economist at the U.S. bank,
wrote in today''s report. </p>
<p>''This market will likely increase yuan settlement for
Korean exports to China and expand yuan investments by Korean
investors, weakening the won against the dollar in the
process,'' Kwon wrote. </p>
<p>South Korea''s trade surplus with China, its biggest export
partner, amounted to $24 billion in the first six months of this
year, according to a July 1 government report. With only 0.3
percent of trade payments settled in the Chinese currency, the
won-yuan market has the potential to grow rapidly, the Goldman
report said. </p>
<p>The value of South Korea''s yuan transactions with China and
Hong Kong has jumped by 5.6 times since June 2013, the Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or Swift,
said in a July 29 statement. Bank of Korea data show yuan
deposits in the country surged 80 percent this year as investors
sought higher interest rates. </p>
<h2>Global Payments </h2>
<p>China''s currency ranked seventh for global payments in
June, according to Swift. The won has appreciated 2.3 percent
against the dollar this year and advanced 4.3 versus the yuan in
the same period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The won, which can only trade onshore in South Korea at
present, may also be transacted in China in the future. The two
countries will seek to establish infrastructure enabling direct
trading in Shanghai, according to a July 3 statement by the Bank
of Korea and the finance ministry. </p>
<p>The agreement also awarded South Korea an 80 billion yuan
($13 billion) quota for domestic investors to buy securities in
China under the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investor program. Bank of Communications Co. was appointed as
the yuan clearing bank in Seoul. </p>
<p>South Korea residents held $40.67 billion in dollar-denominated deposits at the end of June, while those in yuan
were equivalent to $11.97 billion, central bank figures show.
Goldman''s Kwon estimates yuan savings in the country can rise
2.5 times during the next 18 months. </p>
<p>South Korean banks are testing won-yuan transactions. Woori
Bank said it traded 1-month forward contracts directly with
Barclays Plc on July 28, while Kookmin Bank said it settled a
transaction with the Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
on July 23. </p>

<p>Rio Tinto Group Chief Executive
Officer Sam Walsh last week signaled that mining investor
attitudes toward spending on expansion are starting to shift
after a recovery in metals and share prices. </p>
<p>Investors have started to refocus on growth and expansion
plans rather than concentrating only on returns, Walsh, 64, said
at an industry event in Perth, Australia last week. Mining
companies should retain their focus on giving back excess cash
to shareholders and shy away from mergers and acquisitions, two
of the industry''s largest investors said. </p>
<p>''It does seem slightly baffling for him to have come out
with that statement so early on really,'' James Sutton, a
portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management''s $1.9 billion
Natural Resources Fund in London, said today in a phone
interview. ''In terms of the worst culprits of capital ill
discipline, I don''t think they''re off the leash yet.'' </p>
<p>Mining companies have been reining in spending after a $250
billion investment spree marked by poorly timed acquisitions and
asset writedowns sparked investor criticism. As a decade-long
boom in metal prices petered out, producers have focused on
preserving capital and bolstering dividends. </p>
<p>''If you look at investors globally, there was certainly a
time when global investors were more focused on returns,'' Walsh
said. ''Since the beginning of this year, we''ve actually seen a
shift. I think it''s far more balanced; that we''ve now got
investors refocused on growth, expansion, as well as shareholder
returns.'' </p>
<h2>''Damaging Strategies'' </h2>
<p>Walsh replaced Tom Albanese at the head of the world''s
second-largest mining company in January last year following
failed deals in coal and aluminum. He cut $2.3 billion from
costs last year and is seeking to a further reduction of $1
billion this year. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc.''s Evy Hambro, who manages the $8 billion
World Mining Fund, said mining CEOs should maintain their
commitment to rewarding investors. Rio is the fourth-largest
holding in Hambro''s Fund at 7.7 percent. The 101-member
Bloomberg World Mining Index advanced 5.4 percent in July to
reach the highest monthly close in 16 months. </p>
<p>''Given the recent strength in the sector, the market is
starting to acknowledge managements'' focus on returns for
shareholders,'' Hambro said in e-mailed comments yesterday. ''It
would be foolish for the executives and boards to put this
nascent recovery at risk by reverting back to the damaging
strategies of the last cycle.'' </p>
<p>A London-based spokesman for Rio declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Shareholders Important </h2>
<p>There''s been no change of strategy at Rio, Walsh said at
last week''s event. The company raised its dividend 15 percent in
February after reporting a 43 percent gain in second-half
profit. </p>
<p>''Shareholder returns are very important to me and to the
company,'' he said. ''That''s why we''re in business: to provide
returns to our shareholders. We should never lose sight of that.
But it''s also, you know, long-term shareholders as well as
short-term shareholders. We need to get that balance right.'' </p>
<p>Analysts widely expect BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio to
announce share buybacks in the next six months. Macquarie Group
Ltd. analysts have said they''re ''not convinced a buyback is due
or that it would be a responsible use of funds'' for BHP. </p>
<p>Rio Tinto this week drew a line under one of its most
disastrous deals by selling its Mozambique coal assets for $50
million. The company bought the projects as part of a $3.7
billion purchase of Riversdale Mining Ltd. in 2011 before
writing them down by $3 billion last year. </p>
<p>''I don''t think that the large-cap mining companies have
got the mandate from the generalist investor to go on an
acquisition spree any time soon,'' JPMorgan''s Sutton said.
''They always have to consider their pipeline and to consider
the reserve lives of their various commodity exposures. So it
can''t carry on indefinitely, this halt to capex and
acquisitions.'' </p>
<p>The JPMorgan Natural Resources has Rio as its fifth-largest
holding, with a 4.6 percent weighting. </p>

''All of these need to use storage in a big way, and thermal storage is the low-hanging fruit.'' </p> <p>Getting thermal storage to take off has been a slog, though, as building owners don''t want to invest in power savings that will accrue to their tenants, and utilities exempt most customers, especially residential ones, from pricing based on peak demand periods. Without those pricing cues, government tax breaks or subsidies may be needed to boost the use of ice tanks, said Jim Lazar, a utility consultant in Olympia, Washington, who wrote a report on integrating more renewables in the electric grid. </p>

<h2>New York Restaurant Changes Name After Infringement Suit Filed </h2>
<p>Blood  Sand LLC, a Buffalo, New York-based cocktail bar
and restaurant chain, is changing its name one day after the
filing of a trademark suit by a Missouri-based members-only bar
and restaurant with the same name. </p>
<p>In an Aug. 1 posting on its Facebook page, the Buffalo
establishment said that because of ''an unfortunate series of
legal complications,'' the restaurant''s name would be changed.
The restaurant, which is due to open Aug. 15, said it is
soliciting suggestions from the public for a new name. </p>
<p>Blood  Sand, LLC of St. Louis filed the infringement suit
July 30, claiming the New York property''s name infringed and
caused the public to be confused. According to court papers, the
Missouri restaurant registered its name with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. </p>
<p>The case is Blood  Sand, LLC v. Blood  Sand LLC, 4:14-cv-01334, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri (St.

<h2>Copyright </h2>
<h2>Disney Must Face Infringement Claims Over ''Frozen'' Trailer </h2>
<p>The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) failed to persuade a federal court in
San Francisco to dismiss a copyright infringement suit filed by
a California resident who claims a trailer for the movie
''Frozen'' infringes his computer-animated film ''The Snowman.'' </p>
<p>Kelly Wilson of Mill Valley, California, sued Disney March
28, claiming that the ''Frozen'' snowman character Olaf as shown
in the trailer too strongly resembled the snowman in his film,
and that the lot, themes, dialogue, setting, pace, characters
and sequence of events in the Disney film trailer were
''substantially similar'' to his film. </p>
<p>In his July 30 order, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria
said the plot and sequence of events in the Burbank, California-based Disney''s trailer and the Wilson film ''have too much in
common'' for a court to decide that no reasonable juror would
find ''substantial similarity'' of ideas and expression. He did
dismiss Wilson''s claim that the entire ''Frozen'' film infringed
his ''The Snowman.'' </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. won dismissal of
claims by Los Angeles accusing the bank''s Washington Mutual unit
of targeting minority borrowers with predatory loans, while a
judge said the allegations could be refiled against the parent
company. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles ruled that
while claims related to Washington Mutual Inc. were barred, the
city could revise the lawsuit to focus on Chase''s lending
practices during and after JPMorgan bought WaMu in 2008. The
city lumped Chase and WaMu loan information together in the
original complaint and has 21 days to refile the lawsuit
focusing on non-WaMu loans, Wright said. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is one of at least four filed by Los Angeles
against banks for allegedly flooding minority neighborhoods with
subprime mortgages even when residents qualified for better
terms. The city alleged the subprime loans drove up the number
of foreclosures in the city. Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) lost a court bid
in May to dismiss a similar case brought by Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Los Angeles and other cities have explored legal means to
hold banks accountable for urban blight in the wake of the 2008
collapse of the U.S. housing market and financial crisis.
Homeowners in Los Angeles lost about $78.8 billion in home value
as the result of 200,000 foreclosures from 2008 through 2012,
the city said last year, citing a report by Alliance of
Californians for Community Empowerment and the California
Reinvestment Coalition. The lost property tax revenue to the
city has been $481 million, according to the complaints. </p>
<p>''We are pleased with this decision, and we will continue
to carry out our strong commitment to Los Angeles residents,''
Suzanne Ryan, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, said in
an e-mail. </p>
<p>Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for Los Angeles City Attorney
Michael Feuer, said the city is weighing whether to appeal the
ruling. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), becoming as famous for Marvel superheroes as for Mickey Mouse, posted third-quarter profit that beat analysts'' estimates, fueled by box-office hits. </p> <p>Net income rose to $2.25 billion, or $1.28 a share, from $1.85 billion, or $1.01, a year earlier, Burbank, California-based Disney said yesterday in a statement. That beat the $1.16-a-share average of 28 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, had two of the biggest films for the quarter that ended June 30, with Marvel''s ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' and ''Maleficent,'' according to Box Office Mojo. ''Guardians of the Galaxy,'' also from Marvel, opened last weekend with $94.3 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, the best ever for an August release. </p> <p>''People said it came out of nowhere because those characters were not well known,'' Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said of the latest film, in an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday. ''The title was not well known, but the Marvel brand has become something that, at least in the consumer''s eyes, really means something and should be trusted.'' </p> <p>Revenue increased 7.7 percent to $12.5 billion, surpassing the $12.1 billion estimate, Disney said. </p> <h2>''Frozen'' DVDs </h2> <p>Operating income at the film studio more than doubled to $411 million, the biggest gain among the company''s five divisions. ''Frozen,'' the hit 2013 movie, continued to deliver profit in home video and international theaters. </p> <p>Disney''s consumer products unit, which also benefits from Marvel-themed products, posted a 25 percent rise in profit to $273 million, while revenue grew 16 percent. </p> <p>The acquisitions of Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012 has brought to Disney new material to attract teenage boys to its films, as well as characters for its toys, TV networks and theme parks. The film studio is well positioned for at least the next five years, Iger said. </p> <p>The results were strong across most of Disney''s businesses, according to Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst with Barclays Plc. </p> <p>''While the media networks business was roughly in line with our estimates, the company''s parks, studio, consumer products and even interactive businesses showed strength,'' Venkateshwar wrote in a research note. </p> <h2>Theme Parks </h2> <p>Disney gets the bulk of its profit from its TV division. Operating income at the unit, which includes ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channel, was little changed at $2.3 billion, as sports programming costs increased. While ABC earnings increased, profit at the much larger cable operation fell 7 percent because of higher costs at ESPN, the sale of a U.K. unit at ESPN and the shift in the timing of some revenue. </p> <p>Profit at Disney''s parks increased 23 percent to $848 million, with attendance and guest spending up at its domestic resorts. The company raised daily admission prices at its Magic Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida, twice in the past year, to $99 from $89, and benefited from the later Easter holiday, which pulled business into the quarter. Disney also is in the second year of introducing electronic wristbands that make purchases easier in the parks. </p> <p>The interactive unit, which makes video games, reported a profit of $29 million, compared with a year-earlier loss, fueled by sales of the company''s Infinity gaming system. </p> <p>Disney''s shares fell 0.2 percent to $86.59 at the close in New York today, giving them a gain this year of 13 percent. </p> <p>', 'Disney Profit Tops Estimates as Hit Films Spark Studio', 'By Christopher Palmeri', 'Aug 06, 2014  5:06 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-06/disney-profit-tops-estimates-as-hit-films-spark-studio.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Iron ore will extend a drop through
2015 when an increase in seaborne supply that''s spurred a global
glut is set to accelerate, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>While the expansion in supply will probably moderate in the
second half of 2014, the trend rate of growth in seaborne
cargoes exceeds demand by a ratio of three to one, the bank said
in a report dated today. Goldman kept its forecast for the
steelmaking raw material at an average of $80 a metric ton in
2015 from $106 this year. </p>
<p>Prices have tumbled 29 percent in 2014 as companies from
Rio Tinto Group to BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) increased output, betting
higher volumes will more than offset falling prices. Deutsche
Bank AG and Morgan Stanley see lower rates through 2016.
Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. has said it''s completed a $9.2
billion expansion to boost annual output to 155 million tons. </p>
<p>''The shift to oversupply started barely six months ago and
the adjustment phase is far from over,'' said Goldman analysts
Christian Lelong and Amber Cai. ''Seaborne supply is set to
accelerate again in 2015 while Chinese steel production growth
slows further.'' </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Tianjin increased
0.4 percent to $95.90 a dry ton today, according to data from
The Steel Index Ltd. Prices entered a bear market in March and
dropped to $89 on June 16, the lowest level since September
2012. China buys 67 percent of global seaborne supply. </p>
<h2>Labor Dispute </h2>
<p>While mining companies plan to boost shipments, a labor
dispute over leave and wages threatens to disrupt cargoes at
Australia''s Port Hedland, the world''s largest bulk terminal.
Tugboat engineers intend to strike for four hours each on Aug.
9, Aug. 11 and Aug. 13, says Teekay Shipping (Australia) Pty,
which is contracted by BHP Billiton Ltd. to tow vessels. </p>
<p>The action would mean that ''half of the day''s shipping is
lost,'' Ian Roper, a Singapore-based analyst at CLSA Ltd., said
by phone, estimating the strike would disrupt about 2.2 million
tons of supply. ''That''s not a great amount. Fundamental wise,
there''s still an awful lot of supply.'' </p>
<p>Fortescue and BHP estimate such a disruption may cost users
about $93 million a day. Port Hedland shipments made up 55
percent of Australia''s total ore exports last year and about a
quarter of global seaborne trade, Bloomberg calculations based
on Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics data show. Iron ore
is the country''s biggest export earner. </p>
<h2>High Tide </h2>
<p>Given the short duration of the stoppages and the glut, the
strike will probably not materially impact the seaborne market
or prices, Morgan Stanley said in a report today. If conducted
at high tide, each four-hour stoppage could affect as much as
500,000 tons, or 1.5 percent of monthly volumes, analysts
including Joel Crane said. </p>
<p>The outlook from Goldman contrasts with the view from
Westpac Banking Corp.''s senior economist Justin Smirk, who said
prices will rally and peak at $123 in the second quarter. </p>
<p>''We are likely to see softer near-term growth in ore
supply overall as Chinese and other sources of ore moderate
production,'' Smirk wrote in a report today. ''Any near-term
upside surprise in demand will be a positive for prices.'' </p>
<p>Iron ore rose in July for a second straight month on
speculation that China''s demand for imports was improving,
helping to absorb a global surplus as local supplies in the
largest buyer are displaced. </p>
<p>Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. predicted a dramatic recovery in
prices in second half, saying that it''s now cheaper for steel
mills in China to buy seaborne supply rather than domestic
material. Citigroup Inc. said in June prices will rebound as the
daily closure of mines supplying high-cost output in China
boosts demand for seaborne shipments. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OAO Rosneft (ROSN),
the world''s largest publicly traded oil companies by output,
will start drilling a $700 million well in the Arctic Ocean
today, undeterred by the crisis in U.S.-Russian relations. </p>
<p>Vladimir Putin, Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, who''s subject to U.S. sanctions, and Exxon''s Russia head
Glenn Waller will bless the start of Russia''s northernmost well,
the government said yesterday. It''s the first step in a quest
for new oil resources to help maintain oil production near a
post-Soviet high of more than 10 million barrels a day. </p>
<p>The European Union imposed a third round of sanctions last
week, restricting the export of equipment used for offshore oil
production to Russia after its relations with Europe and the
U.S. deteriorated to the lowest point since the Cold War over
the conflict in Ukraine. That hasn''t stopped Exxon because the
contract to hire the rig was signed before the measures were
announced. </p>
<p>''In the area of oil, the sanctions are more symbolic
perhaps at this stage, but if they remain in place for a long
period then they will have some significant consequences,'' said
John Lough, a London-based associate fellow at Chatham House, a
London-based foreign policy research group. </p>
<p>The partners plan to drill the Universitetskaya prospect
after more than two years of planning. Exxon, where output fell
to a five-year low in the second quarter, isn''t the only western
oil company involved. BP Plc, the U.K.''s second-largest oil
company by value, has an interest through its 20 percent stake
in Rosneft. </p>
<h2>West Alpha </h2>
<p>Universitetskaya is the first of as many as 40 offshore
wells Rosneft plans by 2018 to test the potential of the
unexplored the Arctic Ocean. The geological structure targeted
by the drilling is roughly the size of the city of Moscow and
may contain as many as 9 billion barrels of oil, according to a
presentation on Rosneft''s website. </p>
<p>The West Alpha rig, leased by Exxon from Bermuda-based
Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL), is currently in the Kara Sea about 72 miles off
the coast of Novaya Zemlya, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Drilling will take about 70 days, a period that should be
sufficient to assess the reserves of any discovery, Rosneft''s
head of offshore, Zeljko Runje, said on a call with analysts
last week. The area is relatively free of icebergs, meaning work
is ready to start, he said. </p>
<p>Tensions with Russia will make companies pay more attention
to risk, said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects
Ltd. in London. </p>
<h2>''Ecologically Sensitive'' </h2>
<p>In addition to the political background, drilling in the
Arctic Ocean is controversial because campaigners say it
threatens a unique ecosystem. </p>
<p>''The West Alpha platform is fast becoming the most
controversial oil rig in the world,'' Gustavo Ampugnani, an
Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace, said in an e-mailed statement.
The companies'' plan ''to drill in the ecologically sensitive
Arctic is nothing less than absurd.'' </p>
<p>The Exxon-Rosneft cooperation also includes a $300 million
investment in Russian shale pilot projects, which now risk being

<p>The Securities and Exchange
Commission is reviewing whether conflicts of interest led
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to sell certain investment products to
individual clients, according to a person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>The review is at an early stage, said the person, who asked
to remain anonymous because the inquiry isn''t public. The Wall
Street Journal, in a report on the review earlier today, said
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has conducted a
similar probe into whether JPMorgan inappropriately steered
private-banking clients into its own products. </p>
<p>Banks can capture a greater portion of fees by having
clients invest in their own products. In some cases, they can
also offer better-than-average performance. New York-based
JPMorgan said in February that 80 percent of its fixed-income
assets under management and 81 percent of its equity assets were
in funds that were in the top 40 percent of peers over the
previous 10 years. </p>
<p>''We manage a variety of portfolios based on a client''s
investment objectives, and the mix of solutions varies, is
dynamic and transparent,'' said Darin Oduyoye, a JPMorgan
spokesman. ''Our clients have countless options in selecting
financial providers. They come to JPMorgan because of our long-term investments track record and the depth and breadth of our
platform.'' </p>
<p>Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the SEC, couldn''t be
immediately reached for comment. Bryan Hubbard, an OCC
spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Unit Performance </h2>
<p>Private banking, which caters to wealthy individual
clients, generated more than half of JPMorgan''s $5.73 billion in
asset-management revenue in the first six months of this year.
The unit accounted for $383 billion in assets under management,
or 22 percent of the division''s $1.7 trillion total. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s asset-management business, led by Mary Callahan Erdoes, generated $993 million of net income in the first half
of 2014, the lowest among the largest U.S. bank''s four major
divisions. The unit''s 22 percent return on equity was the
highest of the four. </p>
<p>JPMorgan set aside $669 million for legal expenses in the
second quarter. The lender agreed to pay $23 billion in
penalties and settlements last year, leading to its first
quarterly loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. </p>

<p>IBM''s engineers have come up with a way computer chips can think more like humans. </p> <p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said it''s produced a chip that more closely replicates the way the human brain operates than traditional processors do. The new architecture is better at tasks like image recognition in video data -- which could be a new way to help computers sense movement. On top of that, the chip uses less energy than traditional designs. </p> <p>If the design eventually turns into a product, it could help the processor industry, which is searching for new ways to make its products run computers faster. It''s increasingly turning to new methods of trying to perform multiple tasks at the same time, since traditional designs that simply counted faster have led to overheating. </p> <p>IBM said that traditional computer science, which uses linear logic to process data, is inefficient. Processors basically perform one operation at a time, then react to the result of the previous calculation. The computer chip IBM has developed, described in a paper in the journal Science, has 1 million programmable neurons based on 5.4 billion transistors. Its ''neurosynaptic'' cores can each compute and communicate in parallel, rather than in a row. </p> <p>IBM''s statement on the chip design didn''t contain information about when the technology would go into commercial production or go on sale. </p> <p>The company''s labs are so renowned in the industry that titans like Samsung use its technology for their production. That reputation in research hasn''t translated to a leadership position in the chip business, which is dominated by Intel Corp. </p> <h2>Balancing Needs </h2> <p>IBM has had to balance two distinct needs when it comes to its semiconductor business: having control over chip design to make its hardware products better and more efficient, though wanting to get the money-losing manufacturing unit off its books. The division loses as much as $1.5 billion a year, a person familiar with the matter said in June. </p> <p>The company was willing to pay Globalfoundries Inc. about $1 billion to take the chip-manufacturing unit of its hands -- an offer that was turned down for being $1 billion too short, a person familiar with the talks said this month. </p> <p>', 'IBM Chip Inspired by Human Brain Can Sense Images, Cut Energy', 'By Ian King and Alex Barinka', 'Aug 08, 2014 12:16 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-08/ibm-chip-inspired-by-human-brain-can-sense-images-cut-energy.html') LIMIT 1;

Indianapolis federal court, claiming it selected unsuitable and
poorly-performing investments to further its own financial

and federal securities laws. </p>

the financial products it bought for the church, even as the

<p>     Aug. 13 (Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Chevron has taken
another step away from its renewable-energy efforts, putting a
pair of solar projects at its Kapolei refinery in West Oahu,
Hawaii, on ''indefinite hold.'' </p>
<p>The tabled projects, first reported earlier this week by
Pacific Business News, include a farm of solar panels that would
have spanned almost five acres, supplying as much as 1 megawatt
of electricity to the local utility. Chevron also shelved a
demonstration solar thermal project, which would have covered
about 15 acres and used mirrors to generate steam to help power
the Hawaii refinery. </p>
<p>In recent months, Chevron, the second-biggest oil company in
the U.S., has quietly been pulling back from renewable-energy
endeavors, despite a long-promoted commitment to develop what its
corporate website calls ''newer, cleaner ways to power the world.'' </p>
<p>In May, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that Chevron
shuttered a business unit that had surpassed internal profit
targets by helping to launch large-scale solar and geothermal
power projects. In June, we wrote about the sale of its key
renewable-energy subsidiary, Chevron Energy Solutions, to Oaktree
Capital Management. </p>
<p>Each of the Hawaii projects would have reduced carbon
dioxide emissions by about 5,000 tons and contributed to Hawaii''s
goal of generating 70 percent of its energy from renewable
sources by 2030, according to Chevron''s filings with the state. </p>
<p>Instead, they''re being put on hold as the oil company
focuses its resources on other projects, such as its $54 billion
liquefied natural gas plant in Australia, a company spokesman
told Pacific Business News . </p>
<p>Reached by e-mail, Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson
confirmed that the company has put its Hawaiian solar plants on
hold. </p>
<p>Chevron''s pullback on renewables has come amid increasing
concern that climate change and carbon constraints threaten
fossil-fuel companies. Many organizations, including the
International Energy Agency, estimate that as much as two-thirds
of fossil-fuel reserves will need to remain unburned if the world
is to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change.</p>

<p>InterDigital Inc. (IDCC) lost its patent
case against Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and ZTE Corp. at the U.S. International
Trade Commission, dealing the phone-chip researcher another blow
in its efforts to create a new royalty stream. InterDigital
pledged to appeal. </p>
<p>Nokia phones, now made by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and devices by
ZTE didn''t violate InterDigital patent rights, the ITC said in a
notice today on its website. The commission upheld, with
modifications, June findings from a trade judge who said that
Nokia didn''t infringe one patent and that ZTE didn''t infringe
that patent or two others. </p>
<p>The case -- InterDigital''s third at the ITC -- is part of a
years-long struggle to get royalties on sales of the newest
generations of mobile phones. InterDigital got almost all of its
$325 million in sales last year from patent licensing with
companies such as BlackBerry Ltd. and HTC Corp. Nokia and ZTE
have held out, denying they owe any money. </p>
<p>In 2006, Espoo, Finland-based Nokia agreed to pay
InterDigital $253 million to end a licensing dispute over
earlier phone technology. A year later, InterDigital filed suit
again over technology not covered by the earlier agreement, and
the companies haven''t been able to reach an agreement since. </p>
<p>''The commission''s decision is disappointing, running
contrary to a number of judicial decisions involving, in some
instances, the exact same patents as in this case,''
InterDigital Chief Executive Officer William Merritt said in a
statement. ''We do not feel this decision will have any
meaningful impact on our progress towards our licensing goals.'' </p>
<h2>Microsoft Purchase </h2>
<p>The ITC has been the locus of the fight, because the trade
agency has the power to block imports of products made overseas
that violate U.S. intellectual property rights. The first ITC
case, which InterDigital lost, was revived on appeal and is
scheduled for a new hearing in January. The Wilmington,
Delaware-based company lost a second case in December, which is
on appeal. </p>
<p>Microsoft bought Nokia''s handset business in April and has
told the agency it agreed to assume all of Nokia''s liabilities
and have ''sole control over the defense, including sole
authority to resolve this action.'' Even so, Nokia remains in
the case. </p>
<p>Nokia was accused of infringing a patent for a method to
improve transmissions. ZTE was accused of infringing that patent
as well as two others for mobile-phone technology. ITC Judge
Theodore Essex found that the three patents weren''t infringed. </p>
<h2>Fair Terms </h2>
<p>Separately, the judge ruled that InterDigital hadn''t
fulfilled the requirement of a market in the U.S. for the
patents because there wasn''t a link between the three patents
and any product. The agency''s job is to protect U.S. markets
from unfair trade practices, so patent owners must prove they
have a domestic industry to defend. The commission upheld Essex
on that point. </p>
<p>He did find that InterDigital hadn''t violated its pledge to
license the patents on fair terms, and said that, in some
instances, it''s the company making the products that''s being
unreasonable in licensing talks. The commission took no position
on that part of the judge''s findings, saying the issue of
patents on standardized technology will be considered in the
other case against Nokia that InterDigital has pending. </p>
<p>''InterDigital is trying to block our products based on
patents it openly promised the industry could use at reasonable
rates,'' David Cuddy, a Microsoft spokesman, said in a
statement. ''We''re grateful the commission has now confirmed
that we don''t even use these patents in our products.'' </p>
<h2>Senators'' Letters </h2>
<p>Officials with InterDigital didn''t immediately respond to a
query seeking comment after normal business hours. </p>
<p>The reasoning behind the commission''s decision will be
available after both sides have a chance to redact confidential
information. </p>
<p>Essex recommended that should a violation of InterDigital''s
patent rights be found, the agency issue an import ban and delay
the implementation for six months to limit the effect on
consumers. </p>
<p>U.S. Senators Robert Casey, a Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a
Republican, both representing Pennsylvania, separately wrote to
the agency last month on InterDigital''s behalf. The company was
formerly based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and some of its
almost 300 workers are still in the state. </p>
<p>''Their business model and the future success of their
workers are based on the licenses paid for their innovations
used by equipment manufacturers,'' Toomey wrote. Allowing
companies to infringe patents without paying ''will only deter
companies like InterDigital from taking bets on future research
and development. That cannot be good for American innovation and
job creation.'' </p>

3G and/or 4G Capabilities, 337-868, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). </p>

<p>There are simple exchange-traded
fund strategies (''buy gold'') and more-ambitious exchange-traded fund strategies (''dynamically allocate across a basket
of assets based on historical price momentum and volatility.'') </p>
<p>ALPS Distributors Inc. offers simple ETFs like the U.S. Oil
Fund (strategy: buy oil, basically) as well as the more-ambitious varieties, such as those of the dynamically allocating
persuasion. Except investors weren''t allocating funds to those
ambitious ETFs in a dynamic fashion, even though they were
advertised as a way to gain ''access to Goldman Sachs''
expertise.'' As a result ALPS is euthanizing them. </p>
<p>So here is their obituary: The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder
Index ETF series, an ambitious group of securities that
attempted to outsmart the market by licensing Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. strategies based on historical price momentum,
volatility and correlation, died this month after a lifelong
battle with investor disinterest. They were less than 2 years
old. </p>
<p>None of the four ETFs has more than about $3.4 million in
assets. While not all of them performed terribly, neither did
they perform, uh, dynamically. Which is kind of sad, really, if
you believe in old-fashioned notions like the powers of math and
that the biggest brains on Wall Street can outfox the mailman
who puts his whole 401(k) into the Vanguard 500 Index Fund. </p>
<h2>Wet Screens </h2>
<p>Now, some may shake their fists in the air and curse at a
market perceived to be hypnotized into marching in a straight
line by the magic wand of the Federal Reserve. And maybe that''s
a fair reaction, but at the end of it all you''re left with is
tired fist and maybe some spittle on three or four of your
computer screens. </p>
<p>Anyway, here''s what the back of the baseball cards would
look like for the Goldman-inspired funds (for comparison, note
that the SP 500 -- arguably not the best benchmark to compare
each of these to, but let''s do it anyway --  has returned about
40 percent including dividends since these ETFs started trading
in December 2012): </p>
<p>*The ALPS/GS Risk-Adjusted Return U.S. Large Cap Index ETF (GSRA)
did the best since inception, returning 38 percent, less than
the 41 percent gain in the Russell 1000 Index from which it
picks its stocks. Selection criteria included average analyst
price estimates adjusted by volatility, with sectors showing
lower anticipated risk getting a higher allocation. Its expense
ratio is 0.55 percent, compared with 0.15 percent for the
iShares Russell 1000 ETF. Top holdings: Pharmacyclics Inc.,
Cameron International Corp., Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and
Madison Square Garden Co. (Goldman''s risk modelers are,
presumably, not Knicks fans.) </p>
<h2>Baseball Cards </h2>
<p>*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Multi-Asset Index ETF (GSMA)
returned 9.5 percent since inception and had an expense ratio of
0.68 percent. This is an ''ETF squared'' since it only holds
four other ETFs tracking real-estate, emerging markets stocks,
Treasuries maturing in more than 20 years and Latin American
equities. </p>
<p>*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Growth Markets Equities and
U.S. Treasuries Index ETF. This baseball card will not be a
collector''s item: the fund has returned negative 11 percent
since inception. It holds ETFs tracking stocks in India, Brazil,
Turkey and Indonesia and just a dash (0.2 percent) of long-maturity Treasuries. </p>
<p>*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Asia ex-Japan and U.S.
Treasuries Index ETF lost 2.7 percent on a total-return basis
since inception. </p>
<p>''On consideration of current market conditions, as well as
prospects for growth in the funds'' assets, the board determined
that it was in the best interests of the funds and their
shareholders to liquidate the funds'' shares,'' ALPS said
yesterday in statement. </p>
<p>For sure, the ALPS/GS offerings aren''t the only momentum
funds struggling to catch lightning in a bottle from past high-flying stocks. The $12.4 million SPDR SP 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF (MMTM)
has returned 42 percent since its inception in 2012, which is
pretty sweet but not as sweet as the almost 44 percent return
for the SP 1500 itself. Neither have the $313 million iShares
MSCI USA Momentum Index ETF or the AQR Momentum Fund blown the
doors off large, mid and small-cap benchmarks since their
inceptions. </p>
<p>The 16 U.S. momentum ETFs have a total of $3.7 billion in
assets yet have only taken in $57 million this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The lesson to take away, if it''s not obvious by now, is
that catching lightning in a ETF jar is not easy no matter how
dynamically you allocate. </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>U.S. Banks Said to Get Enforcement Letters in FX-Rigging Probes </h2>
<p>Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
Morgan Stanley (MS) have been notified that regulators are preparing
enforcement actions on currency rigging, people familiar with
the investigation said. </p>
<p>Talks are progressing between banks, the U.S. Federal
Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to
settle investigations into alleged manipulation of foreign-exchange markets, according to two people who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. Some firms have
received so-called 15-day letters outlining the agencies''
findings and warning that enforcement actions are likely, the
people said. </p>
<p>Enforcement actions can range from cease-and-desist orders
to fines to banning bankers from the industry. The letters
typically detail the investigators'' findings and give recipients
about 15 days to offer a written defense. Such notices usually
open a final stage of settlement negotiations. </p>
<p>U.S. regulators are coordinating with the U.K.''s Financial
Conduct Authority to settle some of the probes by November,
according to two people. The FCA is in settlement talks with
firms including Barclays Plc, Citigroup, HSBC Holdings Plc,
JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and UBS AG. It
scheduled meetings with some banks for as soon as next month to
discuss penalties, the people said. </p>

<h2>Corinthian Subpoenaed for Records on Student Outcomes, Debt </h2>
<p>Corinthian Colleges Inc. (COCO), the for-profit chain in the
process of selling or shutting its campuses, received a federal
grand jury subpoena seeking records on student-loan defaults and
job placement. </p>
<p>The Aug. 8 subpoena also seeks information on graduation
rates, the transferability of student credits and marketing
materials, according to a regulatory filing yesterday. </p>
<p>Corinthian, which served about 72,000 students as of last
month when it agreed to a government plan to shut down or sell
its 107 campuses, is facing allegations in multiple states of
falsifying job placement and marketing data. The Santa Ana,
California-based company is evaluating the subpoena and intends
to cooperate fully with the request, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Corinthian''s downfall accelerated in June when the U.S.
Education Department imposed a 21-day waiting period for it to
draw on the federal student aid that accounts for almost all its
revenue. </p>
<p>''There can be no assurance that the company will be able
to obtain any such additional needed liquidity on a timely
basis, on terms acceptable to it, or at all,'' Corinthian said
in yesterday''s filing. </p>
<h2>Barclays Seen Facing $2 Billion More in 2014 Conduct Charges </h2>
<p>Barclays Plc (BARC) faces costs of as much as 1.2 billion pounds
($2 billion) for its alleged rigging of currency markets, lying
to clients about its U.S. dark pool and mis-selling interest-rate swaps, Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. said. </p>
<p>The U.K.''s second-largest lender may incur a 700 million-pound charge to settle a foreign-exchange probe with regulators
and a further 200 million pounds relating to a U.S.
investigation into its private-trading venue, Chirantan Barua,
an analyst at Bernstein in London, said in a note yesterday. The
bank might reach settlements by the end of 2014, he said. </p>
<p>Barclays is part of a group of banks in talks with the
U.K.''s Financial Conduct Authority to reach a settlement in the
currency-rigging probe, while fighting a U.S. lawsuit accusing
it of falsifying marketing materials to hide the presence of
high-frequency traders in its dark pool. </p>
<p>The scandals are undermining Chief Executive Officer Antony
Jenkins''s attempts to reform the culture of a bank after it was
fined 290 million pounds in 2012 for rigging the Libor benchmark
interest rate. </p>
<p>London-based Barclays may also set aside 300 million pounds
in the second half to compensate customers improperly sold
interest-rate hedging products, Barua estimates. The bank didn''t
make further provisions for redress in the first half. </p>
<p>Other British lenders are also struggling with rising
provisions for misconduct. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Britain''s largest state-owned lender, may face as much as 1
billion pounds in charges to settle the allegations of currency
market manipulation, Barua wrote in an separate Aug. 11 report. </p>

<h2>Paul Singer Gets OK to Follow Argentina Money Trail to Nevada </h2>
<p>Billionaire Paul Singer, the hedge fund founder seeking to
collect on more than $1.5 billion in judgments over Argentina''s
defaulted bonds, may search Nevada for some of that money, a
judge ruled. </p>
<p>Singer asked a Las Vegas court in April to order 123
companies in Nevada to turn over information about assets
belonging to Argentine businessman Lazaro Baez, who is accused
in that country of embezzling $65 million from government
contracts. U.S. Magistrate Judge Cam Ferenbach in Reno granted
that request Aug. 11, ruling that Singer''s hedge fund was
attempting to execute a valid judgment against Argentina. </p>
<p>''There is no doubt that the 123 companies are shell
corporations,'' Ferenbach said in an order. ''Similarly, there
is no doubt that shell corporations are routinely formed to
commit fraud.'' </p>
<p>Singer''s decade-long quest to recoup on investments in
Argentina''s debt peaked last month when the country went into
default for the second time in 13 years after talks broke down
with some creditors. Singer leads a group of hedge funds owed
more than $1.5 billion from the country''s 2001 default. A
federal judge in New York barred Argentina from paying on
restructured debt until it satisfies Singer''s group. </p>
<p>In his order, Ferenbach wrote that Argentina''s failure so
far to satisfy judgments won by Singer''s NML Capital has caused
the company to ''travel the globe in search of property owned by
Argentina.'' </p>

<h2>Interviews </h2>
<h2>Amazon''s Prices Seen Holding Regulators at Bay in Hachette Spat </h2>
<p>Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)''s treatment of customers means more to U.S.
antitrust authorities than how the largest Web retailer
pressures publishers and movie studios. </p>
<p>Typically it''s seen as a good thing for a retailer to
pressure suppliers to trim prices, as that can lead to better
deals for shoppers, David Balto, a former policy director at the
Federal Trade Commission, said in an interview with Bloomberg
News. </p>
<p>''The antitrust cops clearly would be on Amazon''s
doorstep'' if it was also pushing those suppliers to charge
competing retailers more, he said. Successfully going after
Amazon at this stage ''would be breaking new territory under the
antitrust laws.'' </p>
<p>That hasn''t damped debate about the tactics Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Bezos is using against Hachette Book Group, Walt
Disney Co. and film studio Warner Bros. The question is whether
he''s pushing Amazon toward the same monopolistic territory that
tripped up Microsoft Corp., Standard Oil and ATT Inc. </p>
<p>''They are getting very close to the line,'' said Joseph
Tabacco, a former senior trial lawyer at the Justice Department
who has worked on federal monopoly and price-fixing cases
against mining, electronics and pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) said more
negotiations are required with multiple U.S. government agencies
as the Chinese company seeks approval for more than $5 billion
in planned acquisitions. </p>
<p>Lenovo still believes it can close the $2.3 billion
purchase of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)''s low-end
server unit and the $2.91 billion purchase of Google Inc. (GOOG)''s
Motorola Mobility unit this year as planned, Chief Executive
Officer Yang Yuanqing said in a phone interview today. </p>
<p>''We are making progress, but we definitely still have some
things to do with multiple government agencies,'' Yang said
without elaborating on the remaining issues. </p>
<p>The IBM deal was expected to spark a close review partly
because U.S. agencies, including the Defense Department and the
Department of Homeland Security, buy the IBM servers, according
to Bloomberg Intelligence. Lenovo and IBM, seeking more time for
a U.S. national-security review, in June resubmitted the deal
for examination by an interagency panel, a person familiar with
the matter said at the time. </p>
<p>''The IBM and Motorola deals are important for Lenovo,
especially for growth beyond fiscal 2016,'' said Stephen Yang, a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial. ''All parties
are hoping for calendar year-end closure, but there is always a
risk that regulators could stretch it out.'' </p>
<h2>CFIUS Review </h2>
<p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. examines
acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign investors to determine
the effects on national security, with a standard inquiry taking
75 days. Lenovo said in June the companies were still on track
to complete the deal by year''s end. </p>
<p>Lenovo was successful in getting CFIUS approval in 2005 for
an earlier deal, in which the Chinese company acquired IBM''s
personal-computer unit for $1.25 billion. </p>
<p>Review of the latest IBM purchase, which was announced in
January, comes amid heightened tension between the U.S. and
China over cybersecurity. In May, the U.S. accused five Chinese
military officials of stealing trade secrets and other
information from American companies. </p>
<p>The server purchase would add a business with wider profit
margins than PCs and give Lenovo about 14 percent of that
market, the company has said. The Motorola deal would add an
established mobile phone brand in developed markets, including
the U.S. </p>
<p>''With the Motorola deal, we will become a global player in
the smartphone area,'' Yang said in the interview today. ''The
IBM deal is equally important to our enterprise business or even
more important because that gives us a very strong foundation,
very strong customer base, very good technology and a good
team.'' </p>
<h2>Profit Rise </h2>
<p>Yang spoke today after the company reported net income
surged 23 percent to $213.5 million in the three months ended
June. That beat the $197.3 million average of eight analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sales climbed to $10.4 billion in the period from $8.79
billion a year earlier, Lenovo said. </p>
<p>Yang has kept the company growing by winning market share
in PCs as he expands the smartphone and tablet-computer
businesses. Lenovo is moving beyond its home base of China by
targeting growth in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. </p>
<p>''Looks like strength everywhere -- their emerging markets
business in both smartphones and PCs seemed relatively strong,''
said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in
Hong Kong. ''The PC contraction is now heading into the late
stages, and Lenovo is driving the consolidation to its
advantage.'' </p>
<h2>PC Share </h2>
<p>Lenovo, which has its headquarters in Beijing and
Morrisville, North Carolina, fell 1.4 percent in Hong Kong,
while the benchmark Hang Seng Index declined 0.4 percent. The
stock has gained 19 percent this year. </p>
<p>While industrywide global PC shipments gained 0.1 percent
in the three months ended June, Lenovo posted a 15 percent
increase, researcher Gartner Inc. reported last month. Global PC
shipments are projected to decline 2.9 percent this year,
following a 9.5 percent drop last year, according to Gartner. </p>
<p>Lenovo''s smartphone shipments jumped 39 percent in the
period to 15.8 million units, researcher International Data
Corp. reported last month. That lifted its global market share
for the devices to 5.4 percent from 4.7 percent a year earlier,
IDC said. </p>
<p>''The company beat estimates with strong product shipments
as their PC sales outpaced the global average,'' Ricky Lai, an
analyst at Guotai Junan International Holdings Limited in Hong
Kong, said by phone today after results. ''The smartphone
business is also showing very strong growth in the second
quarter.'' </p>
<h2>Online Sales </h2>
<p>Lenovo passed Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) as China''s smartphone
market leader for the first time, Yang said, citing data from
IDC. Still, increased competition from domestic peers including
Xiaomi Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. are increasing
competition in China. </p>
<p>Lenovo will adopt more of the online distribution strategy
favored by Xiaomi, using Lenovo''s websites and e-commerce
platforms run by JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA),
Yang said. </p>
<p>''China is a very chaotic market and the top three are very
close,'' Yang said in the interview. ''The current competitive
situation is hard for everyone to make money. For mobile phones,
our focus is outside of China, particularly emerging markets.'' </p>
<p>Lenovo ranks No. 4 globally in smartphone shipments, behind
Samsung, Apple Inc. and Huawei, respectively, IDC said. Lenovo
will look to Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America
for growth, Yang said in the interview. </p>
<p>''Lenovo is doing very well on the mobile side,'' Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, an analyst at JI Asia in Hong Kong, said
before the results were announced. ''They have a rapidly growing
business in terms of sales, although it''s still not growing as
much in terms of profit.'' </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) won the backing of a key
U.S. advisory panel to recommend its vaccine Prevnar 13 for
people ages 65 and older to help prevent infections including
pneumonia and meningitis. </p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''s Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, voted 13-2
yesterday to add Prevnar 13 to a list of recommended vaccines
that includes Merck  Co.''s Pneumovax 23. The committee plans to
revisit the recommendation in 2018. </p>
<p>The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
requires insurance companies to cover vaccines recommended by
ACIP without asking patients to pay a share. With $3.97 billion
in sales last year, the inoculation is New York-based Pfizer''s
second-best selling product. </p>
<p>The advisory panel considered a clinical trial Pfizer
conducted on 85,000 patients who received either the company''s
vaccine or a placebo. Among those who got Prevnar 13, there were
46 percent fewer first episodes of community-acquired pneumonia
than among the placebo group. </p>
<p>People 65 and older who haven''t received Pneumovax 23 would
get a dose of Prevnar 13, followed by Pneumovax 23. Those who
have been immunized with Pneumovax 23 would get a shot of
Prevnar 13. </p>
<p>Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and
disabled, would immediately cover Prevnar 13. However, it may
take more than a year for the program to determine whether to
pay for a following dose of Pneumovax 23 in patients who had
never been immunized, the panel said. </p>
<h2>Expanded Use </h2>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration first approved Prevnar 13
for use in children in 2010, then added adults age 50 and older
in 2011. It is already recommended for routine use in children
younger than age 5 and people with compromised immune systems
caused by conditions such as cancer, AIDS and advanced kidney
disease. Merck''s related vaccine, Pneumovax 23, was approved
more than 30 years ago. </p>
<p>Both therapies are approved to prevent infections from
pneumococcus bacteria that can cause pneumonia, meningitis and
blood and ear infections, according to the CDC. About 900,000
Americans get pneumococcal pneumonia each year and as many as 7
percent die, the CDC said. About 90 percent of cases are adults. </p>

<p>James Schiro, who led Zurich
Financial Services AG through the credit crisis and became
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s lead independent director, has died.
He was 68. </p>
<p>He died on Aug. 13, according to an e-mail sent today to
employees of New York-based Goldman Sachs by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn. Schiro
died of multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, at his home in
Princeton, New Jersey. </p>
<p>In 2002, Schiro became CEO of Zurich Financial Services,
which had been the worst-performing European insurance stock the
previous year. Under his leadership, the company returned to
profitability, and Barron''s magazine included him in its Top CEO
list in 2008 and 2009. The company, Switzerland''s biggest
insurer, changed its name to Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) in 2012. </p>
<p>Following his retirement from Zurich Financial in 2009,
Schiro joined Goldman Sachs''s board and in 2012 was named lead
director and chairman of the Corporate Governance, Nominating
and Public Responsibilities Committee, according to the bank''s
biography. He retired last month to undergo medical treatment
for his disease. </p>
<p>''Jim was an outstanding board member and an exceptional
individual who made an invaluable contribution to our firm and
to all those who worked with him,'' Blankfein and Cohn wrote.
''We will remember him for his unfailing commitment to Goldman
Sachs and to our shareholders and for the example he set as a
leader and mentor.'' </p>
<h2>''Navigate Uncertainties'' </h2>
<p>He also served as a director at PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), based in
Purchase, New York, and Royal Philips Electronics NV, located in
Amsterdam. </p>
<p>''Jim will be remembered as one of the finest business
leaders of our generation,'' Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, said
today in an e-mailed statement. ''He could see beyond the
horizon and set a vision for the future, yet he also had the
discipline, focus and agility to navigate uncertainties along
the way. He was as respected for his knowledge and intellect as
he was for his character and integrity.'' </p>
<p>James J. Schiro was born on Jan. 2, 1946, in Brooklyn, New
York, one of two children born to Joseph and Mary Schiro. He
attended a local school, St. John''s University, on a scholarship
from the Knights of Columbus and Citibank, graduating in 1967.
He received a master''s in business administration from Dartmouth
University, according to the Goldman Sachs (GS) biography. </p>
<p>In 1967 Schiro joined Price Waterhouse and held various
positions, including managing partner of the New York office
from 1991 to 1995. He rose to chairman of Price Waterhouse and
when the firm merged with Coopers  Lybrand in 1998, he served
as CEO of New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, one of the
world''s four biggest accounting firms. He retired in 2001. </p>
<p>Survivors include his wife of 46 years, Tomasina; their
children, Justine and James Jr.; and a granddaughter, Elisabeth. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) cleared a U.S. national-security review for the sale of
its low-end server business to China''s Lenovo Group Ltd. (992),
letting the $2.3 billion transaction go forward even amid
tensions between the two nations. </p>
<p>The conclusion of the review by the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, is ''good news for both IBM
and Lenovo, and for our customers and employees,'' Armonk, New
York-based IBM said yesterday in a statement. While Cfius placed
some conditions on the deal, they don''t significantly affect the
business, and terms of the transaction didn''t change as result,
a person with knowledge of the matter said, without specifying
the conditions. </p>
<p>The sale drew scrutiny because of disputes between China
and the U.S., the world''s two largest economies, over
cyberintrusions. By completing the deal, IBM can jettison a less
profitable business to focus on growing areas, such as cloud
computing and data analytics, while giving Lenovo a bigger piece
of the global computing-hardware market. </p>
<p>''This is part of IBM''s process moving away from hardware
manufacturing to a more service-oriented product line and more
profitable product lines,'' Ivan Feinseth, chief investment
officer at Tigress Financial Partners LLC, said in an interview.
''They are trying to change the direction they are going.'' He
has a neutral rating on IBM stock. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for IBM and Lenovo declined to comment on whether
the Cfius clearance included any requirements or concessions.
Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which
leads Cfius, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Essentially Commodities </h2>
<p>The IBM servers, known as x86 for the type of chips they
use, link computers on corporate networks and are essentially
commodities in the information technology world, Christopher Padilla, IBM''s vice president for governmental programs, said in
January. Most of IBM''s x86 servers are made in Shenzhen, China,
he said. </p>
<p>The clearance of the national-security review may also bode
well for Lenovo''s separate $2.91 billion purchase of Google
Inc.''s Motorola Mobility unit. </p>
<p>''We continue to work through a number of regulatory and
business processes to ensure an effective and timely closure on
both deals,'' Lenovo, which has its headquarters in Beijing and
Morrisville, North Carolina, said in a statement. ''We remain on
track to close both deals by the end of the year.'' </p>
<h2>Maintenance Continues </h2>
<p>U.S. agencies, including the Defense Department and the
Department of Homeland Security, buy the IBM servers, according
to Bloomberg Intelligence. The companies were able to head off a
lot of government concerns on the x86 deal because IBM has
agreed to continue maintenance on existing servers for five
years, said the person with knowledge of the matter, who asked
not to be identified because the process was private. </p>
<p>The Cfius review took 150 days to complete, with the
companies forced to resubmit the transaction after an initial
75-day investigation expired, the person said. Cfius asked
hundreds of questions during the probe, primarily focusing on
maintenance of installed IBM servers and Lenovo''s access to
them, while also paying heed to heightened concern and scrutiny
about any Chinese transaction in the U.S. technology sector, the
person said. </p>
<p>Cfius examines acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign
investors to determine the effects on national security. The
U.S. on May 19 accused five Chinese military officials of
stealing trade secrets and other information from American
companies. </p>
<h2>More Examination </h2>
<p>Lenovo was successful in getting Cfius approval in 2005 for
an earlier deal, in which the Chinese company acquired IBM''s
personal-computer unit for $1.25 billion. </p>
<p>Cfius examined more than double the number of transactions
by Chinese investors in 2012 than it did the previous year,
making them the most scrutinized foreign buyers of American
assets ahead of the U.K., according to the committee''s most
recent report to Congress. </p>
<p>Lenovo had agreed to pay a fee more than double the typical
size should it fail to acquire IBM''s low-end server unit, people
familiar with the matter said in January. The breakup charge of
about $200 million, according to one of the people, highlights
the risk the Chinese company has chosen to bear for its largest-ever purchase. </p>

<p>Lowe''s Cos. (LOW) is seeking acquisitions
in Brazil, two people with knowledge of the matter said, in a
move that would help it penetrate a fragmented industry to take
advantage of a growing pool of home owners. </p>
<p>Lowe''s is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as it
searches for targets, said the people, who asked not to be
identified discussing private information. </p>
<p>Options for the Mooresville, North Carolina-based company
include buying part of BR Home Centers, the home-improvement
holding company valued at about 500 million reais ($220.1
million) that is working with Rothschild to study strategic
options, one of the people said. Also exploring a sale is
Curitiba-based Balaroti Materiais de Construcao SA, which is
working with Morgan Stanley, according to the person. </p>
<p>While Lowe''s and rival Home Depot Inc. have built a
presence in Mexico, the U.S. construction-materials super stores
have yet to expand into most of Latin America. An acquisition in
Brazil would have Lowe''s entering a market where the formal
home-improvement industry still competes with corner hardware
stores, even as rising incomes present compelling prospects for
sales. </p>
<p>Although economic growth is slowing this year, retailers
still see a market in which tens of millions of Brazilians
entered the middle class in the past decade. The government has
also encouraged home ownership with its low-income housing
initiative dubbed Minha Casa, Minha Vida -- or My Home, My Life
-- which has delivered more than a million homes, with more on
the way. </p>

<p>South Korea''s record current-account
surplus will boost the won to levels prior to the 2008 global
credit crisis, JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Seoul branch manager said. </p>
<p>The won will climb past 1,000 per dollar as local equities
attract inflows, Managing Director Lee Sung Hee said in an Aug.
14 interview, without specifying a timeframe. The U.S. bank''s
Singapore-based strategist Daniel Hui predicts a 1.8 percent
gain to 1,000 by end-December. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 31 analysts is for a 0.7 percent decline to
1,025 in the same period. </p>
<p>The currency has advanced 3.1 percent this year as global
funds pumped $27.7 billion into South Korean bonds and stocks.
The central bank last month raised its 2014 forecast for the
current-account excess to an unprecedented $84 billion from $68
billion. The Bank of Korea''s decision last week to lower
borrowing costs in support of the government''s efforts to revive
economic growth won''t deter capital inflows, Lee said. </p>
<p>''It would be difficult for the won to weaken given a
current-account surplus of this size,'' Lee, who is also
JPMorgan''s head of global emerging markets in Korea, said in his
office in Seoul. ''Gains in the stock market will spur inflows,
adding appreciation pressure on the won.'' </p>
<p>The won rose 0.3 percent from Aug. 14 to 1,017.75 per
dollar as of 12:19 p.m. in Seoul, according to prices from local
banks. Korean financial markets were closed for a public holiday
on Aug. 15. The currency rallied 0.8 percent on Aug. 14, the
most since April, as the central bank cut its key interest rate. </p>
<h2>Currency Forecasts </h2>
<p>The nation''s currency last traded at 1,000 per dollar in
July 2008, before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
bankruptcy, triggering a crisis in global credit markets. </p>
<p>Hui, the JPMorgan strategist, predicts that after reaching
1,000 by September, the won will remain at that level through
the end of 2014 before climbing to 995 by March and to 985 in
June. The median forecasts in the Bloomberg survey are for the
currency to reach 1,020 in the first quarter of 2015 and 1,017
in the second. </p>
<p>South Korea''s finance ministry unveiled a 11.7 trillion won
($11.5 billion) spending program on July 24 after cutting its
2014 growth forecast to 3.7 percent from 3.9 percent. The
ministry plans to encourage companies to boost dividend payouts. </p>
<p>''One of the government''s policy goals is to raise the
wealth effect by boosting prices of asset such as equities,''
JPMorgan''s Lee said. </p>
<p>The benchmark Kospi (KOSPI) index of shares gained 2.7 percent this
quarter, more than the 1.5 percent increase in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of regional equities. </p>
<h2>Stimulus Measures </h2>
<p>The central bank reduced its key interest rate from 2.5
percent to 2.25 percent on Aug. 14, the first cut since May
2013. The move will help boost the effectiveness of the
government''s stimulus, Governor Lee Ju Yeol said the same day. </p>
<p>The fiscal spending package, along with the central bank''s
policy easing, will encourage foreign inflows by supporting
growth and boosting equities, Morgan Stanley strategists
including Geoffrey Kendrick in Hong Kong wrote in an Aug. 14
report. </p>
<p>Lower borrowing costs won''t discourage overseas bond
investors as central banks and sovereign wealth funds tend to
focus on long-term economic fundamentals, according to the
report. Global central banks accounted for 42 percent of foreign
investment in South Korean bonds as of end-2013, data from the
finance ministry show. </p>
<h2>Volatility Seen </h2>
<p>While the won will appreciate over the long term, the
currency may face increased volatility due to geopolitical
tension in Ukraine and slower economic growth in Europe,
according to JPMorgan''s Lee. </p>
<p>One-month implied volatility in the won, a gauge of
expected swings in the exchange rate used to price options, has
risen 125 basis points, or 1.25 percentage points, this quarter
to 5.90 percent today. </p>
<p>''A certain amount of foreign-exchange volatility can be
beneficial to traders and companies,'' Lee said. ''Too little
volatility tends to lead to overreactions by investors if the
exchange rate moves beyond a certain range.'' </p>

In each pairing, the aerospace-military group beat the broader index, which also included the Standard  Poor''s 500 and FTSE Eurotop 100. </p> <p>''Since we expect the defense theme to become a long-term secular theme in the Japanese market, we see scope for improved relative performance ahead for related stocks,'' Goldman Sachs analysts led by Chief Japan Equity Strategist Kathy Matsui said last week in a research note to unveil the gauge. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. are among the component stocks. </p> <p>Boosting Japan''s military capabilities has been one of the focuses of the Abe government, amid a territorial dispute with an increasingly assertive China. In 2013 Abe increased the defense budget for the first time in 11 years, and this year relaxed an effective ban on defense exports. Even with the changes, defense spending will account for less than 1 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 4 percent in the U.S. and 1.3 percent in China, according to estimates by Japan''s Ministry of Defense. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) abandoned
its bid to get a U.K. court to throw out a $1 billion lawsuit by
the Libyan Investment Authority that alleged the New York-based
bank made about $350 million selling it investments that turned
out to be worthless. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had asked a London judge in April to decide
that the case didn''t have a realistic chance of success and to
issue a so-called summary judgment dismissing the suit, the
sovereign wealth fund said in a statement today. The bank has
withdrawn the request, LIA said. </p>
<p>The ''application was misconceived and issued purely for
tactical reasons, including a desire to delay the determination
of the LIA''s claims,'' the fund said. </p>
<p>Libya''s sovereign wealth fund is one of dozens of small
companies and government agencies that have sued lenders over
deals the investors claim were too complicated to understand. It
also sued Societe Generale SA (GLE) in a $1.5 billion lawsuit, saying
that the French bank paid about $58 million to a friend of the
Qaddafi family to secure investments. </p>
<p>''We continue to believe this case is entirely without
merit and intend to contest it vigorously as it moves through
the legal process,'' Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>A London court hearing is scheduled to take place in early
October, the fund said. </p>
<p>The case is: The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman
Sachs International, case no. 14-310, High Court of Justice,
Chancery Division. </p>

<p>Argentina''s plan to pay holders of foreign bonds from local accounts looks doomed to fail even before it gets off the ground given concern that investors who participate could be held in contempt of a U.S. court ruling, according to KBC Asset Management SAD and JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p> <p>''This might be a dream for Argentina,'' said Olivier De Timmerman, an emerging-market portfolio manager at KBC in Luxembourg. ''I am quite doubtful that this will go into something concrete because I don''t think current holders would like to be in contempt of a U.S. court. This will be a lengthy process and it will be quite messy.'' </p> <p>Bonds fell the most in two weeks today after President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced a plan last night that is in direct conflict with orders by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa that forbid such a transaction. Her proposal, which also would let overseas debt holders swap into new dollar-denominated bonds governed by domestic law, aims to sidestep a ruling by Griesa that the nation must pay $1.5 billion to holders of debt defaulted on in 2001 or reach a settlement before resuming payments on restructured notes. </p> <p>Analysts and investors at BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan, Adelante Asset Management Ltd. and Fideuram Asset Management all cast doubt on the chances of success for Fernandez''s proposal. </p> <p>''Given NY court orders, financial intermediaries with U.S. footprints are unlikely to collaborate in the process,'' Vladimir Werning, an economist at JPMorgan in New York, said in a note to clients. </p> <h2>Bond Limbo </h2> <p>The country''s benchmark restructured bonds due in 2033 fell 2.34 cents to 80.4 cents on the dollar as of 4 p.m. in New York. The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 8.3233 per dollar. </p> <p>Holders of Argentina''s $30 billion of overseas bonds have been in limbo since Griesa blocked the nation''s attempt to pay $539 million in interest due by July 30. His ruling was intended to compel Argentina to negotiate with hedge funds led by billionaire Paul Singer''s Elliott Management Corp. that refused to provide debt relief by swapping bonds from the country''s 2001 default and successfully sued for full repayment. </p> <p>On June 20, Griesa said that the nation is prohibited from paying the overseas bonds in Argentina. Any intermediaries assisting in the process could be sued for contempt of court, while investors who aren''t able to hold local bonds would have to sell their holdings. </p> <p>Terms of the swap probably won''t be favorable to holders of longer-dated debt, but restructured notes due in 2017 should be ''pretty easy to swap,'' said Jim Craige, who helps oversee $65 billion of assets at Stone Harbor, including the Argentine notes due in 2017. </p> <h2>Flouting Orders </h2> <p>Stephen Spruiell, a spokesman for New York-based Elliott, declined to comment. Aurelius Capital Management LP, another plaintiff in the case, said Fernandez''s proposal is further evidence that the government is choosing to flout the law. </p> <p>''They have chronically flouted U.S. court orders, lied to our courts, and proclaimed utter disdain for our courts,'' Aurelius said in a statement. ''These officials are now ''doubling down'' on an illicit and failed approach.'' </p> <p>Holders of bonds governed by New York law are unlikely to want to particulate in a swap, according to Emanuele Del Monte, who helps oversee $1.7 billion in assets as money manager at Fideuram Asset Management in Dublin. </p> <p>''The swap that Argentina wants to propose does nothing to normalize the relationship between the government and investors,'' he said in an e-mail. ''It''s going to be very difficult to execute the exchange. </p> <h2>SP </h2> <p>There''s too little information about the swap to know if it''s a good deal for bondholders, Gabriel Torres, an analyst at Moody''s Investors Service, said in a telephone interview. John Piecuch, a spokesman at Standard  Poor''s, declined to comment. </p> <p>Daniel Pollack, a court-appointed mediator for talks between Argentina and the holdouts, declined to comment on Argentina''s plan. </p> <p>U.S.-based investors may be wary of taking part in the swap over concern they will be held in contempt of court, according to Casey Reckman, an economist at Credit Suisse. </p> <p>Economy Minister Axel Kicillof said today the bill''s main objective is to change the payment location rather than change legislation. Bondholders will find ways to receive their money via the account in Buenos Aires, he said. </p> <p>''''No one''s going to have to take a plane,'' Kicillof told reporters. ''These days even your gas and electricity bills can be paid by the Internet. We''re not going to have an influx of bond tourists coming to get paid.'' </p> <p>', 'Argentine Bond Swap More Dream Than Real for KBC', 'By Ye Xie, Katia Porzecanski and Camila Russo', 'Aug 20, 2014  5:22 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-20/argentine-bond-swap-more-dream-than-reality-for-kbc-to-jpmorgan.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Steve Ballmer resigned from
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s board, eight months after his departure as
chief executive officer, ending more than three decades of
direct involvement in the world''s largest software maker. </p>
<p>Ballmer, 58, remains Microsoft''s top individual
shareholder. He had initially remained as a director after
handing the top job over to one of his deputies, Satya Nadella,
in February. Ballmer recently bought the Los Angeles Clippers
for $2 billion and appeared in front of the team and fans this
week, vowing to lift the team to ''higher heights'' and
promising not to micromanage. </p>
<p>The former CEO''s departure ends a 34-year association with
Microsoft, which he led as CEO from 2000 to February 2014.
Revenue tripled under Ballmer''s tenure, even as the Redmond,
Washington-based company struggled to compete with Apple Inc.
and Google Inc. in areas such as mobile phones, tablet computers
and Internet search. </p>
<p>''I want to be a great shareholder and I want to pay
appropriate attention to my shares but between teaching classes
and my new responsibilities at the Clippers and my civic duties,
it''s a lot,'' Ballmer said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>The former CEO, who dropped out of Stanford University''s
business school in 1980 to become Microsoft''s 30th employee,
will return to the graduate school this fall to teach a course
in strategic management, and also teach a class at the
University of Southern California next year. </p>
<h2>Board Changes </h2>
<p>Ballmer''s exit is the latest change to Microsoft''s board.
Last month, Microsoft named longtime wireless executive John Stanton to the board. In March, director Steve Luczo stepped
down and in February, co-founder Bill Gates stepped aside as
chairman to be replaced by lead independent director John Thompson. The board also added activist investor Mason Morfit of
ValueAct Holdings LP to its ranks this year. </p>
<p>In a letter to Nadella that was posted on Microsoft''s
website yesterday, Ballmer wrote that he would ''support and
encourage boldness by management in my role as a shareholder in
any way I can.'' </p>
<p>Nadella thanked Ballmer, who took over for Gates as CEO in
2000, for his years at the company, saying that the former CEO
created an ''incredible foundation that we continue to build
on.'' </p>
<p>Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities
LLC, said Ballmer''s exit from the board creates room for Nadella
to put more of his stamp on Microsoft. </p>
<p>''I think he recognizes that it''s very hard for a new CEO
to take the reins and have full authority with the old CEO on
the board,'' Barnicle said in an interview. </p>
<h2>Largest Holder </h2>
<p>Ballmer became the company''s biggest individual shareholder
in May after Gates sold 4.6 million shares of Microsoft. Ballmer
owns 333.3 million shares of Microsoft, 3.48 million more than
Gates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ballmer has
collected about $3.4 billion selling shares since the company''s
1986 initial public offering, and has a net worth of $20.8
billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. </p>
<p>Ballmer paid about four times what anyone''s ever paid for
an NBA team when he bought the Clippers. His chance came when
fans and the NBA soured on previous owner Donald Sterling, who
was banned for life and fined $2.5 million after a tape of him
making racially derogatory comments was made public. Sterling''s
wife, Shelly Sterling, went to court to compel him to sell the
franchise he purchased in 1981 for $12.5 million, and Ballmer''s
acquisition became official last week. </p>

<p>John Shaffer, a former Penn State
University quarterback who''s spent more than two decades on Wall
Street, is departing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as co-head of New
York credit sales. </p>
<p>Shaffer, 49, will leave at the end of the year after
joining in 2007 as a managing director, according to an internal
memo obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by Tiffany Galvin,
a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Avanish Bhavsar, head of cross-asset sales, and Jon Meltzer, who''s now co-head of investment-grade, high-yield and
municipal bond sales, will become co-heads of U.S. credit sales,
according to another internal memo. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has shuffled its sales leadership as trading
revenue fell 12 percent in the first half of the year, the fifth
consecutive first-half decline. The New York-based firm this
month named Stacy Bash-Polley, 45, to lead management of its
client relationships across trading. </p>
<p>Meltzer and Bhavsar, who will also continue to oversee
cross-asset sales, will report to Tom Cornacchia, 51, global co-head of sales for fixed-income, currency and commodities.
Salespeople typically call on trading clients to pitch products
and ideas and help manage orders. </p>
<h2>National Championship </h2>
<p>Shaffer, who previously worked at Merrill Lynch  Co. for
17 years, was known to customers and traders partly because of
his background as a football player for Penn State. In 1986, he
quarterbacked the team to a 12-0 season, winning the national
championship with a 14-10 victory over the University of Miami
in the Fiesta Bowl in January 1987. </p>
<p>He said that playing on the team under Joe Paterno was
tougher than working on Wall Street, according to an October
2011 article. </p>
<p>''That pressure, that competition I tried to replicate on
Wall Street, but I just couldn''t,'' he said at the time. </p>
<p>He joined Goldman Sachs as head of the high-yield and
distressed sales group and was named to his current role in
2012, according to one of the memos. </p>
<p>In 2010, Shaffer was promoted to partner, Goldman Sachs''s
highest rank, in a nod to its history as a private partnership
before going public in 1999. Meltzer and Bhavsar were also named
partners four years ago. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is the fourth-most active underwriter of U.S.
corporate bonds this year, up from fifth last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

Merrill Lynch.) </p>

<p>Bloomberg BNA -- Microsoft Corp. has left the American Legislative Exchange Council because of concerns about the lobbying group''s opposition to renewable energy, a coalition of activist investor groups said.</p><p>The Sustainability Group and Walden Asset Management, asset management companies that describe themselves as focused on sustainable investing, said Microsoft confirmed in e-mails that it''s no longer a part of ALEC after the groups pressed the company to abandon it.</p><p>''Microsoft is a leader on carbon issues''in 2012, it committed to becoming carbon neutral, and is one of the largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy,'' the Boston-based groups said in a news release. ''Thus, we believe that its affiliation with ALEC, which is actively fighting policies that promote renewable energy, was incongruous. In addition, there were numerous other ALEC actions that conflicted directly with Microsoft''s values.''</p><p>Arlington, Va.-based ALEC has drafted model legislation for use in state legislatures to roll back renewable fuel standards across the country. Its members include ExxonMobil Corp., Peabody Energy Inc., American Electric Power Co. and Koch Industries Inc., according to the Checks and Balances Project, a nonprofit watchdog group that supports the use of clean energy.</p><p>In response to a request for comment, Microsoft told Bloomberg BNA: ''In 2014, Microsoft decided to no longer participate in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) Communications and Technology Task Force. Our trade association memberships are determined annually on a case by case basis and are based on a number of factors, including evolving policy priorities, business needs and available budgets.''</p><h2>Question of Budget Cuts</h2><p>Bill Meierling, a spokesman for ALEC, said Microsoft left the organization July 16 for budgetary reasons and not as a result of the group''s positions on renewable energy.</p><p>''They left because of budget cuts. They are rearranging their government relations here in D.C.,'' Meierling said in an interview with Bloomberg BNA. ''This is groups opposed to ALEC up to their old tricks.''</p><p>Microsoft announced July 17 it planned to eliminate as many as 18,000 jobs, the largest round of cuts in its history, Bloomberg News reported.</p><p>The Sustainability Group, along with Walden Asset Management, said in a joint news release Aug. 19 that they began pressing Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft to leave ALEC in 2013.</p><p>According the groups, Microsoft, which had been a member of ALEC''s Communications and Technology Task Force, sent an e-mail on July 14 that said, ''We are no longer members of ALEC and do not provide the organization with financial support of any kind.''</p><h2>E-Mail Called Part of Ongoing Dialogue</h2><p>In an interview, Timothy Smith, Walden Asset Management''s senior vice president and director of environmental social and governance shareowner engagement, said the e-mails, which the group sent to investors last month, were part of an ongoing dialogue Walden had been having with Microsoft.</p><p>''It was an ongoing debate inside the company,'' Walden said of the company''s participation in ALEC.</p><p>Walden, which manages $8 billion in assets, considers Microsoft one of its major holdings, Smith said.</p><p>ALEC approved model legislation for the 2013 legislative session designed to be used to repeal states'' renewable portfolio standards and wrote a new version for 2014.</p><p>The standards, which exist in 29 states, have been credited with being one of the largest drivers of renewable energy generation in the U.S. and are expected to drive more than 40,000 megawatts of renewable electricity generation by 2015, according to the Energy Department.</p><p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 50 percent''or more than 1.3 billion kilowatt hours''of the power used by Microsoft annually comes from renewable energy sources, including biogas, biomass, solar and wind. That makes it No. 3 on the EPA''s list of top companies that voluntarily use renewables.</p><h2>Called Example to Others</h2><p>''Microsoft has demonstrated a commitment in recent years to clean energy and climate action by introducing an internal carbon fee and purchasing large amounts of wind energy to power two of its data centers''all actions which run contrary to ALEC''s goal of killing the clean energy economy,'' Greenpeace Senior IT Policy Analyst Gary Cook said in a statement.</p><p>''Google, Facebook, eBay, Yahoo, Yelp and other technology companies that are currently still ALEC members would do well to learn from Microsoft''s leadership,'' Cook said.</p><p>Other major corporations that have left ALEC include Coca-Cola, General Motors, Bank of America and Procter  Gamble, according to Common Cause, a Washington group that has challenged ALEC''s status as a nonprofit organization.</p><p>According to Common Cause, ''the exodus'' began in 2011 after public exposure related to the group''s development of proposals to block renewable energy, as well as other issues such as restrictive voter ID requirements, anti-union measures and ''Stand Your Ground'' gun bills.</p><h2>Consumers Should Decide Energy Choices</h2><p>Meierling said ALEC continues to grow and isn''t opposed to renewable energy specifically.

$2.4 billion of Indian government bonds yesterday, leading
record purchases by international banks, according to three
fixed-income dealers in Mumbai. </p>
<p>Foreign lenders acquired a net 148 billion rupees ($2.4
billion) of sovereign debt yesterday, the most in Clearing Corp.
of India Ltd. data going back to 2006. JPMorgan may have
purchased the notes on behalf of institutional clients, the
dealers said, asking not to be identified as the information
isn''t public. Mollica Senapati, a spokeswoman in Mumbai for the
U.S. bank, declined to comment on the matter in an e-mailed
response to questions. </p>
<p>Global funds pumped in an unprecedented $13.8 billion into
local government and corporate bonds in 2014 as India''s success
in reining in inflation and stabilizing the rupee added to
optimism the nation''s new government will spur economic growth.
JPMorgan''s purchases made up about 90 percent of the $2.76
billion pumped in by overseas money managers yesterday, exchange
data show. </p>
<p>''The purchases represent a significant amount for the bond
markets,'' said Anindya Das Gupta, Mumbai-based treasurer at
Barclays Plc. ''A stable currency, easing inflation and the
fiscal intent of the government are helping to boost the global
appetite for Indian bonds.'' </p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark 8.4 percent sovereign securities
due July 2024 dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, yesterday to 8.48 percent, the lowest level this month.
That''s the biggest decline in a week. </p>
<h2>Rupee, Inflation </h2>
<p>The rupee has rebounded 13 percent from a record low of
68.845 per dollar reached a year ago, the world''s best-performing currency in the period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Consumer-price inflation in India slowed to 7.96
percent in July from as much as 11.2 percent in November. </p>
<p>Finance Minister Arun Jaitley aims to reduce the budget
deficit to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product, which would be
the least since 2008, in the year through March 2015, according
to official estimates released last month. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s bond purchases were executed across different
maturities in the afternoon trading session, the dealers said.
All other categories of investors, including public and private
banks, mutual funds and primary dealers, were net sellers of the
securities yesterday, the Clearing Corp. data show. </p>

cut their ownership of the firm to the lowest level since 2010

<p>The partners owned 8.52 percent of the New York-based

according to a regulatory filing today. Individuals exercised
options from July 16 to Aug. 12 that yielded $107 million after

since the financial crisis. The options vested over three years
ended in January 2012, and shares gained through such awards
couldn''t be sold until this year. </p>
<p>In December 2008, Goldman Sachs granted 36 million options
in an effort to give top performers an incentive to stay after

outstanding at the end of 2013. The partners have exercised
almost 9 million of the options this year, according to filings. </p>
<p>The awards were granted at an exercise price of $78.78. The

more than 38 percent each of the past two years. The partners
also sold $77.4 million of shares unrelated to the options,

<p>Hedge-fund managers, it turns out,
are really like a bunch of grown-up mall rats. </p>
<p>That''s the conclusion one could draw from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.''s report on trends in the alternative-investment
industry. Managers continue to allocate about 20 percent of
assets to shares in companies dependent on discretionary
consumer spending. In the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, their
weighting is only 12 percent. </p>
<p>That group of 85 stocks, from Walt Disney Co. to Nike Inc.
and Yum! Brands Inc., was up 2.4 percent this year compared with
an almost 8 percent gain in the SP 500 as of yesterday. As a
result, many hedge-fund managers, like teenagers who spent too
much time in the mall, are bringing home some lousy report
cards. The industry has returned 1 percent so far this year,
according to Goldman''s Aug. 20 report. </p>
<p>''Consistent large allocations to retail and media stocks
in the consumer discretionary sector have been headwinds to
returns,'' Goldman strategists including Ben Snider and David Kostin wrote. </p>
<p>The smaller dispersion of returns within the group isn''t
helping matters, Goldman notes. There was a 94 percentage point
gap between the SP 500''s best performing consumer-discretionary
stock this year (Under Armour Inc.) and the worst (Coach Inc.)
as of today''s open. That sounds like a lot, but not really when
you compare it with the 217 percentage points that separated the
top winner from the loser at this time of year in 2013. </p>
<h2>First, Worst </h2>
<p>Still the current dispersion, second only to energy shares
among the 10 main SP 500 groups, makes it easy to see why this
is a tough group to quit. And, obviously, not everyone''s a bull,
especially after government data showed consumer spending
stalled in July. </p>
<p>Another report from research firm Markit this week showed
demand to borrow shares of retailers in the SP 500 has climbed
to a one-year high. As the back-to-school season kicks into full
gear, Abercrombie  Fitch Co., Kohl''s Corp. and Five Below Inc.
are among retail stocks showing increases in short interest,
according to Markit. </p>
<p>Goldman serves as sort of a Jane Goodall to hedge-fund
managers, journeying deep into the Excel jungles to learn more
about these exotic creatures and report back to us on their
mysterious ways. The additions and deletions to their indexes of
most-important longs and shorts shows where the action has been
in the consumer space. </p>
<h2>Longs, Shorts </h2>
<p>Dollar General Corp. and DirecTV were added to their basket
of very-important longs, while News Corp. and Constellation
Brands Inc. were dropped. In the very important short basket,
Keurig Green Mountain Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were added, while
DirecTV, Kohl''s and McDonald''s Corp. were dropped. </p>
<p>Perusing the full list, it''s clear that hedge-fund managers
are scattered out across the entire mall, rather than clustered
at a few stores. </p>
<p>Anyway, one theory for their 20 percent weighting in
consumer discretionary could be that hedge fund managers are
wisely getting in front of a pickup in spending and subsequent
rally in the shares. Another theory could be that one is not in
the best position to gauge retail traffic trends if they''re able
to take a helicopter to the mall. </p>

<h2>Ozburn-Hessey Logistics Trade Secrets Case Against 721 Fails </h2>
<p>Ozburn-Hessey Logistics LLC''s trade-secret misappropriation
claims against 10 former employees and the rival shipping
logistics company they started was dismissed by a federal judge
in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>The company filed the suit in February 2012, claiming that
the ex-employees who left to form 721 Logistics LLC in Lester,
Pennsylvania, took trade secrets and were conspiring to compete
unfairly with their former employer. </p>
<p>Ozburn-Hessey, based in Brentwood, Tennessee, said the
purloined proprietary information included client names, product
and service marketing techniques, customer pricing and discount
structures, and sales volumes and purchase patterns of the
company''s customers. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Felipe Restrepo dismissed the case,
saying Ozburn-Hessey''s trade-secret claims didn''t qualify as
such under Pennsylvania law. </p>
<p>''There is no basis in Pennsylvania law for affording
trade-secret protection to a ''compilation'' that exists only in
the collective consciousness,'' he wrote. </p>
<p>He also dismissed the unfair-competition, breach-of-contract and conspiracy claims. The judge did reject the

<p>In one case, the hackers used a software flaw known as a zero-day vulnerability in one of the banks'' websites. They then plowed through layers of elaborate security to steal the data, a feat security experts said appeared far beyond the capability of ordinary criminal hackers. The incidents occurred at a low point in relations between Russia and the West. Russian troops continue to mass on the Ukrainian border and the West tightens sanctions aimed at crippling Russian companies, including some of the country''s most important banks. </p> <h2>Government Link </h2> <p>The sophistication of the attack and technical indicators extracted from the banks'' computers provide some evidence of a government link. Still, the trail is muddy enough that investigators are considering the possibility that it''s cyber criminals from Russia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Other federal agencies, including the National Security Agency, are now aiding the investigation, a third person familiar with the probe said. </p>

<p>Marina Silva''s performance in the
campaign''s first televised presidential debate helped establish
trust among voters and investors, reinforcing her status as the
front-runner in Brazil''s election, analysts from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to Nomura Holdings Inc. said. </p>
<p>The former environment minister showed in the debate aired
last night on Bandeirantes TV that she would be ''reliable and
not extreme'' in the changes she proposes, Tony Volpon, head of
emerging markets research for the Americas at Nomura, said by
phone from New York. ''It makes her the odds-on favorite to win
the election.'' </p>
<p>Silva, who captured the support of Brazilians dissatisfied
with the political establishment and deteriorating growth when
she entered the race, now is capturing enough backing from her
competitors to beat President Dilma Rousseff in a runoff, two
polls published this week show. Equities rallied on speculation
Silva would do a better job managing the economy than Rousseff. </p>
<p>Silva has 43.7 percent support in a possible Oct. 26 second
round vote versus 37.8 percent for the incumbent, according to
an Aug. 21-24 MDA survey published today, which has a margin of
error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. </p>
<p>She has 45 percent of voters'' support, against 36 percent
for Rousseff,  according to an Aug. 23-25 Ibope poll published
yesterday. While both polls show Rousseff leading in the first
round, she doesn''t have the support needed to avert a runoff. </p>
<h2>Stocks Rally </h2>
<p>The Ibovespa stock exchange index rose 1.9 percent at 5:50
p.m. local time today and the real appreciated 0.6 percent to
2.2477 per U.S. dollar, the biggest increase among emerging
market currencies after the South African rand and Turkish lira. </p>
<p>Silva criticized Rousseff''s handling of the economy last
night, saying the incumbent has failed on pledges to slow
inflation and is poised to turn over the country in worse shape
than she found it. </p>
<p>''She handled the debate well,'' Alberto Ramos, chief Latin
America economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a phone interview
when asked about Silva. ''Based on the polls, it''s her election
to lose.'' </p>
<p>Before the debate, Eurasia Group wrote in a note that the
challenge for Silva will be to transition from being a protest
vote candidate to someone voters are willing and able to trust
to govern. The political risk consulting firm wrote today the
candidate last night took a ''positive step'' toward
establishing her reputation as a credible leader. </p>
<h2>Confident, Prepared </h2>
<p>Silva was confident and prepared in going after Rousseff on
slowing growth while fielding questions on how she would forge a
majority in Congress, said Andre Cesar, director at public
policy and business strategy consulting company Prospectiva. </p>
<p>Silva said she could tap support from rival parties to form
a majority. She said she would select for her government some of
the country''s best politicians who have been forced onto the
sidelines by the ruling Workers'' Party and candidate Aecio Neves''s Brazilian Social Democracy Party. </p>
<p>''She passed the first test,'' Cesar said. </p>
<p>Silva''s campaign team has pledged to slow inflation to 3
percent from 6.5 percent last month by the end of 2018, support
formal autonomy for the central bank and undo fiscal policies
that led to a sovereign debt rating downgrade this year. On the
social front, she says she would expand the government program
that transfers money to poor families, known as Bolsa Familia. </p>
<h2>Faster Inflation </h2>
<p>When Rousseff said that her policies have shielded the poor
and workers from the effects of an international economic
crisis, Silva retorted that faster inflation has undermined
confidence and purchasing power. </p>
<p>''Silva would support inflation control, the floating
exchange rate and cut government spending,'' Luciano Rostagno,
chief strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brazil in Sao Paulo, said in
a phone interview. ''That is positive.'' </p>
<p>In the debate, Neves showcased his experience as the former
governor of Brazil''s second-most populous state, saying in a
reference to Silva that voters shouldn''t choose a president
whose proposals are unclear. </p>
<p>''Brazil also can''t put up with new adventures, with
improvisation,'' said Neves, who is running third in polls. </p>
<p>She responded that voters were tired of the dominance of
her two rivals'' parties, which have ruled Brazil for 20 years. </p>
<p>''We will respect the gains that were made in other
governments,'' she said. ''But we will correct the mistakes.'' </p>

<p>Marcelino Calvo Sanchez and his wife, Maria Luisa, had never heard of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. until last year, when the global investment bank bought the four-building housing estate where they live in Vallecas, on the southern outskirts of Madrid. Marcelino, a 71-year-old retired truck driver, isn''t impressed by his new landlord. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs picked up the 289-unit complex in August 2013 as part of its purchase of 3,000 low-income apartments from the regional government of Madrid for 201 million euros ($269 million). With the sale, some subsidies for tenants disappeared, and, according to Sanchez, a small problem with squatters has become a larger one. </p> <p>''We don''t want to live with squatters,'' Sanchez says. ''This has become a business -- it''s not a social program anymore.'' </p> <p>That''s exactly right, Bloomberg Markets will report in its October issue. Though the housing estate looks like one of the last places in the world smart-money Goldman Sachs bankers would bet on -- glass doors are shattered, broken mailboxes hang open, and graffiti mars the courtyard walls -- this is where Goldman has touched down in the Spanish real estate market. Blackstone Group LP, the world''s largest alternative-asset manager, bought a similar low-income-housing portfolio from the city of Madrid in July 2013 for 125 million euros. </p>

<p>All those bond investors fretting
about a bubble will probably be right eventually. In the
meantime, they may want to think about buying some junk debt. </p>
<p>That''s how Bob Michele, who oversees $380 billion as
JPMorgan Asset Management''s chief investment officer for fixed
income, is approaching the market. Just because yields on
speculative-grade debt are falling toward the lowest ever,
that''s not a good enough reason to avoid it, he said. </p>
<p>''Ultimately there will be a bubble,'' Michele said in a
Bloomberg Television interview on Aug. 26. As for now, he said,
''there''s only so long that you''re going to sit in cash earning
a zero percent return in the U.S., perhaps a negative yield in
Europe, before you go back into some form of bonds.'' </p>
<p>Michele isn''t alone in seeing value in junk bonds despite
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen''s suggestion that the market
has gotten frothy. While high-yield notes in the U.S. posted a
1.3 percent loss last month, their first in almost a year,
they''ve bounced right back with a 1.5 percent gain in August,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>The reason yields are so low is because of the Fed''s easy
money policies, which are ongoing (even if a little scaled
back). </p>
<p>So why leave now when the party''s still good? </p>
<h2>Not Much Upside </h2>
<p>It''s understandable why investors would be wary of plunging
into less-creditworthy debt right now. Junk-rated bonds are
yielding 5.9 percent as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. That''s about 0.2 percentage point from the
all-time low, meaning potential returns are significantly less
than the historic average. </p>
<p>While mutual-fund investors yanked a record $7.1 billion
from the debt in the week ended Aug. 6, they''ve since had a
change of heart, plowing $2.9 billion back into the funds in the
two weeks since, according to data provider Lipper. </p>
<p>''Everybody has been lulled into this comforting notion
that between a Goldilocks economy, not lifting off but not
collapsing, and the Fed being the market''s best friend, it''s OK
to leverage every risk factor,'' Mohamed El-Erian, former chief
executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. and
Bloomberg View columnist, said in an interview last week. </p>
<p>''Everybody''s in the same trade,'' he said. ''If sentiment
changes, there''s no shock absorber in the system.'' </p>
<p>Call it a game of chicken, where investors wait as long as
they can before slipping out just before everybody else runs for
the exits. Or perhaps another case of don''t fight the Fed, which
has pledged to keep benchmark rates low for a prolonged period. </p>
<p>''Typically you see bubbles at the end of Fed tightening,
when the Fed has withdrawn liquidity from the system,'' Michele
said. </p>
<p>That''s not happening yet. So for now, game on. </p>

<p>When Scott Knudsen rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange this week, he signaled the ceremonial start of the day''s session and the conquest of the NYSE floor by high-frequency trading firms. </p> <p>His firm, IMC Chicago LLC, just finished its takeover of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s NYSE unit, giving it rights to manage buying and selling of dozens of stocks including prominent ones like International Business Machines Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Visa Inc. </p> <p>IMC joins rival automated trading firms Virtu Financial Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc. facilitating transactions at the NYSE in lower Manhattan, a role once filled solely by humans. While these high-frequency traders, so named because of the speed with which their computers trade, are often reviled by the people they''ve displaced, they''re becoming more dominant. </p> <p>''This illustrates how market makers from the traditional liquidity suppliers of banks and broker-dealers have been unable to compete in the decentralized, fully electronically traded market,'' Terrence Hendershott, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley''s business school, said in an e-mail. </p> <p>Trading on Speed</p><p>The ascent of automated market makers on the NYSE floor represents the latest leg of an evolution that began about a decade ago, when investment banks such as Goldman Sachs began to supplant smaller specialist firms. As advances in technology and rule changes narrowed profits and transformed stock trading into a volume business, computers took over. </p> <h2>''Best Suited'' </h2> <p>''Given IMC''s specialized focus on market making and already extensive exchange-based trading operations, we believe IMC is best suited to drive'' the NYSE floor operation, Todd Hohman, managing director and global head of the quantitative trading business at Goldman Sachs, said in a May 22 statement. IMC hired the investment bank''s team of 15 floor traders, two technologists and an issuer relations manager. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs was seeking as much as $30 million for the business, a person familiar with the discussions said in April. The investment bank, which joined the NYSE in 1896, bought the operations in 2000 as part of a $5.4 billion purchase of Spear Leeds  Kellogg. </p> <p>With Goldman Sachs''s exit, the only bank at the NYSE floor is Barclays Plc. </p> <p>Knudsen, managing director and head of trading at IMC in Chicago, said the firm''s move to the NYSE floor was a natural extension of its business. </p> <h2>''Can''t Ignore'' </h2> <p>''We are and have been in the process over the past couple of years of building up our equity market-making business, so NYSE is an exchange we can''t ignore,'' Knudsen said in a phone interview. </p> <p>IMC was founded in Amsterdam in 1989, and operates both a trading unit and an asset-management division. The firm conducts transactions on 100 markets around the world, according to its website. </p> <p>At a time when high-speed traders face unprecedented regulatory and legal scrutiny, IMC, KCG Holdings and Virtu are now three of the largest traders at the NYSE, whose listed companies are worth more than any other exchange''s. They thrived amid years of modernization and efforts to break the grip of NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock Market on trading. </p> <p>The average size of trades on NYSE Group''s exchanges in the first seven months of the year was about 240 shares, compared with 1,187 in 2000. In 1988, the average was 2,303 shares per trade. Along with that reduction, minimum trading increments have fallen from an eighth of a dollar to one cent. In other words, market making isn''t as lucrative as it once was. </p> <h2>''Building Scale'' </h2> <p>''It''s all about building scale to deal with the narrow spreads,'' Chris Concannon, president of Virtu, which has eight traders on the NYSE floor, said in an interview. ''If you''re a small company with excellent technology, it becomes profitable over time.'' </p> <p>Designated market makers like IMC are required to offer trades at the national best price at least 15 percent of the time in the stocks for which they''re registered, and are compensated with better trading fees by the exchange. </p> <p>While electronic trading firms have taken over at the NYSE, their role at the Big Board also sees them employ human traders who man the posts at 11 Wall Street, the only stock trading floor in the U.S. Knudsen said it''s a model that''s liked by the corporations listed on the exchange. </p> <p>''We do recognize in talking to some of these issuers the real advantages in having people on the floor to help out with the IPO process and during any sort of market disruptions that come about, and that''s just something we wanted to be a part of,'' Knudsen said. </p> <p>Intercontinental Exchange Inc., based in Atlanta, pledged to preserve the trading floor when it agreed to buy the exchange in 2012. ICE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sprecher completed the takeover of NYSE in November. </p> <p>''We did have a conversation with Jeff before we committed to this acquisition, making sure that he was committed to the NYSE as well,'' Knudsen said.

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) wants you to know that its Watson technology can do more
than win ''Jeopardy!'' -- it can now help accelerate scientific
research and discoveries. </p>
<p>IBM, in a peer-reviewed paper with Baylor College of
Medicine, used the Watson Discovery Advisor technology to map
connections within troves of scientific research. The ability to
point scientists toward new hypotheses and patterns in data is
also being used by Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) to help develop medicines
and find additional uses for existing drugs, IBM said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Since the ''Jeopardy!'' win in 2011 proved Watson can
answer questions and analyze data in natural human language, IBM
has been trying to commercialize the technology by showing how
it can be applied to customer service and financial planning. As
declining demand for IBM''s hardware has led to nine straight
quarters of falling sales, the company has turned to data
analytics tools like Watson as a new source of growth. </p>
<p>''We''ve gone from co-creating with these early partners to
creating a commercial offering,'' John Gordon, vice president of
IBM''s Watson Group, said in a phone interview, referring to
Baylor and JJ. ''In the past we''ve talked about how Watson can
help people find answers to things that are known. We are
shifting to really helping innovators investigate the great
problems of our time.'' </p>
<p>IBM has been marketing different uses for Watson since the
company spent about $1 billion to create a new business unit
around the tool. Financial-services firm USAA said last month it
will use Watson on its website to answer military customers''
questions about transitioning back to civilian life -- the first
wide-scale test with consumers. </p>
<h2>70,000 Articles </h2>
<p>Watson''s new science applications identify potentially
unknown points of interest about a topic, instead of only
finding direct answers to specific questions. </p>
<p>Baylor used the tool to analyze the abstracts of 70,000
scientific articles on a specific cancer-related protein to
predict other compounds that may interact with it. Using
frequent words to rank and map relationships, the researchers
identified six proteins to investigate, more than the one that
scientists typically discover in a year. </p>
<p>Johnson  Johnson, whose Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky will join IBM''s board next week, will use Watson to
analyze drug data to potentially allow researchers to more
quickly ask questions about the effectiveness and side effects
of medical treatments. </p>
<p>''This points them to the next great idea,'' Gordon said.
''It''s kind of Watson becoming a scientist.'' </p>

and the one-year forecast to $1.20 from $1.30. That''s one of the
most bearish views among banks surveyed by Bloomberg, with the
median forecast of $1.31 by the end of the year and $1.30 by the
end of the first quarter. </p>
<h2>Inflation Gauge </h2>
<p>The euro has slumped for seven consecutive weeks, the
longest stretch in more than a decade. The shared currency was
little changed at $1.3184 at 10:46 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Draghi last week pushed the central bank closer to
quantitative easing by singling out the five-year, five-year
inflation break-even rate, his preferred gauge of inflation
expectations, sliding below 2 percent. Draghi previously said
that a worsening of the medium-term inflation outlook would
provide a reason for broad-based asset purchases. ECB officials
meet Sept. 4. </p>
<p>In contrast, the U.S. is moving closer toward raising
interest rates. The Federal Reserve has kept the benchmark rate
at a record-low zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, while
futures traders saw about a 56 percent chance the central bank
will start raising rates by July 2015, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The July Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed
policy makers discussed the possibility that jobs gains may lead
them to increase rates sooner than anticipated. </p>
<p>''The longer-term forecast to parity is a pure view that
growth in the U.S. will outperform that that of the euro-zone,''
Brooks said. ''In terms of our euro forecast, we''re clearly
signaling growth will be better in the U.S.'' </p>

<p>Deutsche Bank AG, Europe''s biggest
investment bank, was fined 4.7 million pounds ($7.8 million) by
the British markets regulator for failing to properly report
millions of transactions. </p>
<p>A coding error reversed a buy/sell indicator, leading
Deutsche Bank to improperly report on $29.4 million in
transactions involving a type of swap in which the seller agrees
to pay the buyer the difference between the current value of a
stock, and its value when the contract is made. If the
difference is negative, the buyer pays the seller. The swaps
were made between November 2007 and April 2013, the Financial
Conduct Authority said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The FCA has been cracking down to ensure firms provide
accurate and full reporting on transactions. The London-based
regulator has fined 10 other firms for similar failures,
according to its statement. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank said it ''immediately undertook a complete
review of our transaction reporting systems to rectify the
problem and strengthen our control framework'' after the issue
was identified in March 2013, according to an e-mail yesterday
from Kathryn Hanes, a London-based Deutsche Bank spokeswoman. </p>
<p>The Frankfurt-based bank is spending 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) to improve its controls and reporting systems and is
dedicating 1,300 people to that effort, including the hiring of
about 500 people in the U.S. this year, Chief Financial Officer
Stefan Krause said last month. </p>
<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>FDIC to Hold Sept. 3 Board Meeting For Vote on Margin Rule </h2>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance

according to a public notice published on the agency''s website,
as required under a federal law known as the Government in the
Sunshine Act. </p>
<p>No discussion of the rules is planned for the session,
according to the notice. The matters ''will be resolved with a
single vote, unless a member of the board of directors requests
that an item be removed from the agenda,'' according to the
notice. </p>
<p>The rules to be voted on concern margin and capital

notice. </p>
<p>Separately U.S. banks had $40.2 billion in net income in

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>York London Office Said to Be Probed by Spain Over Bankia Trade </h2>
<p>The London office of James Dinan''s York Capital Management
LP may face civil charges from Spanish regulators for allegedly
using a banned trading technique before last year''s bailout of
mortgage giant Bankia SA. (BKIA) </p>
<p>The Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores, or CNMV,
notified Dinan''s firm in March it was scrutinizing a May 2013
short sale by the York European Focus Fund, according to a
regulatory filing. The stock involved was Bankia, according to a
person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified
because the details are private. In December, the Spanish
regulator started a probe into bets made against Bankia shares
before May 23, 2013, when the stock plunged 51 percent after
terms of a government bailout were disclosed. </p>
<p>The civil charges against York would be one of the first
cases filed under a new regulatory code adopted by the European
Union in 2012 to restrict short selling, blamed by many local
officials for exacerbating the global financial crisis. Richard
Swanson, York''s general counsel, declined to comment. In a
regulatory filing, York said the trade was reviewed by its
compliance department and other parties, and that there were
circumstances outside its control that prevented a timely
delivery of shares to execute the trade. </p>
<p>The CNMV as a policy does not comment on its supervision
process, according to a spokeswoman for the regulator. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan Boosts Customer Data Protections After Cyber-Attack </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, said it
increased defenses against computer hackers after an attack
against the industry this month. </p>
<p>The lender is working with U.S. authorities to determine
the scope of the assault and is taking additional steps to
safeguard confidential information, Patricia Wexler, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said yesterday in an e-mail, declining to give specific examples. JPMorgan will contact
any customers that might have been affected, Wexler said, adding
that the firm hasn''t seen unusual fraud levels. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was among at least five banks targeted in the
coordinated attack on financial institutions in recent weeks, a
U.S. official said Aug. 27. The assault led to the theft of
customer data that could be used to drain accounts, according to
another person briefed by U.S. law enforcement. Both asked not
to be identified because U.S. probes are continuing. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, has warned
shareholders in annual letters that hackers'' efforts to breach
the bank''s computers were growing more frequent, sophisticated
and dangerous. The New York-based bank expected to boost yearly
spending on cybersecurity to about $250 million by the end of
2014, with 1,000 workers dedicated to the effort, he wrote in
April. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) loaned
Portugal''s Banco Espirito Santo SA $835 million in July, just
weeks before the group''s units sought creditor protection in a
cascade of insolvencies that resulted in the lender''s bailout. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs made the loan through Oak Finance Luxembourg
SA, an investment company that raised funds destined for a
Venezuelan oil refinery project, according to the unit''s offer
document. </p>
<p>Banco Espirito Santo, once Portugal''s biggest publicly

disclosed potential losses on loans to other Grupo Espirito
Santo companies and regulators ordered the lender to raise more
capital. The bank was split in two with deposits and healthy
assets becoming Novo Banco in a bailout by the central bank''s
Resolution Fund. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that Goldman 
Sachs sold some of Oak Finance''s securities at a loss to hedge 
funds and the New York-based firm is still holding some of the 
debt, citing a person it didn''t identify. </p>

comment. Novo Banco does not comment about operations that
involve clients, said a spokeswoman, who asked not to be named
in line with company policy. Officials for Portugal''s central
bank didn''t have an immediate comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had agreed to the funding on May 16, the
offer document shows. Four days later, Banco Espirito Santo
warned investors buying stock in its rights offer of
irregularities in the accounts of a parent company and that the
''serious financial situation'' of the parent firm could be
damaging to the bank''s reputation. Regulators are examining how
the group''s companies helped fund each other. </p>

<p>     Sept. 2 (Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Chevron has finalized
the sale of its renewable-energy subsidiary, Chevron Energy
Solutions, to OpTerra Energy Services, a Chevron spokesman
confirmed today. </p>
<p>The sale, on Aug. 29, marks the latest in a series of moves
away from renewables by the oil company. Earlier this year,
Chevron sold a 48-person division that builds renewable projects
and energy-savings retrofits for federal agencies such as the
U.S. Department of Defense. </p>
<p>OpTerra is backed by Oaktree Capital Management, a private
equity firm in Los Angeles, according to OpTerra''s website. It
develops energy-savings projects, as well as clean-energy systems
from technologies like solar and fuel cells. </p>
<p>Bloomberg Businessweek first reported the expected sale of
Chevron''s clean-energy subsidiary in June. </p>
<p>Chevron declined to comment on the price of the transaction
or the number of its employees moving to OpTerra. The company
said in a statement that the sale ''is part of an internal
strategic focus on supporting Chevron''s Upstream and Downstream
businesses. Chevron continues to believe that energy efficiency
and renewable energy are an important part of the overall energy
mix, and operates a portfolio of renewables, including wind,
geothermal and solar.'' </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Oaktree Capital declined to comment. An
OpTerra representative previously declined to comment about the
transaction and didn''t respond to a new request for comment
today. </p>
<p>Chevron Energy Solutions was first acquired by the oil
company in 2000 and has long been a centerpiece of Chevron''s
efforts to pursue renewable energy. A decade after acquiring the
division, Chevron boasted that the group had developed hundreds
of renewable and energy-efficiency projects that were ''reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by more than 3 million metric tons.'' </p>
<p>In addition, Chevron executives frequently touted the
division''s clean-energy work in speeches and in testimony (PDF)
before Congress. </p>
<p>Last month, though, Chevron confirmed that it had suspended
two solar projects at a refinery in Hawaii, which would have
spanned about 20 acres and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by
about 5,000 tons apiece. </p>
<p>And earlier this year, the company dismantled a renewable
power group whose mission was to launch large, profitable
clean-energy projects, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in May.
The group had almost doubled its internal profit targets in 2013,
while helping to launch solar and geothermal projects capable of
powering tens of thousands of homes.</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Societe
Generale SA (GLE) are among lenders seen driving a 10 percent gain
among European banks by year-end as investor concerns over their
capital levels and legal bills ease, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
analysts said. </p>
<p>European bank shares, tracked by the benchmark Stoxx 600
Banks Index, will reverse their underperformance relative to the
broader market in recent months, the analysts including Kian Abouhossein wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. The banks
index, down 3.2 percent in the six months through Sept. 1, today
rose 0.7 percent to 198.06 as of 11:15 a.m. in Frankfurt. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank is leading an unprecedented
regulatory scrutiny of the financial health of the region''s
biggest lenders as it prepares to assume their supervision, an
effort to restore confidence in the industry. European banks
have also faced investor concerns that fines and settlements
would erode capital after France''s BNP Paribas SA (BNP) paid a record
$8.97 billion penalty for breaking U.S. sanctions in July. </p>
<p>The ''ECB stress test should be a positive event,'' the
analysts wrote in the report. All 34 European banks JPMorgan
tested passed its own assessment, which used the same 5.5
percent minimum capital ratio the ECB will employ in the more
adverse of two stress test scenarios, they said. </p>
<p>The ECB is scheduled to release the results of its tests
and examination of the balance sheets of 128 euro area lenders
next month. Firms will have six months to raise equity to cover
any shortfalls identified in its balance sheet review or the
milder stress-test scenarios, and nine months to address
deficiencies resulting from the more-adverse scenario. </p>
<p>JPMorgan added Deutsche Bank, Germany''s biggest bank,
Societe Generale of France and Amsterdam-based ING Groep NV (INGA) to
its list of ''top picks,'' according to the report. The analysts

The panel, described by Salem''s lawyer as a ''kangaroo court,'' didn''t let Salem call some of Goldman Sachs'' top trading executives as witnesses, resulting in a miscarriage of justice, according to the petition. </p> <p>Related: ''Flash Boys'' Programmer Loses in Goldman Fight Over Fees</p><p>''What you have failed to do in your application before this court is show any evidence whatsoever that the material that was excluded was pertinent to this case,'' Bransten told Salem''s lawyer Jonathan Sack. </p> <p>In transcripts of the hearing, filed by Sack along with the petition and later sealed, Salem said his $8.25 million bonus in 2010 didn''t reflect his contributions and that he was led to believe he would be paid at least $13 million.

<p>The European Central Bank will buy
as much as 40 billion euros ($53 billion) of asset-backed
securities as part of a program to stimulate the region''s
economy, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The central bank will limit purchases to the new-issue
market over a three-year period and focus on securities with the
highest credit ratings, JPMorgan analysts led by Gareth Davies
wrote in a note. About 47 billion euros of asset-backed debt has
been sold in the region this year, according to data from the
New York-based bank. </p>
<p>The ECB is preparing to buy ABS as it strives to revive
lending to small-and medium-sized businesses that employ about
70 percent of the European Union''s private-sector workers. While
the region''s outstanding ABS market is as large as 1.2 trillion
euros, a purchase program of this magnitude would necessitate it
being expanded beyond SME-backed loans, the analysts said in the
note. </p>
<p>''The purchase plan is important for a number of reasons,
but broadly because it puts downward pressure on the cost of
issuing ABS, and ultimately feeds into lower product margins on
real economy lending,'' Davies said by e-mail today. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
its first foray into Islamic capital markets three years after
starting a sukuk program that it never used. </p>
<p>Five banks including the New York-based lender will manage
the dollar-denominated offering via JANY Sukuk Co., four people
with knowledge of the deal said. A benchmark-sized sale may
follow, they said, asking not to be identified as the plan is
private. Goldman Sachs in 2011 created a $2 billion program that
faced criticism from some Islamic advisers for not ensuring debt
would be traded at par value, as required by Shariah. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is joining a growing number of issuers
seeking to tap demand among Muslim investors in an industry that
Ernst  Young LLP forecasts will double in the five years
through 2018 to $3.4 trillion. The U.K. became the first non-Muslim country to issue Islamic bonds in June with a sale that
lured bids for more than 10 times the amount offered. Luxembourg
and Hong Kong are also planning investor meetings for similar
offerings. </p>
<p>''There''s so much pent up demand in the sukuk space,''
Thomas Christie, the Dubai-based head of fixed income at
Prometheus Capital Finance Ltd., said by phone. ''Given the
controversy in the past, it would be interesting to see what
structure they''re going to use, how they''re going to use the
funds and how the Islamic community reacts to it.'' </p>
<h2>Previous Attempt </h2>
<p>The planned security will take the form of Sukuk al Wakala,
a Shariah-compliant structure in which one party entrusts
another to act on its behalf. Standard  Poor''s rated the issue
A-, the seventh-highest investment grade, the company said in an
e-mail today. </p>
<p>The lender established a sukuk program three years ago
based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
plus mark-up transaction, that was approved for listing on the
Irish Stock Exchange by the Central Bank of Ireland. Murabaha
certificates can only be bought and sold at par value because
they represent a future claim on the underlying assets. </p>
<p>The program, blessed by eight of the world''s top Islamic
scholars, became entangled in a debate on whether it met
Shariah-compliant guidelines and over lack of clarity on how
Goldman Sachs planned to use the funds it raised. </p>
<h2>Pent-Up Demand </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs will hold investor meetings in the Middle
East on Sept. 10 and 11 and a so-called Regulation S
transaction, which exempts overseas offerings from registration
requirements under the SEC Securities Act of 1933, may follow,
the people said. A benchmark-sized sale usually raises at least
$500 million. </p>
<p>The notes would ''probably price tighter'' than Goldman
Sachs'' conventional bonds due to the ''pent-up demand in the
sukuk space,'' Christie of Prometheus said. The average yield on
debt that complies with Muslim tenets dropped 63 basis points
this year to 2.78 percent yesterday, the lowest since May,
according to the Deutsche Bank Sukuk Bond Index. </p>
<p>Islamic lenders will have 70 million customers by 2018, up
from 38 million last year, according to Ernst  Young forecasts.
Shariah-compliant banking assets will double in that period,
according to the advisory company. </p>
<h2>South Africa, Bangladesh </h2>
<p>South Africa last month picked banks for its debut sale of
Islamic notes, while Bangladesh and the Russian region of
Tatarstan are planning inaugural sales. In addition to itself,
Goldman Sachs hired Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC, National Bank
of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd. and NCB Capital to
manage the offering, the people said today. </p>
<p>Demand for Islamic bonds is surging helped by ample
liquidity at banks. Al Hilal Bank PJSC, an Islamic lender owned
by the Abu Dhabi government, received about $5 billion in bids
for its $500 million sale of perpetual sukuk in June. </p>
<p>''Clearly, this is a good time and the demand for sukuk is
still there,'' Apostolos Bantis, credit analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Dubai, said by phone. ''This does actually indicate that
the asset class of sukuk is expanding and diversifying.'' </p>
<p>JANY Sukuk will enter a murabaha agreement for 49 percent
of the issued amount and a wakala agreement for the remaining 51
percent with J. Aron  Co., a Goldman Sachs subsidiary,
according to SP. </p>

<p>A win for Scottish nationalists seeking a breakaway from the U.K. may have ''severe'' consequences in the short term and spark a pound selloff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Kevin Daly. </p> <p>''The uncertainty about whether Scotland will leave the sterling monetary union could create'' a crisis similar to the one that almost splintered the euro area, Daly said today in an interview with Anna Edwards on Bloomberg Television''s ''On The Move'' program in London.

''People realize increasingly that the undecided camp is big enough to swing this'' and that is why ''volatility is picking up,'' he said. </p> <h2>Volatility Surge </h2> <p>Implied one-month volatility in sterling against the dollar surged 23 percent after the survey was released, the most since 2008. Sterling has declined since then and today fell 0.2 percent to $1.6432 today, having reached $1.6440 yesterday, the weakest since Feb. 12. </p> <p>The question of whether a go-it-alone Scotland will be able to keep the pound in partnership with the remaining parts of the U.K. has dominated the independence debate with all the major parties in Westminster saying they would oppose it.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), at its own request,
was found in contempt of a court order to comply with a U.S.
warrant for e-mails stored in a data center in Ireland, so that
it can promptly appeal the ruling. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan today
granted a joint request by Microsoft and the government to hold
the software maker in contempt. The judge imposed no further
sanctions and said the order permits the company to immediately
appeal her July 31 ruling that it has to produce e-mails of an
unidentified customer sought in a drug probe. </p>
<p>The judge in her July ruling rejected Microsoft''s argument
that the warrant,which requires the company to provide
investigators with the contents of the customer''s MSN.com Web-based e-mail, calls for an illegal search and seizure outside
the U.S. The nation in which the customer lives wasn''t
disclosed. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s third-quarter earnings stand to get a boost from a 2007 investment in an automated-driving technology company that''s more than doubled since a July initial public offering. </p> <p>The bank owned 17.5 percent of Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV (MBLY), mostly through its Goldman Sachs Investment Partners hedge fund, before it helped take the firm public in July, according to filings related to the IPO. The shares priced at $25, above the initial range of $17 to $19, and rose as high as $53.91 today. That advance may lead to a third-quarter gain for New York-based Goldman Sachs of more than $200 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>While calm markets have suppressed Goldman Sachs''s trading business, they have been a boon to investments the firm makes with its own money. The investing and lending unit earned the most profit of Goldman Sachs''s four major business segments in the 12 months ended in June, and gains in companies that went public drove better-than-expected earnings last quarter. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs ''has successfully established a strategy that should allow the firm to continue in the principal-investing business in the coming years,'' Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst, said in a July note. ''The wisdom of that strategy is clear,'' Hintz said, as such gains in the second quarter ''once again provided an unanticipated boost to performance.'' </p> <p>Goldman Sachs invested $100 million in Mobileye in 2007, the first year the company had its driver-assistance EyeQ chip and algorithms put in new cars. The firm hasn''t said whether it added to that investment. Mobileye''s image-sensing technology uses a single camera to capture and display a vehicle''s surroundings, and anticipates potential collisions, according to the company. </p> <h2>Honda, Tesla </h2> <p>Mobileye, whose customers include Honda Motor Co. (7267) and luxury electric-carmaker Tesla Motors Inc., has leaped from a $1.5 billion valuation in July 2013 to a market capitalization of $10.8 billion today. Its $1 billion IPO on July 31 was the biggest in the U.S. by an Israeli company. </p> <p>The investment shows the potential of Goldman Sachs''s strategy of serving as adviser and principal with key clients. The bank generated about $18 million from its role as lead underwriter of Mobileye''s IPO, according to a regulatory filing, and advised the company last year when it received investments from firms including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) </p> <p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the company, declined to comment on the firm''s holdings. </p> <p>The investing and lending unit includes direct investments in debt and equity, stakes in private equity and hedge funds, and loans to corporate and individual clients. The unit earned $4.26 billion before taxes in the 12 months ended in June, or 37 percent of the firm''s total, on $7.14 billion in revenue. </p> <h2>Equity Gains </h2> <p>Gains from equity investments drove better-than-expected earnings last quarter and in the final three months of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in July that two-thirds of the $1.25 billion in equity gains for the second quarter came from companies that went public or experienced an event that resulted in a new valuation. </p> <p>A $200 million gain would represent about a quarter of equity investment revenue for the average of the past 10 quarters. The firm had $18 billion of investments in private equity and $4.33 billion in public stock as of June 30. </p> <p>Analysts including Citigroup Inc.''s Keith Horowitz have said that shareholders give Goldman Sachs less credit for investing and lending gains because they''re seen as volatile and difficult to predict. Schwartz has said the activities are ''core competencies'' of the firm. </p> <h2>ELQ Investors </h2> <p>Eighty-six percent of Goldman Sachs''s stake in Mobileye before the IPO was held by Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, a hedge fund that includes client money and the bank''s own capital. The other 14 percent was a principal investment held through a subsidiary named ELQ Investors II Ltd. </p> <p>ELQ sold $36 million of its stake in the IPO, leaving it with 1.7 percent of Mobileye''s shares. The remaining stake would be worth $176 million at the Sept. 5 closing price if ELQ didn''t sell more shares after the IPO. GSIP sold $105 million of Mobileye stock in the IPO, leaving it with 12.3 percent of the company, which would be worth $1.3 billion. </p> <p>The third-quarter gain for Goldman Sachs will depend on a number of factors, including how Mobileye''s stock trades in September and whether ELQ and GSIP maintain their post-IPO stakes. </p> <p>The shares gained as much as 7.9 percent today, after General Motors Co. said it would introduce a Cadillac model in two years that uses automated-driving technology. Detroit-based GM didn''t name potential technology suppliers. </p> <h2>Mobileye Valuation </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs, which marks its investments to the current market price, hasn''t disclosed at what price it valued Mobileye on June 30. If it marked at $18, the midpoint of the original IPO range, ELQ would currently have a gain of $122 million. GSIP would have a $842 million gain, and Goldman Sachs would receive some cut of that as an investor in the fund. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s own money accounted for about 35 percent of the $7.5 billion in the fund in October 2009, according to marketing documents at the time. Since then, the assets have shrunk and Goldman Sachs has pulled money from hedge funds to eventually comply with the Volcker Rule, which sets a 3 percent limit for how much of a fund can be a bank''s own capital. </p> <p>The fund, which is managed by Kenneth Eberts, Raanan Agus and Nick Advani, had about $5 billion in assets at the end of June, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. DuVally declined to say how much of the fund is the bank''s own money. </p> <h2>Volcker Rule </h2> <p>Part of the unpredictability of investing and lending stems from Goldman''s need to exit $12 billion of the $14 billion in fund investments it had at the end of 2013 to comply with the Volcker Rule, Hintz wrote in June. The bank has said it will make those sales at a pace that won''t hurt other investors in the funds. </p> <p>Gains like the one from GSIP''s stake in Mobileye may provide an incentive for Goldman Sachs to take its time in redeeming its capital. Mobileye has jumped more than 35 percent since the start of trading on Aug. 26. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s own research analyst, Alexander Duval, issued his first recommendation of the stock that day. He rated the shares neutral. </p> <p>', 'Goldman Sachs Earnings to Get Boost From Mobileye Stake', 'By Michael J.

<p>The European Central Bank''s decision
to boost stimulus measures was enough to make Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. change its mind about the short-term fate of the
global equity market. </p>
<p>The bank raised its three-month rating on stocks to
overweight, the equivalent of buy, according to a report from
its portfolio strategy group. Higher bond yields pose less of an
imminent threat to equities following the ECB''s decision last
week to unexpectedly lower key interest rates and implement an
asset-buying plan, the firm said. </p>
<p>The upgrade is a reversal of a call made by Goldman Sachs
on July 26, when the firm cut its three-month rating on stocks
to neutral amid expectations that government bond yields would
increase. The bank maintained its 12-month overweight rating for
stocks. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sees ''lower risk'' from bonds following the
ECB decision, analysts led by chief global equity strategist
Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a Sept. 5 client note. ''The net
effect of the policy action from here will be positive for
equity markets,'' they said. </p>
<p>The MSCI All-Country World Index has rebounded 3.6 percent
over the last month since falling to an 11-week low on Aug. 7.
The gauge declined 0.4 percent at 10:39 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>The global equity measure climbed 0.2 percent last week as
the ECB reduced its three main interest rates by 10 basis
points, lowering the benchmark rate to 0.05 percent and the
deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi
said the central bank will announce details of an asset-backed
securities program after its October rate-setting meeting. </p>
<p>The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.1 percent on the day of
the Sept. 4 announcement as two-year note yields fell below zero
in eight countries. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs isn''t alone in getting more bullish on
equities. Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Adam Parker announced today an increase in the firm''s 12-month SP
500 forecast to 2,125. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank AG strategist
David Bianco increased his year-end SP 500 target to 2,050 from
1,850 and his 2015 projection to 2,150. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will
probably succeed in its latest attempt to sell sukuk as
investors clamor for Islamic bonds, according to the manager of
the Middle East and Africa''s best performing sukuk fund. </p>
<p>Buyers ''have to look at different opportunities'' with
demand outpacing supply, according to Abdul Kadir Hussain, who
oversees about $700 million as the chief executive officer of
Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. Goldman Sachs will meet investors in
the region this week before potentially selling a dollar-denominated, benchmark-sized issue through its unit JANY Sukuk
Co., people with knowledge of the deal said last week. </p>
<p>The New York-based lender''s first foray into the Islamic
capital markets three years ago ended without a sale amid
criticism from scholars about the structure of its sukuk program
and the use of funds raised. This time the planned security will
be a Sukuk al Wakala, where one party entrusts another to act on
its behalf. </p>
<p>''We''ll definitely look at it,'' Hussain said in a phone
interview from Dubai yesterday. ''The structure was an issue''
last time and there were ''a lot of other issuers in the
market,'' he said. ''Now the market is a lot tighter and there
is more capital.'' </p>
<p>Investors bid for 10-times the 200 million pounds ($327
million) that the U.K. sold in its debut offering in June. </p>
<h2>Best Funds </h2>
<p>Mashreq''s Capital DA01 and Al-Islami Income Fund are the
two best performing Islamic fixed-income funds in the Middle
East and Africa this year among 19 tracked by Bloomberg. They''ve
returned 7.7 percent and 6 percent respectively, compared with
5.6 percent for third placed Al Hilal Bank''s Global Sukuk Fund,
the data show. </p>
<p>''Like the U.K. issue, the Goldman Sachs deal is a
broadening of the sukuk market issuer base, and like that issue
this deal isn''t about the pricing or the valuation,'' Hussain
said. ''It''s about the signal that it sends.'' </p>
<p>Average global sukuk yields declined 64 basis points this
year to 2.78 percent last week, according to an index from
Deutsche Bank AG. That compares with a 61 basis-point decline to
5.08 percent in average yields for emerging-market corporate
debt tracked by JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. </p>
<h2>Remaining Shy </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs established a $2 billion program in 2011
based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
plus mark-up transaction. The program, blessed by eight of the
world''s top Islamic scholars, became entangled in a debate on
whether it met Shariah-compliant guidelines because it didn''t
ensure debt was traded at par, and it didn''t clarify how it
planned to use the funds raised. </p>
<p>This time Goldman Sachs along with Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank
PJSC, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd.
and NCB Capital will manage the new offering, the people said.
It plans to meet investors in the Middle East for two days
starting Sept. 10. </p>
<p>''If the investors conclude that Goldman Sachs is going to
take this money into their books and use it to finance their
conventional activities, then the investors are going to remain
a little bit shy,'' Harris Irfan, managing director at European
Islamic Investment Bank, said by phone from London yesterday,
noting the new structure has solved the par-value obstacle, but
not issues with transparency. ''I do hope they will be more
transparent on the flow of money,'' he said. </p>
<h2>Main Critic </h2>
<p>Still, the presence of ADIB on the deal is ''very
positive'' as it was one of the main critics of Goldman Sachs''
earlier plans, Irfan said. The Shariah boards of ADIB and EIIB
share one scholar, according to the lenders'' websites. ADIB''s
outsourced public relations company didn''t answer e-mailed
questions yesterday, and Sophie Ramsay, spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs in London, declined to comment by telephone. </p>
<p>About $72 billion of sukuk have been sold globally in the
year through yesterday, compared with $80 billion in the same
period in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''Islamic finance is a growing market both in terms of
issuers and investors,'' Hussain said. ''Goldman Sachs clearly
has decided that they want to play a role in this market both as
an issuer and I am sure also as an arranger and adviser.'' </p>

<p>Iron-ore''s plunge to five-year lows
would make exports from Brazilian producers including Cia.
Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) and Gerdau SA (GGBR4) unprofitable, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>About 50 million metric tons a year of Brazilian iron-ore
output would be unprofitable at prices that last week fell below
$84 a ton for the first time since 2009, Goldman analysts led by
Marcelo Aguiar said in a research note today. While local
transport costs probably will decline and make exports more
viable, the reduction won''t be immediate, they said. </p>
<p>Miners that don''t have their own railway and port
operations ''will likely be under strong pressure in the short-and near-term given the low iron-ore price environment,'' the
Sao Paulo-based analysts wrote. ''The low profitability of
Brazilian small and mid-size iron-ore miners could be a barrier
for export volume growth from Brazil in the near term.'' </p>
<p>Iron-ore, the key ingredient in the production of steel,
has lost 38 percent this year on signs of weakening demand
growth in China as Vale SA, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto
Group, the three largest producers, increase output, betting
higher volumes will force less competitive mines to close. </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of Qingdao
fell 0.6 percent to $83.50 a dry ton today, the lowest since
Sept. 22, 2009, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. </p>
<h2>Projects'' Jeopardy </h2>
<p>Gerdau declined to comment on Goldman''s analysis when
contacted by Bloomberg News today. CSN, the second-largest
listed Brazilian iron-ore company, didn''t reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. Either did Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA, also listed by Goldman as a producer that would have export
losses at current prices. </p>
<p>Only Rio de Janeiro-based Vale (VALE5), the world''s largest iron-ore producer, would generate positive operating cash flow in
Brazil at current prices, Goldman also said in the note. </p>
<p>Several Brazil iron-ore projects expected to start
producing in the next five years would be canceled or halted
because of the lower prices of the raw material, putting at risk
about 45 million tons a year of expansion potential, the
analysts said. </p>

<p>Taiwanese insurers'' yearly premium income has more than
doubled in the past decade as China''s export-manufacturing boom
boosted the island''s wealth. Their hunt for fixed-income
investments has cut the 10-year sovereign yield 116 basis points
in the past 10 years to 1.71 percent, the 13th-lowest globally,
compared with 2.49 percent in the U.S. </p>
<p>''With Taiwan''s very low benchmark-rate environment, a lot
of domestic-currency investments have low yields,'' said Godwin Chang, head of Taiwan at Societe Generale AG, which sold $1.21
billion of bonds in the territory this year. ''Life insurers are
better off having more foreign-currency investments.'' </p>
<h2>Negative Spread </h2>
<p>The central bank cut its policy rate to a record low 1.25
percent in 2009 and maintained it at 1.875 percent in the past
13 quarters. As domestic rates fell, life insurance firms
boosted holdings of foreign assets to 44 percent as of June 30
from 38 percent at the end of 2011, according to the Taiwan
Insurance Institute. </p>
<p>The insurance industry''s 3.8 percent weighted average
liability cost was significantly higher than its recurring
investment yield of 2.8 percent in 2013, according to a June
presentation by the financial regulator. </p>
<p>Goldman issued its zero-coupon, 30-year bonds at a price to
yield 4.96 percent last week. Morgan Stanley''s notes due 2044
paid a coupon of 4.7 percent and Citigroup''s similar-maturity,
zero-coupon debt was sold at 4.88 percent. All of the dollar
notes sold on the island since May''s amendment are callable by
the issuer and mature in 20 or 30 years, while 74 percent pay
zero coupon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign-currency notes issued in Taiwan are called Formosa bonds. </p>
<p>Callable notes are popular among insurers, which can demand
higher yields to boost returns, J.P. Morgan strategists led by
Joshua Younger wrote in an Aug. 22 note. </p>
<p>''Because they are considered domestic investments from a
regulatory perspective, Formosa bonds are generally compared
against Taiwan dollar-denominated fixed-income products,'' the
strategists wrote. ''With Taiwan dollar rates quite low by
comparison, yield-sensitive investors are likely to lower their
return targets for U.S. dollar callable Formosa bonds relative
to those registered overseas.'' </p>
<h2>Bond Sales </h2>
<p>The May 20 amendment also spurred issuances in yuan bonds,
with lenders such as Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of
China Ltd. selling 9.3 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of debt in
Taiwan since then, compared with 1.5 billion yuan in the first
four months of 2014. </p>
<p>Local insurers'' total annual premium income grew an average
8 percent in each of the last 10 years to NT$2.7 trillion ($90
billion) in 2013 from NT$1.2 trillion in 2003, according to
Financial Supervisory Commission data. Premiums collected added
up to 17.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, the
world''s highest penetration rate, a Swiss Re Ltd. report shows. </p>
<h2>Insurer Interest </h2>
<p>For insurers whose investments abroad haven''t yet neared
the 45 percent limit, the locally issued foreign-currency bonds
are not the most attractive. Cathay Life Insurance Co. (2882), the
largest in the industry with NT$4.3 trillion of assets, has
bought very few of the foreign-currency notes as they offer
rates lower than similar securities overseas, executive vice
president Joseph Wang said at an Aug. 29 briefing. </p>
<p>Other companies have been more enthusiastic. Shinkong
Insurance Co. (2850) has spent NT$42.8 billion on locally issued
foreign debt and plans to buy more to boost returns, according
to an Aug. 28 presentation. Fubon Life Insurance Co. aims to
increase its holdings to NT$100 billion within a year, the
Economic Daily News reported on Aug. 22. </p>
<p>All of the dollar debt sold in Taiwan since May''s rule
change has been bought by the insurance industry, according to
Mark Liu, Taipei-based head of global markets at Societe
Generale. The French bank is speaking with European companies
both in and outside the financial sector regarding bond
issuances in Taiwan, Chang said. </p>
<h2>Expectations Tempered </h2>
<p>This may be a good time to sell debt as borrowing costs
will probably rise. Eight of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg poll
expect Taiwan to raise its policy rate at least once by the end
of this year. The island''s economy is showing signs of a
recovery this year. Data yesterday showed exports grew 9.6
percent in August, the most in 20 months. Sixty-six percent of
Taiwan''s shipments went to China, which this week posted a
record trade surplus for August. </p>
<p>In the U.S., 62 of 74 economists in another survey see a
Federal Reserve interest-rate increase by the third quarter of
next year. </p>
<p>Investors have already tempered their expectations for a
rate increase, according to Cosmas Lu, chief executive officer
at the Taipei branch of Barclays Plc, which lists its $600
million of 30-year bonds on the bond exchange GreTai Securities
Market today. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have declined 54
basis points in 2014 as Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled the
monetary authority''s commitment to low borrowing costs amid
mixed U.S. economic data. </p>
<p>''Taiwan''s investors have been pretty quiet in the first
half of the year, waiting for interest rates to rise, which
didn''t happen,'' Lu said in an Aug. 27 phone interview. ''So
they''re very cash-rich and they realize they can''t wait forever.
There''s definitely very big demand from investors.'' </p>

<p>New York state''s pension fund is
giving Goldman Sachs Asset Management $2 billion to invest in
global stocks. </p>
<p>It''s the first time the $180.7 billion fund has formed such
a partnership, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, the pension''s
sole trustee, said today in a statement. In addition to
investing the funds with equity managers, the unit of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will also provide advice across the pension''s
remaining $98 billion equity portfolio. </p>
<p>''Identifying new opportunities is key to the continued
growth of the fund''s long-term value,'' DiNapoli said. It will
give the pension ''full access to world-class global equity
investment opportunities and the nimbleness to take advantage of
them on a timely basis.'' </p>
<p>New York joins public pension funds including New Jersey,
New York City and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas in
making big allocations of capital to investment managers that
can be deployed more quickly and across different strategies.
Such separately managed accounts offer cheaper fees and more
control for investors, who in turn agree to commit large sums
for a decade or more. </p>
<h2>''Landmark'' Deal </h2>
<p>In 2011, Texas committed as much as $3 billion each to KKR
 Co. (KKR) and Apollo Global Management LLC, while New Jersey gave as
much as $1.5 billion to Blackstone Group LP. New Jersey''s State
Investment Council said the deal would save the state about $120
million. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s partnership with New York state is the
largest it has ever done, said Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for
the bank. </p>
<p>In 2008, the South Carolina Retirement System Investment
Commission created several strategic partnerships, including one
with Goldman Sachs. The firm managed $1.15 billion as of June
30, 2013, according to a report from the state. </p>
<p>In 2010, New York-based Goldman Sachs received $500 million
from the Alaska Permanent Fund to manage with a goal of
returning 5 percentage points more than inflation. The bank had
$725 million at the end of July, and had returned 8.03 percent
in the past three years, ahead of its 6.79 percent target,
according to a report from the Alaskan fund. </p>
<p>Timothy O''Neill and Eric Lane, global co-heads of the
investment management division at Goldman Sachs, said the New
York deal is a ''landmark assignment'' for the firm. </p>
<p>''We are excited to provide customized access to our broad
open-architecture platform, due diligence expertise and
portfolio construction capabilities,'' they said jointly in the
e-mailed statement from DiNapoli. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s alternative investments and manager
selection group, run by Chris Kojima, supervises $156 billion,
Raphael said. The unit selects and performs due diligence on
long-only portfolio managers for institutional investors, in
addition to running funds of funds in private equity and hedge
funds. </p>

<p>Iron ore declined sooner than
expected this year as supplies exceeded demand and prices are
unlikely to recover, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
which said 2014 will mark the end of a so-called iron age. </p>
<p>This year ''is the inflection point where new production
capacity finally catches up with demand growth, and profit
margins begin their reversion to the historical mean,'' analysts
Christian Lelong and Amber Cai wrote in a report today titled:
''The end of the Iron Age.''  The 2016 forecast for seaborne ore
was cut to $79 a metric ton from $82 and the 2017 outlook was
reduced to $78 from $85, according to the New-York based bank,
which stuck with a forecast for $80 next year. </p>
<p>The raw material tumbled into a bear market this year as
the biggest producers including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group expanded low-cost output, betting higher volumes would more than offset
falling prices while less competitive mines were forced to
close. The decline in prices came sooner than expected,
according to Goldman, which said in November that iron ore would
probably drop at least 15 percent this year. The commodity is
seen in a structural downtrend, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said today. </p>
<p>''The price decline has been dramatic, but a weak demand
outlook in China and the structural nature of the surplus make a
recovery unlikely,'' Lelong and Cai wrote. ''Lower prices for
iron ore and steel are unlikely to boost demand in a material
way. Instead, the day when steel production in China will peak
gets ever closer.'' </p>
<h2>Lowest Level </h2>
<p>Ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of Qingdao
fell 39 percent to $82.22 a dry ton this year, the lowest level
since September 2009, according to data from Metal Bulletin Ltd.
The Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM), which doesn''t include iron ore as
a member, lost 2 percent in the period. Within the index,
soybeans fell the most. </p>
<p>Before the surplus emerged, iron ore supplies were tight
and producers had above-trend profits even as costs increased,
according to Lelong and Cai. That period, dubbed by the bank as
the Iron Age, is now ending, they wrote. </p>
<p>''The current exploitation phase in iron ore could last for
a decade,'' the analysts wrote. ''Iron ore markets went through
a 20-year period of declining prices in real terms during the
previous exploitation phase that ended in 2004.'' </p>
<p>The global surplus will more than triple to 163 million
tons in 2015 from 52 million tons this year, according to
Goldman. The glut was seen expanding to 245 million tons in 2016
295 million tons in 2017 and 334 million tons in 2018. </p>
<h2>Producers'' View </h2>
<p>The biggest suppliers see higher prices. Ore may increase
as the higher-cost output exits the market, Nev Power, chief
executive officer of Perth-based Fortescue (FMG) Metals Group Ltd.,
said in an Aug. 20 interview on Bloomberg Television. Vale SA
also sees prices rebounding as supply growth slows and mines
close, Jose Carlos Martins, the Rio de Janeiro-based company''s
head of ferrous and strategy, said on July 31. </p>
<p>Iron ore may see a dramatic recovery this half, Paul Gait,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a report on July 9,
citing factors including a seasonal increase in the second six
months and an end to China''s policy tightening. Asia''s largest
economy accounts for about 67 percent of seaborne demand. </p>
<p>Credit growth in China missed estimates in July and new-home prices fell in almost all the cities the government tracks,
putting pressure on policy makers to step up stimulus as they
seek to meet an economic growth target of 7.5 percent. </p>
<p>About 110 million tons of global supply will close next
year and a further 75 million tons in 2016, Goldman estimated in
the report. While the majority of closures would be in China,
seaborne producers will not go unscathed, it said. </p>
<h2>''Exceed Demand'' </h2>
<p>''New seaborne iron ore supply delivered into China is
expected to exceed demand growth over the next three to four
years,'' Daniel Kang, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Hong

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
scrapped its forecast for the Reserve Bank of India to raise
borrowing costs after a pickup in monsoon rains and a drop in
oil prices tempered the inflation outlook. </p>
<p>The U.S. lender, which had expected a 50-basis-point
increase in the benchmark repurchase rate this year followed by
a reduction of the same magnitude in the second half of 2015,
now sees the RBI staying on hold through the end of next year,
it said in a report. Consumer-price (INFUTOTY) gains slowed to 7.8 percent
in August, from as high as 11.16 percent in November, the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey shows before data due Sept. 12. </p>
<p>''Near-term risks to inflation have receded due to weaker
oil prices and a significantly improved monsoon,'' Tushar Poddar, an economist at Goldman in Mumbai, wrote in the report
dated yesterday. ''While our base case is now for the RBI to
remain on hold, the probability of a rate hike is higher than
that of a rate cut. The biggest change under the new government
has been a more investor-friendly mindset.'' </p>
<p>Measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took
office after a landslide election win in May, will spur economic
growth, lure capital inflows and support the rupee, Goldman said
in the report. A shortfall in India''s annual rains, crucial for
crops from sugar to rice and cotton, has narrowed to 11 percent
from more than 40 percent in June, official data show, and Brent
crude prices have retreated 14 percent from this year''s high of
$115.71 per barrel in June. </p>
<h2>Quickening Growth </h2>
<p>Goldman predicts Asia''s third-largest economy will expand
5.6 percent in the fiscal year through March 2015. Gross
domestic product increased 4.7 percent in the previous period, a
pace that was near the decade-low 4.5 percent recorded the year
before. The U.S. lender still sees the rupee weakening to 61 per
dollar, 62 and 63 in three, six and 12 months. The currency fell
0.4 percent to 60.8225 as of 9:21 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
prices from local banks. </p>
<p>RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, who raised borrowing costs
three times in the past year to combat inflation, has left them
unchanged since January. The central bank will hold the
benchmark rate at 8 percent through the end of 2014, according
to 16 of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Four see a reduction
to 7.75 percent, while five estimate a 25-basis-point increase
and one expects an advance to 8.5 percent. </p>
<p>Modi''s decisions to cut red tape and allow more foreign
investment in industries including railways and defense have
buoyed investor confidence, Goldman said in the report. The
rupee has rebounded 13 percent from a record low of 68.845 per
dollar reached in August 2013, the world''s best-performing
emerging-market currency over that period, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>''We think the Indian rupee will continue to trade in a
narrow range, with the RBI intervening to prevent any sharp
appreciation,'' Goldman''s Poddar wrote. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and 21st Century Fox Inc. are in discussions to supply Sony Corp. (6758) with programming for its planned Internet-based TV service, according to people familiar with the conversations. </p> <p>Disney and Fox would join Viacom Inc. (VIAB), which said yesterday it will provide 22 networks, the first time the media company, headed by Chairman Sumner Redstone, has made its shows available for a Web-based service. The deal covers live and on-demand programming, Viacom and Sony said in a statement. </p> <p>Sony''s service will debut with ''major programmers,'' according to yesterday''s statement. The company wouldn''t specify when, or identify potential partners. No deal with Disney or Fox is imminent, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Sony shares rose. </p> <p>''Sony is clearly beefing up content offerings for its growth plans for its Entertainment Network division, recently merged with its gaming unit,'' Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore, said by e-mail. </p> <p>Television, telephone and technology companies are exploring cable-like packages streamed over the Internet to reach younger viewers who aren''t signing up for traditional cable and satellite TV. Progress has been slow. Intel Corp. (INTC) abandoned a planned Web-TV service this year. Dish Network Corp. (DISH) secured rights to carry Disney channels like ESPN in an online package separate from its satellite-TV business. </p> <h2>Verizon Plans </h2> <p>Verizon Communications Inc. is planning an Internet-based offering by mid-2015 after acquiring the supporting technology from Intel Corp. earlier this year, Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said today at a Goldman Sachs conference in New York. Verizon''s mobile-video-streaming technology could let it offer live video from major broadcasters along with on-demand programming, he said. </p> <p>The Viacom deal with Sony took a more than a year to complete after a preliminary accord. </p> <p>''It''ll benefit every party in the ecosystem we have all enjoyed,'' Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman said yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference. </p> <p>Dauman praised the ''elegant consumer interface'' of Sony''s service and said the Tokyo-based company was a natural partner given the popularity of its gaming devices among the young viewers who watch Viacom''s cable channels. </p> <p>Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA), Time Warner Inc. (TWX) and Starz are also among the companies discussing offering their programs through Sony, the New York Times reported earlier. </p> <h2>Numerous Partners </h2> <p>''The service will launch with numerous major network partners, but we aren''t providing specifics at this time including who we are speaking to,'' Sean Yoneda, a spokesman for Sony in the U.S., said in an e-mail. </p> <p>Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman for Disney''s ESPN, declined to say whether the network was speaking to Sony. </p> <p>''We remain platform agnostic and are always looking for new and innovative ways to serve our fans, consistent with the approach we are taking with our current distribution partners,'' LaPlaca said in an e-mail. </p> <p>Nathaniel Brown, a spokesman for Fox (FOXA), declined to comment. </p> <p>The partnership announced yesterday unites more than 75 million Internet-enabled Sony devices in U.S. homes with Viacom''s programming, Sony said. Viewers can watch shows such as ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and ''Teen Wolf'' on TVs, game consoles and Blu-ray players. </p> <h2>Boosting Investment </h2> <p>Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai has boosted investment in content production and TV networks as he pushes his ''One Sony'' vision to unite products, including mobile devices and TVs, with games, music and films as it competes against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world''s biggest maker of phones and televisions. </p> <p>Sony shares rose 2.7 percent to 2,105 yen at the close in Tokyo. The company''s American depositary receipts climbed 1.2 percent to $19.74 at 10:14 a.m. in New York. Viacom shares were little changed at $79.86. </p> <p>''A good lineup is important for this service because users will choose a service with a lot of content,'' said Hideki Yasuda, a Tokyo-based analyst at Ace Research Institute. ''It''s also a way for Sony to differentiate itself from Samsung.'' </p> <p>Viacom owns and operates the largest basic-cable portfolio in the U.S. by audience share, said Sony, citing Nielsen data. The cloud-based TV service will stream Comedy Central, VH1 and Spike, among others, as well as Viacom''s full video-on-demand package. </p> <p>The deal earlier this year with Burbank, California-based Disney gave Dish, Charlie Ergen''s satellite-TV company, rights to carry the Disney Channel, ABC and ESPN. That put Dish ahead of Sony in the race to become the first to offer a service known as over-the-top, or OTT, because it runs over an Internet connection. </p> <h2>OTT Stalled </h2> <p>Negotiations for the right to stream popular TV channels have slowed the development of every planned OTT service, because distributors need a minimum number of channels to offer a product robust enough to compete with traditional pay-TV. Every major TV programmer has explored such deals. </p> <p>''What they are trying to do is figure out a way to get younger consumers and some cohorts that are not obviously going to subscribe to big packages and bundles of channels, and give them really an on-ramp to starting in the experience of subscribing and getting something that fits them,'' Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said at the Goldman conference. </p> <p>''It''s a very worthy thing to try to figure this out.'' </p> <p>', 'Disney, Fox Weigh Joining Sony''s Web-TV Service', 'By Lucas Shaw and Anousha Sakoui', 'Sep 11, 2014 10:17 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-11/fox-disney-said-to-weigh-joining-sony-s-web-tv-service.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Cash is dirty and flimsy. It comes with no official rebate or reward programs. Worst of all, you can''t stuff it into a smartphone or laptop to pay for something online. </p><p>Yet there are no real substitutes for cold hard cash. Despite predictions of a cashless society, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the U.S. Mint churn out more currency and coins every year. The average American still uses cash for dozens of transaction each month, despite the wealth of alternatives, from good old plastic to virtual currencies to ''point and pay'' apps like the upcoming Apple Pay service. </p><p>Cash has advantages these high-tech replacements can''t match. It won''t run out of battery power, for one thing. It''s anonymous -- invisible to the IRS, law enforcement and hackers, as well as to irritating marketers and data brokers. As Cass Sunstein notes, paying only in cash can also be a great way to monitor spending and stick to a budget.</p><p>The average person pays with cash about 23 times a month, according to an analysis by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. While credit card use has doubled since 2000 and debit card use is up fivefold, cash is still used more often than either option. It''s most often used for transactions under $25, even by those who claim to prefer credit or debit cards overall. And 40 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds say cash is their preferred form of payment. </p><p>Some $1.2 trillion in cash circulates outside of banks -- 15,000 tons worth. That''s up 20 percent since 2011, and is the equivalent of $3,836 squeezed under the mattresses of every U.S. man, woman and child.</p><p>The location of all these "Benjamins" -- it''s mostly in $100 bills -- is a puzzle to economists and currency experts. When asked how much money they kept in their wallet or house, the average U.S. respondent said a little more than $40 in the wallet and $100 in the house, according to a 2013 Tufts University study. </p><p>Some of the money may be overseas. Less than a quarter of U.S. currency resides abroad, estimates University of Wisconsin economist Edgar Feige. Where''s the rest? Legitimate business owners and those without bank accounts rely heavily on cash. And some is hidden away by the real-life equivalents of Breaking Bad''s Walter White in an underground ''cash only'' economy. The U.S. may lose more than $100 billion a year in taxes on unreported income of over $400 billion, according to the Tufts study and others. </p><p>Using cash can help people carefully track their own spending, as Sunstein says. But one of its most convenient features is that it keeps everyone else in the dark.</p><p>More stories by Ben Steverman:</p>

<p>Ukraine''s deteriorating economic
outlook is increasing the likelihood of a default that could

capital outflows and disrupted economic output to the point

<p>''None of the U.S. expansions of
the past 40 years died in bed of old age,'' the late
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor
Rudiger Dornbusch observed in 1997. ''Every one was murdered by
the Federal Reserve.'' </p>
<p>As investors brace for interest-rate increases by the Fed
and the Bank of England, the message from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. is that the economic recovery and animal spirits of
financial markets will abide in most major economies. </p>
<p>The bank, which made $1.63 billion from its equities
division in the second quarter, bases its call on its analysis
of 33 interest-rate tightening cycles since the mid-1980s in
economies including the U.S., U.K. Germany and Canada. </p>
<p>''Our bottom line is that a shift to higher yields need not
be a roadblock to ongoing economic and market progress,'' Noah Weisberger, a New York-based economist, said in a report
published Sept. 10. ''Markets may well be able to adjust to a
new rate regime without much loss of momentum.'' </p>
<p>The analysis shows policy rates rise about 150 basis points
in a typical cycle, which lasts about 12 months. There''s another
four years or so before a subsequent recession. </p>
<p>Annualized economic growth averages almost 4 percent in the
four quarters before the tightening and loses only about 20
basis points during the cycle before slowing to just over 2
percent in the subsequent year. </p>
<p>''Despite current concerns, historically, rate cycles seem
to leave economic growth largely intact at the outset, and, over
the longer term, tend to slow economic growth without disrupting
it,'' according to the report. </p>
<h2>Financial Markets </h2>
<p>As for financial markets, 10-year yields move an average 40
basis points in the year leading up to the first rate increase
and equity markets grow an average 9 percent into the onset. In
the full year after the hikes begin, stocks post 12 percent
returns on average. </p>
<p>Given sluggish growth and labor-market slack in the U.S.
and Europe, central banks will be careful not to douse the
expansion when they do start raising, Weisberger said. </p>
<p>''Despite heightened worries about the market and economic
implications of the removal of monetary accommodation, our read
of the historical evidence is that such concerns are likely
misplaced and overdone, he said. </p>

market value of $620 million, comes as Aberdeen Asset Management
Plc sees Russian small-capitalization stocks as ''ridiculously
cheap'' after a sell-off. The MSCI Russia Small Cap Index is
down 22 percent this year, following a broad decline in the
country''s securities amid concern sanctions against Russia over
the Ukraine war will squelch economic growth. The U.S. and
European Union enforced new measures last week. </p>
<p>MD Medical gained 3.1 percent to $8.25 in London on Sept.
12, reducing its loss this year to 27 percent. Trading volume of
67,016 shares was 4.2 times the average of the past three
months. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index rose 0.4 percent as
energy exporters including OAO Surgutneftegas and OAO Gazprom
Neft gained on speculation a weaker ruble will boost profits. </p>
<p>JPMorgan cited the stock''s ''compelling 30 percent
discount'' to peers in eastern Europe and the Middle East when
it raised MD Medical from the equivalent of hold. Analyst Elena Jouronova forecast compound annual revenue growth of 26 percent
through 2017 as regional expansion gathers pace, according to an
e-mailed research note. </p>
<h2>GDP Slowdown </h2>
<p>Growth in Russia''s $2 trillion economy has been slowed by
the international sanctions intended to punish President
Vladimir Putin for allegedly supporting the rebellion in eastern
Ukraine, a claim he denies. Barclays Plc., which projects a 0.1
percent decline in gross domestic product this year and a 0.6
percent contraction in 2015, said in a Sept. 11 research note
that new measures ''imply downside risks'' to that forecast. </p>
<p>Luis Saenz, head of equity sales and trading at BCS
Financial Group in London, said MD Medical isn''t as vulnerable
to the slowdown as other companies whose revenue comes from
domestic spending. </p>
<p>''They focus on high-end maternity health care and are
diversifying operations throughout Russia,'' Saenz said by
phone. ''Even as the economy slows, people won''t cut spending on
maternity health care because it''s so critical.'' </p>
<h2>Sales Estimates </h2>
<p>MD Medical, which has 17 medical centers throughout Russia
including in Moscow, St.Petersburg, Perm, Samara and Irkutsk,
said on Aug. 20 that it bought Avicenne Medical Center in
Novosibirk for $45.5 million. The acquisition will help the
company increase revenue, according to JP Morgan''s Jouronova and
Saenz of BCS. </p>
<p>JP Morgan raised MD Medical''s revenue forecast by as 4.6
percent to $204 million for 2014 and increased its 2015 sales
estimate by 5.6 percent to $265 million, according to the bank''s
research note. </p>
<p>''Their business model is beautiful, but low liquidity in
Russian small-capitalization stocks is a problem'' Saenz said.
''Investors are worried about the geopolitical risks and want to
be able to get in and out of the market quickly.'' </p>
<p>The Micex Second-Tier Index of companies with lower market
capitalization fell 1 percent to 2,959.65 last week, extending
the decline this year to 4.9 percent. The benchmark Micex Index
dropped 1.1 percent last week to 1,458.52 and is down 3 percent
this year. The Bloomberg index of the most-trade Russian stocks
in the U.S. slid 3.3 percent to 85.46 in the five days through
Sept. 12 and has retreated 16 percent in 2014. </p>
<h2>Fund Flows </h2>
<p>''Within the Russian space, the small-caps have sold off
ridiculously,'' Peter Taylor, a senior investment manager for
global emerging markets at Aberdeen Asset Management in London,
said in an interview on Sept. 5. ''Liquidity has completely
dried up. There are Russian small caps that are decent
businesses that are just looking ridiculously cheap.'' </p>
<p>MD Medical is a ''nice business,'' Taylor said. ''The
management team impresses us and the business model is an
attractive structural story in Russia and yet that stock has
just gone so off year-to-date.'' </p>
<p>Futures (VEA) on the dollar-denominated RTS index expiring this
month gained 0.7 percent to 122,230 in U.S. hours on Sept. 12.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
futures, declined 1.2 percent to 32.19. </p>
<p>The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that tracks the nation''s stocks, fell 3 percent last
week to $24.57. It gained 0.5 percent on Sept. 12. </p>
<p>Russia-dedicated funds attracted about $140 million in the
week through Sept. 10, after outflows in the previous week,
Cameron Brandt, research director at EPFR Global, a Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based company that tracks fund flows, said by e-mail. </p>

<p>The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is that acquisitions are about gaining great talent. Just last week, Tim Cook told Charlie Rose that one of the main reasons Apple bought Beats was for "incredible talent." The Valley even has its own term for an acquisition based solely on hiring: "acquihire."</p><p>But that''s not why Microsoft is spending $2.5 billion for Mojang. The purveyor of all things Xbox is buying the Swedish developer for the mega-hit video game Minecraft. That''s it. While Mojang says the "vast majority" of employees are expected to stick around until after the deal closes, the three founders are leaving right away. That includes Markus "Notch" Persson, the face of the company.</p><p>The headline on Microsoft''s press release is telling: "Minecraft to join Microsoft." Not Mojang. Minecraft. That''s a pragmatic way to describe the deal: Just about every kid and parent has heard of Minecraft, which has sold more than 54 million copies, comprising virtually all of the small studio''s revenue. But Microsoft seems to indicate that this isn''t about cultivating an eccentric group of independent-minded game designers; it''s about Minecraft.</p><p>Microsoft declined to comment on its acquisition strategy, referring us to a generic statement that reads: "Microsoft has acquired Mojang and the iconic Minecraft franchise. We''re honored to partner with them to carry Minecraft forward."</p><p>Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox who led the Minecraft deal, seems to place a premium on franchises. He also helped broker Microsoft''s purchase of the Gears of War franchise in January from Epic Games, a high-profile developer led by antagonistic creatives. In the announcement, Spencer noted that the shooter series "has a very strong, passionate and valued fan base on Xbox." They''ve bought 22 million copies of the Gears of War games, grossing more than $1 billion, he added.</p><p>The focus on cultivating successful franchises, rather than brilliant but sometimes fickle visionaries, makes a lot of sense, says Billy Pidgeon, an independent consultant to the games industry. Video games are a lot like Hollywood, and a recognizable title goes a long way.</p><p>Microsoft''s talent plays haven''t always produced results. In 2002, the company bought Rare, the British studio behind some of the most beloved Nintendo games including Donkey Kong Country and GoldenEye 007. Rare didn''t own most of the franchises it worked on, and it hasn''t produced a major hit under Microsoft. Founders Tim and Chris Stamper left Microsoft in 2007.</p><p>Bungie Software joined Microsoft in 2000, a year before releasing the first in its blockbuster Halo series. The developer created five Halo games until the relationship became untenable. Microsoft agreed in 2007 to spin off Bungie into an independent company, without Halo. Microsoft established its own development team devoted to Halo, and that group is creating a new version of Halo every year. Each one has been selling well. Meanwhile, Bungie teamed up with Activision to release Destiny on Sept. 9. That''s already on track to be a massive franchise, generating $500 million in revenue in its first day available.</p><p>In addition to Halo, Microsoft lists a series called Fable among its "global blockbuster franchises." That one came from the 2006 acquisition of Lionhead Studios. The company, also British, was started a decade earlier by Peter Molyneux, who''s somewhat legendary in the gaming world for his innovative games, grand visions and over-promising. Molyneux, who has a lot of fans and critics, resigned in 2012.</p><p>"The thing with games is it can be more volatile, and you''re really dependent on the talent: You lose them, and you''re in a bad place," says Pidgeon. "Franchises are always worthwhile. As long as you continue to keep the quality and continue to develop it in line with expectations, it can be really valuable. It''s guaranteed to sell. As long as there are millions of people playing it, they''ll continue to play it. The games business is very hit-driven."</p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), maker of the Xbox video-game console, agreed to acquire Mojang AB, the software company behind the popular game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion, in a bid to boost its Xbox and mobile businesses. </p> <p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, said Stockholm-based Mojang will join its game-studio division, though the company''s founders will move on to other projects. The purchase is projected to close late this year, and will break even in fiscal 2015, Microsoft said today in a statement. </p> <p>Buying Mojang would be the biggest deal struck since Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft''s chief executive officer in February, succeeding Steve Ballmer. The purchase gives Nadella a game that is popular across consoles, computers and mobile devices made by Microsoft and rivals like Apple Inc. It also bolsters a push to woo serious gamers back to Xbox after a lackluster attempt to turn the system into an all-in-one device that serves up broader content such as movies and music. </p> <p>''Acquiring the Minecraft game through the Mojang acquisition gives Mr. Nadella  Co. the right product at the right time as the company continues to invest in its Xbox strategy and begins its foray into the intensely competitive mobile-phone space with Nokia now under Microsoft''s hood and the restructuring plan under way,'' Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO)''s newest social-media campaign reaches back to a time when even MySpace didn''t exist. </p> <p>Surge, a citrus-flavored Mountain Dew knockoff that was discontinued by Coke about 12 years ago, has reappeared in limited supply today. The only place to get it: Amazon.com. </p> <p>Billed as the company''s first ever e-commerce reintroduction, the news was announced by the Facebook Fan site ''Surge Movement,'' whose 128,000 members lobbied for its return and paid for a billboard in Atlanta. Coke gave the drink a Twitter account, too, so loyalists can ''follow the brand''s journey.'' </p> <p>''Surge is back,'' the Facebook page''s organizers said, urging readers to buy and spread the word. ''The Movement does not end here!'' </p> <p>At the website listserv.com, Surge is listed as No. 7 on a Top 10 list of discontinued sodas, beating out Hubba Bubba Soda. Surge, a sweet and caffeinated green pop, will be sold in 12-packs of 16-ounce cans printed with the original graphics for $14. Coke said it may expand the drink to other retailers and add to the campaign, depending on how consumers react. </p> <p>''This will be a great learning experience for us and a refreshing opportunity for fans,'' Wendy Clark, Coke''s president of North America Sparkling  Strategic Marketing, said in a statement. </p> <p>Scott Williamson, a Coke spokesman, declined to say how much of the drink the company has produced intially. </p> <h2>''Extremely Rare'' </h2> <p>Coca-Cola has struggled for decades to counter PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)''s Mountain Dew juggernaut. Surge was one of those efforts. Introduced in 1996, the last bottles and cans were offered in 2001, two years before the social-networking site Myspace debuted. Facebook would come even later. </p> <p>At the Surge Movement Facebook page, founded just before Christmas 2011, fans shared a 1997 commercial for the drink. Another post showed a way to get ''extremely rare'' Surge syrup on Ebay.com. One fan photo shows an artifact that was discovered at a flea market in Okoboji, Iowa: a giant Surge bottle once used at events to ice down drink samples. </p> <p>''I stole one of these when Surge first came out,'' one commenter responded. ''Sadly, it was lost at the top of Happy Jack Mountains outside of Laramie Wyoming when someone got in it and tried to ride it down a mountain. It was a prize possession.'' </p> <p>The group sold ''The Surge Movement'' t-shirts, and it crowdfunded a $4,000 billboard near Coke headquarters in Atlanta that read: ''Dear Coke, We couldn''t buy Surge so we bought this billboard instead.'' It''s the largest to ''pledge'' for the revival of any discontinued product. </p> <h2>Mountain Dew </h2> <p>The site''s managers urged fans to call Coca-Cola routinely with reminders like, ''Did you make your call today?'' A mysterious undated video posted yesterday showed the Facebook page''s administrators meeting at a hotel in Atlanta. Users wanted to know why but they weren''t saying. </p> <p>It''s no wonder Coke keeps trying. Mountain Dew, the fourth-best-selling soft drink in the U.S., has been one of the few bright spots in PepsiCo''s soda lineup in recent years as consumers drink less soda. Popular with teens, video gamers and extreme sports enthusiasts, Mountain Dew outperformed both the soda category and Pepsi-Cola last year, according to Beverage Digest data. </p> <p>Coke may have found its opening, though. Dew''s volume sales declined last year. Sales volume for regular Dew fell 2.2 percent, compared with declines of 3.6 percent for Pepsi-Cola and 3 percent for the category. </p> <p>', 'Coca-Cola Brings Back Surge Soda to Tap 1990s Nostalgia', 'By Duane D.

<p>Thomas Lee, the former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who spent 24 years at some
of Wall Street''s biggest firms, has started a seven-person
research boutique. </p>
<p>Lee, 45, left New York-based JPMorgan in March to start
Fundstrat Global Advisors with John Bai, former head of Asia and
U.S. equity sales at Mizuho Securities, according to a statement
today from the new company. Lee, who started at Kidder Peabody 
Co. in 1993 and worked at Salomon Smith Barney before joining
JPMorgan in 1999, will lead a research team of four, while Bai
oversees sales. </p>
<p>''I''ve had an itch for a long time to start my own thing,''
Lee said last week in a telephone interview. Covering the
wireless industry ''from its infancy basically to its apex''
over 15 years instilled a desire to attempt to create something
of his own, he said. </p>
<p>Lee deferred that wish while being the lead equity
strategist at the biggest U.S. bank since 2007, calling for
gains in American stocks for six straight years and getting them
in four. It was a ''really rough road'' being bullish at the
start of his tenure, he said. </p>
<p>''Everyone hated equities,'' Lee said. ''We turned it into
something people found a lot of value in, because people began
to trust us.'' </p>
<h2>More Accurate </h2>
<p>Lee was bullish at the start of each of six full years as
chief equity strategist, forecasting an average annual gain of
14 percent in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) over the period.
He was more accurate than the average of strategist forecasts in
four of the six years, including 2012 and 2013. </p>
<p>At Fundstrat, Lee will combine an overview of markets,
similar to his work at JPMorgan, with calls on specific
industries and stocks, he said. </p>
<p>''It''s a chance to produce a strategy product that would be
very difficult'' at a big bank, he said. ''It''s very difficult
when you''re at JPMorgan to have a view on a stock if the analyst
has a different view. We are freer to take much more contrarian
views at the stock level.'' </p>
<p>Another strategist, Deutsche Bank AG''s John-Paul Smith, is
also leaving to start an independent-research firm. Smith, 53,
is forming Eclectic Strategy with Emad Mostaque, he said in an
e-mail. Smith was previously at Morgan Stanley, where he
correctly predicted Russia''s stock-market crash in 1998. </p>
<h2>Client Partnerships </h2>
<p>Smaller firms also allow a greater level of partnership
with clients who don''t have to worry that their trades or
strategy will be shared with thousands of other market
participants, Lee said. </p>
<p>Wall Street banks are losing research market share to
smaller competitors, according to financial-services consulting
firm Greenwich Associates. Analysts departing big firms say they
can spend more time on research rather than meeting clients and
marketing. </p>
<p>Lee remains optimistic on U.S. equities, which he says are
in the middle of a bull market that favors value stocks. He
predicts the SP 500, which closed last week at 1,986, will
climb 5.8 percent to 2,100 by year-end, up from a previous call
of 2,075. </p>
<p>The market ''creates an opportunity for those who can help
clients, because the average Wall Street firm isn''t providing
helpful guidance,'' he said. </p>

<p>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) charged New
York customers higher prices for Coca-Cola products than stated
in national circulars, running afoul of false advertising laws,
according to the state attorney general. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest retailer charged $3.50 in New York
stores for 12-packs of the soft drinks instead of $3.00 as
advertised during promotions this year, New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement yesterday. In one
instance, store staff falsely told a customer who complained
that the extra charge came from a ''sugar tax,'' Schneiderman
said. </p>
<p>''There has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter
how rich or how powerful, and that is why our office must ensure
that even the largest corporations cannot advertise one price
and then charge a higher one to New Yorkers,'' Schneiderman
said. </p>
<p>Under an agreement announced yesterday, the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based retailer will pay a $66,000 penalty and improve
practices to avert over-charging. The attorney general''s office
determined that cash registers weren''t programmed to recognize
the advertised price. Wal-Mart didn''t admit or deny the attorney
general''s findings, according to the agreement. </p>
<p>New York law generally prohibits deceptive advertising,
including ads displaying false or misleading prices. Earlier
this year, Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. agreed to a $220,000
settlement with the state attorney general to resolve claims of
deceptively advertising prices by making it appear as though
consumers were receiving steep discounts. </p>

<p>Rahul Parekh became used to long hours and late nights at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in London, where he was executive director of equity-derivatives trading. </p> <p>It was the food that took its toll. </p> <p>''I remember when I was at Goldman Sachs, working late in the evening and nothing was open nearby,'' he said in an interview. ''You order online from one of the delivery businesses and can end up waiting 1-1/2 hours for a greasy takeaway that doesn''t feel healthy in any way.'' </p> <p>It may have been more a microwave moment than a light-bulb idea but Parekh decided he could do better. He quit Goldman earlier this year and co-founded EatFirst, a food-delivery service that cooks its own fresh meals and promises to get them to your office in the City of London within 15 minutes of an order being placed. </p> <p>EatFirst follows an initial public offering in Just Eat Plc, an online takeaway service whose shares began trading in April. Just Eat was started in Denmark in 2001 and expanded into the U.K. in 2006. Just Eat Plc has a market value of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.6 billion). </p> <p>Just Eat connects customers with restaurants for takeaway meals. Unlike EatFirst, it doesn''t make or deliver the food. Other companies in the market include Deliveroo, which supplies foods from restaurants and charges for delivery. </p> <p>Parekh''s partners are Humberto Ayres Pereira, who was at McKinsey  Co. and founded the Skin online cosmetics business in his native Portugal; and Torben Schulz, an entrepreneur who plans to start an EatFirst in Berlin, where he is based. </p> <p>EatFirst is backed by Berlin-based Rocket Internet AG, which invests in companies related to the Internet industry. </p> <h2>Two Dishes </h2> <p>The company currently offers a choice of two dishes, one of them vegetarian. They both change daily and are prepared in a kitchen in Farringdon, near the City of London. Recent options include chorizo and chicken jambalaya; Thai massaman curry; and goat cheese ratatouille. Each costs 7 pounds ($11.32). </p> <p>The executive chef is Jane Tran, who previously worked at Bar Boulud. A third option will be added in coming months. Customers may pay by debit or credit card or via an app. </p> <p>Parekh, 28, was born in Manchester, England, to a family that was originally from Gujarat, in India. His parents were born in Kenya. EatFirst is initially delivering in part of the City of London financial district. It''s a crowded market. </p> <p>''At Goldman, I used to cycle between Itsu on a Monday, and a Pret on a Tuesday, and a Leon on a Wednesday and a Pod on a Thursday and it just gets so boring after a couple of weeks,'' he said. ''That''s what we really wanted to change with EatFirst so people can have a varied diet and don''t have to look elsewhere.'' </p> <p>Natalie Berg, global research director at Planet Retail Ltd. in London, said that while the trend toward healthy convenience food isn''t new, technology is changing things. </p> <h2>Working Lunch </h2> <p>''Food delivery has been limited to pizza and other fast food without high-quality options,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''But technology is changing this and there''s an opportunity to tap into a very lucrative working-lunch market. </p> <p>''''What is especially interesting with EatFirst is that it''s based on simplicity -- just a couple of dishes -- which helps them to keep costs down and reinforces the ethos of high-quality, freshly prepared food.'' </p> <p>Parekh declined to disclose financial details or profit targets. He said the company plans to expand aggressively. </p> <p>''In a place like London, which is so vast and so densely populated, the sky''s the limit,'' he said. ''Even the City, which is a tiny area, there''s almost 400,000 people during the day, so there''s no reason we can''t be pushing towards thousands a day and be the biggest food-delivery company in London. </p> <h2>Food Has Lagged </h2> <p>''''For the first year, I''d imagine within London we can get over 1,000 meals a day and that would be serving the City and central London and also expanding to Canary Wharf. We have a pretty aggressive expansion plan. We are working on a number of new kitchen locations and expanding our delivery network </p> <p>''''I see this as the future for food delivery. As other retail products move online, food has really lagged. Our expansion plan is realistic given the future that we expect for the food industry and the online-delivery landscape.'' </p> <p>Most Britons ordering food online currently do so through a restaurant''s own website such as Pizza Hut, according to Helena Childe, senior food service analyst at Mintel. </p> <p>Third-party sites such as Just Eat are increasing in popularity, she said. </p> <p>''Most online restaurant habits (from online ordering to mobile payments) are most common among Londoners and the tech-savvy youth market (under-35s),'' Childe said in a Mintel report, ''Eating Out: The Decision-Making Process,'' earlier this year. </p> <h2>Small Cog </h2> <p>EatFirst leases its kitchens and delivery bikes, seeking to keep down costs while it expands. Fair enough but was it wise to quit Goldman to pursue such a venture? </p> <p>''I had a fantastic experience at Goldman but everything we do now has a huge impact on the future of the business,'' he said. ''It''s different to working in an organization like Goldman Sachs, where you can feel like a small cog in a massive machine. </p> <p>''''This is a totally different thrill: There''s new things every day to do. I''ve been in the kitchen, cleaning dishes with the chefs. I''ve been handing out flyers with the marketing team. I''ve been involved in fund-raising meetings. There''s so much to do and it''s an all-round business experience.'' </p> <p>Information: https://www.eatfirst.co.uk/; the app is here: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id907506298. </p> <p>(Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Bloomberg.

(CVX)''s attempts to turn plants into alternative fuels for profitable, large-scale production have failed. </p> <p>The second-largest U.S. oil company by market value spent ''significant sums'' and assigned some of its best scientists to evaluate more than 100 kinds of feedstock and 50 techniques for converting them into fuels without success, Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson said during an address to the Economic Club of Minnesota in Minneapolis today. </p> <p>''The smartest minds in my company and others haven''t yet cracked the code on pairing the right feedstock conversion technology and logistics in an economic and scalable package,'' Watson said. </p> <p>Major crude producers from Chevron to BP Plc have been scaling back investment in renewables to focus on higher-profit ventures such as deep-water oil wells. Chevron''s setbacks echo those of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), which last year said its $600 million foray into algae-based fuel may not succeed for another 25 years. BP put $3.1 billion of wind assets for sale last year after withdrawing from solar in 2011. </p> <p>Chevron sold an energy-efficiency unit last month that had been losing money for half a decade, Watson said. The company remains dedicated to other forms of renewables such as geothermal and continues to pursue research into some types of biofuels, Watson told reporters after his speech. Chevron''s plants research focused on non-food crops, he said. </p>

<p>Even with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sounding the all-clear, Stephen Jen is inclined to stay in the bunker. </p> <p>The co-founder of London-based hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners LLC and former chief currency strategist at Morgan Stanley is pushing back against research by economists at his one-time employer and Goldman Sachs that the U.S. and global economic expansions have long to run. </p> <p>''I don''t find their argument persuasive at all,'' Jen wrote in a Sept. 9 note to clients. ''I see the probability of recessions being higher, not lower.'' </p> <p>His reasoning is that the U.S. and other developed countries still have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis and recession that accelerated with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., six years ago yesterday. Government debt, for example, has ballooned, leaving economies less secure than in previous expansions. </p> <p>The weak recovery is another reason for Jen to worry. He says it leaves economies prone to small shocks that could tip them into another contraction. The euro area stalled in the second quarter, while a harsh winter was enough for the U.S. to shrink in the first -- leaving the return to historically normal interest rates an unpredictable force. </p> <h2>Easy Money </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley said in a Sept. 2 report that a prolonged period of deleveraging in the U.S., alongside global growth, could mean the current five-year-old expansion lasts to 2020. It last week extended its analysis to the world economy, saying it could grow another five years amid easy money. </p> <p>Making a similar argument, Kris Dawsey of Goldman Sachs said in a report last month that most economic indicators and asset markets suggest the U.S. expansion is not at a late stage. </p> <p>Jen says the financial crisis changed how economies work, limiting the value of comparisons with past business cycles. He notes Japan had six recessions and contracted 37 percent of the quarters since its own asset bubbles burst in 1989-1990. </p> <p>''There are so many features of the macro economy that have been strange and different since the global financial crisis of 2008,'' said Jen.

<p>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) charged New
York customers higher prices for Coca-Cola products than stated
in national circulars, running afoul of false advertising laws,
according to the state attorney general. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest retailer charged $3.50 in New York
stores for 12-packs of the soft drinks instead of $3.00 as
advertised during promotions this year, New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement yesterday. In one
instance, store staff falsely told a customer who complained
that the extra charge came from a ''sugar tax,'' Schneiderman
said. </p>
<p>''There has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter
how rich or how powerful, and that is why our office must ensure
that even the largest corporations cannot advertise one price
and then charge a higher one to New Yorkers,'' Schneiderman

determined that cash registers weren''t programmed to recognize
the advertised price. Wal-Mart didn''t admit or deny the attorney

<p>Iron ore''s slump to a five-year low
isn''t expected to prevent the world''s two biggest miners, BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO), returning cash to investors,
a JPMorgan Chase  Co. fund manager said. </p>
<p>''You have to remember the very large operating margins
which can still be achieved within iron ore,'' James Sutton, a
portfolio manager at JPMorgan''s $1.6 billion Natural Resources
Fund in London, said in an interview. There''s ''a lot of scope
for shareholder returns,'' as Rio and BHP are curbing investment
in marginal projects, he said. </p>
<p>The steel-making ingredient slumped to the lowest in five
years this month prompting Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to declare
the ''end of the Iron Age'' after a Chinese-led demand spike
over the last decade prompted record profits for BHP and Rio. As
investors demand a greater share of mining industry profits, the
largest iron ore producers are flooding the market with new
supply, trimming prices. </p>
<p>''Looking at the bigger picture, I think that the two
things are not incompatible,'' Sutton said. ''These businesses
will have to get used to a lower iron ore price environment.
They may become more boring as a result and focus on those core
assets and focus on getting more and more margin out of them.
That will ultimately lead to higher dividends and buybacks.'' </p>
<p>The JPMorgan Natural Resources fund has Rio as its fourth-largest holding, with a 4.7 percent weighting, and BHP as it the
sixth at 4.1 percent. </p>
<p>This year''s 37 percent decline in iron ore was partly
responsible for BHP shying away from a widely anticipated
buyback last month, chief executive officer of the world''s
biggest mining company Andrew Mackenzie said at the time. </p>
<h2>Disappoint Again </h2>
<p>''We fear the group could again disappoint (excessively
high) market expectations on capital return next year,'' if
prices for iron ore and copper fail to rebound sharply, Exane
BNP Paribas analysts led by Luc Pez wrote in a report this week
in which BHP was downgraded to underperform. </p>
<p>Rio Tinto CEO Sam Walsh, who derives almost 90 percent of
the London-based company''s earnings from the iron ore division,
last month described the world''s second-biggest iron ore
exporter as a ''cash machine'' as a cost-cutting drive starts to
bear fruit. The company has a vision to ''deliver on increased
shareholder returns,'' he said in an Aug. 8 interview. </p>
<h2>Chinese Port </h2>
<p>Iron ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of
Tianjin fell 0.8 percent yesterday to $84.50 a dry ton,
according to The Steel Index. Prices retreated to $81.90 a ton
on Sept. 11, the lowest level since September 2009. </p>
<p>''At current prices we think they will announce a
significant dividend increase and a buyback,'' said Rob
Clifford, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, who rates
Rio Tinto a buy. ''I''m convinced that today''s iron ore price
remains above both BHP and Rio''s internal view of what long term
prices are ,so as far as they''re concerned they''re still making
excess margins on iron ore.'' </p>
<p>Still, the price may find a floor near $80 a ton as lower
cost Australian supplies displace higher cost Chinese
production, according to JPMorgan''s Sutton. </p>
<h2>Hit a Floor </h2>
<p>''We are seeing increasing signs of production falling off
in China and other parts of the world as well being displaced by
this very low cost Australian production which is coming on
stream ahead of time,'' he said. ''We might be starting to hit a
floor.'' </p>
<p>Mine closures around the world spurred by the slump in
prices will help the price to level out, according to the
government forecaster in Australia, the world''s biggest
exporter. It may average $90 a ton to $95 a ton over the next
five years, according to Wayne Calder, deputy executive director
at the Canberra-based Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics. </p>
<p>The expanding global glut will more than triple to 163
million tons next year from 52 million this year, according to
Goldman. The surplus is seen expanding to 245 million tons in
2016, 295 million tons in 2017 and 334 million tons in 2018. </p>

<p>Companies in Brazil are shunning
the local bond market on speculation President Dilma Rousseff,
who''s presided over an economy plagued by surging inflation and
a lack of growth, will be re-elected. </p>
<p>Corporate borrowers have issued 35.44 billion reais ($15.24
billion) of bonds in the first eight months of the year, a 7.8
percent decrease from a year ago and the least since 2010,
according to the most recent data from Anbima, Brazil''s capital
markets association. </p>
<p>With the first round of elections less than three weeks
away, polls show Rousseff is regaining the popular support she
lost earlier this month. That''s revived concern a victory by the
incumbent will mean four more years of fiscal policies that led
to Brazil''s first recession since 2009, which may deter
companies from borrowing to expand, according to JPMorgan Chase
 Co. and Banco Votorantim SA. This month, companies have issued
2 billion reais of bonds, less than half as much as a year ago. </p>
<p>Companies are waiting ''until there is more clarity on what
the next government will be like,'' Ricardo Leoni, the head of
Brazil''s debt capital markets at JPMorgan, said in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo. </p>
<p>Officials from the president''s office didn''t reply to e-mails and a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>Assuming Rousseff is one of the top finishers in first-round voting on Oct. 5, she would then probably garner 41
percent of the vote in an Oct. 26 election runoff, according to
a Vox Populi poll released Sept. 15. </p>
<h2>Dead Heat </h2>
<p>That puts her in a statistical tie with opposition
candidate Marina Silva, who received support from 42 percent of
those polled. The Sept. 13-14 survey of 2,000 people has a
margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. Silva''s lead was seven
percentage points in an Aug. 31-Sept. 2 poll. </p>
<p>An Ibope poll published yesterday showed a runoff between
Rousseff and Marina Silva would be too close to call while
backing for third-place candidate Aecio Neves increased.
Rousseff would win 36 percent of voter support in the first
round, with 30 percent for Silva and 19 percent for Neves,
according to the Sept. 13-15 survey. In an Oct. 26 runoff, Silva
would have 43 percent of voter support, compared with 40 percent
for Rousseff, according to the poll published on Jornal Nacional
television. </p>
<p>In the past three weeks, Rousseff has stepped up attacks
against Silva, saying the former environment minister doesn''t
have the experience to lead and would reduce investments in
offshore oil and gas reserves. Silva says the incumbent''s
policies contributed to a recession in the first half of this
year and quicker inflation. </p>
<h2>Government''s Role </h2>
<p>Since taking office in January 2011, Rousseff has increased
the government''s role in companies, changing concession-renewal
rules to lower electricity rates and capping gasoline prices to
tame inflation that last month exceed the 6.5 percent limit of
the central bank''s target range. Policy makers raised the
benchmark interest rate by 3.75 percentage points over nine
straight meetings through April before holding it at a two-year
high of 11 percent for the past three. </p>
<p>Latin America''s largest economy shrank 0.6 percent in the
April-June period from the previous three months, after
contracting 0.2 percent in the first quarter, the national
statistics agency said Aug. 29. </p>
<p>The real declined 0.3 percent to 2.3388 per dollar today as
of 2:40 p.m. in New York. </p>
<h2>Average Rates </h2>
<p>Silva has promised to cut inflation by half and called for
a fiscal-responsibility body to independently monitor budgets
and spending to verify that the government is complying with
fiscal targets. </p>
<p>The average interest rate on floating-rate local bonds with
maturities longer than 12 months issued this year was 10.99
percent, 0.12 percentage point above the average in the same
span last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>''This has been a tough year for local companies, with all
the concerns regarding politics and the economic scenario we''ll
have starting next year,''Carolina Lacerda, the head of
investment banking at UBS AG''s Brazil unit and a director at
Anbima, said in an interview in Sao Paulo. ''Companies are
cautious, especially because the cost of funding, in general, is
at a very high level.'' </p>
<p>While Brazilian companies are staying away from the local
debt market, they''re boosting overseas offerings to lock in
borrowing costs before U.S. policy makers raise interest rates.
They have issued $42.7 billion this year, a 45 percent increase
from the same period in 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Growth Outlook </h2>
<p>Ricardo Carvalho, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said that if
economic growth begins to recover later this year, issuance in
the local market will probably rebound. </p>
<p>Brazilian companies aren''t selling bonds ''because they are
not spending much,'' he said in an interview in Sao Paulo.
''That could change once the economy starts to improve, which
could happen before the end of this semester.'' </p>
<p>While Carvalho sees the potential for growth to accelerate,
Moody''s Investors Service cut the outlook on Brazil''s credit
rating to negative on Sept. 9, saying the economy is unlikely to
rebound in the short term. </p>
<p>''Companies seem to be waiting for what will happen in the
macroeconomic scenario and after elections before selling more
debt,'' Reinaldo Lacerda, who helps manage 43 billion reais in
assets as the investment director at the wealth management
division of Banco Votorantim SA, said in an interview in Sao
Paulo. </p>

<p>Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) fell after a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst said the company may need at
least $6 billion in capital, most of it over the next 11 years,
if its electric car becomes a ''disruptive'' product. </p>
<p>The automaker led by Elon Musk is targeting production of
100,000 premium electric cars by late next year and has an
eventual goal to sell at least 500,000 cars annually. The
capital may be needed to fund growth if Tesla''s vehicles prove
to be as popular as Apple Inc.''s iPhone or Ford Motor Co.''s
Model T. Under such scenarios, production would range from 1.8
million a year to 3.2 million a year by 2025, Patrick Archambault, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote today in a note. </p>
<p>''With numerous projects laid out (as well as those not
currently communicated) ahead for Tesla, we see a possible need
for additional capital,'' he wrote. </p>
<p>Tesla also is building a battery factory to provide cheaper
lithium-ion cells for its vehicles. It said the facility may
cost as much as $5 billion. In March, the company raised about
$2.3 billion toward the plant, which is being built near Reno,
Nevada. </p>
<p>Archambault, who has a neutral rating on Palo Alto,
California-based Tesla, said the bulk of his estimate for the
company''s capital needs would be for 2017 through 2025. </p>
<p>Tesla hasn''t given a forecast for capital spending, Simon Sproule, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said the U.S. government is giving the company more time to shut its Russian Arctic well beyond the deadline for sanctions aimed at halting the $700 million project. </p> <p>Exxon asked Washington for an extension to allow it to continue performing shut-down work on the Universitetskaya-1 (University-1) well in Russia''s Kara Sea to make sure the well was safe before it''s temporarily abandoned. The Irving, Texas-based company already had ceased drilling the offshore well after U.S. sanctions set a Sept. 26 deadline for ending the work. </p> <p>''The U.S. Treasury Department, recognizing the complexity of the University-1 well and the sensitive Kara Sea arctic environment, has granted a license to Exxon Mobil and other U.S. contractors and persons involved to enable the safe and responsible winding down of operations related to this exploration well,'' Exxon said in a statement today. </p> <p>The most-recent round of sanctions intended to punish Russia for its involvement in separatist violence in Ukraine barred U.S. and European Union companies from helping Russia exploit oil resources in the Arctic, deep seas and shale formations. </p> <p>Waging Financial War</p><p>The measures had prompted Exxon and its partner OAO Rosneft (ROSN) to temporarily halt drilling at the well, which lies about 260 feet (79 meters) beneath the sea surface off Siberia''s northern coast, according to three people familiar with the project. The well is aiming to tap a resource estimated to hold as much as 9 billion barrels of crude, worth $880 billion at current prices. </p> <h2>More Time </h2> <p>Exxon sought the exemption from the deadline after engineers involved in the project warned they needed more time to properly plug the well with cement and conduct tests to ensure there are no leaks, cracks or faults that could damage the reservoir or allow environmental contamination, according to a source with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. </p> <p>Exxon and Rosneft are exploring a geologic formation never before drilled by humans, which means the pressure changes, layer densities and temperatures at various depths are unknown, increasing the risks of unexpected collapses or pressure bursts. For that reason, the engineers closing the well need to map the formation a foot at a time as they back out of the well, a process that can take weeks. </p> <h2>Slowing Progress </h2> <p>The halt at Universitetskaya-1 is a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin''s quest to find a new generation of oil fields to replace declining output from some of the country''s Soviet-era reserves. The Russian oil industry is dependent on expertise and equipment from the U.S. and Europe to penetrate crude reservoirs that are deeper, denser and more remote than anything they''ve attempted before. </p> <p>The disruption also is a setback for Exxon as the company seeks to lift production that touched a 4-year low in 2013 as the rate it''s replacing output with new discoveries tumbled to the lowest in half a decade. </p> <p>Exxon''s $3.2 billion exploration pact with Moscow-based Rosneft is a linchpin of the U.S. company''s bid to spur production and reserves growth in the next decade, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis. </p> <h2>''Enormous'' Potential </h2> <p>''The Arctic drilling potential for Exxon is really enormous,'' said Youngberg, who has a hold rating on Exxon shares. ''It''s one of the key growth areas they''re looking to post-2020.'' </p> <p>Rosneft''s press office in Moscow declined to comment. Hagar Chemali, a U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson, declined to comment and referred a Bloomberg News inquiry to Exxon. </p> <p>Exxon is using the West Alpha rig owned by Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL)''s North Atlantic (NADL) Drilling unit at the Universitetskaya-1 site about 70 miles offshore. The rig departed a Norwegian shipyard in July and sailed around the northern coast of Scandinavia and into Russian territory right before the U.S. and EU prohibited exports of gear for Arctic, deep-water and shale drilling. </p> <p>Within weeks, the U.S. and EU moved to close loopholes in the sanctions by also banning the export of services such as engineering expertise and geological analysis for Russian Arctic, deep-water and shale projects. </p> <p>Exxon rose 0.5 percent to $97.12 at the close of trading in New York. Seadrill fell 4.1 percent today in Oslo to its lowest closing price since November 2011. </p> <p>The measures left untouched so-called conventional oil developments that aren''t part of Putin''s hunt for next-generation oilfields, including the Sakhalin-1 development off Russia''s Pacific Coast managed by Exxon and Rosneft. </p> <p>', 'Exxon Gets U.S. Sanctions Extension to Shut Russian Arctic Well', 'By Joe Carroll and Alan Katz', 'Sep 19, 2014  4:27 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-19/exxon-gets-safety-extension-on-u-s-sanctions-on-arctic-w.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s third-largest oil producer by market value, is seeking a buyer for one
of its smallest refineries, the Kapolei plant on the Hawaiian
island of Oahu. </p>
<p>The sale of the the 54,000-barrel-a-day Kapolei complex is
part of a larger plan to divest $10 billion worth of assets over
the next three years. Closing the plant would leave Hawaii with
a single 93,500-barrel-a-day refinery, which Par Petroleum Corp. (PARR)
bought from Tesoro Corp. (TSO) last year. </p>
<p>Chevron shares were up $1.03, or 0.8 percent, at $125.17 at
2:42 p.m. New York time. Par Petroleum Corp., which operates the
only other plant in Hawaii, gained 6 percent to $16.58. </p>
<p>Chevron ''has decided to engage an investment banking firm
to identify potential parties interested in the purchase of our
assets in Hawaii,'' Braden Reddall, a spokesman at Chevron''s
headquarters in San Ramon, California, said by telephone late
yesterday. ''No decision has been made at this time other than
to determine the level of interest of potential buyers.'' </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank has been hired by Chevron, two people with
direct knowledge of the situation said, while asking not to be
identified because the information isn''t public. </p>
<p>Al Chee, a Chevron spokesman at the refinery, declined by
telephone to comment. Ari Cohen, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank
in New York, declined by e-mail to comment. </p>
<h2>Fourth-Smallest </h2>
<p>Chevron previously considered turning the Kapolei complex
into a terminal. After a review three years ago, the company
decided to continue to run it as a refinery. It''s Chevron''s
fourth-smallest by capacity, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Selling the refinery in 2011 was ''not as competitive'' as
improving its value, Michael Wirth, Chevron''s executive vice
president of downstream and chemicals, said in a conference call
with analysts at the time of the review. </p>
<p>''Everybody realizes that''s a small refinery,'' he said.
''It''s not an especially complex refinery. It''s got a somewhat
isolated and finite market. And so we''re really in the space of
optimizing every dimension of performance there.'' </p>
<p>The refinery ran 39,000 barrels a day in 2013, down from
46,000 in 2012, the company said in its 10-K annual report. Last
year, the plant imported 87 percent of its oil from Indonesia,
Thailand and Vietnam, Energy Information Administration data
show. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Chevron extended a supply contract with
Hawaiian Electric Co. Inc. for low-sulfur fuel. Meanwhile, Par
Petroleum said it was losing its contracts with the utility in
December and was ''aggressively pursuing other outlets.'' </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are the two
largest oil producers. </p>

<p>Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. said one
of its trading units fell under the U.K.''s Financial Conduct
Authority for the first time as it seeks to expand services in
European financial commodity markets. </p>
<p>Mercuria Europe Trading Ltd. is authorized and regulated by
the FCA under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the
Geneva-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Mercuria, nearing completion of a $3.5 billion deal to buy
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s physical commodity operation, joins
Glencore Plc and Trafigura Beheer BV in having part of its
business regulated by the FCA. After decades of operating in
relative secrecy, the acquisition of physical assets is pushing
independent commodity traders to increase disclosure as they
seek new sources of financing, including bond sales. </p>
<p>''As Mercuria''s business model continues to evolve to
expand its provision of services, so too does the regulatory
oversight of Mercuria,'' Victoria Attwood Scott, the firm''s head
of compliance, said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Attwood Scott, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive,
said in April that Mercuria was in discussions with the FCA to
determine whether the purchase of JPMorgan''s European gas and
power operations would require regulatory oversight by the U.K. </p>
<h2>Growing Fast </h2>
<p>Founded a decade ago by former Goldman Sachs traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, Mercuria is growing faster than
Trafigura, Gunvor Group Ltd. and Vitol Group, the world''s
largest oil trader. As investment banks such as JPMorgan pull
back from physical commodities because of rising regulatory
scrutiny, Mercuria is seeking to combine such operations with
investment bank-style commodity futures and options trading. </p>
<p>Mercuria''s FCA application isn''t the first by a foreign-based commodity trading firm. A unit of Baar, Switzerland-based
Glencore Plc (GLEN) is regulated by the FCA as is the Galena Asset
Management Ltd. hedge fund arm of Amsterdam''s Trafigura, and
energy and metals trading firms related to Wichita, Kansas-based
Koch Industries Inc, according to the FCA website. </p>
<p>The FCA in February issued its first report on commodity-market regulation in the U.K. since 2007. The study raised
concerns about the increasing role in global markets played by
commodity trading houses and the ability to adequately regulate
them. </p>
<p>Non-governmental organizations like Switzerland''s Berne
Declaration have said there is a gap in regulatory oversight in
relation to traders like Mercuria, which recorded revenue of
$112 billion in 2013. The firm and other traders have said their
businesses are already subject to regulation through exchange-traded options trading and oversight of their banking partners. </p>
<p>''Mercuria has always been subject to regulations and
oversight across the globe in all of its activities and takes
these responsibilities very seriously,'' Attwood Scott said in
the statement. ''As such, Mercuria views this development as an
extension of its existing obligations and regulatory
relationships as we broaden the scope of our business.'' </p>

<p>U.S. banks will probably wait to see if issuing Shariah-compliant bonds is worth the trouble after it took Goldman Sachs Group Inc. three years to sell its debut sukuk. </p> <p>Islamic finance in the U.S. is still underdeveloped, and misconceptions associated with it taint the industry, according to King  Spalding LLP, an adviser on Shariah transactions in the country for 35 years. HSBC Holdings Plc, the biggest underwriter of sukuk this year after Malaysia''s CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., says the need for tangible assets to structure deals, and the lack of legislation to address taxation issues, makes selling Islamic bonds a challenge. </p> <p>''It''s highly likely that Goldman will be the sole player in the Islamic finance market in any meaningful way for the near term,'' George Thomas Conboy, chairman of Rochester, New York-based Brighton Securities Corp., a financial services company, said by phone from Istanbul on Sept. 18. ''There aren''t as many players willing to take risks in that area until Goldman blazes a trail and it''s clear that Islamic finance can be properly structured and profitable.'' </p> <p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest bank in the U.S., sold its debut sukuk last week, three years after its first foray into Islamic capital markets ended with controversy over the debt''s structure. It''s the fourth U.S.-based issuer to sell the securities. Borrowers raised $2 trillion from all bond sales in America last year, more than 46 times the amount sold in the Shariah market and more than the value of Islamic financial assets globally. </p> <h2>Negative Perception </h2> <p>Hong Kong, the U.K., South Africa and Sharjah, one of seven sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates, are among borrowers that have sold Islamic bonds for the first time this year. New York-based Goldman Sachs''s five-year notes yielded 21 basis points more than similar maturity non-Shariah compliant debt it issued in January at 3:21 p.m. in Dubai. The bank attracted orders for three times the $500 million it sold. </p> <p>''Islamic finance''s level of awareness and depth of knowhow in general in the U.S. is at best at its infancy, with negative connotations stemming misconceptions,'' Rizwan Kanji, a Dubai-based partner at King  Spalding, said by telephone from Dubai Sept. 18. </p> <p>Islam is the most negatively perceived religion in the U.S., followed by atheism, according to a study by the Washington-based Pew Research Center published in July. About 1.9 million Muslims live in the country, the seventh-biggest religious group among about 319 million people, according to CIA World Factbook data. </p> <h2>Risk Premium </h2> <p>While Goldman Sachs''s sukuk won''t ''create a market of new issuers in the U.S., frequent conventional issuers will start to see sukuk as a new avenue for tighter pricing or diversification of their investor base,'' Kanji said. Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. were among the biggest issuers of debt last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Rob Julavits, a spokesman for Citigroup, Zia Ahmed from Bank of America and Jessica Francisco from JPMorgan declined to comment last week on whether the lenders will be pursuing Islamic financing deals. </p> <h2>Stamp Duties </h2> <p>Borrowers using sukuk need assets to underlie the debt and there''s an additional cost of hiring Shariah scholars or boards to structure the securities. </p> <p>''If you''re a U.S. corporate that doesn''t have tangible assets it can utilize, it''s more challenging to structure'' a sukuk, Mohammed Dawood, HSBC''s Dubai-based global head of sukuk financing, said in a Sept. 11 interview. ''The U.S. hasn''t passed sukuk-specific legislation, unlike Hong Kong and the U.K., which have passed legislation to address tax and legal impediments.'' </p> <p>To adhere to Islam''s ban on interest, the bonds pay a return on assets and may attract double charges on stamp duties because of the sale and purchase of goods to back the debt. Profits or capital gains incur taxes, whereas interest is tax deductible. </p> <p>Islamic finance is too new for U.S.-based issuers, and the structures and impediments are too complicated, Conboy said. </p> <p>''Anything with Shariah attached to it carries a small risk premium,'' he said. </p> <p>', 'Goldman Sachs Sukuk Seen as Too Risky for U.S. Imitators', 'By Daria Solovieva and Dana El Baltaji', 'Sep 22, 2014  7:30 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-22/goldman-sukuk-seen-too-risky-for-u-s-imitators-islamic-finance.html') LIMIT 1;

premium is virtually gone,'' John Melvin, who oversees fixed-income investments for insurers at Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said by phone. Insurers ''really have almost an
insatiable demand for investment product on the long end of the
yield curve,'' he said. </p>
<p>With hundreds of billions of dollars to reinvest annually
and interest rates held near record lows by the Federal Reserve,
insurers are looking beyond public, investment-grade bonds,
according to BlackRock Inc. (BLK) In addition to private placements,
they''re weighing infrastructure bets and real estate, said
BlackRock''s David Lomas. </p>
<h2>''Natural Holder'' </h2>
<p>''Insurance companies are a natural holder'' of less liquid
assets, said Lomas, who runs BlackRock''s global financial
institutions group. ''They''ve got great cash flow, and they can
afford to extend their strategy into some of these areas.''
Insurers can hold premiums on life policies for decades before
paying death benefits. </p>
<p>Borrowers may choose private loans and bonds to limit
financial disclosures and save administrative costs. While that
contributes to the higher yields, it makes the debt harder to
sell should an insurer need to exit a holding to pay claims or
cut credit risk. </p>
<p>''To the extent that you need to sell a security and
liquidate it, there''s less ability to do that without impacting
the price,'' said Shachar Gonen, an analyst at Moody''s Investors
Service. </p>
<h2>Evaporating Premium </h2>
<p>At New York Life Insurance Co., the extra yield from less
liquid investment-grade debt has dropped by about half over the
last two years, to a range of 20 to 25 basis points, according
to Tony Malloy, who oversees a portfolio that was valued at more
than $185 billion at the end of 2013. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. </p>
<p>Malloy''s company, the largest policyholder-owned U.S. life
insurer, allocates about 30 percent of its portfolio to private
placements and mortgage loans, up from about 25 percent five
years ago, he said. Since 2008, New York Life has built a
business to make its own loans, reducing its reliance on other
firms that originate the debt. That''s helped maintain spreads,
Malloy said. </p>
<p>''The competition for assets amongst insurance companies is
fierce, and so we had demand that was greater than the supply,''
Malloy said. ''A way of meeting the demand that New York Life
had was to essentially open up the regional offices and go
knocking on the doors of corporations.'' </p>
<h2>Private Equity </h2>
<p>When Goldman Sachs surveyed chief investment officers in
February and March, it found that insurers saw holding less-liquid assets as among the best strategies for increasing
returns. Insurers planned to boost allocations to private
equity, commercial mortgages, real estate equity and mezzanine
debt, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<p>''While the interest in investment-grade traditional
private placements has been quite strong for the last several
years, that''s probably waning,'' Melvin said. Insurers are
''moving down the credit curve.'' </p>
<p>American International Group Inc. said in June that it had
committed $1.5 billion to a venture with Oak Hill Capital
Management that will lend to mid-sized companies. The business,
called Varagon Capital Partners, will lend to companies with
earnings of as much as $75 million before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization. </p>
<p>Yields on investment-grade company bonds have dropped to
3.11 percent, less than 0.5 percentage point from the record-low
reached last year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. That compares with an average of 4.77 percent over
the past decade. </p>
<h2>Price Disclosures </h2>
<p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority began
disseminating prices for the first time in June on debt issued
privately under a rule known as 144a, the latest step in the
agency''s effort to make over-the-counter debt markets more
transparent. </p>
<p>With spreads declining for private bonds, the increase in
demand is probably nearer to the end than the beginning, said
Robert Derrick, co-head of the North American corporate finance
group at insurer Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)''s private-lending
unit. The challenge is that the extra yield for taking on risk
is dropping across asset classes, said Alton Cogert, whose
Strategic Asset Alliance advises insurers. </p>
<p>''You don''t get a whole heck of a lot,'' Cogert said.
''Nowadays, it''s so hard to get compensated for taking risk,
it''s crazy.'' </p>

<p>Adele and Mark Lee, who live in England with their three children, said they got approved for a U.S. mortgage without setting foot on American soil. The vacation home they''re buying near Florida''s Disney World would have been out of reach if they had to pay all cash. </p> <p>''It would have been a stretch,'' said Adele, a 35-year-old nursery school teacher, speaking from the family''s home near Birmingham. ''We wanted to keep some money here just to fall back on.'' </p> <p>The Lees are using a foreign-national mortgage, a loan for overseas buyers that required a 40 percent down payment, to purchase the five-bedroom house later this month for $423,000. Adele and her husband, a construction worker, plan to rent the Orlando property when they''re not living in it. </p> <p>Lenders are providing greater access to credit for non-U.S. residents to finance vacation houses and investment properties. Foreign buyers, who are helping to fill a void left by Americans facing high borrowing hurdles, spent about $35 billion on U.S. homes using mortgages in the 12 months through March, a 46 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p> <p>''The American pool of borrowers is drying up,'' said Anthony B. Sanders, an economics professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. ''Middle-class borrowers have flatlined due to low income growth, and domestic investors are finding it less appetizing because the foreclosure inventory has dried up. So who do you go to? Foreign investors.'' </p> <h2>Growing Share </h2> <p>At HSBC Holdings Plc, foreign-national mortgages, available to banking clients who deposit at least $15,000, account for about 30 percent of its U.S. home-lending business, according to Peter Alongi, a mortgage sales manager. That''s up from a share in the ''teens'' in 2008. </p> <p>FBC Mortgage LLC, an Orlando-based lender, has increased mortgages to international buyers by 65 percent this year compared with 2013. Calabasas, California-based Mega Capital Funding Inc. started lending to non-residents in June after seeing rising demand from Chinese buyers. </p> <p>''Instead of buying two houses in cash they can buy four houses with loans,'' said Brian Na, chief executive officer of Mega Capital, which is now issuing about $10 million of the mortgages a month. ''At the same time, buyers can build a credit history in the U.S.'' </p> <p>While many Americans struggle to qualify for mortgages, lenders are chasing wealthy buyers, including foreigners, whose loans typically require a 30 percent to 40 percent down payment compared with 20 percent for U.S. residents. Banks and smaller firms are offering more loan products to buyers based overseas, most of whom have paid cash for homes in the last few years. </p> <h2>Cash Sales </h2> <p>Cash sales have been falling and in June made up the lowest share of total home purchases, at 33 percent, since September 2008, according to CoreLogic Inc., an Irvine, California-based property-data firm. </p> <p>In Florida, the state with the largest share of cash sales, smaller community banks have gotten increasingly comfortable lending to foreign buyers, said Rob Nunziata, CEO of FBC. </p> <p>His firm typically offers nonresident borrowers adjustable-rate loans of as much as $750,000 that are fixed for three to five years. The mortgages require at least a 30 percent down payment and six months of cash reserves. Borrowing costs are generally one or two percentage points higher than conventional loans. </p> <h2>Credit Profiles </h2> <p>The biggest challenges for lenders are verifying incomes and building credit profiles for non-U.S. residents. Their home countries have tax systems that differ from America''s and lenders have to rely on third parties, along with documentation from employers or accountants, said Nunziata. </p> <p>One of FBC''s borrowers, Yoram Yahav, said he purchased a few houses in cash before deciding to get a $100,000 loan for a Florida property. He''s seeking to build his U.S. credit profile because he plans to bring more foreign capital to America with other global investors. </p> <p>''You may have $2 million in your bank account in England, but if you want to borrow $80,000 in the U.S. you can''t because of this issue with credit,'' said Yahav, whose Tel Aviv, Israel-based firm works with management teams in scenario planning for future events. ''This way I can also increase my cash portion and have more money to put into new businesses.'' </p> <p>While home loans were available to foreign nationals during the U.S. housing boom, financing dried up as banks tightened credit after the crash. Applications from international homebuyers are now at about the same level they reached during the peak in about 2006, when foreigners needed just a passport and an application to get a mortgage, according to Andy Scott, president of International Mortgages.Net in Orlando, which caters to mostly British clients, including the Lees. </p> <h2>''Convoluted'' Process </h2> <p>''The process is more convoluted,'' Scott said. ''It takes longer to get applications through. And there are a lot more checks and balances.'' </p> <p>The company, which has worked with international buyers in the U.S. and elsewhere for about 13 years, now uses seven lenders, up from only two after the housing bust. The firm moved from Scotland to Orlando a year ago because so many clients were purchasing there, Scott said. </p> <p>Buyers from the U.K., Canada, China, Mexico and India accounted for 54 percent of foreign sales in the year through March, data from NAR show. While Canada was the top source of international buyers, China accounted for the largest sales dollar volume because Chinese purchased more expensive properties on average, the Realtors report said. The top five states for international buying are Florida, California, Arizona, Texas and New York, according to the association. </p> <h2>Disney World </h2> <p>The Lees have only seen their vacation house in videos taken by their Realtor. They chose it for its swimming pool and proximity to Disney World, which they usually visit annually. The couple plans to rent it for the next five years and may eventually live there year-round. </p> <p>''It''s amazing what you can get over there for the money,'' Adele said. ''I also like that we could do everything over the Internet. We have noticed that Americans love paperwork. But the process was fairly straight forward.'' </p> <p>Rising prices and competition from cash-rich investors have kept many American homebuyers on the sidelines. Renters have also been blocked from homeownership by down payment requirements and ''very strict underwriting standards,'' said Stuart Miller, CEO of Lennar Corp., the largest U.S. homebuilder by market value. </p> <p>''The process itself has become fairly invasive,'' Miller said last week on a call with investors. It''s ''almost designed to scare people away.'' </p> <h2>Loan Dropoff </h2> <p>Mortgage applications for house purchases are 10 percent below the level a year earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Banks this year are also struggling to replace a falloff in lending dominated by refinancing, which plunged last year when borrowing costs spiked. </p> <p>While more financing for foreigners will boost property purchases in the U.S., smaller lenders who can''t hold as much debt are constrained by a limited secondary market for selling their loans, said Na of Mega Capital. </p> <p>Foreclosure of delinquent borrowers could also be a complicated process for some foreigners, such as those with diplomatic immunity, according to Joseph Pisa, CEO of Northstar Funding Inc., a Hoboken, New Jersey-based lender which focuses on the New York City area. While the borrowers can still get financing, rates are higher because of the additional risk, he said. </p> <p>Jerry Barker, a real estate agent in Celebration, Florida, said half of his clients, which are mostly European, now get foreign national loans. That compares with about five percent three years ago. </p> <p>''Our business has increased because we are able to sell to people we couldn''t sell to before,'' said Barker. ''Not everybody has a shoe box under their bedsprings with cash.'' </p> <p>', 'Brits Get Disney Fix as U.S. Banks Lend to Foreigners', 'By Heather Perlberg and Prashant Gopal', 'Sep 23, 2014 11:03 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-23/brits-get-disney-fix-as-u-s-banks-lend-to-foreigners-mortgages.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Factors ranging from monetary-policy divergence to inflation trends indicate the dollar''s
rally against its major peers during the past four months has
scope to continue, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The U.S. Dollar Index posted its a 10th consecutive gain
last week, the longest streak since 1967, and reached 85.485
today, the highest level since July 2010. It also still trades
at almost its 10-year average, as measured by the
Intercontinental Exchange Inc. gauge that tracks the greenback
against the currencies of six U.S. trading partners. </p>
<p>''As big as the dollar move looks close up, it is actually
small in historical and economic terms,'' Robin Brooks,
Goldman''s New York-based chief currency strategist, wrote in a
note to clients today. In ''reaction to client meetings in
recent days, many have sticker shock at the recent strengthening
in the dollar and are instinctively on the sidelines as they
await/ hope for a pull-back,'' he wrote. </p>
<p>The U.S. currency may build on its gains versus the euro as
the region''s central bank meeting next week will highlight
policy and economic divergence. European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi will have an opportunity to further explain his
plans to expand the central bank''s balance sheet via bond-buying, Brooks wrote. </p>
<h2>Inflation Range </h2>
<p>The meeting is also likely to bring focus to below-target
inflation within the currency bloc nations. Draghi''s preferred
gauge of inflation expectations, the five-year/five-year
inflation swap rate, fell to 1.91 percent on Sept. 19, the
lowest on a closing basis since October 2010. </p>
<p>''We do not think euro-dollar at current levels remotely
prices the kind of balance sheet expansion that President Draghi
talked about in September,'' Brooks wrote. ''So that coming
press conferences, including next week''s, are an opportunity for
the ECB to spell out the way forward, which we think will set
the stage for more euro-dollar downside.'' </p>
<p>Since reaching $1.3993 on May 8, the strongest in 2 1/2
years, the euro has slumped 9.1 percent as the currency bloc''s
economic expansion stopped in the second quarter as its three
biggest economies -- Germany, France and Italy -- failed to
grow. </p>
<p>Goldman cut its six-month forecast on the single currency
last month to $1.25 from $1.34, and projects it will weaken to
parity by the end of 2017. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve officials increased their median estimate
for the federal funds rate to 1.375 percent at the end of next
year on Sept. 17, versus June''s forecast for 1.125 percent and
virtually zero now. The extra yield investors get from holding
U.S. Treasuries instead of Germany''s two-year bunds rose to 0.64
percentage point yesterday, the widest since April 2007. </p>
<p>''The recent dollar strength has really been an unusual
confluence of idiosyncratic trends,'' Brooks wrote. ''We expect
the coming months to bring higher front-end rates in the U.S. as
Fed forward guidance fades, giving rise to real dollar strength.
This is not an environment conducive to a pull-back.'' </p>

<p>Poland''s top three coal companies,
burdened by losses amid communist-era benefit payments and a
market glut, are hiring banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
BNP Paribas SA to sell debut Eurobonds to raise cash. </p>
<p>Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas were picked by Katowicki
Holding Weglowy SA, the third-biggest coal-miner, to manage a
euro-denominated debt sale, two people familiar with the plan
said on Sept. 18, asking not to be identified because the
details are private. Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG
were also hired by the miners, separate people said. </p>
<p>The unprecedented rush for international financing is
occurring as mining unions prepare protests against plans by the
state-controlled companies to restructure operations and clamp
down on benefits. Kompania Weglowa SA, the European Union''s
largest producer, said this week it will scrap free coal
allowances for 160,000 retired employees, which cost it about
260 million zloty ($79.1 million) annually. </p>
<p>''Foreign issues are the only way for these companies to
gain funds,'' Mariusz Zarod, a money manager at BZ WBK Asset
Management in Poznan, Poland, with the equivalent of $3.7
billion under management, said by e-mail yesterday. ''If they
manage to pull it off, they will probably sell high-yield notes,
even though some investors won''t go near them.'' </p>
<h2>Falling Prices </h2>
<p>Kompania, which had a 675.7 million-zloty net loss last
year, chose Barclays, BNP and Deutsche Bank for its offering,
according to separate people familiar with the plan. The company
aims to meet three rating companies by early October, spokesman
Tomasz Zieba said last week, declining to comment on the sale. </p>
<p>The third miner, Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA, hired
JPMorgan and Credit Suisse for a sale of at least $500 million
in notes in the fourth quarter, a person familiar with the
details said last month. Spokeswoman Katarzyna Jablonska-Bajer
declined to comment by phone yesterday. </p>
<p>Prices of European coal for delivery next year fell to
$75.2 a ton at 2:23 p.m. in Warsaw today, the lowest level since
March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Waning demand is
also compounded by ''overstaffing, mismanagement and numerous
unions,'' Zarod said. Scrapping the free coal benefits will help
Kompania avoid bankruptcy and pave the way for long-term
financing, the company said in the Sept. 23 e-mail. </p>
<p>Miners ran up a combined 772.3 million-zloty net loss in
the first half, compared with profit of 15.6 million zloty a
year earlier, the Economy Ministry said. </p>
<h2>Industry Headwinds </h2>
<p>Katowicki Holding will seek to raise 500 million euros
($636 million) of bonds in November to refinance existing debt
and boost working capital, Chief Financial Officer Artur Trzeciakowski told PAP newswire on Sept. 18. The company earlier
held talks with ''most banks'' in Poland and failed to convince
them to increase their funding, he said. </p>
<p>The Polish debt offerings come as some eastern European
miners face headwinds. Russia''s economy minister said last week
he saw no alternative to bankruptcy for OAO Mechel, the
country''s biggest producer of coking coal, following nine months
of unsuccessful efforts to refinance its debt. New World
Resources Plc, a Czech miner, is restructuring 775 million euros
of bonds after falling coal prices hit it with seven consecutive
quarterly losses. </p>
<p>Polish government debt has attracted investors seeking less
risky regional assets amid the fallout from the Ukraine crisis.
The yield on the 2019 euro-denominated sovereign bond declined
to a record low of 0.61 percent today. </p>
<p>''It should be possible for Polish miners to place
Eurobonds (BEMC) as long as they are state-controlled,'' Clemens Hansmann, a money manager at Gutmann Kapitalanlage AG in Vienna,
which oversees 7 billion euros of assets, said by e-mail
yesterday. ''There is a structural decline in global demand for
thermal coal. For the Polish coal mines, this pressure will
continue'' and ''investors are well aware of these structural
issues,'' he said. </p>

Entertainment settled its copyright dispute with the children of
the late comic book artist Jack Kirby, who helped create the

<p>''Marvel and the family of Jack Kirby have amicably
resolved their legal disputes, and are looking forward to
advancing their shared goal of honoring Mr. Kirby''s significant
role in Marvel''s history,'' the company and the Kirby family
said in a joint statement today. </p>
<p>The family in March petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to
review their case after both a federal judge in New York and a
federal appeals court had agreed with Marvel that their father''s
drawings were work-for-hire and the family couldn''t terminate
the publisher''s copyright to the characters. </p>
<p>Disney acquired Marvel for $4.2 billion in 2009. Since
then, characters such as Iron Man and Thor have proved box
office gold for the Burbank, California-based company. </p>
<p>''Marvel''s The Avengers'' was the top-grossing film of
2012. This year''s ''Guardians of the Galaxy,'' based on lesser-known Marvel characters, also led the domestic box office with
$315 million in tickets sold since its August release. </p>
<h2>Spider-Man Fees </h2>
<p>Licensing fees from merchandise tied to Marvel characters
such as Spider-Man have boosted the results of Disney''s
consumer-products division. </p>
<p>In 2009, Kirby''s adult children sent 45 notices to Marvel
to terminate license renewals for the characters in comics
published from 1958 to 1963. Marvel sued in January 2010,
seeking a judgment that the termination notices were invalid. </p>
<p>Kirby, who died in 1994, also created or co-created the
Fantastic Four and the Avengers. His heirs said their father was
a freelance artist paid by the page who received no benefits
from Marvel. Stan Lee, who worked for Marvel as an editor, is
credited as co-author of the Hulk. </p>
<p>Marvel said in court papers that Kirby granted the company
rights to the characters in 1972 and that his children waited
too long to make their copyright claims. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) delayed by months the European
Union''s investigation into Euribor rigging amid scrutiny of
possible EU bias, according to three people familiar with the
case. </p>
<p>The trio gained more time to respond to the EU''s May
antitrust complaint after demanding to see files necessary for
their defense, said the people who asked not to be named because
the issue is private. These requests have been taken more
seriously since the EU''s ombudsman started inquiring into Credit
Agricole''s bias allegations, two of the people said. </p>
<p>''The European Commission doesn''t want to appear to have
been too tough on Credit Agricole,'' Adrien Giraud, a lawyer at
Willkie Farr  Gallagher LLP, said. ''That might explain why
they were more lenient on deadlines than usually.'' </p>
<p>The Euribor-rigging investigation has been strained since
the three refused to join four other lenders including Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) and Societe Generale SA (GLE) who paid a total of 1 billion
euros ($1.3 billion) to settle the case. The delays -- including
the latest scrapping of a mid-September deadline for responses -
- robbed Joaquin Almunia, the EU''s antitrust chief, of the
chance to impose another set of fines on the finance industry as
he prepares to leave office at the end of next month, the people
said. </p>
<p>Representatives for the commission, JPMorgan, HSBC and
Credit Agricole all declined to comment on the Euribor
investigation. </p>
<h2>Failed Settlement </h2>
<p>Almunia said this month that time has run out in his two-year long quest to clinch an antitrust settlement with Google
Inc. (GOOG) He''s also conceded that he won''t have time to complete an
antitrust probe into credit derivatives trading by 13 of the
world''s biggest banks. </p>
<p>''It''s clear that Almunia has accepted that he won''t be
able to finalize several cases'' and Euribor ''is just one more
on his list,'' Giraud said. ''The officials working on the case
aren''t therefore in as much of a hurry.'' </p>
<p>The EU ombudsman, the internal EU watchdog, opened a case
on July 31 after Credit Agricole complained that public comments
made by Almunia indicated he had already made up his mind about
the conclusion of the Euribor investigation, Bloomberg News
reported this week. </p>
<p>Almunia''s stance explains the banks'' determination to try
to delay the case until after his departure, said the people. </p>
<h2>''Fairness and Transparency'' </h2>
<p>His successor, former Danish Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager, is scheduled to take over the EU antitrust brief and
deal with the EU ombudsman''s inquiry at the start of November. </p>
<p>Vestager said this month that all cases should be ''treated
with fairness and transparency.'' </p>
<p>Aside from examining Euribor, Vestager will inherit a
preliminary probe into suspected rigging of foreign-exchange
markets, which is part of a global scandal that tarnished the
reputation of some of the world''s biggest lenders. Oil
benchmarks are also under scrutiny. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole were accused on May 20
by the commission of colluding to rig Euribor rates. </p>
<p>The so-called statement of objections was the next step in
the EU enforcement process after the banks dropped out of
settlement talks last year. The EU procedure allows them to
respond to the complaint in writing and request a hearing. If
companies fail to deflect accusations in antitrust cases they
are then usually fined. </p>
<p>The Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, and Libor, the
London Interbank Offered Rate, gauge banks'' estimated cost of
borrowing over different periods of time. Libor alone is the
benchmark interest rate for more than $300 trillion of
securities. </p>
<h2>Banks Prejudged </h2>
<p>While JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole haven''t yet been
found liable, the December settlements spell out their role in
helping to manipulate Euribor, said another person familiar with
the confidential EU documents. This suggested the EU had
prejudged the three banks before they were given their full due-process rights, said the person who is familiar with the
reasoning of a settling bank and raised the issue with the
commission. </p>
<p>The commission shouldn''t make ''any allusion to the
liability'' of companies in a final decision -- such as the
December Euribor settlements -- before the firms are given a
chance to fend off charges, according to EU case law. </p>
<p>''The companies could argue their case has been decided
before they had the chance to defend themselves,'' said Alfonso
Lamadrid, a lawyer at Garrigues in Brussels who''s not involved
in the case. This would give them ''new procedural ammunition to
challenge an eventual sanction'' in court. </p>

<p>Aabar Investments PJSC, owned by
Abu Dhabi''s sovereign wealth fund, is working with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) as it explores options for its stake in RHB Capital
Bhd. (RHBC), according to people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Aabar, the Malaysian bank''s second-largest shareholder with
a 21.2 percent stake, is seeking to protect the value of its
investment as the lender negotiates a three-way, $27 billion 
merger with CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) and Malaysia Building 
Society Bhd., the people said. It hasn''t yet signed a formal 
mandate with Goldman Sachs, one person said, asking not to be 
identified as the talks are private. </p>
<p>CIMB, Malaysia''s second-biggest bank, and RHB are
discussing structuring the deal as a reverse takeover, people
familiar with the matter said this month. The structure of the
transaction, which would value RHB at about 1.4 times book
value, is designed to overcome any potential resistance from
Aabar as it would require approval from only a majority of RHB
investors, the people said. </p>
<p>Sophie Ramsay, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Aabar officials didn''t respond to
several e-mails and phone calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>Aabar bought its RHB stake from Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank
PJSC for 10.80 ringgit per share in 2011, when RHB was the
target of a takeover battle between the country''s biggest lender
Malayan Banking Bhd. and CIMB. RHB shares traded at 8.86 ringgit
at 3:07 p.m. today in Kuala Lumpur, 18 percent below Aabar''s
purchase price. </p>
<h2>EPF''s Vote </h2>
<p>CIMB, RHB and Malaysia Building Society (MBS) in July announced
plans for a three-way merger that would create the country''s
largest banking group by assets. The companies, which have a
combined market value of about $27 billion, entered into a 90-day exclusive agreement to negotiate and finalize the price and
structure of the merger, according to a July 10 joint statement
from the lenders. </p>
<p>Under a proposal being discussed, RHB would issue new
shares to acquire CIMB, whose market value is two and a half
times bigger, people familiar with the talks said earlier this
month. An outright acquisition by CIMB would require approval
from 75 percent of RHB shareholders, leaving Aabar in a stronger
position to scuttle the deal. </p>
<p>Even so, engaging with Aabar may become more important amid
uncertainty about whether Malaysian pension manager Employees
Provident Fund, which owns stakes in all three banks, will be
allowed by the country''s stock exchange to vote on the deal. EPF
controls 40.9 percent of RHB. </p>
<p>EPF wrote to the three lenders on Aug. 26, saying it should
be given a waiver allowing the fund to vote on the proposed
merger, Malaysian newspaper The Star reported Sept. 5. </p>
<p>CIMB and RHB are discussing making the merger proposal
conditional on EPF being allowed to vote, three people familiar
with the talks said. The exclusivity period for the merger talks
expires Oct. 8. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Xalkori for advanced
lung cancer shrunk tumors in those with a rare genetic mutation,
according to a study that may provide the first targeted
treatment for these patients. </p>
<p>Xalkori reduced the size of tumors in 36 of 50 patients in
the study while halting tumor growth in another nine, according
to company-funded research released today at the European
Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Madrid and online in the
New England Journal of Medicine. </p>
<p>About 15,000 people, or 1 percent of the estimated 1.5
million annual new cases of non-small-cell lung cancer, have an
abnormality to the ROS1 gene, according to New York-based
Pfizer. Today''s findings also showed that Xalkori was effective
for about 18 months in patients, longer than the average eight
to 12 months seen for some other targeted treatments, said Alice
Shaw, a lead study author. </p>
<p>''We''re seeing much longer durations of remissions,'' Shaw,
an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said in a telephone
interview. ''This points to being a very good target in lung
cancer and this drug being a very effective targeted therapy for
these patients.'' </p>
<p>Xalkori helps shut off the ROS1 gene that is causing cancer
tumors to grow, she said. It was approved in 2011 to treat non-small-cell lung cancers in patients with mutations to the ALK
gene, which has structural similarities to the ROS1 gene. The
National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 25 cancer
centers, already recommends that doctors use Xalkori in patients
who have this gene defect. </p>
<h2>More Testing </h2>
<p>''Pfizer continues to support clinical research of Xalkori
in patients with ROS1 rearrangements to better understand the
compound''s activity in this population,'' Sally Beatty, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The cancer drug generated $282 million in 2013 sales,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The drug may produce
revenue of more than $812 million in 2017, according to the
average of five analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Patients with a mutation to the ROS1 gene are often younger
and usually aren''t smokers, Shaw said. </p>
<p>Today''s study is an expansion of the original Phase 1
clinical trial of Xalkori in patients with the ALK gene
mutation. Researchers enrolled 50 patients who were ROS1
positive starting in late 2010 through August 2013. Those in the
study received Xalkori two times daily. </p>
<p>By the end of the trial, half of the patients were still
getting Xalkori and had no signs of their tumors growing, the
authors said. </p>
<p>''We''re hopeful that because of showing how well this drug
works in ROS1 patients, this will let pathologists know they
need to screen their patients for this genetic abnormality,''
Shaw said. ''In lung cancer there''s been a lot of progress made
in targeted therapies.'' </p>

<p>The European Central Bank will
start its asset-purchase program with covered bonds because
large trades in the debt are easier than for asset-backed
securities, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The new-issue market for covered notes is more active than
for asset-backed debt and investors typically hold larger
amounts than ABS buyers, JPMorgan analysts led by Gareth Davies
wrote in a note to clients. With 791 billion euros ($1 trillion)
of covered bonds outstanding, compared with 251 billion euros of
ABS, the central bank will also find it easier to expand its
balance sheet, Davies said. </p>
<p>Policy makers are seeking to spur economic growth by
encouraging lending and will disclose the size and details of
the program after policy makers meet this week. ECB President
Mario Draghi, who has made the revival of the ABS market a top
priority this year as he seeks to channel credit to businesses
by freeing up bank balance sheets, mentioned purchases of
covered bonds for the first time this month. </p>
<p>''The ECB is likely to begin its purchase program in the
covered bond space as it is unlikely to be able to do meaningful
size in the ABS market,'' London-based Davies said in a
telephone interview today. ''If the ECB wants a strong sentiment
change by making large purchases it''s hard to do that in the
secondary or new-issue ABS markets as there quite simply aren''t
enough bonds.'' </p>
<p>The debt-buying plans have been greeted with skepticism by
investors who suggest the central bank will struggle to buy
enough securities after the market contracted more than 40
percent since 2010. Covered bond purchases are being considered
to expand the amount of assets available to purchase. </p>
<h2>Retained ABS </h2>
<p>Draghi said earlier this month the Frankfurt-based central
bank will buy a broad portfolio of ''simple and transparent
securities'' that will include ABS and covered bonds. While
declining to disclose the size of the program, he signaled a
willingness to grow the ECB''s balance sheet by as much 1
trillion euros. </p>
<p>Europe''s public ABS market isn''t big enough to achieve that
goal and purchases of the 635 billion euros of notes created and
retained by banks to use as collateral for central bank funding
during the financial crisis wouldn''t effect the ECB''s balance
sheet, said Davies. </p>
<p>Banks create asset-backed securities by bundling individual
loans such as mortgages, auto credit and credit-card debt.
Covered bonds are guaranteed by the issuer and have a designated
pool of assets, such as mortgages and public sector loans, which
can be used to meet payments if the issuer can''t. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) lost a bid to
block buyers of $10 billion worth of residential mortgage-backed
securities it packaged in 2007 to proceed as a group with their
lawsuit alleging the bank misled them. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan today ruled
that the claims of investors in nine separate offerings of the
securities were similar enough for them to move forward as a
class on the question of whether JPMorgan is liable for making
false and misleading statements in the offering documents. </p>
<p>The ruling only applies to liability. Oetken said he wasn''t
convinced at this stage that there''s a damages calculation that
would cover the claims of all the investors included in the
group. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last year agreed to a $13 billion settlement with
the U.S. to resolve allegations the bank misled investors in
mortgage-backed securities about the soundness and risks of the
investments that helped bring on subprime-mortgage crisis of
2008. </p>
<p>''Because the class is currently certified for liability
purposes, this phase of litigation will focus on the issue of
whether defendants made material false statements or omissions
in the offering documents that affected the value of the
certificates owned by the plaintiff class members,'' the judge
said. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on today''s ruling. </p>
<p>Class certification will allow individual investors who
haven''t filed a lawsuit to be represented by the lead plaintiff
in a single case because their experiences and legal claims are
similar. Class-action status is less expensive for plaintiffs
than filing multiple lawsuits and provides leverage in
settlement negotiations. </p>

<p>West Texas Intermediate crude may be
nearing a price floor because a move below $90 a barrel would
prompt some U.S. producers to reduce drilling, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>WTI futures traded near $92 a barrel today after plunging
13 percent in the three months ended yesterday, the U.S.
benchmark''s biggest quarterly drop in more than two years.
Prices are close to a level that would make production
unprofitable for some companies in higher-cost places such as
North Dakota, Goldman''s head of commodities research, Jeff Currie, said in London today. </p>
<p>''U.S. producers may lay down rigs and slow production if
WTI keeps falling below $90,'' Currie said in an interview
during the World Commodities Week conference. The potential for
oil prices to fall further is also ''limited'' because of
threats to supply, particularly in Libya, Currie said. </p>

barrel in three months, while Brent, the European benchmark,
rebounds to $100. Brent traded at about $95 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange today in London. </p>
<p>''The downside is limited, unless the economic situation
outside the U.S. deteriorates further,'' Currie said. </p>
<p>Disappointing economic growth in China would mean that
Brent might miss the target, Currie said. Concern that China is
slowing, coupled with the strengthening U.S. dollar, sparked a
selloff across commodities yesterday that pulled oil lower, he
said. WTI fell 3.6 percent yesterday to $91.16 a barrel, the
biggest drop since November 2012, according to New York
Mercantile Exchange data. </p>

<p>''The picture''s a tad more bearish,'' Currie said. ''Our
baseline view is an acceleration in demand into 2015 and
slightly lower production. My conviction in our baseline view is
waning with recent macro data.'' </p>
<p>China''s manufacturing remained subdued last month as the
world''s second-largest economy was weighed down by a property
slump. The government''s Purchasing Managers'' Index (CPMINDX) was at 51.1
in September, the same as August''s reading. </p>
<p>A pullback in manufacturing, declining industrial profits,
and factory-output growth at a five-year low point to a
deepening economic slowdown. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predict China will expand 7 percent in 2015, the slowest pace
since 1990. </p>
<h2>Supply Threats </h2>
<p>''The political situation in Libya is one of the most
tenuous we''ve seen since unrest first erupted,'' Currie said. </p>
<p>The holder of Africa''s biggest oil reserves remains divided
politically even as its production has tripled to 780,000
barrels a day last month from 250,000 a day in May, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its internationally recognized
government shifted to the eastern city of al-Bayda and a
different administration allied with Islamist militias has
seized control of the capital, Tripoli. </p>
<p>The nation''s production, currently at about 900,000 barrels
a day, was disrupted last month by protests at the Gialo field
and a rocket attack that damaged the Zawiya refinery, according
to Mohamed Elharari, a spokesman at National Oil Corp. </p>
<p>''You lose some of Libya, China shows an acceleration, you
get a slight reduction in Saudi Arabian production, and the
market would be back up to $100,'' Currie said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank, today described the size of its previously disclosed data breach, ranking it among the year''s largest-known cyber-attacks. Here''s what customers need to know: </p> <p>Q. How big was the breach? A. JPMorgan estimated that data on 76 million households and 7 million small businesses were compromised, without identifying locations. For perspective, the U.S. had about 115 million households total as of 2012. The breach affected people who visited the firm''s websites, including Chase.com, or used its mobile app, said a person briefed on the matter. </p> <p>Q. What information was taken? A. User contact information including names, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses. Internal data identifying customers by category -- such as whether they''re clients of the mortgage, auto, credit-card or private-bank divisions -- also were exposed, the person said. </p> <p>Graphic: Top U.S. Data Breaches</p><p>Q. What wasn''t taken? A. JPMorgan said there''s no evidence hackers stole account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers. </p> <p>Q. Are hackers draining accounts, and is my money safe? A. JPMorgan said it hasn''t seen any unusual fraud linked to the breach. Customers aren''t liable for unauthorized transactions if the bank is promptly alerted, the company said. </p> <p>Internet Security</p><p>Q. What should I do to protect myself? A. Because account IDs and passwords weren''t compromised, JPMorgan said it isn''t necessary to obtain new credit or debit cards, change passwords or obtain identity or credit monitoring as a result of the incident. The firm said customers should alert it immediately if they spot suspicious transactions. </p> <p>Q. What can hackers do with contact information? A. Phishing scams are typically the biggest risk, according to JPMorgan. That''s when criminals contact people and try to trick them into handing over account details or other sensitive information. The bank warned customers not to click links or download attachments on e-mails from unknown senders and to be wary of other suspicious communications. </p> <p>', 'Here''s What You Need to Know About JPMorgan''s Data Breach', 'By Katia Dmitrieva and Michael Riley', 'Oct 02, 2014  7:11 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-02/here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-jpmorgan-s-data-breach.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.''s six-month-old agreement to buy JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s physical
commodities business for $3.5 billion was revised to cover only
$800 million of assets, according to people familiar with the
change. </p>
<p>JPMorgan plans to sell the rest of the business in separate
transactions, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the final deal''s terms haven''t been made public. Some
separate sales have already been agreed, one person said. The
Wall Street Journal reported on the changes earlier today. </p>
<p>Trading houses such as Mercuria are filling the void as
banks from JPMorgan and Barclays Plc to Deutsche Bank AG and
Morgan Stanley (MS) withdraw from or scale back physical commodity
operations amid increased regulatory scrutiny of lenders owning,
storing and trading raw materials. Founded in 2004 by former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi,
Mercuria has grown to become the world''s fourth-largest
independent commodity trader with 2013 revenue of $112 billion. </p>
<p>Among the assets not being purchased by Mercuria include a
crude oil supply agreement to a refinery in St. Paul, Minnesota,
the refinery''s owner, Northern Tier Energy LP, said in a
regulatory filing last month. </p>
<h2>Earnings Boost </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s physical commodity business, formerly led by
Blythe Masters, has previously generated annual operating profit
before compensation costs of $750 million, according to people
who have seen documents related to the unit''s sale. That would
bring Mercuria, which posted net income of $273 million last
year, closer to earnings achieved by competitors Vitol Group and
Trafigura Beheer BV. </p>
<p>Mercuria competed with Macquarie Group Ltd. and Blackstone
Group LP to enter exclusive negotiations for the unit in
February, people with knowledge of the bidding said at the time.
The JPMorgan unit, put up for sale last year, was slated to give
Mercuria gas and power trading operations on both sides of the
Atlantic, physical assets spanning about 40 locations in North
America and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian
oil sands. </p>
<p>Mercuria also gets Henry Bath  Sons Ltd., a 220-year-old
metal-warehouse operator based in Liverpool, England, that will
be operated as a stand-alone subsidiary separated from
Mercuria''s trading operations. Henry Bath was a founding member
of the London Metal Exchange, and handles products that include
aluminum, steel and copper as well as cocoa and coffee,
according to its website. </p>
<p>Mercuria, which is registered in Cyprus and has its main
trading operations in Geneva, offered jobs to about 200 people,
or about half of the unit''s staff, a person familiar with the
matter said in March. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s board found a way
to keep Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger in place
until 2018 while maximizing the chances the internal candidates
most likely to succeed him stick around. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, yesterday extended
Iger''s contract by two years to June 2018. The move keeps in
place a manager who has spearheaded high-profile acquisitions
like Marvel, turned around the company''s historic animation
business and tripled Disney''s stock price. </p>
<p>At the same time, the company has decided to name a chief
operating officer next year -- and that executive, most likely
coming from within, would be Iger''s heir apparent, according to
a person close to the company. Giving a time frame to the
internal candidates, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and
Parks  Resorts Chairman Thomas Staggs, makes them less likely
to bolt before a decision is made. </p>
<p>''There''s no doubt Bob Iger has been performing at an
outstanding level,'' said William Simon, an executive recruiter
who heads the entertainment industry practice at Korn Ferry (KFY) in
Los Angeles. ''Asking a potential successor to wait four years
could prove to be difficult.'' </p>
<p>The company said in a filing today that Iger could earn a
retention bonus of $60 million if Disney''s operating income
increases to a cumulative $78.3 billion for the five years
ending in September 2018. He will earn a smaller bonus if that
number tops $76 billion. For the year that ended in September
2013, the company generated operating income of $10.7 billion. </p>

<p>Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. is hiring
just one JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) metals trader as the Swiss trading
house pares back its purchase of the New York-based bank''s
commodity unit, three people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Jonathan Berchole will trade aluminum, nickel and tin for
Mercuria in London, said the people, who asked not to be

about $800 million for part of the JPMorgan assets, less than
the $3.5 billion cited by the bank when it announced the deal
for the whole unit in March. </p>

and inventories or its two crude-supply contracts for U.S.
refineries, the bank still expects to recoup $3.5 billion for

<h2>Trademarks for Cord Auto Offered for Private Sale, Auction </h2>
<p>Leake Auction Co. of Tulsa, Oklahoma, will be selling the
trademarks related to the Cord automobile, the company said in a
statement. </p>
<p>According to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, two ''Cord'' trademarks are registered to the Auburn-Cord-Dusenberg Co. of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. One is for toy
cars and the other is for original and replacement parts for
antique cars. </p>
<p>The auction house said the two trademarks for sale had
belonged to the late Glenn Pray of Broken Arrow. His family is
now selling them. Pray sold the Dusenberg mark for $500,000, the
auction house said. </p>
<p>The original Cord, which had its debut in 1929, was the
first front-wheel drive car in the U.S., according to the Car 
Driver website. It sold for about $3,000 and was available in
several models, including one intended to be chauffeur-driven.
The Hemmings car-collector website lists antique Cord vehicles
for sale for as much as $225,000. </p>
<p>The auction company said the two trademarks are available
separately as private sales through Oct. 22. After that, they
will be removed from the market and offered at the Leake
Collector Car Show  Auction in Dallas on Nov. 22. </p>
<h2>Coca-Cola Defeats $100 Million Infringement Claim Over Coke Zero </h2>
<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) prevailed in a trademark suit brought by a
now-defunct Illinois producer of bottled water. </p>
<p>The suit was filed in Illinois federal court in 2008, with
Mirza Baig and his Blue Springs Water Co. seeking $100 million
in damages. </p>
<p>Baig said Coca-Cola stole his idea to sell Zero-brand no-calorie soft drinks and claimed that Coke Zero and Sprite Zero
infringed. He said he approached the Atlanta-based soda giant
about buying his business and the overture was rejected. </p>
<p>He had filed an application in 1997 to register ''Naturally
Zero'' as a trademark.  That application was initially refused.
After Baig amended it, he was refused again in 2005, according
to court papers. </p>
<p>In a Sept. 24 ruling, the court said there was no evidence
in the record that Baig''s Naturally Zero water ''ever held any
significant share of the market for bottled water or soft
drinks.'' Baig also failed to present any consumer testimony,
surveys or evidence of intentional copying, the court said. </p>
<p>The court ruled that Baig and Blue Springs abandoned the
trademark application, and dismissed his claim against Coca-Cola. </p>
<p>Baig also said Coca-Cola infringed his Canadian trademark.
The court relinquished jurisdiction over that claim and
dismissed it. </p>
