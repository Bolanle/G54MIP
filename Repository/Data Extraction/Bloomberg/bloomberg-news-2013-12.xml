&lt;p&gt;Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong
will post the biggest gain since 2009 next year on prospects the
economy will stabilize, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), also known as the H-share index, will rally 18 percent to 13,600 by the end of 2014,
Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs,
wrote in a report yesterday. The advance would be the biggest
since the gauge surged 62 percent in 2009. The measure dropped
0.8 percent to 11,450.55 at the midday break in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s manufacturing growth beat analyst estimates in
November, indicating the nation&#8217;s economic recovery is
sustaining momentum amid government efforts to rein in credit
growth. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s H-share forecast forms part of a trade
recommendation in which the bank is telling investors to buy
Chinese stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities
will lag the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade
its fourth top recommendation for next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Equities are our favorite asset class in an environment
where growth is moderate but not overheating, while policy
makers remain accommodative,&#8221; Weisberger said by phone
yesterday. &#8220;For the first time in the last several years, we
would argue to own exposure to China through the Chinese equity
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China last month vowed to allow more private investment in
state-controlled industries, loosen its one-child policy and
better protect farmers&#8217; rights in the most sweeping reforms in
two decades. The government also pledged to elevate the role of
markets in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;H-Share Valuation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists estimate gross domestic product will expand 7.5
percent next year after growing 7.6 percent this year, according
to the median projection in Bloomberg News surveys last month.
The government set a target for 7.5 percent expansion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the H-share index closed yesterday at the highest
level since Feb. 20, it still traded 19 percent below its
average valuation of the last five years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg based on estimated earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been positive for China for quite some time and
it&#8217;s an overweight country for us,&#8221; Allan Conway, who oversees
$27 billion as head of emerging market equities at Schroder
Investment Management in London, said in a phone interview
yesterday. Chinese stocks account for about 22 percent of his
portfolio. &#8220;The market is attractively priced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copper Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) slipped 0.1 percent to
2,205.56 today. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in New York lost 0.1 percent to 108.17
yesterday while the iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest
Chinese exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.9 percent to
$39.79. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index dropped 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Weisberger said buying the H-share and
selling copper futures may generate a combined return of 25
percent next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While stability in China&#8217;s growth is enough to boost &#8220;risk
sentiment&#8221; after the H-share index fell 12 percent over the
past three years, it&#8217;s insufficient to lift demand for copper as
a supply glut weighs on the market, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think the current context is a little bit different
whereas whatever growth acceleration we are going to see in the
coming year is going to be a developed market theme,&#8221; said
Weisberger. &#8220;When the economic growth is driven by the
developed market, it&#8217;s going to leave the commodity behind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weisberger ended a recommendation to buy China&#8217;s H shares
in November 2011 after the trade lost 5 percent. The Hang Seng
China index rallied about 22 percent in the three months after
he advised clients to exit the bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H-share wager is the fourth top trade recommended by
Goldman for 2014. The other recommendations include buying SP
500 futures while selling the Australian dollar; betting
European interest rate swaps will decline while five-year
Treasury yields will rise; and selling the Canadian dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#8217;s trading in New York, SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN),
the nation&#8217;s biggest real estate website owner, gained the most
among Chinese companies, surging 11 percent to $71.85. E-House
China Holdings Ltd. (EJ), a real-estate service provider, rose 6.3
percent to $11.35. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd., (HOLI) an automation system
manufacturer, declined 5.7 percent to $17.90. The company said
on Dec. 1 that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Changli Wang
resigned. Jianfeng He, who was chief operating officer, was
elected chairman, while Baiqing Shao, a senior vice president,
will become CEO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the world&#8217;s biggest trading firms, had their
revised capital plans for 2013 cleared by the Federal Reserve
yesterday, a month before next year&#8217;s submissions are required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Fed didn&#8217;t object to the banks&#8217; proposals in
March, the New York-based firms were required to resubmit them
after weaknesses were found in projections of revenue and
potential losses, a Fed official said at the time. The
submissions from all 18 banks in this year&#8217;s Comprehensive
Capital Analysis  Review, or CCAR, are now approved ahead of
the next round due the first week of January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators, intent on preventing a repeat of the 2008
credit crisis, run annual stress tests to see how the largest
lenders would fare in a recession or economic shock. Banks need
Fed approval to raise dividends and increase share buybacks.
Yesterday&#8217;s announcement is a welcome development for JPMorgan,
the subject of more than a half dozen U.S. probes, said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst with Guggenheim Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Though this is more of a procedural holdover from the
2013 CCAR, it just reassures JPMorgan investors that while there
were significant overhang issues, and still are to a degree,
there is still a base of capital and risk management that
regulators generally believe is more than adequate,&#8221; Mosby
said. &#8220;That makes this a little more newsworthy than it
would&#8217;ve been otherwise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gay rights activists plan to defy
Russian President Vladimir Putin and pressure Olympic sponsors
including Coca-Cola Co. (KO) during the Sochi Games by encouraging
athletes to protest a national ban on homosexual &#8220;propaganda.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athlete Ally, based in New York, said it&#8217;s in talks with
Australian snowboarder Belle Brockhoff and Canadian Alpine skier
Mike Janyk as well as two other athletes about wearing logos
referring to the Olympic charter, which bans all forms of
discrimination in its sixth principle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a tremendous opportunity because the world is
going to be watching,&#8221; Hudson Taylor, Athlete Ally&#8217;s founder
and executive director, said by phone on Nov. 27. The sponsors
will have &#8220;no choice&#8221; but to respond, Taylor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s largest beverage company, and
McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD), the biggest global restaurant chain by sales,
have already endured protests in the U.S. over their sponsorship
of the Sochi Games, as has Procter  Gamble, the world&#8217;s largest
consumer-products maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Out, a New York-based gay rights group with 1.9 million
members around the world, hired trucks in October to circle
Coca-Cola&#8217;s headquarters in Atlanta with billboards urging the
drink maker to call on Russia to repeal the law signed by Putin
in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelers Cos. (TRV), the only property
insurer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is too expensive to
be a defensive pick for investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
while outlining a &#8220;cautious&#8221; outlook for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer&#8217;s rating was downgraded to neutral from buy,
Goldman Sachs analysts led by Michael Nannizzi wrote in a note
to clients today. New York-based Travelers has rallied about 80
percent since September 2011, when it was added to the bank&#8217;s
list of stocks to buy in the Americas, compared with the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index&#8217;s 50 percent gain, the analysts
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at property-casualty insurers were helped this
year as underwriting margins widened, claims costs from natural
disasters fell and reserves proved redundant. Such benefits may
be unsustainable, making the industry less attractive after some
companies&#8217; stock valuations rose, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Leading commercial insurers are at all-time highs,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;On a relative-value basis, the sector is
simply less defensive than at past market highs when valuations
for the group were depressed relative to other industries, which
made it a natural defensive choice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelers fell 1.9 percent to $89 at 4 p.m. in New York,
the biggest decline since July. The insurer ended November
trading 33 percent above book value, the highest in about six
years relative to the measure of assets minus liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for Travelers, declined to
comment on the note. Goldman Sachs also downgraded commercial
insurer W.R. Berkley Corp. to sell from neutral, citing
valuation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s bad bank will sell 437
million euros ($592 million) of loans to Realia Business SA (RLIA) at a
46 percent discount to their face value to Fortress Investment
Group LLC (FIG), two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least nine funds expressed an interest in buying the
debt from Sareb, as the Spanish bank is known, one of the people
said. They both asked not to be identified because the
information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain set up Sareb last year to absorb 50.8 billion euros
in real estate assets from lenders including the Bankia group
that took state aid. Sareb has raised 1.7 billion euros this
year, beating its target of 1.5 billion euros, Deputy Economy
Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said at a conference in Madrid
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Madrid-based Sareb declined to comment. A
spokesman for Fortress, based in New York, also wouldn&#8217;t
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criminal gangs are shipping the equivalent of 60 to 100 tanker trucks of subsidized Venezuelan fuel per day into Colombia, much of it paid for with cocaine, according to the Colombian government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 10 percent and 15 percent of fuel used by Colombian drivers is smuggled from neighboring countries, Juan Ricardo Ortega, the head of the nation&#8217;s tax and customs agency DIAN, said in a Nov. 28 interview in Bogota. That&#8217;s led to a slump in fuel duties collected by the government and a warning to BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP), Anglo American Plc. (AAL) and Glencore Xstrata Plc. (GLEN)&#8217;s Cerrejon coal complex over the source of fuel for its trucks. Cerrejon said it&#8217;s investigating the situation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tankers are loading up on gasoline and diesel purchased near the border in Venezuela&#8217;s Zulia state for about one cent a gallon and driving into Colombia abetted by corrupt government officials and local politicians, according to Ortega. The Colombian state has &#8220;zero control&#8221; over the border province of La Guajira in the northeast of the country, which has a centuries-old smuggling tradition, Ortega said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly the DIAN, the Governor of the department, employees of the department and the police are incredibly corrupt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In Venezuela, the state police are particularly involved. They lost all control of the police in Zulia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it&#8217;s selling
every Xbox One player it can make, after introducing the new
game console on Nov. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales are setting records, the Redmond, Washington-based
software maker said yesterday in a statement, without being more
specific. Users have already spent more than 50 million hours on
games and entertainment, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Demand is far exceeding supply in the 13 countries we&#8217;ve
launched and we are sold out at retailers around the world,&#8221;
Yusuf Mehdi, vice president of strategy and marketing for Xbox,
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may not want to issue a lower number than the 2.1
million units that Sony Corp. (6758) reported it had sold as of Dec. 1
for the PlayStation 4, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at
Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. The software maker limited
its Xbox introduction to 13 countries, from 21 initially
planned, to make sure larger markets had sufficient supplies,
and reported first-day sales of more than 1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Microsoft with Edelman public relations
declined to comment yesterday beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony (SNE), which introduced the PlayStation 4 starting Nov. 15,
said yesterday its tally included about 700,000 units purchased
by consumers in Europe and Australasian markets after the player
went on sale in those regions Nov. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each company probably has factory capacity to make
1 million consoles a month, said Pachter. About 55 percent of
the 4.5 million PlayStation 4s produced by the end of January
will go to North American retailers, he estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, fell 0.4
percent to $38.31 yesterday in New York. The stock has gained 43
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony American depositary receipts fell 1 percent $18.41 and
have gained 64 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and two other banks rejected a European Union deal to end an antitrust probe into the rigging of Euribor lending rates, risking higher fines and challenging the future of the EU&#8217;s settlement process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The EU is seeking to announce two sets of settlements as soon as today with banks accused of colluding to rig the London interbank offered rate and Euribor, according to a person familiar with the EU&#8217;s probe who asked not to be identified because the process is private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While global fines for rate-rigging have already topped $3.7 billion, the cost to banks may climb as they face lawsuits worldwide. An EU accord includes a finding of liability that can be used in civil cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan joined HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Agricole SA in pulling out of the Euribor settlement talks, according to the person. ICAP Plc won&#8217;t take part in the Libor settlement process, which relates to the yen, the Financial Times reported yesterday, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rejecting a settlement and facing a higher fine could be worth the risk, said Noelle Lenoir, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis  Frankel LLP in Paris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies &#8220;know full well that admitting to what they are charged with would be a money pit,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santos Ltd. (STO), Australia&#8217;s third-largest oil and gas producer, expects output to rise as much as
12 percent next year, driven by the start of a $19 billion
natural gas project in Papua New Guinea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production will be 52 million to 57 million barrels of oil
equivalent in 2014, the Adelaide-based company said today in a
presentation. Santos said it will produce 51 million barrels
this year, down from its October forecast that it would produce
at the low end of a 52 million to 55 million barrel range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos will receive a boost from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s
liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, which is
scheduled to begin next year, and is looking to expand in the
Pacific nation, Chief Executive Officer David Knox said today on
an investor webcast. Santos also is building the $18.5 billion
Gladstone LNG project in Queensland, one of seven under
construction in Australia to meet Asian demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production is projected to climb to 80 million to 90
million barrels by 2020, it said today. Santos&#8217;s operations
include the Fletcher-Finucane oil project off Western Australia,
the Chim Sao oil field in Vietnam and assets in central
Australia&#8217;s Cooper Basin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos dropped 1.6 percent to A$14.07 as of 10:22 a.m. in
Sydney, while Australia&#8217;s benchmark SP/ASX 200 Index fell 0.4
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s cut in the 2013 production forecast was the second
time this year Santos had lowered its outlook. The company had
originally forecast 2013 output of 53 million to 57 million
barrels in November last year before cutting it in July, citing
delays at projects in Asia and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) sold $8 billion of
bonds in dollars and euros, a record offering from the world&#8217;s
largest software maker that followed Johnson  Johnson by
issuing AAA rated corporate securities this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft borrowed $3.25 billion with five-, 10- and 30-year notes in the U.S. currency, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Redmond, Washington-based company also issued 3.5
billion euros ($4.8 billion) of bonds split between eight- and
15-year portions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-ranked borrowers are seeking to raise cash from the
bond market even as investors favor the higher yields of lower-rated debt amid speculation the Federal Reserve will soon taper
stimulus measures that pushed interest rates to record lows. The
Bank of America Merrill Lynch AAA U.S. Corporate Index has lost
4.2 percent this year, compared with a 6.9 percent gain for
dollar-denominated speculative-grade securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds will fund general corporate purposes, Microsoft
said in regulatory filings today. The euro sale is more than six
times the size of its only previous issue in the currency of 550
million euros in 20-year notes that won a record-low 2.625
percent coupon for similar-maturity nonfinancial corporate bonds
on April 25, Bloomberg data show. That sale coincided with
almost $2 billion of dollar debt issued in three parts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co. (KKR), the private-equity firm
run by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, hired Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) to sell its Turkish shipping company U.N. Ro-Ro
Isletmeleri AS, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York buyout firm, which bought the operator of
roll-on roll-off transport vessels for about 910 million euros
($1.2 billion) in 2007, plans to sell its majority stake in the
Istanbul-based company next year, the people said, asking not to
be identified because the matter is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR&#8217;s assets include private equity, credit, hedge funds
and other alternatives to stocks and bonds. The firm has been
among the most active buyout firms in deploying capital this
year and last month sold about 1.1 billion-euros worth of shares
with Permira Advisers LLP in ProSiebenSat.1. Media AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR bought 97.6 percent of the Turkish company, which
counts 12 vessels in its fleet and operates routes to Italy&#8217;s
Trieste, Toulon in France, and to Damietta in Egypt, in its
first acquisition in Turkey and the biggest private equity
investment in the country at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.N. Ro-Ro, originally set up by a group of Turkish
transporters in 1994, increased sales to 221.8 million euros in
2012, from 218 million euros in 2011, according to its website.
Sales were 164.5 million euros when KKR bought it in 2007.
Sailings rose to 627 in 2012 from 609 in the previous year and
506 in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S., German and U.K. government bond
yields are too low to be attractive given the outlook for
improving global growth, according to JPMorgan Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury 10-year notes should yield 3.50 percent based on
growth and inflation forecasts and the impact of the Federal
Reserve&#8217;s asset-purchase program, instead of today&#8217;s 2.78
percent, JPMorgan executives said in a presentation in London.
Benchmark German bund yields should be at 2.20 percent, versus
1.72 percent, while similar-maturity U.K. gilts should yield
3.30 percent instead of 2.82 percent, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still can&#8217;t get too excited about government bonds,&#8221;
said Iain Stealey, a portfolio manager for JPMorgan&#8217;s
international fixed-income group. &#8220;If gilt yields or Treasury
yields wax and wane you can still lose a little bit of money
owning government bonds. We don&#8217;t see there to be much
opportunity there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Treasury yield climbed to this year&#8217;s high of
3.01 percent on Sept. 6, from as low as 1.61 percent in May, as
signs the world&#8217;s largest economy is gaining momentum fueled
bets the Fed is moving toward reducing its $85 billion a month
in asset purchases. The yield was last at 3.50 percent in
April 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries have lost investors 2.5 percent this year after
returning 2 percent in 2012 and 10 percent in 2011, according to
Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Gilts dropped 3.6 percent and
German securities fell 1.2 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Low&#8217; Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People want fixed income that can potentially give them
some sort of return and government bonds used to do that,&#8221; said
Nick Gartside, international chief investment officer for fixed-income at the New York-based investment bank, which manages $1.5
trillion. &#8220;What we&#8217;re seeing from institutional investors is
they want a source of fixed income that can potentially give
them a return, which clearly with low government bond yields and
low corporate bond yields is a stretch.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bases its estimate for where the Treasury 10-year
yield should be on a 2014 growth forecast of 2.6 percent and
inflation prediction of 1.9 percent, and a reduction of 1
percentage point due to the impact of the Fed&#8217;s debt-purchase
program known as quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) are marketing bonds in euros, spurring deals in the
currency from U.S. borrowers to the most since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American companies have raised 39 billion euros ($53
billion) from debt sales this year, compared with 20 billion
euros in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
average yield gap between investment-grade bonds in euros and
dollars is 1.3 percent, approaching the widest discount for
borrowers in the common currency since Sept. 13, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank&#8217;s decision to cut its benchmark
rate last month as it seeks to boost a sputtering recovery in
the 17-nation bloc helped extend the advantage for borrowers in
euros. Speculation the Federal Reserve will start reducing
stimulus increased yesterday when data showed U.S. manufacturing
grew in November at the fastest pace in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The euro market is much cheaper than the dollar market
today,&#8221; said Microsoft Treasurer George Zinn in an e-mailed
response to questions. &#8220;We are being opportunistic and looking
at rates across the globe. We can use the proceeds from these
bonds for any general, domestic purpose.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s bad bank will sell 437
million euros ($592 million) of loans taken by Realia Business
SA (RLIA) to Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) for 46 percent less than
their face value, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the New York-based private-equity firm, at
least eight funds expressed interest in buying the debt from the
Madrid-based bank known as Sareb, one of the people said. Both
asked not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government set up Sareb last year to absorb 50.8
billion euros in real estate assets from lenders including the
Bankia group that took state aid after the Spanish property
market slumped. Sareb has raised 1.7 billion euros this year,
beating its target of 1.5 billion euros, Deputy Economy Minister
Fernando Jimenez Latorre said at a conference in Madrid last
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realia, Spain&#8217;s second-largest publicly traded real estate
company by market value, reported a nine-month net loss of 17.3
million euros and net financial debt of 2.2 billion euros. Last
month, the Bankia group and Fomento de Construcciones y
Contratas SA, which together own about 58 percent of Realia,
hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to seek buyers for their stakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realia rose as much as 2.2 percent in Madrid trading and
was up little changed at 91 cents as of 11:52 a.m. The stock has
climbed 21 percent this year, giving the company a market value
of 251 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong over a $34.3 million loss on Brazilian real-yen options trades he claimed the bank misled him into making. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oei accused the New York-based bank of fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent inducement and unjust enrichment in papers filed yesterday in New York state court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rejected allegations that it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter it wrote to Oei in July and filed in a Singapore court, where the businessman is suing a unit of the bank over the same loss. The bank has said it will defend that lawsuit, which it is seeking to halt in favor of private and confidential arbitration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of clients are like me, they trust the big banks like they trust their doctors,&#8221; Oei, 65, said in an interview today. His friends have had similar experiences and he is suing for &#8220;justice and fairness&#8221; for all clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New York, said Oei&#8217;s lawsuit is without merit and will be defended. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oei said in the New York lawsuit that he cut dealings with Goldman Sachs in 2011 after it profited on a losing trade it persuaded him to make. He said he resumed transactions after senior executives including President Gary Cohn and Asia head David Ryan visited him in April 2012 and said his interests would be placed first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won European Union
approval for its 5.44 billion-euro ($7.4 billion) bid to take
over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset business as regulators warned that they
would monitor Nokia&#8217;s licensing practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said it &#8220;will remain vigilant and
closely monitor Nokia&#8217;s post-merger licensing practices under EU
antitrust rules,&#8221; according to an e-mailed statement. Any
possible competition concerns over Nokia&#8217;s conduct as the owner
of a portfolio of smartphone patents &#8220;falls outside the scope&#8221;
of the EU&#8217;s review of the Microsoft transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s bid for Nokia&#8217;s mobile-phone business didn&#8217;t
raise any antitrust issues because the companies&#8217; businesses
only have a &#8220;minimal&#8221; overlap, the EU said. Microsoft is
unlikely to restrict the supply of its Windows operating system
for mobile phones or its mobile apps or to restrict rivals&#8217;
access to its business mail service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker will pay 3.79 billion
euros for Nokia&#8217;s devices division and 1.65 billion euros to
license patents, according to a statement from the companies.
Microsoft and Nokia face an EU antitrust complaint filed by
Google Inc. last year that alleged the companies were using
patents to thwart competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also complained in its own name and as part
of industry groups over Google&#8217;s Android operating system for
mobile phones and its search engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is &#8220;pleased that the European Commission has
cleared the deal without conditions,&#8221; Robin Koch, a spokesman
for the company in Brussels, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company won approval from the
EU for the deal more than eight months after it was fined 561
million euros by the same regulator for violating the terms of
an antitrust settlement to give users a choice of Web browsers.
The penalty was the fourth levied on Microsoft by the EU since
it was fined 497 million euros in 2004 for blocking rivals for
server and media programs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. with Bill Gates, will fund a survey of the number of elephants in Africa to help combat poaching that is claiming the life of one of the pachyderms every 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The family trust of Allen, who&#8217;s worth $15.7 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, will fund an $8 million count of the animals in 13 countries using three fixed-wing airplanes and two helicopters, Botswana-based Elephants Without Borders said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the bleakest time for the elephants,&#8221; Allen, 60, said in the statement. &#8220;Statistics on the plight of Africa&#8217;s elephants are daunting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A fifth of Africa&#8217;s elephants may be wiped out over the next decade if poaching continues at its current pace, with about 22,000 killed last year, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, Traffic and the International Union for Conservation of Nature said in a Dec. 2 statement. The animals are poached for their ivory tusks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Estimates of the African elephant population vary between 410,000 and 650,000 and in some countries there haven&#8217;t been surveys for many years, Elephants Without Borders said. They are now found in 35 African nations, down from an initial 46, and in 20 of those they number less than 1,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. food and beverage company Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) is following Microsoft Corp. selling bonds in Europe as borrowing costs fall. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The maker of Oreo cookies is marketing a total of 2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of fixed- and floating-rate notes, according to a person familiar with the matter. The average yield investors demand to hold corporate bonds in euros instead of government debt dropped six basis points this week to 123 basis points, the lowest since June 12, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;American companies are raising funds in the common currency at the fastest pace since 2008, with Microsoft&#8217;s 3.5 billion-euro issue yesterday boosting the total for the year to 44 billion euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Borrowers are speculating the European Central Bank will hold benchmark rates at record lows as a report today showed the region&#8217;s economy slowed in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In Europe we&#8217;re still in an environment of easing from the central bank, whereas everyone is expecting tapering in the U.S. early next year,&#8221; said Nicolo Bocchin, a Milan-based credit portfolio manager at Aletti Gestielle SGR SpA who helps oversee about 3.5 billion euros. &#8220;U.S. companies see that there is demand in Europe so they issue here where there are lower yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average yield gap between investment-grade bonds in dollars and euros widened to 1.3 percentage points this week, near the biggest discount since Sept. 13, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Euro-denominated notes yield an average 2 percent while securities in dollars yield 3.3 percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Three-Part Deal &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mondelez, based in Deerfield, Illinois, last issued bonds in euros in 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It is selling 400 million euros of floating-rate notes due June 2015 that will be priced to yield 50 basis points more than the three-month euro interbank offered rate, according to the person, who asked not to be identified before the transaction is completed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is also marketing 750 million euros of bonds maturing January 2017 to yield 58 basis points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate and 1.25 billion euros of notes due January 2021 at a spread of 93 basis points, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund a bond buyback, Michael Mitchell, a spokesman for Mondelez in Deerfield, said in an e-mail. The company is repurchasing as much as $3.4 billion of notes maturing between 2017 and 2020 in a tender offer expiring on Dec. 17, it said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring corporate bonds against losses was little changed, with the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on 125 investment-grade companies rising 0.8 basis point to 82 basis points at 1:39 p.m. in London.

&lt;p&gt;A London judge said HTC Corp. (2498)
couldn&#8217;t sell its One Mini phone in the U.K. starting Dec. 6
after it was found to have infringed patents owned by Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Judge Richard Arnold also ruled that HTC&#8217;s One phone
contained microchips that breached Nokia&#8217;s patent, he delayed an
injunction against the product so HTC could appeal. Blocking
U.K. sales of the One would cause &#8220;considerable&#8221; damage to
HTC, he said in a ruling today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC One, released globally including the U.K. in March, is
the Taiwanese company&#8217;s flagship handset for 2013 and was lauded
by reviewers for its sleek metallic design. HTC One Mini and HTC
One Max, smaller and larger variants of the device, were
released in the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia is also claiming financial compensation for the
infringement of this patent,&#8221; the Espoo, Finland-based company
said in a statement. HTC has agreed not to import any more of
the products into the U.K. pending the appeal, Nokia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two calls and an e-mail to HTC public relations after
Taiwan office hours weren&#8217;t immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC had argued the microchips found to infringe Nokia
patents were &#8220;a very small component&#8221; and didn&#8217;t justify a
sales ban, Arnold said in the ruling. HTC sold about 750,000
smartphones worth about 221 million pounds ($363 million) in the
U.K. between January and September, according to the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia also sued Apple Inc. (AAPL) over the chip patent and settled
the case in April 2011 after agreeing to grant Apple a license.
In September, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to buy Nokia&#8217;s devices and
services business for 5.44 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are HTC Corporation v. Nokia Corporation, High
Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, HC12A02048
and HC12C02909. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ParkerVision Requests Royalties, Ban on Qualcomm Chip Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ParkerVision Inc. (PRKR) asked a federal judge to order Qualcomm
Inc. (QCOM) to pay as much as 70 cents for each infringing mobile-phone
chip sold in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dec. 2 request follows a $173 million award a jury made
to ParkerVision in October in a patent lawsuit. The federal jury
in Orlando, Florida, rejected ParkerVision&#8217;s argument that the
infringement was intentional. Had the jury found willfulness, it
would have allowed U.S. District Judge Roy Dalton to triple the
award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ParkerVision, which filed the infringement suit in July
2011, also asked for an order barring the sale of the disputed
chips. Qualcomm is seeking to have verdict overturned and
damages reduced.      The case is ParkerVision v. Qualcomm, 11-cv-00719, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida
(Jacksonville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disney Tells Australian Chip Shop to Forget About Frying Nemo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. told a fish-and-chips shop in a suburb of
Adelaide, Australia, to change its name or face a trademark-infringement action, the U.K.&#8217;s Drum magazine reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of Frying Nemo told the magazine that she had
consulted with a graphic design firm and that she thought the
image it used was sufficiently removed from the original -- seen
in Disney&#8217;s 2003 &#8220;Finding Nemo&#8221; film --  to differentiate it
from the studio&#8217;s intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said other businesses use the &#8220;Frying Nemo&#8221; name
without being targeted by Burbank, California-based Disney,
according to Drum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Black Friday&#8217; Registered as &#8216;Cyber Monday&#8217; Trademark Sought &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two shopping days after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday
known, respectively, as &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; and &#8220;Cyber Monday&#8221;
mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Philatelist reported &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; was
first used by the Philadelphia Police Department to describe the
traffic jams that the shopping rush created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cyber Monday&#8221; was created in 2005 by a unit of the
National Retail Federation to describe the surge on online
shopping that occurs the Monday after Thanksgiving, when many
workers order holiday gifts online after they&#8217;ve returned to
their offices following the holiday, according to the
association&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several retailers and providers of advertising services
have either registered or sought to register the terms,
according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Wisconsin brewery registered &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; as a
trademark in December 2012. Lakefront Brewery Inc. of Milwaukee
said in its filing that it began using the mark in November
2012, and that it would use the mark with beer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second application for use of the term with advertising
and marketing services is pending. It was filed in September
2012 by a resident of Cleveland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Signature Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, registered &#8220;A
Month of Black Fridays&#8221; in December 2012. That application
specified it&#8217;s to be used for retail stores selling furniture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)&#8217;s Sears Brands Unit registered
&#8220;Better than Black Friday&#8221; in September 2010 for use with
retail department-store services. Also in retail, DealNews.com
Inc. registered &#8220;dealnews Where every day is Black Friday&#8221; as
a trademark in March 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although San Jose, California-based EBay Inc. (EBAY) filed two
applications in November 2008 to register &#8220;Everyday is Black
Friday on eBay!!&#8221; the company abandoned both in November 2009.
According to patent office data, the applications were
considered abandoned in September 2009, for either failing to
respond to an office inquiry or responding too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one &#8220;Cyber Monday&#8221; trademark. It was
registered in August to a resident of Gilbert, Arizona, who said
in the application that the mark would be used for advertising
services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time Warner Unit Turns Back Screenwriter&#8217;s Infringement Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s Warner Bros. unit successfully
challenged a copyright-infringement lawsuit brought by a
Massachusetts writer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael P. Kenney and his Shamrock Films sued the studio in
federal court in Boston April 30, claiming that its film
&#8220;Ghostman&#8221; infringes the copyright to his &#8220;Ghostman,&#8221;
currently in post-production editing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said Nov. 29 that Kenney was unable to prove
Warner Bros. had access to the script on which his film was
based or that there was a &#8220;substantial similarity&#8221; between the
two works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, Kenney&#8217;s film is based on his
comic-book hero Ghostman, &#8220;a masked thief who seeks to avoid
the FBI by using ghost-like abilities.&#8221; The Warner Bros.
project is based on Roger Hobbs&#8217;s novel &#8220;Ghostman,&#8221; to which
the studio acquired the rights, the court said in its ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements that Kenney claimed are infringed, such as
plots, subplots or themes, aren&#8217;t protectable under U.S.
copyright law, the court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kenney v. Warner Brothers Entertainment Inc.,

&lt;h2&gt;Youku Tudou Wins China Copyright Infringement Suit Against Baidu &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU), the Beijing-based provider of streaming
video, prevailed in a copyright infringement lawsuit against the
Chinese search engine company Baidu Inc. (BIDU), China Radio
International&#8217;s English-language website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu was accused of broadcasting 18 Chinese television
programs to which Youku had exclusive rights, according to CRI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search-engine company was ordered to pay 481,000 yuan
($80,600) by the Haidian District People&#8217;s Court in Beijing, CRI
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ruling comes after infringement accusations made
against Baidu Nov. 13 by the Motion Picture Association of
America, several Chinese online video services and other content
owners, according to CRI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copyright Agency in Australia Says Costs Are Justified &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s Copyright Agency said the A$16.5 million ($15.1
million) in costs levied against the A$121.5 million it
collected in royalties are justifiable, according to the
Australian newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy Grant, who leads the agency, told the Australian that
its fees are cheaper than most other collection agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government departments, schools and universities account
for about 85 percent of the revenue the agency collects,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dairy-Equipment Company Awarded $22.7 Million in Secrets Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Minnesota state court jury awarded a dairy-equipment
company $22.7 million in a trade-secrets case against former
employees, according to a statement from the company&#8217;s counsel,
Gray Plant Mooty PA of Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relco LLC of Willmar, Minnesota, sued the former employees
in May 2011, alleging they took confidential information to
their new jobs at Custom Fabricating  Repair Inc. of
Marshfield, Wisconsin, and violated terms of their employment
agreement with Relco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom Fabricating will be responsible for 90 percent of
the damages award, according to the statement. Custom
Fabricating didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for confirmation of the damages award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Relco LLC v. A. Kent Keller Technologies Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which issued the
first euro-denominated bond in its 38-year history in April, is
favoring the currency in its biggest sale ever, taking advantage
of a widening discount to dollar borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker sold 3.5 billion euros
($4.8 billion) of bonds yesterday to account for more than half
of an $8 billion issue. Corporations are paying 1.13 percentage
points less to borrow in euros than dollars for debt of five to
10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Two years
ago, the relationship was reversed, with euro yields eclipsing
dollar rates by 1.2 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft sold notes in April, the discount was only
0.47 percentage point, and the company&#8217;s debut euro bond
comprised about a quarter of a $2.67 billion issue. The Redmond,
Washington-based company&#8217;s newest offering adds to about 40
billion euros of issuance by American companies in 2013, almost
double the amount sold in 2012, as the European Central Bank
cuts interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a confluence of events between monetary
policy, interest rates and overall demand from investors, and an
improving basis, all of which has made it very attractive to
issue in euros,&#8221; said Jim Glascott, head of global debt capital
markets at Barclays Plc, which helped manage the Microsoft
offering. &#8220;The demand and the attractiveness of euros is
something that&#8217;s definitely going to affect volumes in 2014.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gasoline in Los Angeles strengthened

&lt;p&gt;MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) and Radian
Group Inc. (RDN) jumped in New York trading after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. recommended investors buy the shares, citing the potential
for sales growth amid an improving housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGIC advanced 2.4 percent to $8.29 at 4:03 p.m. after the
stock was called a &#8220;top idea&#8221; by Goldman Sachs. Radian gained
1.1 percent. MGIC has tripled this year and Radian has more than
doubled. Goldman Sachs set a $10 price target for MGIC and said
Radian can reach $17 in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers &#8220;have one of the strongest secular
growth stories among all financials,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts
Eric Beardsley and Rachel Meyers said today in a report. &#8220;Their
pace of credit improvement is underestimated by the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices in 20 cities rose 13.3 percent in the 12 months
through September, the most since 2006, according to the
SP/Case-Shiller index. That helped MGIC and Radian, which cover
losses when homeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup
costs. The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.6 percent annualized
pace in the third quarter, the fastest in more than a year,
Commerce Department figures today showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGIC and Radian raised cash from investors this year to
replenish capital drained when housing crashed. Essent Group
Ltd. (ESNT), a mortgage insurer started after the financial crisis, has
rallied about 30 percent since an initial public offering in
October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bankers are in New York, the
exchange is in London and the aluminum is stored mostly around
Detroit. The buyers of the metal suing over allegations of price
manipulation are scattered across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roughly 25 cases filed in varying combinations against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), their
warehousing businesses and the London Metal Exchange should be
fought in New York, New Orleans or elsewhere, lawyers for the
factions argued before a panel of federal judges today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants are accused of constricting aluminum
supplies to drive up prices in violation of U.S. antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The monopoly allegedly occurred in Detroit,&#8221; said
Christopher Lovell, who filed the first of the lawsuits on Aug.
1 on behalf of Gwinn, Michigan-based aluminum fabricator
Superior Extrusion Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restraint of trade &#8220;emanated&#8221; from Detroit, where
75 percent of the warehoused aluminum in the U.S. is stored,
Lovell told six members of the federal Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation in federal court in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accusing Goldman and LME of tying up 1.5 million tons of
aluminum and then charging above-market rates for its storage,
Superior Extrusion is seeking class status on behalf of buyers
who faced the same situation and unspecified money damages that
would be tripled under federal antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Later Complaints &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later complaints make similar allegations and demands. Most
of the suits were filed in Detroit, four were brought in New
York and others in Boston, New Orleans and Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel consolidates cases to streamline the pretrial
exchange of evidence and taking of depositions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The primary means by which defendants accomplished their
goal was to hoard, stockpile and manipulate the supply of
physical aluminum stored in their warehouses in Detroit,&#8221;
Lovell argued in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs and Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, have each said the
cases are without merit. Both banks are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The center of gravity in the United States, if it&#8217;s
anywhere, is in New York,&#8221; attorney Margaret Zwisler argued
before the panel today on behalf of JPMorgan Chase and the
London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aluminum Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issue here is who made the rules and how were they
made,&#8221; Zwisler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs waived its right to argue before the panel,
from which appellate Judge Marjorie Rendell was absent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detroit is the world&#8217;s second-biggest repository for
aluminum stockpiles monitored by LME, the world&#8217;s largest
industrial metals marketplace. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Metro
International Trade Services LLC has the most LME-approved
warehouses in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delays of as long as 16 months in filling aluminum orders
raised prices for consumer-product makers, according to brewer
MillerCoors LLC, which hasn&#8217;t sued, and flashlight maker Mag
Instrument Inc., which did. Mag, based in Ontario, California,
named Goldman, Metro International and LME as defendants in a
complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrett Wotkyns, Mag&#8217;s attorney, described a &#8220;merry-go-round of metal,&#8221; as warehouse operators shifted inventory from
one site to another to satisfy output requirements without
actually relinquishing control of aluminum stockpiles. Other
lawyers today made similar assertions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Simple &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked by panel member U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro
whether the defendants would dispute that such inventory
movements occurred in Detroit, Zwisler replied, &#8220;it&#8217;s not that
simple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether their truck moved from one warehouse to another
does not mean there&#8217;s something wrong with that,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Samuel Rudman, arguing for case
consolidation in New York, where he sued on behalf of Peterson
Industries Inc., said truck drivers won&#8217;t necessarily be
witnesses in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LME told members last month it was changing its rules to
accelerate withdrawals from depots where waiting times are
exceeding 50 calendar days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the changes, slated to take effect April 1,
warehouses with excessive delays will be required to ship at
least 1,500 metric tons more metal each day than they take in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warehouse Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange also said it would review its warehouse system
every six months and is studying its powers to regulate
warehousing companies&#8217; charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wotkyns, whose client makes the Maglite-brand flashlight,
asked the panel to have the cases heard in Los Angeles, citing
the experience of that court&#8217;s judges and its capacity to handle
the caseload. Phillip Howard, an attorney for Jacksonville,
Florida-based pool deck-enclosure maker Master Screens Inc.,
made similar arguments in support of its preferred venue,
Tallahassee, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel heard about 45 minutes of argument today. It
didn&#8217;t immediately rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust
Litigation, MDL No. 2481, Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $234.7
million of structured notes tied to a proprietary gauge of seven
futures indexes, its largest U.S. offering in at least four
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year securities, issued Nov. 22, yield the gains
and losses of the JPMorgan Enhanced Beta Select Backwardation
Alternative Benchmark Total Return Index, according to a
prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The gauge consists of seven other indexes tied to
prices of commodities futures from gold to lean hogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index rebalances monthly, based on weightings of its
members in the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index, the most popular
commodity benchmark for structured notes this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its level rises and falls with
market prices and its members can change weekly to favor
commodities showing the most &#8220;backwardation,&#8221; where earlier
contracts cost more than later deliveries, according to the
prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A backwardated market is by no means indicative of prices
falling into the future,&#8221; said Stephen Schork, president of the
Schork Group Inc., a consultant to the energy industry in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. &#8220;The fact that prices are lower in the
future isn&#8217;t an indication that demand is going to fall in the
future. It&#8217;s just an indication that demand in the spot market
is very strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index was established Sept. 30, less than two months
before the securities were sold, according to the prospectus.
Since then, it fell 0.4 percent to 101.93 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investor Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank charges 0.85 percent a year in investor fees, so
the index would have to rise from its starting level at least
4.25 percent at maturity for the notes to break even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backwardation can provide investors with a so-called roll
yield from buying the earlier monthly contract and then
collecting the difference as they sell and transfer into the
next, cheaper month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for the bank in New York,
declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA and Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA rallied as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said the chance of steel price increases in the first
quarter of 2014 has risen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred shares of Usiminas gained 7.2 percent to 13.38
reais at 2:43 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the highest level on a closing
basis since March 2012. The steelmaker was the best performer on
the Ibovespa, which added 1.7 percent. CSN, as Cia. Siderurgica
is known, rose 4.8 percent to 12.62 reais, the steepest advance
since Nov. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian steelmakers will probably raise prices at the
beginning of next year as a decline in the currency reduced the
domestic premium over overseas products, Marcelo Aguiar,
Humberto Meireles and Diogo Miura, analysts at Goldman Sachs,
wrote in a note to clients today. The real&#8217;s decline should also
discourage imports, helping to create a &#8220;supportive scenario&#8221;
for a domestic price increase, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais-based Usiminas gets about 80
percent of its revenue from sales in Brazil, according to the
company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings statement. &#8220;Usiminas has the
higher operating leverage to domestic prices,&#8221; the Goldman
Sachs analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in prices will probably &#8220;boost steelmakers&#8217;
results in the first quarter of 2014,&#8221; according to the Goldman
Sachs research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real has weakened 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter,
the worst performance among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, on concern Brazil&#8217;s fiscal deterioration will lead to
a reduced credit rating and speculation the Federal Reserve will
curtail stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is paying $1.5 billion for a minority stake in Dong Energy A/S, will get veto powers enabling it to block strategic decisions, according to a Danish Finance Ministry document. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman will be the only minority owner granted broad veto rights over the government-owned utility, according to the Dec. 3 dated document, which is due to be presented to members of the parliament&#8217;s Finance Committee next week in Copenhagen. Dong will only be allowed to sell new shares or hybrid capital, change senior management or make acquisitions if it gets prior approval from Goldman, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman and Danish pension funds ATP and PFA agreed on Oct. 2 to become owners in Denmark&#8217;s largest utility, which is shoring up its balance sheet after losing money on failed natural gas bets. The ministry is also asking the committee to approve a plan to list Dong before 2021. Should the company seek an initial public offering before 2018, Goldman and ATP would need to approve the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry said the government will retain 56.1 percent to 60 percent of Dong after the sale, valuing the company at at least 42.5 billion kroner ($7.75 billion). The current minority investors, which include local power companies, have the option to acquire new Dong shares for as much as 2.6 billion kroner to avoid diluting their stakes, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will expand the use
of encryption to protect customer information, following reports
that governments are intercepting data traveling between users
and servers or between company data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will also step up its legal efforts to protect
private data and will make its software code more transparent so
customers can reassure themselves Microsoft&#8217;s products don&#8217;t
contain &#8220;back doors&#8221; allowing access to their information, the
Redmond, Washington-based software company said in a post on its
official blog today. The encryption enhancements will be
completed by the end of next year, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are taking steps to ensure governments use legal
process rather than technological brute force to access customer
data,&#8221; Microsoft said. &#8220;Government snooping potentially now
constitutes an &#8216;advanced persistent threat&#8217; alongside
sophisticated malware and cyberattacks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. and Google Inc. have also announced they&#8217;ll
beef up encryption, following reports of spying by the U.S.
National Security Agency. The NSA has tapped fiber-optic cables
abroad to siphon data from Google and Yahoo, circumvented or
cracked encryption, and introduced weaknesses and back doors
into coding, according to reports in the Washington Post, the
New York Times and the U.K.&#8217;s Guardian newspaper based on

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) had a hearing
behind closed doors with a Pennsylvania judge in its bid to keep
secret a draft of a government lawsuit related to its $13
billion settlement with the U.S. as well as the identity of an
employee who cooperated in a federal probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is fighting an Oct. 17 order by Judge Stanton
Wettick in Pittsburgh that it release the document and the
employee&#8217;s name to lawyers for the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Pittsburgh, who say the material may provide a more detailed
account of the U.S. Justice Department probe of JPMorgan that
could be used in their lawsuit against the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;FHLB has not set forth any facts supporting why it needs
the draft DOJ complaint or what admissible evidence it might
glean from the allegations of a complaint,&#8221; Deborah Little, a
lawyer for JPMorgan, said in a court filing. &#8220;FHLB has not
demonstrated any nexus between the DOJ&#8217;s investigation and the
subject matter of this case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the start of a hearing today, Wettick closed the
courtroom to the public. Lawyers on both sides declined to
comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHLB lost $2.3 billion on mortgage-backed securities it
purchased from JPMorgan. The losses aren&#8217;t covered by the record
U.S. settlement resolving allegations that the bank misled
buyers about the soundness and risks of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, is paying the
record settlement to resolve Justice Department probes into the
bank&#8217;s sale of mortgage bonds that officials said helped feed
the financial chaos of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FHLB&#8217;s Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conduct and deals at issue in the settlement are the
same ones at the heart of the FHLB&#8217;s case, David Beehler, an
attorney for the Pittsburgh bank, said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acknowledged the settlement&#8217;s statement of facts
without admitting violations of law, Chief Financial Officer
Marianne Lake said on a Nov. 19 conference call. In the
statement, the official narrative of events leading to the
infractions, the bank acknowledged that from 2005 to 2007 its
subsidiaries securitized subprime and Alt-A mortgages loans and
sold the resulting mortgaged-backed securities to investors
while failing to disclose that the loans didn&#8217;t meet
underwriting standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement doesn&#8217;t refer to specific employees,
documents or events. It also doesn&#8217;t provide any details about
the loan programs or vendors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh bank is suing JPMorgan and credit rating
companies including Moody&#8217;s Investors Service over mortgage-backed securities it bought in 2006 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Draft Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FHLB attorneys persuaded Wettick in October to order
JPMorgan to turn over the draft civil fraud complaint prepared
by U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento, California. The
lawsuit alleged violations of the Financial Institution Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, known as FIRREA, according
to court filings in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law allows the government to sue an individual or
group, rather than charge them with a crime, for fraud that
affects a federally insured financial institution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FHLB agreed to give the bank until Nov. 22 to provide the
document at the request of Justice Department lawyers who said
the agency was close to a settlement, according to court
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord was announced Nov. 19, and three days later
JPMorgan attorneys notified the FHLB that it would seek to block
Wettick&#8217;s order, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fraudulent Conduct&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given JPMorgan&#8217;s apparent deep desire to prevent it from
ever seeing the light of day, it would not be at all surprising
if the draft complaint is a much more detailed account of
JPMorgan&#8217;s fraudulent conduct, and as such, far more
enlightening than the statement of facts,&#8221; according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the draft complaint was provided to it by the
Justice Department as a &#8220;confidential settlement
communication&#8221; and it agreed to use it solely for the purpose
of settlement negotiations, according to a court filing.
Allowing the document to be turned over to the FHLB would
violate state and federal law and &#8220;chill the use of such
materials in future settlement negotiations,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moody&#8217;s Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its case against Moody&#8217;s, the Pittsburgh bank is seeking
to question Jerome Fons, a former executive of the ratings
company who criticized credit graders to U.S. lawmakers in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the FHLB have asked Wettick to allow them to
question Fons on his testimony in a case against Morgan Stanley (MS)
and other banks in federal court in Manhattan. That testimony,
under seal after the case was voluntarily dismissed, was given
to plaintiff lawyers in Pittsburgh. Moody&#8217;s argued in court
papers filed Nov. 20 that a deposition of Fons would &#8220;provide
no evidence relevant to this action and will only place undue
burden on Moody&#8217;s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fons &#8220;has no firsthand knowledge of any Moody&#8217;s structured
finance analyst ever allowing market share pressure to impact a
particular rating,&#8221; lawyers for Moody&#8217;s said, citing sections
of the sealed testimony transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House Committee &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fons told the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee in October 2008 that originators of structured
securities typically chose the agency with the lowest standards,
&#8220;engendering a race to the bottom in terms of rating quality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs allege Moody&#8217;s and other rating companies
assigned the highest possible ratings to mortgage-loan pools so
they could be sold to institutional investors all the while
knowing the certificates were actually junk bonds, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fons, formerly a Moody&#8217;s managing director for credit, left
the firm in August 2007. Until his departure, he helped set
criteria for how the firm rated the debt of corporations,
financial institutions and countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The truth is that the rating agencies did not have
sufficient and reliable information to place a triple-A rating
on the securities,&#8221; the Pittsburgh bank said in court papers.
&#8220;The rating agencies and other defendants knew they were
feeding false information into their predictive models and that
those models could not predict the losses on the loans in the
mortgage pools.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh v. J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, GD09-016892, Court of Common Pleas of
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond investors are signaling they
want Chilean billionaire Alvaro Saieh to sell his bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corpbanca&#8217;s $800 million of notes due 2018 have returned
1.9 percent since the Saieh-controlled bank said Nov. 29 that it
was in preliminary talks with potential bidders. The gain is
bigger than that of any other high-grade bond in emerging
markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saieh, 64, is entertaining offers from Sao Paulo-based Itau
Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) and Bilbao, Spain-based Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA) as he looks for cash to plow into his retailer SMU
SA after it violated debt agreements and restated earnings.
Colombia-born Saieh, who has a doctorate in economics from the
University of Chicago, has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Bank of America Corp. to sell a controlling stake in Corpbanca,
two people familiar with the matter said Nov. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being taken in by a bigger, more diverse bank is
positive,&#8221; Aaron Grehan, who helps manage $4.5 billion of
emerging-market debt at Aviva Investors Ltd., said in telephone
interview from London. &#8220;It&#8217;s a credit-improvement story. The
headlines last week caused a change in sentiment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Corpbanca&#8217;s
benchmark notes instead of U.S. Treasuries fell to a five-month
low of 3.13 percentage points yesterday after reaching a record
high of 501 basis points on Aug. 29. The peso gained 0.2 percent
to 528.7 per dollar at 7:35 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corpbanca declined to comment on its merger talks,
according to an external press official who asked not to be
named. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BBVA, Itau &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau, Latin America&#8217;s biggest lender by market
capitalization, is one of the banks Corpbanca has approached,
said one of the two people, who asked not to be named because
the negotiations are private. Corpbanca, based in Santiago, has
a market value of $4.22 billion. Saieh and his family directly
and indirectly own 76 percent of the bank, according to its most
recent annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau declined to comment, according to an official who
asked not to be named in keeping with company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Tobin, a spokesman for BBVA in Madrid, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corpbanca&#8217;s BBB rating from Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the second-lowest investment grade, is in line with Itau&#8217;s and one level
above that of BBVA. Itau has subordinated bonds in dollars due
in 2020 that yield 349 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries.
BBVA&#8217;s subordinated bonds in dollars due in 2022 yield 336 basis
points more than Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation that Itau or BBVA may buy Saieh&#8217;s Corpbanca
hasn&#8217;t helped SMU&#8217;s bonds. The yield on the bonds rose to 18.58
percent yesterday from 18.4 on Nov. 29. It reached 21 percent on
Oct. 30, up from 6.16 percent in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Severe Issues&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saieh has been selling off assets and has pumped $300
million into SMU in an attempt to help bring the grocery chain
into compliance with rules on its bonds that demand lower debt
ratios. At the end of September, Corpbanca had made more than
$400 million of loans and other credits tied to sister companies
owned by Saieh, and the bank accounted for as much as 90 percent
of his conglomerate&#8217;s profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMU &#8220;has had severe issues with working capital and
consuming all its cash,&#8221; said Soummo Mukherjee, an analyst at
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service who this week cut the company to Caa1,
seven levels below investment grade. &#8220;Any hiccup in liquidity
would lead to an immediate downgrade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Smart Guys&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saieh, a former head of research at the central bank,
started his career in banking when he accepted an equity stake
to join the management of Carlos Abumohor&#8217;s Banco de Osorno y La
Union. Saieh and Abumohor sold 51 percent of Banco Osorno to
Spain&#8217;s Banco Santander SA (SAN) in 1996 and used the profit to build
Corpbanca. In the past 24 months, Saieh has spent $2.5 billion
buying the Colombian operations of Banco Santander and Helm Bank
to expand Corpbanca&#8217;s regional presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal told analysts
on an earning conference call on Nov. 12 that Chile is a
priority market and that the bank is considering acquisitions in
Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Itau has said it wants to be a Latin American bank, but
it&#8217;s hard to grow organically so it needs to buy,&#8221; Anibal Valdes, an analyst at Barclays Plc in New York, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;These are smart guys and they&#8217;re not
going to pay just any price but it would make sense to be the
third-largest private bank in Chile. The banking business is all
about scale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after the rally, Corpbanca&#8217;s bonds still offer a
premium to peers. The 4.17 percent yield on its notes compares
with an average of 3.45 percent for investment-grade banks in
Latin America, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It trades at a higher spread than the rest of the banks
so the rationale behind the move makes sense,&#8221; Jaime Achondo,
head trader at Finanzas y Negocios SA Corredores de Bolsa in
Santiago, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s digital crime unit
has teamed up with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and
its European counterpart to fight software that infected more
than 2 million computers to steal revenue from online
advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#8217;re working to track down computers that have been
taken over with the malicious software known as ZeroAccess or
Sirefef, and get rid of the malware, Microsoft said in a
statement. While the effort won&#8217;t eliminate the threat, it
should significantly reduce the fraud, which has cost online
advertisers an estimated $2.7 million a month, the Redmond,
Washington-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;botnet,&#8221; a group of connected programs, is used to
redirect queries in search engines owned by companies such as
Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft, to certain sites to
steal money generated by ad clicks. It also creates automated
Web traffic that simulates users&#8217; clicks on ads, for which
advertisers pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Due to its botnet architecture, ZeroAccess is one of the
most robust and durable botnets in operation today and was built
to be resilient to disruption efforts,&#8221; Microsoft said in the
statement. The malware relies &#8220;on a peer-to-peer infrastructure
that allows cybercriminals to remotely control the botnet from
tens of thousands of different computers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft filed a civil suit against those operating ZeroAccess last week and got authorization from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas to block communications between computers that had been identified as being used to commit the schemes. Microsoft also took control of 49 web domains thought to be affiliated with ZeroAccess. Close

&lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda&#8217;s payslip is 38 percent less than his predecessor&#8217;s 15
years ago, underscoring Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s warning that
wages must rise for Abenomics to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank chief&#8217;s pay is about 24 million yen
($235,000) for the year ending March 31, down from an inflation-adjusted 39 million yen in fiscal 1998, based on a BOJ statement
on Nov. 29. Swaps signal an average inflation rate of 1.2
percent over the coming five years, compared with 2.03 percent
in the U.S. and 1.38 percent in the euro zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s cost of living rose in October by the most in five
years even as salaries extended declines from June 2012,
threatening to derail Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#8217;s efforts to
sustain a recovery in the world&#8217;s third-largest economy.
Goldman&#8217;s chief Japan strategist Kathy Matsui on Dec. 4 called
for higher wages, while Kuroda told regional business leaders
this week that he expects an increase in basic pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unless wages gain in Japan, higher prices will reduce
purchasing power, hurting consumer spending and risking a
slowdown in the economy,&#8221; said Akio Kato, the team leader of
Japanese debt in Tokyo at Kokusai Asset Management Co., which
manages the equivalent of $38 billion. &#8220;It would be meaningful
for the BOJ to take the initiative by hiking the governor&#8217;s
pay,&#8221; which is &#8220;rather low,&#8221; Kato said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bernanke&#8217;s Paycheck &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is set to receive
$199,700 this year, while European Central Bank President Mario
Draghi pulled in 374,124 euros ($511,200) last year. Bank of
England Governor Mark Carney earns a basic salary of 480,000
pounds ($784,000). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuroda would need 25 years of his current salary to be able
to afford a 10-year-old condominium with three bedrooms in
central Tokyo that was priced at the equivalent of $5.8 million,
according to a listing on Nomura Real Estate Holdings Inc.&#8217;s
website. A similar-sized home in the city&#8217;s eastern suburbs 30
minutes by train from downtown sells for about $672,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 0.9 percent in
October from a year earlier, government data showed. BOJ policy
makers forecast the price growth, stripped of the effects of tax
increases planned starting April, will quicken to 1.3 percent
next fiscal year and to 1.9 percent in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modest pay gains are expected considering the recovery in
the labor market, but we can&#8217;t anticipate a wage rise that&#8217;s
fast enough for the BOJ to achieve its 2 percent price goal,&#8221;
said Toru Suehiro, a market economist in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co. &#8220;Once it gets clear that the upward price path
foreseen by the BOJ is unlikely to happen, it will provide a
catalyst for nominal yields to decline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s benchmark 10-year note yield rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.67 percent today, after
earlier touching 0.68 percent, the highest since Oct. 1. It
reached a record low of 0.315 percent on April 5, the day after
Kuroda and his board doubled monthly bond purchases to stoke 2
percent inflation in two years. The yen has fallen 15 percent
this year to 102.10 per dollar as of 3:33 p.m. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank cut the governor&#8217;s salary last year by 30
percent as a temporary measure to reduce costs while the nation
rebuilt after the March 2011 earthquake. The decrease wasn&#8217;t
reversed this year with the pay kept at the same level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Salaries for the Bank of Japan&#8217;s officers are determined
in consideration of the remuneration and other circumstances of
national public officers, as stipulated by the BOJ Act,&#8221;
Yasutaka Hirata, a central bank spokesman, said without
elaborating further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tax Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s public debt has ballooned to more than 1
quadrillion yen and is expected by the International Monetary
Fund to grow to the equivalent of 244 percent of gross domestic
product this year, the highest ratio globally. Abe approved
raising Japan&#8217;s consumption tax to 8 percent from 5 percent in
April 2014 and will decide whether to increase it to 10 percent
the following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Considering Japan&#8217;s finances, the sales tax may have to
go higher even after being hiked to 10 percent,&#8221; said Maiko Noguchi, a former BOJ official and a Tokyo-based senior
economist at Daiwa Securities Co., Japan&#8217;s second-biggest
brokerage. &#8220;It will be a problem if the economy experiences a
sharp fall every time the sales tax is raised and voters cry out
in displeasure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have the cash to increase wages if they choose.
Domestic non-financial private companies held 220 trillion yen
in cash and bank deposits at the end of June, almost the size of
Brazil&#8217;s annual GDP, the latest data from the BOJ show. The
amount reached 224 trillion yen in March, the most on record
dating back to 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intensifying Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There won&#8217;t be many companies that increase base salaries
unless they can expect sustained earnings growth,&#8221; said Daiwa&#8217;s
Noguchi. &#8220;Modifying existing products doesn&#8217;t create large
demand. Instead, intensifying competition cuts companies&#8217; profit
margins, and this can&#8217;t be easily changed by Abenomics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese Trade Union Confederation, or Rengo, plans to
demand pay increases of more than 1 percent during labor talks
in spring, according to a statement released in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Household consumption accounted for 58 percent of Japan&#8217;s
real GDP last year, according to Cabinet Office data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government needs to fuel domestic consumption to
boost GDP, and the only way is to raise wages,&#8221; said Satoshi Okagawa, a senior global-markets analyst in Singapore at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., a unit of Japan&#8217;s second-biggest
financial group by market value. &#8220;Policy makers want to convert
companies&#8217; accumulated earnings into consumer spending, but
businesses won&#8217;t listen to their plea. That&#8217;s why Kuroda is
suffering.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rubicon Project Inc., an online-advertising company that reaches more U.S. Web users than Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s ad network, picked Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to lead its initial public offering, according to people
with knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubicon, based in Los Angeles, is aiming for a market debut
next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information hasn&#8217;t been disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many newly public ad-technology companies have seen
their share prices plunge, Rocket Fuel Inc.&#8217;s (FUEL) successful
offering in September and the rally that followed Twitter Inc. (TWTR)&#8217;s
IPO last month have instilled a renewed level of confidence.
TubeMogul Inc., a maker of software for digital marketing, is
also planning an IPO for next year, people with knowledge of the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Billingsley, a spokesman for Rubicon, declined to
comment. Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman at Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment on their banks&#8217; roles in the Rubicon IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubicon, whose technology automates the buying and selling
of online promotions for marketers and publishers, topped $100
million in revenue three years ago and is profitable. Its
network reached 96 percent of U.S. Internet users in October,
compared with 95 percent for Google, according to ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2007 by Frank Addante, Rubicon has raised at
least $60 million from investors including Clearstone Venture
Partners and Mayfield Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public Debut &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocket Fuel, a provider of technology to manage, run and
evaluate online-ad campaigns, has jumped 68 percent since its
IPO in September. Ad-tech companies that went public earlier
this year have dropped, including video-ad network YuMe Inc. (YUME),
which has declined 11 percent since debuting in August, and
rival Tremor Video Inc., which has plunged 57 percent since its
June IPO. Marin Software Inc. has fallen 30 percent since its
March IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addante told Bloomberg News in August that he was holding
off on an IPO until Rubicon&#8217;s numbers could impress Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors in general appreciate companies that are at
scale, profitable, have high growth rates and are technology
companies,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Greg Stohr" date="Dec 09, 2013  7:19 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-09/pfizer-rejected-by-top-court-on-neurontin-marketing-suits.html"><headline>Pfizer Rejected by Top Court on Neurontin Marketing Suits</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
$142 million award against Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and let two similar suits
go forward with claims that the drugmaker defrauded insurers by
illegally marketing its Neurontin epilepsy drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices without comment today rejected Pfizer&#8217;s
appeal, letting stand three connected federal appeals court
decisions. The cases are part of the fallout from a 2004 guilty
plea by Pfizer&#8217;s Warner-Lambert unit to charges that it promoted
Neurontin for unapproved &#8220;off-label&#8217;&#8221; uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rebuff means a nationwide class-action suit can
proceed, seeking damages on behalf of insurers, union funds and
employers who paid for ineffective dosages of Neurontin. Pfizer
must also defend against a suit by Aetna Inc. (AET), which says it
paid for more than a million off-label Neurontin prescriptions.
In addition, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker lost its challenge to
a $142 million jury award won by the Kaiser Foundation&#8217;s health
plan and hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer &#8220;strategically conducted a decade-long,
multifaceted fraud to make Neurontin a blockbuster drug,&#8221;
Kaiser argued in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a statement that it &#8220;has strong defenses on
the merits in the cases that will now proceed in the lower
court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unapproved Uses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Supreme Court, Pfizer argued that the Boston-based
appeals court improperly relaxed the standards for winning a
case under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, known as RICO. Pfizer said the appeals court
should have required proof that the company&#8217;s marketing affected
the prescriptions issued by individual doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court instead said the insurers could rely on
aggregate data showing a link between Pfizer&#8217;s promotional
spending for unapproved uses and the number of off-label
prescriptions written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court decisions &#8220;invite an unlimited
escalation in RICO and related cases against pharmaceutical
companies for off-label promotion using the shortcut of
aggregate proof,&#8221; the New York-based company argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suing insurers say Pfizer pitched Neurontin as a
treatment for bipolar disorders, neuropathic pain and migraines,
while suppressing or misrepresenting clinical studies that
showed the drug wasn&#8217;t effective for those treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Snake Oil&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurers point to an internal e-mail describing
Neurontin as &#8220;the &#8216;snake oil&#8217; of the twentieth century.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conduct occurred before Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert
in 2000. In its 2004 plea agreement, Warner-Lambert admitted it
promoted Neurontin for off-label uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal law bars drugmakers from promoting uses that
haven&#8217;t received Food and Drug Administration approval, though
doctors are free to prescribe medicines for off-label purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner-Lambert&#8217;s marketing increased off-label sales from
15 percent of all Neurontin prescriptions in 1994, its first
year on the market, to 94 percent of Pfizer&#8217;s Neurontin sales in
2002, according to federal government court filings. The drug&#8217;s
sales hit $2.3 billion in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aetna and class action cases can now go forward in a

&lt;p&gt;Tomkins Ltd., a London-based
producer of auto parts and industrial products, is working with
banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a sale or initial
public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Tomkins could fetch at least $6 billion, said
two of the people, who asked not to be named because the process
is private. Goldman Sachs will help Tomkins find a buyer
starting in February, or lead the IPO if the company decides to
go public, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomkins is more likely to go with an IPO, one of the people
said, because of its size and a relative dearth of competitors
in its industry. Toronto-based private-equity firm Onex Corp.
and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought Tomkins in
2010 for $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. would have
prominent underwriting roles on an initial share sale, according
to the people familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse Group AG
and Deutsche Bank AG would also be involved in underwriting an
IPO, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment. A spokeswoman
for CPP also declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Onex
didn&#8217;t respond to a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gates, Aquatic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomkins owns Gates Corp., a provider of power transmissions
and fluid-transfer products, and Aquatic, a producer of acrylic
bathtubs and showers, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates is the larger of the two companies with $2.9 billion
in annual sales in 2012 and $551 million in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the website
shows. Aquatic had $114.5 million in sales and had negative
Ebitda of $6.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters previously reported that Tomkins was interviewing
advisers to help in a potential sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) may quickly enlarge
its Shanghai resort after it opens in late 2015 in order to meet
rising demand in the world&#8217;s most populous country, Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Disney Resort will be almost 1,000 acres (404.7
hectares) in size when it opens, putting it third behind Walt
Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and Disneyland Paris among the
company&#8217;s resorts, Rasulo said at the UBS Global Media and
Communications Conference in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re opening the park for a pretty healthy number of
attendees but more importantly both we and our partners and the
Shanghai government are eager and willing to expand rapidly
after that,&#8221; Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance could ultimately top the company&#8217;s second-most
popular property, Tokyo Disney Resort, which has 28 million
annual visitors, Rasulo said, reiterating remarks he made in
September. Disney, the world&#8217;s largest theme park operator, is
building a 29 billion-yuan ($4.78 billion) resort in Shanghai
that will include two hotels and an outdoor recreational area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burbank, California-based company owns 43 percent of
the venture with the state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group Co., a
consortium of three businesses, holding the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resort is part of a larger focus by Disney on China,
where entertainment spending by consumers has lagged the growth
of the middle class, Rasulo said. The new park is within a
three-hour drive of 330 million people, many of them young
families, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Attractions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney in the past four years invested in new attractions
at its Hong Kong resort, where business is now &#8220;growing in
leaps and bounds,&#8221; Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said last month that its capital expenditures
in its current 2014 fiscal year may be about $1 billion higher
than 2013 due to the investment in the Shanghai park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Disney announced its first corporate sponsor of
the new park. Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. will
feature its brand in the Garden of the Twelve Friends, part of
an 11-acre compound at the center of the park where each animal
of the Chinese Zodiac will be represented by a Disney or Pixar
character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe we&#8217;re developing a park that will absolutely
blow people away,&#8221; Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney rose 0.6 percent to $71.57 at the close in
New York yesterday. The stock has gained 44 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity National Financial Inc. (FNF),
the title insurer that also has restaurant businesses and an
auto-parts company, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to review
possible divestitures of assets as the firm narrows its focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer will consider spinoffs and sales of portfolio
company investments, Jacksonville, Florida-based Fidelity
National said today in a statement. The company holds stakes in
vehicle-component maker Remy International Inc. (REMY), human-resources
firm Ceridian Corp. and American Blue Ribbon Holdings LLC, the
operator of restaurants including O&#8217;Charley&#8217;s, Max  Erma&#8217;s,
Village Inn and Bakers Square. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman William Foley is increasing his focus on the
housing market after agreeing in May to buy Lender Processing
Services Inc. (LPS), a former unit, for about $2.9 billion. The deal,
which hasn&#8217;t yet been completed, will help Foley expand in the
business of providing and analyzing mortgage data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our energies are focused on the pending acquisition,&#8221;
Foley said in the statement. &#8220;Portfolio company investments
have significant value which may not be fully reflected in our
stock price&#160;and we believe there are attractive alternatives we
can pursue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fidelity National, the largest U.S. title insurer, advanced
2.7 percent to $30.34 at the close in New York. The company
gained 25 percent this year through yesterday, trailing the 28
percent rally in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s Midcap 400 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Roundtable lobbyists wanted
2013 to be the year lawmakers, free of immediate election
pressures, would revamp U.S. immigration policy, pass a debt-lowering budget and expedite a pair of trade deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Congress is on pace to have its least productive
year ever, with just 56 pieces of legislation signed into law so
far. The former record low, reached in 1995, was 88 new laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The major issues that we think are necessary to jump-start the American economy continue to languish,&#8221; said Bill Miller, top lobbyist for a group that represents chief
executives of companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the business agenda lagged, Congress this year completed
work on measures such as one that speeds disabled veterans
through airport security and another that converts some federal
land in Wyoming into a local shooting range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigger-ticket items -- expanding skilled-worker visas
sought by technology companies, restoring defense spending for
weapons systems and lowering tax rates -- didn&#8217;t come to a vote
in both chambers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are many. Partisan rancor grew deeper as a
result of the October government shutdown. Elected officials in
both parties fretted about primaries for party loyalists who
would accuse them of abandoning their principles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time Off &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, Congress has taken plenty of time off this year. The
House has been out 191 days, and the Senate 199 days. And
leaders gobbled up much of the agenda with debate on measures
the other chamber had no plans to consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic-led Senate passed measures boosting the
nation&#8217;s $7.25 hourly minimum wage and prohibiting employers
from firing or refusing to hire workers because of their sexual
orientation, measures that went nowhere in the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Republican-led House voted 46 times this
year to repeal the 2010 health-care law, measures the Senate has
no plans to consider. Republicans&#8217; insistence on curtailing
Obamacare led to the 16-day government shutdown in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With weightier decisions pushed into 2014, many lobbyists
say they doubt lawmakers can overcome partisan divisions before
midterm elections where Republicans seek to retake control of
the Senate and Democrats try to cut into the 232-seat Republican
House majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the immigration, trade, deficit-reduction and other
matters must compete for time against a possible revision of the
U.S. tax code and a multiyear highway bill that faces opposition
from lawmakers backed by anti-tax Tea Party movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Immigration Measure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Congress will complete a revamp of immigration
policy is very much in doubt, said Carl Guardino, president and
CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. While the Senate
passed a comprehensive immigration measure in June that included
skilled-worker work visas benefiting technology companies, the
House took no action this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By delaying a solution and taking this into an election
year, they&#8217;ve turned Mount Whitney into Mount Everest,&#8221; said
Guardino, whose San Jose, California group&#8217;s members include
Intel Corp. (INTC) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) California&#8217;s Whitney is the largest
mountain in the contiguous 48 American states, yet less than
half as tall as Everest, the world&#8217;s largest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split-party gridlock that began after Republicans took
control of the House in 2011 is creating uncertainty in the U.S.
economy and for businesses, said Ed Yardeni, president and chief
investment strategist at Yardeni Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Positive&#8217; Gridlock &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a time not long ago that gridlock was seen as a
positive for the economy and for industry,&#8221; Yardeni said.
&#8220;Gridlock was a sign of success in our political system,
because it showed the system was in balance. But now the
factions are so far apart and their differences so
irreconcilable that it&#8217;s creating problems for the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years of standoffs over the budget and the U.S.
deficit, negotiators are now eying only a limited plan to ease
some of the automatic cuts next year. That deal wouldn&#8217;t end
uncertainty for holders of U.S. debt and for businesses, Yardeni
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense contractors receive signals about what weapons
systems the government might buy from the separate annual
defense authorization and defense appropriations measures, said
Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association,
which includes Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD)
as members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defense Authorization &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Senate and House negotiators yesterday reached
agreement on a compromise Pentagon authorization bill that could
pass by year&#8217;s end, defense firms still lack the kind of
lawmaker consensus they need on specific expenditures in an
appropriations bill, Stohr said. They also can&#8217;t be assured
Congress will agree on new deficit-cutting targets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are serious doubts about whether it could pass both
houses,&#8221; Stohr said of a budget plan that would curtail some of
the defense-spending reductions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randy Belote, a spokesman for General Dynamics, says the
automatic cuts prevent the Falls Church, Virginia-based weapons
manufacturer from making decisions about staffing levels for
specific programs, and the cuts will worsen matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we began to see the impact in 2013, 2014 has all
the earmarks of being horrible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re imploring
Congress to adopt a stable budget that we can work towards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other executives bemoan delays in advancing the biggest
tax-code changes since 1986. Fred Smith, chief executive officer
of FedEx Corp. (FDX), says putting off a revamp off misses
opportunities to help job creation and spur the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not Spending&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not spending enough for equipment and software,
and that&#8217;s why we can&#8217;t create the jobs,&#8221; Smith said Nov. 15 on
CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lobbyists say they see at least some chance to push
legislation next year, particularly limited measures that could
help cut red tape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House in September passed legislation that streamlines
the permitting and environmental reviews for mining projects,
and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are working on a version. Nancy Gravatt, a senior vice president at the National Mining
Association, said that raises the prospects of changing the
regulations next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s probably the bright spot,&#8221; Gravatt said. &#8220;The
actual movement of legislation that benefits mining and minerals
has really been limited.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks&#8217; Priorities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small banks haven&#8217;t given up on action in 2014 on measures
important to them, including changes to housing finance policy,
said Paul Merski, the top lobbyist and chief economist for the
Independent Community Bankers of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, independent banks are focusing on more
than 20 regulatory modifications that would help the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because of midterms, many members are going to want to go
home and campaign on accomplishments,&#8221; Merski said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard
to campaign on gridlock. I think there will be some willingness
early on to form some comprises and alliances and get some
things over the finish line and to the president.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 2013 is shaping up to be a year that will be
remembered for roadblocks and delays in Congress, punctuated by
occasional half-steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scores of measures were put off, including a
reauthorization of the Amtrak passenger rail system, and not a
single annual appropriations bill was completed. If the annual
defense authorization bill isn&#8217;t acted on this year, it will be
the first time ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farm Bill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, negotiators on a farm bill that benefits
processors including Archer-Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) pushed their
work into early next year after failing to reach an agreement on
food-stamp cuts. And Congress probably won&#8217;t agree by year&#8217;s end
to extend tax breaks that expire Dec. 31, affecting wind turbine
makers, motorsports track owners, filmmakers and mass-transit
commuters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Obama&#8217;s approval ratings are near record lows, the
public&#8217;s view of Congress is at rock bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nov. 7-10 Gallup Poll found that Americans&#8217; approval of
the way Congress is handling its job dropped to 9 percent, the
lowest in the polling firm&#8217;s 39-year history of asking the
question. The poll of 1,039 U.S. adults had a margin of error of
plus or minus 4 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s cloud-services
chief, Satya Nadella, said he plans to stay at the software
company regardless of who replaces Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is an exciting place to be at now. It&#8217;s an
amazing spot to be in,&#8221; Nadella said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV in Paris today, where he&#8217;s attending Le Web
Internet conference. Asked whether he will stay at Microsoft for
the long-haul, Nadella said: &#8220;absolutely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive declined to comment on his status as a
potential successor to Ballmer. Nadella is on a list of more
likely candidates at the Redmond, Washington-based company,
people familiar with the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is aiming for a quick replacement for Ballmer,
who said in August that he will retire within the next 12
months. Microsoft has seen its software leadership decline amid
a shrinking of the personal-computer market, which was its core
business. Microsoft is shifting its strategy to focus more on
hardware and Internet-based services and away from its software
roots as it competes with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for a new CEO hasn&#8217;t affected day-to-day
business, Nadella said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Re-engineer Ourselves&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not like there wasn&#8217;t any change we had to navigate
over the past 30 years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we didn&#8217;t know how to do
it, we wouldn&#8217;t be here. We&#8217;ve shown our ability to re-engineer
ourselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of that push is to compete with Amazon.com Inc. on
selling cloud-computing services to companies. The executive
said he met with customers in France this week to talk about
moving faster to cloud services that can be accessed at a
distance. He said clients are &#8220;excited,&#8221; though they&#8217;re
increasingly worried about data-privacy issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customers were asking before -- they&#8217;re asking more
now,&#8221; Nadella said about data privacy. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually working
to our advantage because we have the flexibility to tailor to
our customers&#8217; needs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday joined technology companies including
Apple and Google to call on the U.S. government to lead reform
of surveillance practices after revelations the National
Security Agency gained access to private networks to conduct
spying. Other signatories of the statement, addressed to
President Barack Obama and members of Congress, are AOL Inc.,
Facebook Inc. (FB), LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD), Twitter Inc. (TWTR) and Yahoo! Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encrypting data and storing them on equipment based in
specific countries or regions are among the proposed solutions,
Nadella said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft slipped less than 1 percent to $38.48 at 10:09
a.m. in New York. The stock gained 45 percent this year through
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) plans to spend $39.8
billion on capital projects next year amid rising labor costs,
increased drilling expenditures and currency fluctuations from
Canada to Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for floating platforms, oil-refinery repairs,
pipelines and rig rentals is 5.2 percent less than Chevron&#8217;s
2013 estimated outlay of $42 billion, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a statement today. The cost estimate for
the Gorgon natural gas export complex in Australia rose to $54
billion, the second increase in 13 months. Weather and
logistical delays will postpone startup of the project off the
northwest coast by about three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson is
counting on deep-water oil discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and
gas exports from the Indian and Pacific oceans to boost output
20 percent by the end of 2017. Chevron aspires to become the
world&#8217;s third-largest producer of liquefied natural gas, or LNG,
after Qatar and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, by the end of the decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s full-year 2013 capital spending exceeded the
original $36.7 billion forecast because of acquisitions that
required additional spending, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron may sell some oil and gas fields that promise
leaner returns than the new prospects, Chief Financial Officer
Pat Yarrington told analysts and investors during a Nov. 1
conference call. Yarrington didn&#8217;t specify what the company
might be considering exiting, nor did she provide a time frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said Nov. 22 its 240 million-barrel Rosebank field
off the Scottish coast currently doesn&#8217;t make economic sense to
develop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is the largest energy company by market
value, followed by PetroChina Co. (857), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoppers are loading up on Internet
coupons heading into the holidays -- and investors will soon get
their chance to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebates Shopping.com Inc., which offers online coupons and
discounts to consumers, picked JPMorgan Chase  Co. to lead its
initial public offering next year with help from Bank of America
Corp., according to people with knowledge of the deal, who asked
not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online shopping jumped about 20 percent to a record on
Cyber Monday last week, as consumers surfed the Web for post-Thanksgiving deals in lieu of hitting physical stores. More than
100 million adults in the U.S. will use digital coupons next
year, up from 96.6 million in 2013, according to researcher
EMarketer Inc. That spurred online couponer RetailMeNot Inc. to
go public earlier this year and is generating growth at Ebates
and rival Coupons.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising and consumer-related companies are lining up to
go public after Twitter Inc. (TWTR)&#8217;s offering last month and the rally
that followed. TubeMogul Inc., a maker of software for digital
marketing, and The Rubicon Project Inc., an online ad company,
have picked banks for IPOs, as has Internet-dating site Zoosk
Inc., people familiar with the companies have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebates was founded in 1998. The San Francisco-based company
offers discounts to more than 1,600 online stores, including
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Macy&#8217;s Inc. and Home Depot Inc. Members get
paid back a percentage of every purchase they make each quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Ebates, JPMorgan and Bank of America
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebates is backed by investors including August Capital,
Canaan Partners and Foundation Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RetailMeNot, based in Austin, Texas, has climbed 28 percent
since its IPO in July and is valued at about $1.36 billion. The
company and its shareholders filed earlier this week to sell an
additional 6.27 million shares. &lt;/p&gt;

pace with Sony Corp.&#8217;s PlayStation 4 during the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony said on Dec. 3 that it had sold 2.1 million of its
machines since they went on sale Nov. 15 in North America.
Microsoft, which introduced Xbox One on Nov. 22 in 13 countries,
is selling pretty much every console it can get into stores and
has &#8220;aggressive&#8221; plans to restock, said David Dennis, a
spokesman for Xbox, in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales of both platforms are basically on par with each
other,&#8221; said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird 
Co. in San Francisco. &#8220;Production seems to be roughly the same
for both platforms and they&#8217;re both doing well at retail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Sony are trying to attract gamers against a
backdrop of declining console sales. From 2008 to 2012, the
market shrank 32 percent to $13.3 billion, according to
researcher NPD Group Inc. Both the $499 Xbox One and the $399
PlayStation 4 have more powerful graphics and entertainment
applications than older models. To distinguish its machine,
Microsoft has been pitching its motion-sensing camera, the
ability to control live television and exclusive games like
&#8220;Ryse: Son of Rome&#8221; and &#8220;Dead Rising 3.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re at 2 million at 18 days, and they were at about 2
million at 18 days, so we are running neck and neck,&#8221; Dennis
said. He declined to provide a forecast for future sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;November Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects PlayStation 4 sales to top Xbox One when
NPD releases its November sales data for the U.S. tomorrow,
Dennis said. He attributed the lead to Sony&#8217;s extra days on sale
in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After replenishing initial inventories, Sony and Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft each may sell about 3 million
consoles worldwide by the end of the year, according to
projections by Sebastian as well as Michael Olson, an analyst at
Piper Jaffray Cos. in Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Tretton, president and chief executive officer of
Sony&#8217;s U.S. computer entertainment division, said Nov. 11 that
the Tokyo-based company is confident it can meet analysts&#8217; sales
estimates of 3 million units by year-end, and its own target of
5 million units by March. Sony expanded sales of the PlayStation
4 on Nov. 29, and it was available in 32 countries as of Dec. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both consoles sold more than 1 million units in their first
24 hours in stores. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s government must create space
for the central bank to cut the key interest rate and revive
economic growth, according to Yashwant Sinha, a former finance
minister with the main opposition party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India cannot reduce the benchmark
repurchase rate until the government improves the supply chain
to reduce the cost of food, Sinha, finance minister from 1998 to
2002 under Bharatiya Janata Party-led governments, said in a
Dec. 10 interview. India&#8217;s consumer-price inflation rose to 10.1
percent in October, the second-highest in a basket of 17 Asia-Pacific economies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once you tackle inflation, you will create the necessary
room for the RBI to maneuver,&#8221; Sinha, 76, said at his New Delhi
office. &#8220;The crying need of industry today is a reduction in
interest rates. Even a 25 basis-point reduction in interest
rates by the RBI will send very, very welcome signals to revive
investment in our economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BJP victories in four state elections over the past month
have bolstered its chances of ending the decade-long rule of
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s Congress party in elections due
by May. The country&#8217;s benchmark stock index climbed to an all-time high this week as investors bet on the ouster of a
government that has overseen the slowest growth in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer-price inflation probably rose 10 percent in
November from a year ago, after gaining 10.09 percent in
October, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 31 analysts.
The data is due today. Wholesale prices probably increased 7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Increases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has raised the benchmark
repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 7.75 percent since taking
charge at the central bank in September, and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. predicts he&#8217;ll boost it to 8.5 percent in 2014. The next
policy rate decision is scheduled for Dec. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of the inflation is concentrated in food, it&#8217;s
also evident in non-food manufacturing and services, Rajan said
at a conference in Kolkata yesterday. The central bank seeks to
balance the need to stem price gains while also supporting a
&#8220;relatively weak&#8221; economy, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not your traditional inflation,&#8221; Rajan said.
&#8220;This is not driven by a rip-roaring strong economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political parties must work together now to ensure that the
government that emerges after elections due by May can pass
measures necessary to manage the economy to avoid a credit-rating downgrade, Rajan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hung Parliament &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s sovereign rating will come under pressure if the
election produces a hung parliament, Terry Chan, a managing
director at Standard  Poor&#8217;s, said yesterday in a
teleconference with reporters. Opinion polls over the past month
show neither the ruling Congress party nor the BJP winning a
majority of the 543 seats up for grabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinha said India lacks an adequate system to distribute
food supplies, without elaborating on specific measures the BJP
would take to apportion an estimated 70 million tons of
foodgrains in government stockpiles. Food prices rose 19 percent
from January through October, almost twice as fast as during
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The RBI cannot adjust interest rates in a vacuum,&#8221; Sinha
said. &#8220;You have to create the necessary conditions for the RBI
to start reducing interest rates. If you create those
conditions, they&#8217;ll have no choice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said yesterday
that prices of fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs and milk were
helping to drive inflation. He said the government needs to
&#8220;radically transform&#8221; how food is stored, transported,
distributed and sold, while accusing state governments of
failing to enforce laws against hoarding and profiteering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian economic growth quickened last quarter from a four-year low on higher factory output, a revival threatened by
looming interest-rate increases to fight rising prices in the
nation of 1.2 billion people. Six of eight economists in a
Bloomberg survey expect the central bank to leave the repurchase
rate unchanged at the next decision on Dec. 18, while two expect
a 25-basis point increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh began a policy overhaul in September 2012 to spur
growth, including gradual increases in diesel prices aimed at
containing subsidies, and lifting curbs on foreign investment in
the retail and aviation sectors to attract capital flows.
Chidambaram has pledged to narrow the deficit to a six-year low
of 4.8 percent of GDP in the 12 months ending March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bloated Tremendously&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinha said the government&#8217;s subsidy budget was &#8220;bloated
tremendously&#8221; and called for spending to shift to investments
in housing and power plants. A BJP government would bring down
the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product over a
period of time, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The policy of this government has been to reduce the
people of India to beggary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve given it all
away for free, especially at the time of elections.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi, the BJP&#8217;s prime minister candidate, has
touted his ability to attract investment over the past 12 years
as chief minister of Gujarat. The state in western India
accounts for about a fifth of India&#8217;s exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP&#8217;s ability to impose drastic policy changes if it
comes to power depends on the strength of its coalition, said
Madan Sabnavis, a Mumbai-based economist with Credit Analyst 
Research Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the BJP can form a government without a coalition,
they&#8217;ll be successful where the Congress wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Sabnavis
said. &#8220;If they have the numbers, they should have no trouble
installing a Gujarat-type model where the bureaucracy is more
efficient. That could be the biggest difference.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said banks will have to charge more for
lending to get a &#8220;fair return&#8221; as regulators require the
industry to set aside more funds to cushion against losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;re going to have all these banks
around the world holding this amount of capital and the
revolvers will cost the same,&#8221; Dimon, 57, said today at an
investor conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New
York. Revolving loans and repurchase agreements are among
products that &#8220;use a lot of balance sheet&#8221; and will have to be
repriced, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are forcing firms to hold more capital
against assets banks consider low risk by proposing a minimum
leverage ratio of 5 percent as an increased buffer against
potential losses. Market participants have said that would
affect pricing and access to lending in the repurchase
agreement, or repo, market, in which borrowers sell lenders
securities with an agreement to buy them back later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms face new curbs, including limits on
hedging, designed to prevent financial blowups after the Federal
Reserve and four other regulators yesterday adopted the Volcker
rule, a centerpiece of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The hedging
provision drew more attention in the Volcker rule debate after
JPMorgan lost $6.2 billion last year in bets on credit
derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) lost a court bid
to block the European Union&#8217;s unconditional approval of
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s $8.5 billion-takeover of Skype Technologies
SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco &#8220;failed to demonstrate&#8221; that the EU was wrong to
clear the deal, the EU General Court, the 28-nation bloc&#8217;s
second-highest tribunal, ruled today. The merger &#8220;does not
restrict competition&#8221; in the markets for consumer- and
business-video communications, the court said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s plan to buy Skype, the world&#8217;s most popular
international calling service, was waved through in October 2011
by EU regulators who said the deal wouldn&#8217;t harm competition
because the market was growing and they faced &#8220;numerous
players, including Google.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco, the largest maker of computer-networking equipment,
said it was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; the court &#8220;did not require the
commission to revisit interoperability requirements for the
Microsoft-Skype merger,&#8221; according to an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Koch, a Microsoft spokesman in Brussels, welcomed the
court&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Innovative Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said the ruling &#8220;confirms&#8221; its
assessment of new markets and technologies. The decision to
clear the deal &#8220;did not put the development of innovative
products and services at risk,&#8221; said the Brussels-based EU
antitrust authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco had argued in its appeal that the EU regulator used
&#8220;flawed reasoning&#8221; that conflicted with its approach in
previous cases. It told the court that the Microsoft-Skype tie-up would give them a combined share as high as 90 percent of the
market for video calls on Microsoft Windows-based computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said today that even if the deal gave Microsoft
such a market share, it  wouldn&#8217;t enable it &#8220;to significantly
harm effective competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: T-79/12, Cisco Systems and Messagenet v.
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixi Inc. (2121), a Japanese game and
social network operator, fell the daily limit in Tokyo trading
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its recommendation to sell
from neutral and said the shares have risen too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 17 percent to 7,560 yen as of the close of
trade. Shares of the Tokyo-based company had risen 661 percent
from Nov. 19 through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixi had surged on expectations of profit from its new
smartphone game &#8220;Monster Strike&#8221; and the &#8220;YYC&#8221; social app,
according to the Goldman note. &#8220;Monster Strike,&#8221; which allows
up to four players to participate simultaneously, was ranked as
the 29th most popular free game on iTunes today, according to
the AppDB website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two apps would need to earn 26 billion yen ($253
million) in combined annual revenue to justify the current share
price, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiroyuki Osawa, a spokesman for Mixi, declined to comment
by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matt Robinson" date="Dec 12, 2013  5:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-12/jpmorgan-sees-bulls-in-high-grade-debt-arch-coal-selling-bonds.html"><headline>JPMorgan Sees Bulls in High-Grade Debt; Arch Coal Selling Bonds</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Investors surveyed by JPMorgan Chase
 Co. are the most bullish on investment-grade bonds in more
than nine years as they demand the least relative yields since
the start of the financial crisis. Arch Coal Inc. plans to raise
$300 million in a private offering of secured notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50 percent of investors in the JPMorgan survey are
overweight investment-grade credit in their portfolio, the most
since April 2004, meaning they&#8217;re wagering a larger portion than
benchmarks, Eric Beinstein, the bank&#8217;s head of high-grade
strategy, said today in a research note. About 5 percent of
respondents are underweight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimistic view on credit comes as the extra cost
investors demand to hold the debt instead of similar-maturity
Treasuries touched the lowest in more than six years yesterday,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
Index. A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate credit that reached
the lowest since November 2007 at the start of the week was
little changed as growth in retail sales added to speculation
the Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus that&#8217;s bolstered credit
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average relative yield on dollar-denominated,
investment-grade corporate bonds in the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index fell yesterday to 137 basis points, or 1.37
percentage points, the least since August 2007. The JPMorgan
analysts are forecasting spreads in their bank&#8217;s index to
continue tightening next year by another 15 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade spreads narrowed 0.3 basis point today,
Bloomberg data show. The measure for speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt tightened 1.1 to 541.6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, held at 70.3 basis points as
of 5:01 p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure has climbed from 67.3 on Dec. 9, the
lowest closing level since November 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index has risen as speculation mounts that the Fed is
gearing up to start reducing $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases as the economy improves. The share of economists
predicting the Fed will pare its stimulus in December has
doubled to 34 percent after a Dec. 6 report showing the
unemployment rate fell in November to a five-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taper Speculation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail sales rose more than forecast in November as
Americans bought cars and took advantage of discounts going into
the holiday-shopping season. Purchases climbed 0.7 percent, the
most since June, after a 0.6 percent advance in October that was
larger than previously reported, Commerce Department figures
showed today. The median forecast of 83 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 0.6 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confidence of debt investors in Computer Sciences Corp (CSC),
the technology consultant, fell after the company disclosed that
it may face a regulatory action from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission as part of an accounting probe. Credit swaps
tied to the Falls Church, Virginia-based company&#8217;s $2.5 billion
of bonds and loans rose 4.4 basis points to 109.3 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps, which typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves, pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arch Coal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch Coal (ACI) is planning its bond sale as the coal producer
prepares to redeem shorter-maturity securities. The St. Louis-based company intends to issue second-lien notes due in 2019, it
said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for corporate borrowing through short-term IOUs
surged the most in 16 months as demand from money-market mutual
funds increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
climbed $31.7 billion to $1.081 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
That&#8217;s the biggest jump since an equivalent dollar rise for the
period ended Aug. 1, 2012, and the highest level since the week
ended Oct. 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) led
gains in Chinese stocks traded in New York after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said the online real estate services provider is
poised to extend its six-month rally as housing prices soar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg China-US Index of the most traded Chinese
equities in the U.S. rose less than 0.1 percent to 104.55
yesterday, after dropping the most in two years the previous
day. About two stocks rose for every one that fell on the gauge.
Shanghai-based E-House jumped 6.8 percent while hotel chain
China Lodging Group Ltd. (HTHT) posted the biggest advance in a month.
Baidu Inc., China&#8217;s biggest search engine, capped the largest
two-day decline since October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of homes sold in China increased 19 percent to
the highest since December 2011, according to government data
released this week. E-House, which has surged 50 percent this
quarter to lead gains on the China-US gauge, stands to benefit
from this trend as a property agent, Shanghai-based Goldman
analysts led by Yi Wang wrote in a report dated Dec. 11. Goldman
also raised its estimate for E-House&#8217;s 2014 adjusted earnings by
10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rising home sales signal that the government won&#8217;t take
irrational steps to curb growth of China&#8217;s property sector,&#8221;
Tian X. Hou, the founder of T.H. Capital LLC, said by phone from
Beijing yesterday. &#8220;Investors didn&#8217;t consider E-House as an
Internet company until this year, after it expanded its e-commerce business. Both government policy and its own business
restructuring have helped the stock&#8217;s performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETF Retreats &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slipped 1.1 percent to $38.11
in New York, extending its decline to a fourth day. The Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index retreated 0.4 percent as improving economic
data spurred speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut
stimulus as soon as next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-House&#8217;s American depositary receipts soared to $13.80,
the highest level since February 2011. Trading volume was twice
the three-month average compiled by Bloomberg. The ADRs have
gained 237 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sold $135 million of 2.75 percent five-year
convertible notes yesterday. The conversion price of the notes
was about $16.80 for each ADR, a 30 percent premium over the
closing level Dec. 11, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman lifted its earnings projections for E-House by 11
percent for 2015 and 12 percent for 2016 to reflect &#8220;potential
benefits from the sharper focus on online expansion and our
estimated dilution impact from its convertible bonds issuance,&#8221;
according to the note. It also increased a 12-month price target
to $16.77 from $14.39. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SMIC Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN), China&#8217;s biggest real-estate
information website, rallied 4.1 percent to $71.82, extending
its gains this quarter to 39 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Lodging, a budget hotel operator based in Shanghai,
surged 6 percent to $25.76. Phoenix New Media Ltd., a television
and Internet news outlet, climbed 4.7 percent to $8.99, rising
the most in four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (981), a
Shanghai-based chip foundry, climbed 1.6 percent to $3.72 after
retreating 10 percent in a six-day slump. BOC International
Holdings Ltd. analysts led by Cheng Manjiang named the company a
2014 top pick among shares listed in Hong Kong in a report
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu&#8217;s ADRs slid 1 percent to $171.50 in New York,
retreating 4.7 percent from a two-year high of $108.77 reached
on Dec. 10. The ADRs have jumped 71 percent this year, the best
advance since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindray Medical International Ltd. (MR), a medical device maker
based in Shenzhen, tumbled 11 percent to $35.61, the biggest
decline since August 2010. Volume was four times the 90-day
average. Short interest on its stock was 23 percent of shares
outstanding as of Dec. 10, Markit data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in Hong Kong
retreated 1 percent to a four-week low of 10,962.18, while the
Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) fell less than 0.1 percent to 2,202.80
in a third day of slump. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank also assented to a deferred-prosecution agreement,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
negotiations are private. In such deals, the government agrees
not to prosecute for a specified period and charges are
dismissed if the entity improves its programs and complies with
the law. The talks are in their final stages and the accord
could be announced before year-end, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
resolve government probes that have beset JPMorgan, the biggest
U.S. bank, while overhauling internal controls to improve
relations with regulators. Wall Street firms have spent years
fighting off claims brought on behalf of Madoff&#8217;s victims,
including accusations that the companies ignored the con man&#8217;s
fraud to continue reaping fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the bank&#8217;s
primary regulator, and Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
have been investigating how New York-based JPMorgan handled
funds controlled by Madoff, whose multibillion-dollar fraud was
the biggest Ponzi scheme in the nation&#8217;s history. James Margolin, a Bharara spokesman, and the FBI&#8217;s Peter Donald
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Fines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC, which sanctioned the lender in January for
violating the Bank Secrecy Act, plans to punish the company for
BSA violations related to Madoff, according to another person
briefed on the probe. The OCC also is likely to fine the bank
for additional anti-money laundering violations, the person
said. Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1970 Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions
to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money
laundering, such as reporting cash transactions exceeding
$10,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in October that a deferred-prosecution agreement was among options the U.S. had discussed
with the bank. The New York Times reported on the tentative $2
billion accord late yesterday. About half of the penalties will
go toward resolving the Justice Department&#8217;s criminal case while
the rest will be paid to federal bank regulators, the newspaper
said, citing people briefed on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan listed at least eight Justice Department probes in
a quarterly filing last month, including the Madoff inquiry, and
investigations into hirings in Asia and the bank&#8217;s energy-trading practices. Weeks later, the firm agreed to a record $13
billion settlement to end government investigations of its
mortgage-bond sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan enters a deferred-prosecution agreement in the
Madoff case, it would be the second time that Attorney General
Eric Holder has allowed Dimon&#8217;s bank to avoid prosecution for
behavior the government has deemed criminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was in 2011, when the department granted JPMorgan
a non-prosecution agreement for its dealings in the municipal
bond markets. The bank&#8217;s employees &#8220;entered into unlawful
agreements to manipulate the bidding process and rig bids on
municipal investment and related contracts&#8221; from 2001 through
2006, the Justice Department said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Criminal Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, the bank agreed to pay $228 million to
federal and state agencies and to cooperate in the ongoing
probe. The investigation resulted in criminal charges against 18
individuals at firms including JPMorgan. UBS AG (UBSN) and Wells Fargo
 Co.&#8217;s Wachovia also agreed to pay penalties and enter into
non-prosecution agreements over the charges of rigging bids in
the municipal bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other banks that have entered into non- or deferred-prosecution agreements include London-based HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)
Wachovia&#8217;s cases focused on conduct before the lender&#8217;s 2008
acquisition by Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because a deferred-prosecution agreement or a plea
agreement involves oversight by a judge, they are better tools
to fix compliance issues than a non-prosecution agreement that
is never filed in a court,&#8221; said Brandon Garrett, a professor
at the University of Virginia School of Law who specializes in
corporte crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is increasingly calling for
corporate monitors in non- and deferred-prosecution agreements
to review companies&#8217; compliance with the terms of the agreements
and to ensure corporate reform, according to a 2008 department
memo on the topic. The corporate monitors are usually employed
by the firms and approved by the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coupons.com Inc., which took coupon
clipping from newspapers to the Web in 1998, plans to go public
next year and has picked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to lead the
offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mountain View, California-based company, whose
customers range from General Mills Inc. to Walgreen Co., makes
money when a customer downloads a coupon for redemption. More
consumers using digital coupons spurred RetailMeNot Inc. (SALE) to go
public earlier this year and Ebates Shopping.com Inc. to seek an
IPO in 2014, people familiar with the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Patrick
Crisp, a spokesman for Coupons.com, declined to comment. The
people familiar with Coupons.com&#8217;s IPO plans asked not to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet companies are jumping at the chance to go public
after Twitter Inc. shares almost doubled following the
microblogging site&#8217;s IPO last month. In addition to Ebates,
Internet-dating site Zoosk Inc. picked banks for its IPO, as did
online-advertising companies TubeMogul Inc. and The Rubicon
Project Inc., according to people with knowledge of the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupons.com is backed by investors including venture-capital firm Greylock Partners. A $200 million investment from
institutional investors in 2011 valued the company at $1
billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million adults in the U.S. will use digital
coupons next year, up from 96.6 million in 2013, according to
researcher EMarketer Inc. RetailMeNot, an Austin, Texas-based
provider of digital coupons, priced a secondary offering of its
stock yesterday at $26 a share, a 24 percent increase over the
company&#8217;s IPO price in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) isn&#8217;t the
lead underwriter on Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.&#8217;s initial
public offering. The investment bank still stands to reap more
than any other firm handling the largest-ever hotel IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will generate more than $117 million in
proceeds from the $2.35 billion deal as a stakeholder and
lender, based on a description of the bank&#8217;s holding in the
sale&#8217;s prospectus and Hilton&#8217;s statement on the final terms.
That&#8217;s on top of fees as an underwriter of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The windfall stems from the firm&#8217;s six-year involvement
with Hilton&#8217;s buyout and return to the stock market. The bank
was among lenders providing $20.6 billion of mortgage and
mezzanine debt to finance Blackstone Group LP&#8217;s 2007 purchase of
the hotel chain. A 2010 debt restructuring gave Goldman Sachs a
stake in Hilton, and the firm served as a lender in credit
facilities that are being repaid with IPO proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, isn&#8217;t alone in having multiple roles in the sale.
New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) also had a stake in the Hilton
holding company and was set to receive stock in the hotel
operator or cash from the IPO, the prospectus shows. That
investment is held by Morgan Stanley&#8217;s asset management unit,
according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be
identified because details of the holding aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Indian court lifted an asset
freeze linked to a federal tax demand on Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) easing the
path for the Finnish company&#8217;s 5.44 billion-euro ($7.5 billion)
sale of its handset business to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia must deposit 22.5 billion rupees ($364 million) into
an escrow account within 30 days,  which may ultimately be used
to cover the Espoo, Finland-based company&#8217;s disputed tax dues of
at least 20.8 billion rupees, according to a ruling by the court
in New Delhi. In exchange, India&#8217;s Income Tax Department will
return control of assets including a mobile-phone plant in the
southern city of Chennai, according to the court&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injunction, ordered by authorities in September, would
have complicated Nokia&#8217;s deal with Microsoft by risking
elimination of the Indian assets from the sale had the court
ruled in India&#8217;s favor, the manufacturer said last month. The
Finnish company could face a tax bill of as much as 210 billion
rupees should a court order Nokia&#8217;s local unit to pay taxes on
royalties to its parent company, said Mohan Parasaran, the
government lawyer for the case. Nokia has said the claims are
without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett Young, a spokesman at Nokia,  said the company is
&#8220;currently analyzing the Delhi High Court&#8217;s ruling and will
only comment once that work is done.&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition
is slated for completion in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feature Phones &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia said the Chennai plant had continued operations while
the assets remained frozen. The facility makes feature phones
which are distributed across Asia and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim against Nokia adds to mounting demands against
foreign companies in India where investors including Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD), Royal Dutch Shell Plc and International Business
Machines Corp. face disputes over so-called transfer pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March, more than 2 trillion rupees in tax demands
were locked up in various Indian courts, estimates by BMR Legal
in New Delhi show. Indian tax authorities and courts have ruled
on more than 4,500 transfer-pricing cases since 2011 valued at a
combined 1.1 trillion rupees, according to BMR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombay High Court ordered Vodafone India to take its
$200 million transfer-pricing case to a dispute resolution panel
after ruling that tax authorities had not properly evaluated the
merits of the income being taxed, said Mukesh Butani, a partner
at BMR. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, is forecasting a 30 percent surge in the
value of mergers and acquisitions the bank expects to handle in
Asia next year, a rebound from this year&#8217;s decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies, financial firms and Asian buyers
expanding in the U.S. and Europe will drive a surge in activity
for JPMorgan, said Rob Sivitilli, 41, who has been head of Asian
MA outside Japan since September 2012. The New York-based bank
climbed this year to No. 2 among advisers in the region from No.
4 in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose in deal rankings by improving communication
between bankers in Asia and colleagues in North America and
Europe, Sivitilli said. Takeover activity declined this year in
the region as slowing economies from India to China curbed
executives&#8217; risk appetite. Mergers involving Asian companies may
fall short of last year&#8217;s $311 billion after ending last week at
$298 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have enough visibility on first-quarter and second-quarter activity that leads us to project ourselves into a much
higher level of performance in 2014,&#8221; Sivitilli said in a Nov.
25 interview in Singapore. &#8220;We continue to see further gains in
market share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may pay about
$2 billion to resolve U.S. probes into whether the bank ignored
signs of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, the New York Times
reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is close to a deal that includes a deferred
prosecution agreement and more than $1 billion in penalties to
resolve a criminal case, with remaining sanctions imposed by
federal regulators investigating gaps in the company&#8217;s money-laundering safeguards, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in October that the company was in
settlement talks that may lead to a deferred prosecution
agreement. In such deals, the government agrees not to prosecute
for a specified period and dismisses charges if the entity
improves its programs or complies with the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
resolve government probes that have beset JPMorgan, while
overhauling internal controls to improve relations with
regulators. It&#8217;s among Wall Street firms that have spent years

including accusations that the companies ignored the con man&#8217;s
fraud to continue reaping fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has been

firm turned a blind eye to his multibillion-dollar fraud, the
biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on the settlement talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank listed at least eight Justice Department probes in

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest bank-card network, said it awarded Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf compensation for fiscal year 2013 valued at $10.5
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pay package included a $950,000 base salary and a bonus
of $3.57 million, Foster City, California-based Visa said today
in a filing. He received $2.97 million in performance shares,
$1.48 million in options and a similar sum in restricted stock,
the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa has risen 37 percent this year, lagging the 60 percent
return for MasterCard Inc. while outpacing the 24 percent
advance for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. The shares are up
about 49 percent since Scharf succeeded Joseph W. Saunders on
Nov. 1, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders received a pay package valued at $9.7 million in
total compensation for fiscal year 2012, reflecting a formula
based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Scharf
was paid $24.2 million for fiscal year 2013 based on the same
calculation, which differs from the company&#8217;s number because it
includes the compensation actually received in the year rather
than what was awarded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) shareholder sued the company over claims its cooperation
with a National Security Agency eavesdropping program caused a
drop in sales in China, hurting investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Sheriffs&#8217; Pension and Relief Fund, in a
complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court, accuses
IBM of defrauding investors by concealing that sales slowed
after Edward Snowden disclosed the company was cooperating with
the NSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, documents released by Snowden revealed the NSA&#8217;s
&#8220;Prism&#8221; surveillance program, which used information from
technology companies such as IBM, the pension fund said. IBM
also lobbied in favor of a bill that would allow it to share
customers&#8217; personal data, including data from users in China,
with the NSA, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company knew but misrepresented or concealed from
investors that the disclosures of its lobbying and its
association with the Prism and NSA spying scandal caused
businesses in China as well as the Chinese government to
abruptly halt doing business with IBM, leading to an immediate,
and precipitous decline in sales,&#8221; the pension fund said in its
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 16, IBM, the largest computer-services provider,
reported a 22 percent drop in sales in China compared with the
previous quarter as a result of the Snowden disclosures,
according to the Louisiana fund, which said it pays retirement,
death and disability benefits to more than 20,000 active and
retired employees of sheriff&#8217;s offices throughout the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is &#8220;pushing a wild conspiracy theory,&#8221; IBM&#8217;s
general counsel, Robert Weber, said in a statement today. &#8220;This
lawsuit seeks to confuse IBM&#8217;s support for a U.S. cybersecurity
legislative proposal -- which has yet to be enacted -- with the
completely unrelated NSA surveillance program called PRISM,&#8221;
Weber said in the statement. &#8220;Even a cursory reading of the
legislative proposal, known as CISPA, makes clear that it has
nothing to do with the recently disclosed NSA surveillance
program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pension fund is seeking to represent a class of
investors who bought IBM stock from June 25 to Oct. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Sheriffs&#8217; Pension  Relief Fund v.
International Business Machines Corp., 13-cv-08818, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) directors seeking a
new chief executive officer to reinvigorate the software maker
should be mindful of the lesson of J.C. Penney Co., said Steve Miller, who spent his career helping hobbled companies survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What must terrify them is the example, say, of J.C.
Penney,&#8221; Miller, the chairman of American International Group
Inc. (AIG), told Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker in an interview today. &#8220;They decided they needed to
change, they brought in Ron Johnson, did a radical shift in
their whole strategy, and it was a complete failure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney hired Johnson from Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he turned
the iPad maker&#8217;s stores into a lucrative retail empire. At J.C.
Penney, Johnson scaled back discounts and sought to transform
the department-store chain into collections of boutiques. The
company replaced Johnson with former CEO Mike Ullman in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, has been considering
outsiders for the CEO post. Its list of candidates has included
Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally and Qualcomm Inc. Chief
Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf, according to people familiar
with the matter. Mollenkopf was removed from the running today
when Qualcomm named him CEO. Microsoft is replacing Steve
Ballmer who took over as CEO in 2000 from Bill Gates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co. (PG) plans to re-organize its overseas business units as Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley works to cut costs at the world&#8217;s largest consumer-products maker, said three people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The maker of Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste is weighing a merger of its Western European unit with Eastern and Central Europe to create one group for the continent, said the people, who requested anonymity because the plan won&#8217;t be unveiled until 2014. PG&#8217;s Indian business will combine with the Middle East and Africa to form another group, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The streamlining, which follows similar moves by other consumer-product companies, is an attempt to accelerate sales growth and reduce costs. Some senior management staff in Europe could lose their jobs, according to two of the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, Cincinnati-based PG has five geographic units: North America, Latin America, Asia, Western Europe, and CEEMEA, which includes Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Western Europe accounted for 18 percent of PG&#8217;s $84 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year, according to its annual report, while CEEMEA comprised 15 percent of revenue and Asia 18 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move represents Lafley&#8217;s second major shakeup since he returned to run the company in May. The following month, PG streamlined its businesses into four industry-based groups &#8220;to facilitate faster global expansion of brand and product innovations,&#8221; the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock has advanced about 4 percent since Lafley replaced Bob McDonald as CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cost Savings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve openly discussed our focus on productivity and growth, and this includes reviewing our geographic operations,&#8221; Paul Fox, a spokesman for PG, said in an interview. &#8220;Studies are underway to explore the best ways to scale and simplify our global market operations, but no final decisions have been made.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At an investor conference in September, Lafley hinted at the coming changes when he said &#8220;we&#8217;ll look to scale operations across all of Europe&#8221; as part of its plan &#8220;to accelerate and strengthen our productivity and cost savings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PG is not the first consumer-goods company to redraw its map of the world in the wake of the global recession. Last year, Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/), the maker of Lysol disinfectants, combined Europe and North America into one business unit to shed costs and speed up decision making. The maker of Nurofen painkillers also placed Latin America and Asia together into the same reporting unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lafley&#8217;s Return &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lafley, who had served as president and CEO from 2000 to 2009, returned this year as the company struggled to rekindle growth. The 66-year-old Lafley has said he will continue a turnaround plan that McDonald embarked on that aims to cut $10 billion in costs through 2016 and renews focus on the company&#8217;s leading businesses, such as hair care. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The maker of Gillette razors and blades entered Europe in 1930 by acquiring a soap company in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent, trying to speed efforts to improve the
company&#8217;s North American distribution system, shook up his
management team, resulting in the departure of a leader once
considered a contender to succeed him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Cahillane, president of Coca-Cola Americas, will
leave the company as his unit is dissolved, the Atlanta-based
company said in a statement yesterday. North America operations,
including brand marketing, food service and new product
development, will be handed back to 25-year Coke veteran Sandy Douglas, who stepped aside as president of the region in 2012.
Coke&#8217;s bottling operations in the U.S. and Canada will be folded
into the company&#8217;s international bottling group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We organized the business to intensify focus on key
markets, streamline reporting lines and provide flexibility to
adjust the business within these geographies in the future,&#8221;
Kent said in the statement. The changes, he said, will
&#8220;accelerate the refranchising of our bottling system in our
flagship market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Kent took control of 90 percent of Coca-Cola&#8217;s
North American distribution network with the purchase of its
largest bottler, hoping to stem volume sales declines and boost
profit. He is reversing a decades-old model in which Coca-Cola
sold franchises in the U.S. to bottlers who handled everything
from production to distribution, buying beverage concentrates
from Coca-Cola. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Thomas Stolper, who correctly predicted the dollar&#8217;s slide against the
euro this year, is deviating from the consensus that the
greenback will be among the best currencies to own in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar will weaken through 2014, reaching $1.40 per
euro for the first time since October 2011, Goldman&#8217;s London-based chief currency strategist said. The mean estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 46 contributors is for a 7 percent rally to
$1.28 per euro from $1.3758 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms from BNP Paribas SA to Barclays Plc and Morgan
Stanley say a strengthening U.S. economy will allow the Federal
Reserve to pull back on stimulus measures that include printing
dollars to buy $85 billion of bonds every month. For Stolper,
that will be offset by the Fed keeping its benchmark interest
rates at about zero even as it reduces bond purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tapering is in the price already, we find it difficult to
see where the dollar strength would come from,&#8221; Stolper wrote
in an e-mailed response to questions this week. &#8220;There is
always a risk that stronger growth in the U.S. suddenly pushes
rates even higher as markets anticipate a stronger Fed response.
However, our base case is that we see only marginal support for
the dollar from interest rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stolper&#8217;s Calls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stolper, 45, predicted in December 2012 that the dollar
would trade at about $1.33 per euro in June. It averaged $1.32
that month, falling as low as $1.34. He cut his outlook on the
dollar Sept. 12 when it was trading at about $1.33, predicting
it would weaken to $1.38 per euro in three months, from a
previous forecast of $1.34. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 46 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, 42 expect the
greenback to gain against Europe&#8217;s common currency next year as
rising Treasury yields lure international investors from lower
returning counterparts. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yield
104 basis points, or 1.04 percentage points, more than
comparable maturity German bunds, close to the biggest premium
in about seven years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index has risen 1.8 percent from
an eight-month low in October as gains in employment added to
speculation the Fed may slow its quantitative-easing program as
soon as next week&#8217;s policy meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Euro &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro has strengthened 4.3 percent this year against the
dollar, making it the best performer among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. It got an added boost after European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi left interest rates
unchanged and gave no indication he would take further steps to
ease monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect all major central banks on hold until at least
late 2015 -- hence, no immediate catalyst&#8221; for further gains in
the dollar, Stolper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While strategists predict broad dollar gains, investors are
hedging their bets ahead of the Dec. 17-18 Fed meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures traders reduced net wagers that the dollar will
gain versus eight peers including the euro, yen and pound to
$18.9 billion as of Dec. 3, from $19.1 billion a week earlier,
according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data compiled
by Societe Generale SA. The net long position on Nov. 26 was the
most since Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the first two rounds of quantitative
easing, the dollar showed little momentum. The Bloomberg U.S.
Dollar Index rose 0.4 percent the month after what&#8217;s known as
QE1 was completed in March 2010, and fell 1.3 percent the month
after QE2 in June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation Change &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dollar may stay here for a while as the Fed will get
away with the story of inflation is nowhere to be seen,&#8221; Jose Wynne, the head of foreign-exchange research at Barclays in New
York, said in a phone interview. &#8220;But this may change in the
second half of next year, when inflation starts to turn
around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays forecasts the dollar will rally to $1.27 against
the common currency by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since reaching a three-year high of 3.9 percent in
September 2011, inflation has slowed. In October, consumer
prices rose 1 percent from a year earlier, the smallest increase
in four years, according to a Nov. 20 Labor Department report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better economic growth in the U.S. relative to most
developed nations will support the dollar, according to Morgan
Stanley. The world&#8217;s biggest economy will grow 2.6 percent in
2014, versus 1 percent in the euro area and 2.4 percent in the
U.K., according to separate Bloomberg surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Drivers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this environment, we believe that relative growth
differentials will be key currency drivers, and these are
dollar-supportive, given that the U.S. private sector has
delevered more than the rest of developed markets,&#8221; Morgan
Stanley strategists led by Hans Redeker in London wrote in a
Dec. 2 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a persistent deficit in the current
account, which is the broadest measure of trade because it
includes investment, hurts demand for the dollar, according to
Stolper. The shortfall was $98.9 billion in the second quarter.
The euro area recorded a current-account surplus in September
for the eighth consecutive month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A growth story convincing enough to see international
investors commit more capital to the U.S.&#8221; is necessary for a
breakthrough in the dollar, Stolper said. &#8220;So far, we have seen
mainly capital outflows from the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) shareholder sued the company over claims its cooperation
with a National Security Agency eavesdropping program caused a
drop in sales in China, hurting investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Sheriffs&#8217; Pension and Relief Fund, in a
complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court, accuses
IBM of defrauding investors by concealing that sales slowed
after Edward Snowden disclosed the company was cooperating with
the NSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, documents released by Snowden revealed the NSA&#8217;s
&#8220;Prism&#8221; surveillance program, which used information from
technology companies such as IBM, the pension fund said. IBM
also lobbied in favor of a bill that would allow it to share
customers&#8217; personal data, including data from users in China,
with the NSA, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company knew but misrepresented or concealed from
investors that the disclosures of its lobbying and its
association with the Prism and NSA spying scandal caused
businesses in China as well as the Chinese government to
abruptly halt doing business with IBM, leading to an immediate,
and precipitous decline in sales,&#8221; the pension fund said in its
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 16, IBM, the largest computer-services provider,
reported a 22 percent drop in sales in China compared with the
previous quarter as a result of the Snowden disclosures,
according to the Louisiana fund, which said it pays retirement,
death and disability benefits to more than 20,000 active and
retired employees of sheriff&#8217;s offices throughout the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is &#8220;pushing a wild conspiracy theory,&#8221; IBM&#8217;s
general counsel, Robert Weber, said in a statement today. &#8220;This
lawsuit seeks to confuse IBM&#8217;s support for a U.S. cybersecurity
legislative proposal -- which has yet to be enacted -- with the
completely unrelated NSA surveillance program called PRISM,&#8221;
Weber said in the statement. &#8220;Even a cursory reading of the
legislative proposal, known as CISPA, makes clear that it has
nothing to do with the recently disclosed NSA surveillance
program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pension fund is seeking to represent a class of
investors who bought IBM stock from June 25 to Oct. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Sheriffs&#8217; Pension  Relief Fund v.
International Business Machines Corp., 13-cv-08818, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) added
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) to a group
of banks prepared to lend it as much as $25 billion for its Time
Warner Cable Inc. bid, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also includes Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Deutsche
Bank AG and Barclays Plc (BARC), said one of the people, who asked not
to be named because the discussions are private. While Charter
hasn&#8217;t signed a letter of commitment yet, the banks have agreed
to fund a bid, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter met with the lenders last week to set financing
terms, one of the people said. The fourth-largest U.S. cable
operator is planning to offer less than $135 per Time Warner
Cable share, a person said last week. At that price, Time Warner
Cable is valued at about $62 billion, including debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bid will include cash and Charter&#8217;s stock, and Charter
may also sell shares in a public offering, one of the people
said. John Malone&#8217;s Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA), currently Charter&#8217;s
largest shareholder, will contribute cash to maintain about a 27
percent stake in the new company, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Dudley, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-based
Charter, and Susan Leepson, a spokeswoman for Time Warner 
Cable, declined to comment, as did representatives of Goldman 
Sachs and Credit Suisse. Courtnee Ulrich, a spokeswoman for 
Liberty, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, is seeking to sell a global investment unit in a push
to simplify operations by paring non-essential holdings, a
person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan began offering its Global Special Opportunities
unit, which has about $2 billion in assets, to potential buyers
in the past few weeks, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are confidential. Private-equity
firms Blackstone Group LP (BX), Carlyle Group LP (CG) and KKR  Co. among
possible bidders for the business, which could fetch $1 billion,
the Financial Times reported today, citing unidentified people
familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which is based in Hong Kong, employs 35 people
mostly in Asia and is run by Chris Nicholas. It invests the New
York-based bank&#8217;s money in distressed debt, non-performing loans
and private equity. Federal bank regulators last week approved
the Volcker Rule, which limits proprietary trading and investing
by deposit-taking banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re doing a lot of what I call pruning,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, told investors at a
conference last week. &#8220;Simplify, pruning. You should do it all
the time. Every year, businesses should look at what do I need,
what don&#8217;t I need, how do I serve my clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has already announced plans to spin off its
private-equity unit, sell most of its physical commodities
business and exit student lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined
to comment, as did Carlyle&#8217;s Randy Whitestone and KKR&#8217;s Kristi Huller. A Blackstone spokesman didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies buying their own stock make up more of the U.S. equity market than ever before, underpinning share values even as the Federal Reserve prepares to reduce stimulus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stock acquired under company repurchase programs represented 6.4 percent of daily trading in the Russell 3000 Index by value through Sept. 30, exceeding 2007&#8217;s level of 4.1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Birinyi Associates Inc. The proportion of trading is higher even as chief executive officers spend $343 billion less on buybacks so far this year, reflecting a seven-year decline in equity volume. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. to Walt Disney Co. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) took advantage of record-low interest rates to raise an unprecedented amount of debt financing and repurchased stock, helping boost per-share U.S. earnings for four years. With cash at a record, buying by companies is poised to continue in a bull market that is about to enter its sixth year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mathematics are pretty compelling,&#8221; Martin Leclerc, founder of Barrack Yard Advisors LLC and a 30-year veteran of investment management, said in a telephone interview Dec. 11. His firm oversees $260 million. &#8220;There will be continued shareholder buybacks, even increased shareholder buybacks, because things are pretty good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stocks Beat &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains in the 100 Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index stocks (SPX) with the most purchases relative to market value have beaten the full index this year, 40 percent to 27 percent, including dividends. Since March 2009, companies focused on buybacks have risen 270 percent, compared with the SP 500&#8217;s 190 percent. Stocks fell 1.6 percent last week after speculation an improving economy would spur the Fed to cut stimulus as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed 0.6 percent to 1,786.54 at 4 p.m. New York time today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies have helped offset trading lost as about $400 billion was withdrawn from mutual funds that invest in American stocks from 2009 through 2012. Buybacks as a proportion of the value of stocks traded have increased each of the last four years as companies purchased $1.88 trillion of shares since 2009, according to Birinyi and Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trading Falls &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stock trading fell every year since 2007, based on data for the Russell 3000, which is composed of companies representing 98 percent of the investable U.S. equity market, according to the Russell website. The data on buybacks compares the average daily value of repurchases each year compared with the overall value of shares changing hands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SP 500 earnings reached more than $100 a share last year, compared with about $60 in 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They&#8217;re forecast to rise 5.3 percent to $109.40 in 2013, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re anywhere near the level of overall valuation where companies will not buy stock back,&#8221; Paul Zemsky, the head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, which oversees $190 billion, said in a telephone interview Dec. 11. &#8220;Companies are still buying stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500&#8217;s price-earnings ratio has increased 17 percent this year to 16.7. While the multiple reached 17 last month, the highest level in almost four years, the average since 1998 is about 19, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL), the world&#8217;s largest company by market value, borrowed $17 billion in its first bond sale since 1996 to help fund a $55 billion addition to its capital return plan. The offering was the largest on record until Verizon Communications Inc. sold $49 billion in bonds in September. Shares of the Cupertino, California-based company have rallied 25 percent since the April 30 announcement, more than the 11 percent gain in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;IBM, Disney &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, bought back about $35 billion since the end of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The world&#8217;s largest provider of computing services has said it plans to repurchase $50 billion from 2011 to 2015. While revenue has fallen the last six quarters, buybacks have helped per-share earnings expand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, plans to purchase between $6 billion and $8 billion in shares this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said during a Sept. 12 conference call. The Burbank, California-based company has bought back about $3 billion in calendar 2013, Birinyi data show. Disney, which has about $4 billion in cash and short-term investments and an A credit rating, has seen shares climb 40 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Advance &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) gained 73 percent the last three years. The New York-based company said it plans to buy back $39 billion of stock, including a June announcement for $10 billion. The world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker acquired more than $11 billion so far this year, according to Birinyi data. Pfizer sold $4 billion of bonds in May, its first dollar-denominated offering in more than four years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The $1.137 trillion of investment-grade corporate bonds issued this year is a record, topping last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the average yield of 3.11 percent is up from the record low 2.65 percent in May, it&#8217;s still almost 1.8 percentage points below the decade mean, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of companies are using their cash flow to buy back shares and quite a few companies are borrowing money to buy back shares,&#8221; Edward Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research Inc. in New York said in a Dec. 11 phone interview. &#8220;That will probably continue at the pace we&#8217;re seeing now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fed Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed has kept its benchmark lending rate near zero since December 2008 and implemented three rounds of economic stimulus programs. The central bank will reduce its $85 billion monthly bond purchases at the Dec. 17-18 meeting, according to 34 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg Dec. 6. Nine of the 35 economists surveyed said the central bank will buy fewer bonds at its January meeting, and the remaining 14 predict tapering will start in March. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While share buybacks have boosted earnings, they&#8217;re also a sign that the economy isn&#8217;t strong enough to support corporate investments, according to Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $25 billion as chief investment strategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;GDP Expands &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product expanded 1.7 percent this year, down from 2.8 percent in 2012, according to 86 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. economy increased an average of 2.3 percent per quarter since 2009, the weakest recovery since World War II. While a report last week showed retail sales rose more than forecast in November, a separate release showed unemployment benefits increased. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the margin we&#8217;re seeing some improvements in the economy, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a significant pickup,&#8221; McCain said in a Dec. 11 phone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tough environment for companies to find projects where they can put more money into a new capacity, when most industries are struggling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To LPL Financial LLC&#8217;s Jeffery Kleintop, a slowdown in share repurchases wouldn&#8217;t be a negative sign. After a record year of corporate buying, companies will shift next year to investing their extra cash in plants, equipment and more workers as sales pick up with the economy, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue is forecast to grow almost twice as fast in 2014 as it did this year. Analysts project SP 500 companies will boost sales 4.1 percent to $1,134 per share next year, then another 4.5 percent to $1,166 in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Cash &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may not see as many buybacks,&#8221; Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL in Boston, which manages about $400 billion, said in a Dec. 11 phone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be positive. Businesses will actually be investing in fundamental growth and not financial engineering. Next year, the growth in earnings will be much more focused on fundamental growth, which is much more healthy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief executives have record cash that could keep buybacks going or be used to fund investments. SP 500 companies had $1.14 trillion of cash and equivalents as of June 30 and are on track to top that for the third quarter, according to data compiled by SP. The total has increased every quarter since Sept. 30, 2012, and is almost twice the level when the SP 500 last reached a record in October 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies authorized $728 billion in repurchase programs this year, compared to $467 billion at this point last year, Birinyi data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buybacks are a good thing,&#8221; Thomas Garcia, the head of equity trading at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management Inc. said in a Dec. 11 phone interview. His firm oversees $90 billion. &#8220;They&#8217;re willing to purchase shares. It&#8217;s a good thing to see that they have cash flow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Susan Decker" date="Dec 16, 2013  1:57 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-16/google-s-motorola-loses-bid-to-overturn-microsoft-victory.html"><headline>Google&#8217;s Motorola Loses Bid to Overturn Microsoft Victory</headline><body>

lost an appeals court bid to invalidate a patent Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
used to win a ban on U.S. imports of some mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility failed to prove the technology covered by
Microsoft&#8217;s patent was previously used in Apple Inc.&#8217;s failed
Newton personal digital assistant of the 1990s, the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an
opinion posted on its website today. Motorola Mobility conceded
it infringed the patent and pinned its arguments on claims the
invention wasn&#8217;t new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent, which covers a way mobile devices synchronize
calendars with computers, is part of Microsoft&#8217;s ActiveSync
software that Motorola Mobility licensed before the two
companies started fighting. Microsoft has also sued U.S.
officials, claiming the import ban isn&#8217;t being enforced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a broader argument by Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft that Google&#8217;s market-dominant Android
mobile phone operating system uses its technology. Motorola
Mobility, which was acquired by Mountain View, California-based
Google in 2012, is one of the biggest holdouts from an Android
licensing program that Microsoft started three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even after a closer look by the Federal Circuit, it&#8217;s
clear Google is using patented technology Microsoft worked hard
to invent,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft&#8217;s deputy general counsel,
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syncing Feature &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Android operating system is the most popular
platform for smartphones, with 81 percent of the global market
in the third quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Motorola Mobility&#8217;s handset sales don&#8217;t rank in the top 10.
Microsoft&#8217;s operating system, used with Nokia Oyj&#8217;s Lumia
phones, had 3.7 percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed with this decision but pleased with
the overall outcome,&#8221; said Will Moss, a spokesman for Motorola
Mobility. &#8220;Microsoft lost on eight of its &#8216;best&#8217; patents, and
this lone opinion does not impact our ability to build great
products that people love.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft separately appealed aspects of the U.S.
International Trade Commission case it lost. The Federal Circuit
in October revived Microsoft&#8217;s claims involving one patent.
Since the patent expires this month, Google wouldn&#8217;t face any
import ban from the ITC though the ruling boosts Microsoft&#8217;s
chance of seeking cash compensation in district court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft contends any Motorola Mobility phone that has the
syncing feature infringes the patent, and has sued U.S. Customs
and Border Protection, saying its officials aren&#8217;t stopping
phones from entering the U.S. The government has asked that the
case be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Motorola Mobility case against Microsoft, seeking to
block imports of the Xbox video-gaming system, failed at the ITC
and is on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Microsoft Corp. v. ITC, 12-1445, and Motorola
Mobility LLC v. ITC, 12-1535, both U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of
Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components
Thereof, 337-744, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cushman  Wakefield Inc., the
largest closely held commercial real estate services firm, hired
Edward C. Forst, former chief administrative officer of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., as president and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forst, 53, will take over the positions from Carlo Barel di Sant&#8217;Albano, Cushman&#8217;s chairman, on Jan. 6, the New York-based
company said in a statement today. Di Sant&#8217;Albano was interim
president and CEO for five months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forst&#8217;s hiring &#8220;will further strengthen Cushman 
Wakefield&#8217;s ability to capture the opportunities to accelerate
the firm&#8217;s growth,&#8221; said John Elkann, chairman and CEO of Exor
SpA, the brokerage&#8217;s parent company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will be Cushman&#8217;s fourth CEO in four years. Di
Sant&#8217;Albano took the job temporarily after Glenn Rufrano left in
June. Rufrano, former CEO of Australian shopping-center landlord
Centro Properties Group, joined O&#8217;Connor Capital Partners as its
chairman and CEO last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forst was Goldman&#8217;s global co-head of investment management
when he left in 2011 after 17 years there, interrupted by a
2008-2009 tenure as Harvard University&#8217;s executive vice
president. He is a 1982 Harvard graduate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving Goldman, Forst was an adviser to investment
firm Fenway Partners, Cushman said. In 2007, he served as
chairman of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siemens AG (SIE) will develop diagnostic
tests for U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc. (PFE) in an effort to sell
medicines to the patients most likely to benefit from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Siemens Clinical Laboratory, which is based in
Berkeley, California, will lead product development to ensure
efficacy, Europe&#8217;s largest engineering company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companion diagnostics are an important enabler of
targeted therapies,&#8221; John Hubbard, Pfizer&#8217;s global head of
development, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companion diagnostics is used to evaluate a drug&#8217;s
effectiveness on particular patients. Health care companies are
increasingly targeting the segment for future growth as
declining health care budgets prioritize the need to ensure the
efficacy pharmaceuticals before they are prescribed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnostics division generated an earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margin of 20
percent, making it one of Munich-based Siemens&#8217;s most profitable
businesses in the last fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens announced similar development deals in 2012 with
HIV drugmaker ViiV Healthcare Ltd. and Tocagen Inc., a developer
of an experimental brain tumor treatment, to create tests that
will determine which patients will benefit from the therapies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Allianz SE (ALV), Europe&#8217;s
biggest insurer, are &#8220;attractive&#8221; because the pace of fund
withdrawals at asset management business Pacific Investment
Management Co. is decreasing, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We note that Pimco net outflows are slowing, and that
performance of the main total return fund is beginning to
recover,&#8221; Michael Huttner, an analyst at New York-based
JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed report to clients dated Dec. 13.
&#8220;And we estimate that Pimco concerns are now in the price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has an overweight recommendation on Allianz
shares. The company climbed 0.6 percent to 123.55 euros at 9:43
a.m. in Frankfurt, taking this year&#8217;s gains to 18 percent. The
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Insurance index rose 20 percent in
the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allianz&#8217;s asset-management unit, which includes Newport
Beach, California-based Pimco, reported third-party net outflows
of 26.7 billion&#160;euros ($36.7 billion) in the third quarter,
mainly coming from traditional fixed-income products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher prices for German motor and house-building insurance
as well as &#8220;lower claims inflation&#8221; are expected to boost non-life pretax operating earnings at Allianz by 2015, Huttner said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Mulally&#8217;s candidacy for the top job at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) threatens to overshadow car introductions at Ford Motor Co. (F) and raises the risk of internal strife among his deputies at the automaker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keeping the focus on autos rather than management will be paramount as Ford plans to introduce 23 new vehicles in 2014, the busiest year on record for the 110-year-old company, said Michelle Krebs, an analyst for auto researcher Edmunds.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a distraction at a time when they need to focus on plants, products and people -- not one person,&#8221; Krebs said. &#8220;They are launching more products next year than any time in the history of Ford Motor Co. They need to focus on the business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Mulally, Executive Chairman Bill Ford and other company leaders have frequently reiterated a 13-month-old plan that called for Mulally to stay at the helm of the second-largest U.S. automaker through at least next year. While Ford has established a successor in Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, questions over timing risk a return to the executive infighting that afflicted the pre-Mulally Ford, said a person at the company with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing managers&#8217; roles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates told shareholders last month the software maker&#8217;s chief executive officer is a &#8220;complex role to fill.&#8221; As the board seeks a final candidate, it&#8217;s finding out just how right he is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm Inc.&#8217;s No. 2 executive, was named CEO Dec. 12, taking the 44-year-old out of the running to replace Steve Ballmer at Microsoft. While Alan Mulally, Ford Motor Co.&#8217;s CEO, is considered a candidate to lead Microsoft, his star faded amid concerns about his age, 68, and lack of technology experience, people with knowledge of the search have said. EBay Inc. CEO John Donahoe and former VMware Inc. CEO Paul Maritz declined to be considered, people with knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The challenge of finding a new CEO compounds the obstacles facing the world&#8217;s largest software maker as the company undergoes its biggest transition in decades. Microsoft is seeking to transform itself into a provider of devices and services amid declining personal-computer sales. The board is seeking an executive with enough experience to run a large public company and plenty of energy to oversee an overhaul, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Going outside for a CEO is always riskier and always more costly,&#8221; said Joseph McCool, president of search-committee advisory firm McCool Group in Amherst, New Hampshire. &#8220;For Microsoft, which has only had two CEOs, naming a new leader is one of the most critical decisions in its history. It has serious long-term implications because so much is hanging in the balance: the brand, the workforce, the customer base and investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pay Package &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another issue that could complicate the search for a new CEO is salary. If CEO pay at other companies is any guide, Microsoft will probably have to offer significantly more than the $1.26 million in compensation that Ballmer received for the fiscal year that ended in June. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who holds 4 percent of Microsoft&#8217;s outstanding shares, has been paid less than many of his top lieutenants and CEOs at peer companies. Mollenkopf received compensation of $14.2 million last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while Mulally earned about $21 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies typically pay a premium of 30 percent to 40 percent whenever they choose a new outside CEO, especially when they&#8217;re recruiting another CEO, McCool said. Such compensation often involves extra equity or cash to make up for unvested stock or incentive plans they&#8217;re leaving behind, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Qualified Candidate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board is also considering at least one external candidate who hasn&#8217;t been named publicly, two people familiar with the process have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, declined to comment or make executives or directors available for comment. Ford Director Edsel Ford II said on Dec. 5 that Mulally was staying put through 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;No change,&#8221; Mulally told reporters last week, in response to questions about his plans to remain Ford&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;I love serving Ford.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a handful of people that can really do the job,&#8221; said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. &#8220;You need a CEO of a $50 billion market cap company who wants to move to a $200 billion company and who wants to take on the challenge of turning Microsoft around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spate of departures of senior executives at Microsoft over the last decade means many of Ballmer&#8217;s top lieutenants have only served at that level for a handful of years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Difficult Choice &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, Microsoft&#8217;s head of cloud services, is a leading contender, people with knowledge of the search said in November. Even so, he has only run a business unit since 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Business development and evangelism chief Tony Bates and former Nokia Oyj CEO Stephen Elop remain in the mix, although they&#8217;re considered less likely to be offered the job, the people said last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Susan Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Nokia, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft with multiple businesses, many management layers and a complex organizational structure, has also been a difficult company for outside executives to fit into, said BGC&#8217;s Gillis. At the same time, it&#8217;s precisely because of such a culture that some investors want to see an outsider come in and shake it up, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has to be a vexing moment for Microsoft because the qualities they likely want in a new CEO are going to be difficult to find in one person,&#8221; said Michael Useem, director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to want someone who has managed a big company before and has a proven record for doing a turnaround.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risky Decision &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;An outsider still needs to fit in even if the culture needs changing, said McCool. A new Microsoft CEO would have to create alliances with insiders to make changes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;To do something transformative, they need someone who will be there for more than three to four years,&#8221; Useem said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft directors should be mindful of the lesson of J.C. Penney Co., said Steve Miller, the chairman of American International Group Inc. who spent his career helping hobbled companies survive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;What must terrify them is the example, say, of J.C. Penney,&#8221; Miller told Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney hired Johnson from Apple Inc., where he turned the iPad maker&#8217;s stores into a lucrative retail empire. At J.C. Penney, Johnson as CEO scaled back discounts and sought to transform the department-store chain, resulting in plummeting sales and Johnson being replaced by former CEO Mike Ullman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Radical Shift &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They decided they needed to change, they brought in Ron Johnson, did a radical shift in their whole strategy, and it was a complete failure,&#8221; Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miller, a director at Symantec Corp. since the 1990s, was the person who convinced John Thompson to take the CEO job at Symantec. Thompson is now Microsoft&#8217;s lead independent director and heading the search for Ballmer&#8217;s replacement. Microsoft&#8217;s board should do the same and persuade Thompson to become the company&#8217;s CEO, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson has said publicly that he doesn&#8217;t want the job. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the best candidate for that position is John Thompson himself, because of what I saw him do at Symantec,&#8221; Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Susan Decker and Drew Armstrong" date="Dec 17, 2013  4:53 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-17/teva-to-sell-generic-viagra-in-2017-in-pfizer-settlement.html"><headline>Teva to Sell Generic Viagra in 2017 in Pfizer Settlement</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Generic Viagra will hit the U.S.
market more than two years earlier than had been anticipated
under a settlement reached by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (TEVA) and the maker of the impotence drug, Pfizer Inc. (PFE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva can enter the market on Dec. 11, 2017, and will pay
patent royalties through the expiration of the Viagra patent in
April 2020, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement. Other
settlement terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viagra, whose chemical name is sildenafil citrate, is one
of Pfizer&#8217;s best-known medicines. Sales of the drug totaled
$2.05 billion in 2012, the most ever. Pfizer earlier this year
began selling the blue pill through a company-sponsored website
to combat counterfeit versions sold online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine came from a group of compounds considered
during research to treat high blood pressure and angina. The
assistance with erectile dysfunction was a side effect
discovered during testing, and the patent, issued in 2002, is
for use of the compound to treat impotence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of the patent were earlier rejected in 2010
because it was similar to a Chinese herb known as Horny Goat
Weed. Teva lost its bid to invalidate the rest of the patent at
trial, and was appealing the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit today dismissed the appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, which has tentative U.S. regulatory approval to sell
the generic drug, began selling copies in some European
countries in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, based in Petach Tikva, Israel, rose 12 cents to
$39.84 at 4:15 p.m. in New York trading. Pfizer fell 11 cents to
$30.14. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which is seeking a replacement for Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, said it anticipates completing the search in the early part of 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead independent director John Thompson, who is heading Microsoft&#8217;s CEO search committee, wrote in a blog post that the Redmond, Washington-based company has identified more than 100 candidates, talked with several dozen and has since focused on about 20 individuals, whom he deemed &#8220;extremely impressive in their own right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;As you would expect, as this group has narrowed, we&#8217;ve done deeper research and investigation, including with the full board,&#8221; Thompson wrote. &#8220;We&#8217;re moving ahead well, and I expect we&#8217;ll complete our work in the early part of 2014.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The timeline underscores the hurdles of finding a new leader for the world&#8217;s biggest software maker. Ballmer said in August that he planned to retire within a year. With no succession plan in place, the board was working toward speedily finding a successor as early as the end of this year, people with knowledge of the process have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Microsoft&#8217;s Nadella Studies Startup Roadmap Amid Search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet some candidates have dropped out of the running. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm Inc.&#8217;s No. 2 executive, was named CEO of the wireless chipmaker on Dec. 12, taking him out of the picture to replace Ballmer. While Alan Mulally, Ford Motor Co.&#8217;s CEO, is considered a candidate to lead Microsoft, his star has faded amid concerns about his age, 68, and lack of technology experience, people with knowledge of the search have said. EBay Inc. CEO John Donahoe and former VMware Inc. CEO Paul Maritz declined to be considered, people with knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Complex Role&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other candidates are still in the mix, including Microsoft&#8217;s cloud-computing chief Satya Nadella, Executive Vice President Tony Bates and former Nokia Oyj CEO Stephen Elop, the people have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said at the company&#8217;s shareholder meeting that he and other directors have met with &#8220;a lot of CEO candidates&#8221; and that &#8220;it&#8217;s a complex role to fill.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The software maker is going through its biggest transition in decades, seeking a new leader while it adopts a new corporate structure focused on devices and services. Microsoft is buying Nokia&#8217;s handset unit, its largest acquisition by number of employees, as it adapts to a technology landscape where consumers and businesses favor mobile devices and Web-delivered software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Two CEOs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said it&#8217;s important for Microsoft to find a replacement sooner rather than later &#8220;to resolve investor questions and to formally and finally define the company&#8217;s core direction.&#8221; He rates the shares the equivalent of a buy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history and both have been company insiders. Gates co-founded the software maker in 1975 and led as CEO until 2000, when he passed the reins to longtime executive Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment beyond the blog post or to make executives available for interviews. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jay Cooney, a spokesman for Ford, said there is no change from a plan the company laid out in November last year that Mulally would remain its CEO through at least 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alan remains absolutely focused on progressing the One Ford plan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We do not engage in speculation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Susan Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Nokia, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 1 percent to $36.52 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More Transparency &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies have been compelled to be more transparent on succession issues, especially as activist investors bring more scrutiny to company management, said Joel Koblentz, senior partner at executive recruiter The Koblentz Group in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investor Bill Ackman&#8217;s public campaign to get a new CEO at J.C. Penney Co. prompted the company&#8217;s other directors to publicly address the CEO search and the plans for the process. That search is still under way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chip Wilson, founder of retailer Lululemon Athletica Inc., discussed the search for a CEO in a November Bloomberg television interview before the company announced a decision earlier this month. The maker of exercise apparel had been under pressure from investors after it recalled yoga pants for being too sheer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft earlier this year struck a cooperation agreement with activist investor ValueAct Holdings LP. A ValueAct executive is set to join the company&#8217;s board in early 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Boards always want to have an orderly process of succession, but the balance between secrecy and transparency seems to be shifting,&#8221; James Post, a professor at Boston University School of Management, said in an interview. &#8220;For sure, there&#8217;s no going back to the old way where only private searches are done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="Dec 17, 2013  4:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-17/pfizer-s-schulman-to-leave-as-head-of-new-drug-unit.html"><headline>Pfizer&#8217;s Pick to Head New Drug Division Leaves</headline><body>

Pfizer&#8217;s general counsel, was chosen in July to lead one of the
businesses as the New York-based company reorganizes ahead of a
potential breakup. Albert Bourla, a 20-year Pfizer veteran, will
now head the unit, which handles vaccines, oncology and consumer
health products, Pfizer said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s division into two brand-drug and one off-patent
business, set for Jan. 1, will occur as the company divests non-medicine operations. The world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker has said it
is narrowing its focus on a smaller group of research areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Amy Schulman and Pfizer have agreed to separate,&#8221; the
company said in a statement today. She will stay at the company
for a transition period, after a five-year tenure there. The
company didn&#8217;t give a further reason for her departure or say
she was leaving for another job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second unit, to be led by Geno Germano, will get
inflammation and immunology, cardiovascular and metabolic drugs,
neuroscience, pain, rare diseases, and women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s health
products. John Young will head Pfizer&#8217;s established products
business, consisting of drugs that have lost patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schulman joined Pfizer as general counsel in 2008. She was
given leadership of the company&#8217;s nutrition unit in 2010, when
it had $1.87 billion in sales. After that unit was sold, she
headed the $3.12-billion-a-year consumer business, before being
assigned the newly created drug unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have enjoyed my years at Pfizer and wish the company
and my many friends and colleagues well,&#8221; Schulman said in an
e-mailed statement provided by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $30.14 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The shares have gained 19 percent in the last 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit by a group of Ecuadoreans
to seize Chevron Corp.&#8217;s Canadian assets can proceed in the
country, a Canadian court ruled today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled today that the 47
villagers have the right to pursue Chevron&#8217;s Canada assets. It
reverses a ruling made on May 1 that stated the company did not
have any assets in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court in the Latin American country in 2011 found the
company liable for about three decades of soil and water
pollution near oil wells that ruined the health and livelihoods
of Amazon rain forest dwellers. Since then, Ecuadorean farmers
and fishermen have been trying to collect $19 billion in
environmental damages from San Ramon, California-based Chevron,
the world&#8217;s third-largest oil company. The award was reduced to
$9.5 billion from $19 billion on Nov. 12 by the Ecuadorean
National Court of Justice, the nation&#8217;s highest tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even before the Ecuadorean judgment was released,
Chevron, speaking through a spokesman, stated that Chevron
intended to contest the judgment if Chevron lost,&#8221; judges James
MacPherson, Eileen Gillese and C. William Hourigan said in the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judges noted in the ruling that a Chevron spokesman had
said: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to fight this until hell freezes over. And
then we&#8217;ll fight it out on the ice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s wish is granted, the judges said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After all these years, the Ecuadorean plaintiffs deserve
to have recognition and enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment
heard on the merits in an appropriate jurisdiction. At this
juncture, Ontario is that jurisdiction,&#8221; the ruling states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible Appeal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision affords the plaintiffs no substantive relief
and merely allows the action to go forward,&#8221; Morgan Crinklaw, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Chevron Corp. is evaluating next steps, including a possible
appeal of today&#8217;s decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans should have an opportunity to attempt to
enforce the judgment in a court where Chevron will have to
respond to the merits, the judges said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s presence in Canada dates back to the 1930s and
includes an oil-refining complex in British Columbia, an Alberta
oil-sands venture and offshore wells in the Atlantic Ocean. The
Ecuadoreans estimate that Chevron has $15 billion in Canadian
assets, according to a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decision affirms that the court in Canada has
jurisdiction and it forces Chevron to participate in a trial
process to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment,&#8221; Steven Donziger, a
legal adviser to the Ecuadorean communities, said by phone
today. &#8220;The entirety of that judgment could be paid, every
penny, if an enforcement action in Canada is successful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and Chevron Canada were each ordered to pay
plaintiffs costs of C$50,000 ($47,000), the ruling said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corp. (CVX), C57019, Court of
Appeal for Ontario (Toronto) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to boost the number of junior investment bankers it employs by about 10 percent and provide them with &#8220;protected weekends&#8221; to reduce their workload, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeff Urwin, the New York-based company&#8217;s global head of investment banking, announced the changes on an internal conference call today, said the person, who didn&#8217;t say how many people would be affected and asked not to be identified because the new policies aren&#8217;t public. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the major Wall Street firms are planning to increase investment-banking staff in 2014, according to Jeanne Branthover, the head of financial-services recruitment at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York. They are also trying to protect their best employees from poaching as average pay at the biggest banks declines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Business is better and they&#8217;ve stayed lean for so long,&#8221; Branthover said. &#8220;People are burned out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which lowered the amount it set aside for employee compensation by 5 percent in the first nine months of the year, said in October that it was discouraging investment-banking analysts from working weekends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the ex-Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) vice president found liable for his part in a failed
$1 billion investment, should pay $1.1 million in fines,
disgorgement and interest, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 34, was found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at
which the SEC claimed he intentionally misled investors in a
subprime mortgage vehicle called Abacus. The agency alleged
Tourre lied about the role played by billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s
Paulson  Co. hedge fund, which helped choose the portfolio of
securities underlying Abacus then made a billion-dollar bet it
would fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These remedies are appropriate because the conduct that
the SEC proved at trial was egregious,&#8221; the SEC said in a brief
filed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. &#8220;Tourre, a
licensed securities professional, took the lead in structuring a
financial product that was secretly designed to maximize its
potential for failure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC asked U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest to
impose a fine of $910,000 and order that he disgorge $175,463 of
his 2007 bonus plus $62,858 in interest. The agency is also
seeking an order barring Tourre from violating the securities
laws in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Kittredge, a spokesman for Tourre with the firm Sard
Verbinnen  Co., declined to comment on the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is drawing record deposits into a bond mutual fund that&#8217;s making money even as interest rates rise, giving the bank a boost in one of the few Wall Street businesses it hasn&#8217;t dominated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX) attracted $9.8 billion in the first 11 months of 2013, more than three times the net new cash taken in by the New York-based company&#8217;s previous best-selling mutual fund in a calendar year, according to Morningstar Inc. (MORN) data going back to 1993. The $12.5 billion fund returned 5.3 percent in 2013 through Dec. 13, beating 96 percent of rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund has quintupled in size this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strategic Income is raising the bank&#8217;s profile in the $14.6 trillion U.S. mutual-fund industry by standing out among a breed of bond products whose managers can invest across the fixed-income spectrum, including bets that pay off when interest rates rise. The unconstrained funds have caught on as investors flee conventional fixed-income funds in anticipation of rates climbing further and spurring losses in bonds when the Federal Reserve scales back its asset-buying program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This portfolio has a shot at making money in any rate environment,&#8221; co-manager Michael Swell said in a telephone interview from New York. &#8220;You will see money flowing out of traditional fixed income into products like this one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years after Pfizer (PFE) Inc.&#8217;s
Viagra changed the sexual equation for older men, the
blockbuster impotence drug is set to become available in a less
expensive generic form as early as 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s little blue pills, which generally cost about $15
each, replaced treatment that included penile injections, pumps
and surgery. It will be produced generically, probably for a far
lower cost, after Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries
Ltd. reached a legal settlement to sell a copy of the drug,
whose chemical name is sildenafil citrate, more than two years
earlier than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 18 million Americans older than age 20 suffer
from erectile dysfunction, according to Johns Hopkins
University&#8217;s Bloomberg School of Public Health. Viagra, the
first of three medicines to take on the issue, has been one of
the best-known pills sold by Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, generating $2.05 billion in 2012, the most ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This blue pill changed the way we practiced medicine,&#8221;
said David Samadi, the chairman of urology at New York&#8217;s Lenox
Hill Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, Pfizer began selling the blue pill through a
company-sponsored website to combat counterfeit versions sold
online. Under a settlement announced yesterday, Teva (TEVA), the
world&#8217;s largest generic-drug maker, can enter the market on Dec.
11, 2017, and will pay patent royalties through the expiration
of the Viagra patent in April 2020, New York-based Pfizer said
in a statement. Other terms weren&#8217;t disclosed, and Teva already
sells generic versions of the drug in some European countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 2.1 percent to $30.77 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 20 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surprising Finding &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug was an accident. Pfizer first started looking at
sildenafil citrate to treat high blood pressure and angina.
During testing, though, patients developed erections. The
patent, issued in 2002, is for use of the compound to treat
impotence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of Viagra&#8217;s patent were earlier rejected in
2010 because it was similar to a Chinese herb known as Horny
Goat Weed. Teva lost its bid to invalidate the rest of the
patent at trial, and was appealing the case. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit yesterday dismissed the appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erectile dysfunction gets more common as men age. It can
also be caused by cardiovascular problems and a lack of physical
activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it was approved in 1998, Pfizer said 3 million
patients got the drug that year, moving 50 million pills for
$788 million that year, and $1.03 billion in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had a particular allure in society, as patients had to
pay for the drug themselves as insurance companies rarely
covered it, said Louis Kavoussi, chairman of urology at the
Arthur Smith Institute for Urology in New Hyde Park, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That gave it more of an aura,&#8221; Kavoussi said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;When patients came in, they&#8217;d beat around
the bush, and you knew what they were asking for. It was like
they were asking for the Playboy magazine in the back of the
store.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A generic version should cut the cost of the pills. &#8220;Going
generic is a good thing; it&#8217;s very expensive,&#8221; Kavoussi said.
&#8220;It is still not covered most of the time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That price, and the interest in the drug, has also prompted
theft and counterfeiting. When Kavoussi changed offices in 2006,
a demolition crew took apart the old space, he said. When they
did, they found box after empty box of Viagra samples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They left them in the ceiling -- years later we found
them!&#8221; Somebody -- likely hospital staff, Kavoussi said -- had
been breaking into the supply closet, taking the pills and
hiding the empties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treatment Revolution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, it was a revolution in treatment, said the two
doctors. Many patients with sexual dysfunction were diabetics,
whose disease had damaged blood vessels, hurting the ability of
the penis to fill with blood to create an erection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others were prostate cancer surgery patients, a side effect
of which can be the inability to become erect. For the prostate
cancer patients, the potential of Viagra to help was
particularly meaningful, Samadi said, since their average age in
his practice was about 50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are very young guys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Viagra can be
very successful in restoring function.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now about 70 percent of patients can be treated with pills,
Samadi said, a category that includes Eli Lilly  Co.&#8217;s Cialis
and Bayer AG&#8217;s Levitra. Lilly projects generic Cialis will enter
the market in November 2017, though it has other patents on the
medicine that last through 2020. Bayer&#8217;s main patent on Levitra
expires in October 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. claiming the agency is
responsible for more than $1 billion in liabilities faced by the
company as a result of its 2008 takeover of Washington Mutual
Inc.&#8217;s bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and the FDIC disagree over which side promised to
cover losses related to the takeover at the urging of the
regulator during the financial crisis. JPMorgan&#8217;s latest suit
leaves it to a judge to resolve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Washington that the FDIC agreed to shield it from
liability from lawsuits claiming failures by Washington Mutual.
JPMorgan said it took on only limited liabilities in its
purchase of the Seattle-based bank&#8217;s assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPM is simply saying, &#8216;Wait a minute, we&#8217;re not a
punching bag.&#8217; They&#8217;re not overreaching in the sense that they
had an agreement,&#8221; Peter Henning, a former federal prosecutor
and Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who teaches law
at Wayne State University in Detroit. &#8220;In fairness to them, the
FDIC begged them to come in and rescue WaMu. Now they&#8217;re saying,
&#8216;Wait a minute, you&#8217;ve turned on us?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has &#8220;a reasonably good chance of success&#8221; on its
claim, Henning said, making a settlement likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it is the
subject of numerous lawsuits, including claims by buyers of
securities backed by faulty Washington Mutual residential loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Damages Asked &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is seeking unspecified damages and a court order
declaring that the FDIC is responsible for the claims against
Washington Mutual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FDIC&#8217;s indemnification obligations that are the
subject of this action are a matter of contract,&#8221; the New York-based bank said in its complaint. &#8220;They are promises that the
FDIC made to JPMC to induce JPMC&#8221; to buy Washington Mutual&#8217;s
assets, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint follows JPMorgan&#8217;s $13 billion settlement
last month to resolve U.S. probes of its sale of mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the FDIC seized WaMu&#8217;s banking operations and sold
them to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion. The bank agreed not to pursue
reimbursement from the FDIC for bad loans issued by WaMu. Which
side has responsibility for other claims against WaMu is less
clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit filed yesterday is the latest attempt by JPMorgan
to fix responsibility for WaMu liabilities on FDIC, which took
over as receiver in connection with WaMu&#8217;s failure, the largest
in history for a U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2008 Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank bases its claim on a Sept. 25, 2008 &#8220;Purchase and
Assumption Agreement&#8221; between FDIC and JPMorgan. One paragraph
of the 39-page document sets out the WaMu liabilities to be
taken on by JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;agrees to pay, perform, and discharge, all of
the liabilities of the failed bank which are reflected on the
books and records of the failed bank as of bank closing,&#8221;
according to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s got all the worst attributes of a contract dispute -
- a poorly-written document created in a rush,&#8221; said Henning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disagreement between JPMorgan and FDIC over the meaning
of that agreement is the subject of JPMorgan&#8217;s new suit as well
as other suits involving both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2010 suit, Deutsche Bank AG, as a mortgage-bond
trustee, sued over $6 billion to $10 billion in securities
backed by flawed WaMu mortgages. One of JPMorgan&#8217;s defenses to
the claim was that any money owed in the Deutsche Bank suit was
the responsibility of FDIC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Liability &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in a November 2010 court filing in the
lawsuit that it &#8220;never assumed any liability&#8221; for the claims
asserted by Deutsche Bank and that the FDIC must indemnify
JPMorgan &#8220;in full.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan sued the FDIC seeking to force it to
pay a $2.65 million settlement of taxes Washington Mutual owed
the state of Connecticut. That case is pending in federal court
in Washington, D.C. And in 2010 the bank asked the court to
shift liability to FDIC for unpaid taxes allegedly owed by
Washington Mutual to North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FDIC is saying, you&#8217;re a sophisticated party, you
know what the risks were, everybody understands that when you
buy a failing bank, there&#8217;s going to be a lot of carryover
successor liability there,&#8221; said James Cox, a professor at Duke
University School of Law in Durham, North Carolina. &#8220;At the end
of the day, this was a good deal for JPMorgan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Hernandez, an FDIC spokesman, declined to comment on
the bank&#8217;s allegations. Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman,
declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. v. Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., 13-cv-01997, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s plans to spend $15 billion
of its oil wealth buying Ukrainian bonds is a risky bet that is

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G)&#8217;s chief economist in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia yesterday committed $15 billion, primarily from its
$88 billion National Welfare Fund, to buy Ukrainian bonds as
part of an aid package for its former Soviet neighbor. The
sovereign vehicle is a rainy-day fund built up to stabilize
retirement provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The numbers aren&#8217;t insignificant,&#8221; Grafe said by phone
about the deal. &#8220;Most of the exposure is coming from the state
and the state-controlled banks. If the bet goes wrong, it will
be seen on the balance sheet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on the deal with
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych yesterday, after the
smaller country suspended plans to sign a trade agreement with
the European Union. Ukraine is a crucial pipeline transit nation
for Russian natural gas exports to western Europe, while Russia
accounts for about 25 percent of its exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s cited Putin as saying Ukrainian borrowers owed
Russia about $28 billion, according to a report this month,
before the $15 billion of bond purchases. Ratings agencies will
&#8220;eventually&#8221; have to look at this exposure, Grafe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Spectacularly Wrong&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Seville, director of Fitch Ratings&#8217; sovereign
rating group in London and Kai Stukenbrock, head of sovereign
ratings for the Commonwealth of Independent States and at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s investment &#8220;can go spectacularly wrong if Ukraine
fails to refinance it by 2015,&#8221; Maxim Tishin, who helps manage
$1 billion as a portfolio manager at UFG Asset Management in
Moscow, said in e-mailed comments. &#8220;If it places at par, that
would be a bad trade financially, that&#8217;s for sure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s dollar bonds extended the biggest jump on record,
with the yield on notes due in June falling 28 basis points, or
0.28 percentage points, to 8.48 percent by 6:41 p.m. in Kiev,
the lowest since June on a closing basis. The rate dropped more
than six percentage points yesterday. The hryvnia, which is
managed by the central bank, gained 0.1 percent to 8.2850 per
dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds may help the smaller nation avoid a default after
its economy sank into the third recession since 2008 and its
foreign reserves sank to a seven-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Political Moves&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Ukrainians are staging the biggest protests in
almost a decade in Independence Square in Kiev after Yanukovych
rejected signing the EU integration and trade accord last month
to deepen ties with Russia, which had opposed the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Decisions like we have seen yesterday are clearly
dominated by political motives only,&#8221; Sergey Dergachev, who
helps oversee about $9 billion as a money manager at Union
Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt, said in e-mailed
comments. &#8220;Russia bonded Ukraine much closer to herself, thus
distancing Ukraine from the EU.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s failure to turn
over e-mails in a tax probe that led to the arrest last year of
five employees may have been caused by errors at International
Business Machines Corp., which managed the bank&#8217;s data storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The December 2012 arrests were based on prosecutors&#8217; claims
that Deutsche Bank withheld e-mails from the last week of April
2010 in the accounts of employees suspected of participating in
a tax scheme related to carbon emission certificates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month after the arrests, an IBM employee said in a letter
to prosecutors that staff at the computer services company mixed
up the dates of its monthly data-storage operations. The
confusion may have meant the e-mails from the last week of the
month were left out of documents turned over to investigators,
according to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police arrested the five employees, who included the bank&#8217;s
then head of litigation, in a raid on the lender&#8217;s office a year
ago this month. Four of the employees spent more than a week in
prison and were released days before Christmas, when prosecutors
said there was no longer a risk of evidence tampering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is an element of a probe by Frankfurt prosecutors
into tax declarations for carbon-emission certificates at
Deutsche Bank. Co-Chief Executive Officer Juergen Fitschen and
Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause, who signed tax returns,
are also being looked at as part of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Badle, a spokesman for Frankfurt prosecutors,
declined to comment because the probe is ongoing. Christian Streckert, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, also declined to comment
on the case as did Marie-Ann Maushart, a spokeswoman for IBM in
Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Investigations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is also grappling with escalating regulatory
investigations and litigation stretching from alleged rigging of
interbank lending rates to misrepresentation of products tied to
U.S. mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon emission tax issue dates back to April 2010,
when Deutsche Bank was first raided in the case. The fact that
e-mails from around that time were missing was used as evidence
to obtain a second search warrant and arrest warrants at the end
of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IBM employee who wrote the letter to prosecutors in
January of this year helped Deutsche Bank staff compile e-mails
when prosecutors raided the bank in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Missing E-Mails &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned by investigators over the issue in October
2012, the IBM employee said the e-mail back up took place over
the first weekend in May 2010 while in fact the operation was
conducted a week earlier, on April 24 and 25, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That confusion covers the period of missing e-mails from
April 26 to 29, 2010, which prosecutors later cited to obtain
arrest warrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations of obstruction of justice were also based
on the fact that Deutsche Bank had been informed before the
April 2010 raids that prosecutors planned to search the bank and
that a member of the legal department discussed it with one of
the suspects. Prosecutors also claimed that Internet chat
protocols weren&#8217;t properly disclosed by the bank and that
recordings of traders&#8217; phone calls were deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a July 3 meeting this year with Frankfurt prosecutors,
IBM staff told investigators that another &#8220;glitch&#8221; caused the
loss of additional data from a period in 2012. The data sought
by prosecutors had been deleted because various archival
requests -- including some by Deutsche Bank -- were mingled and
one folder was deleted at IBM, according to a copy of a memo
written by Frankfurt tax investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, prosecutors asked IBM for a written report on
the July issue and the names of the people who deleted the data,
according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) made two
senior appointments for its global commodities and metals
businesses, said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles McGarraugh, currently head of European mortgage-product trading, was named global head of metals trading, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. Don Casturo, currently head of
commodities investor products, has been appointed chief
operating officer of global commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel changes are being made at at time when the
world&#8217;s biggest banks are employing fewer staff members for
their commodities businesses as tighter regulations and lower
raw-material prices spur cutbacks. Investors pulled a record
$36.3 billion from commodity products this year through
November, according to Barclays Plc, while the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
GSCI Index (SPGSCI) of raw-material prices is headed for the first annual
drop since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Market participants, whether it be corporate, governments
or Wall Street firms such as Goldman, should not back away from
their commitment to this sector,&#8221; Sandy Mehta, chief executive
officer of Value Investment Principals Ltd. in Hong Kong, wrote
in an e-mail today. &#8220;Investment banking in commodities should
rebound smartly, predicated on stronger U.S. and Europe growth,
and a flattening out and rebound in key emerging markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York,
didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment on the appointments
after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Headcount &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm was ranked second to JPMorgan Chase  Co. in terms
of commodity revenue in the first six months of this year,
according to data from Coalition, a London-based analytics
company. Revenue derived from commodities at the 10 largest
banks from Goldman Sachs to Barclays will drop 14 percent to
$4.7 billion this year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total headcount in commodity units at those banks dropped
to 2,290 at the end of September, about 4 percent less than at
the end of 2012, according to Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to sell its physical commodity
business, while Deutsche Bank AG announced 200 employee cutbacks
on Dec. 5. Goldman Sachs, which has put its uranium-trading unit
up for sale, has no intention of selling its commodity business,
Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s natural for banks to keep the commodities business
for hedging opportunities,&#8221; said Ronald Wan, chief China
adviser at Asian Capital Holdings Ltd. &#8220;It&#8217;s too early for them
to quit this line of business. Demand for commodities and metals
will recover eventually.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is among banks whose ability to participate
in the commodities markets is being examined by the Federal
Reserve. The Fed is conducting a review while U.S. lawmakers and
regulators raise concerns that banks might abuse their various
roles in physical commodities markets, or that the businesses
pose risks to the firms&#8217; financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s cloud-computing chief Satya Nadella, one of the leading contenders for the top job at the world''s largest software maker, took time in Paris last week to huddle with local startups like video-on-demand company Video Futur Entertainment Group SA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s important to speak with startups because &#8220;the tech cycle is such that the small guys make it big and the big guys die,&#8221; Nadella said in an interview in Paris, where he was attending a technology conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella, who has emerged as one of the candidates to replace Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer according to people familiar with the matter, needs to bone up all he can on how to keep a decades-old technology behemoth from getting lapped by upstarts. The board will complete the search for Ballmer''s successor in early 2014, lead independent director John Thompson wrote in a blog post yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Microsoft Says Board Will Complete CEO Search in 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Nadella isn&#8217;t appointed CEO, he has said publicly that he &#8220;absolutely&#8221; intends to stay at Microsoft. That would set up the 46-year-old as a key lieutenant to whoever becomes the new chief, given Nadella&#8217;s 21 years at the company, where he has worked in everything from small business software to the Bing search engine to cloud services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama commuted the
sentences of eight people convicted and sentenced on crack
cocaine offenses, saying their prison terms were too long as a
result of disparities in the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the eight men and women has served more than 15
years in federal prison. Obama cited the differences in
sentences between crack and powder cocaine offenses, a gap
reduced under the Fair Sentencing Act that he signed in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of
them would have already served their time and paid their debt to
society,&#8221; Obama said in a statement. &#8220;Instead, because of a
disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust, they
remain in prison, separated from their families and their
communities, at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each
year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama also granted pardons to 13 people who already served
terms for drug-related convictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the offenders who received commutations were
profiled in an American Civil Liberties Union report that
highlighted people serving life without parole for nonviolent
offenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one important step toward undoing the damage that
extreme sentencing has done to so many in our criminal justice
system,&#8221; Vanita Gupta, ACLU deputy legal director, said in a
statement about the president&#8217;s actions. &#8220;We hope the president
will continue to exercise his clemency powers and lend his
support to systemic reform that will make our criminal justice
system smarter, fairer, and more humane.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pardons Record &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama issued only one commutation previously. The 13
pardons also break a pattern for the president, who before today
had granted 39 pardons, according to Justice Department figures.
That&#8217;s the fewest by a president in recent history, according to
the ACLU. By comparison, former President George W. Bush had
granted 62 pardons by the end of his fifth year in office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama in 2010 signed legislation narrowing the sentencing
disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. While blacks
accounted for 30 percent of crack use, they made up 82 percent
of the convictions, the Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1986 law had created sentencing rules where it took
possession of 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine
to trigger a five-to-10 year mandatory minimum sentence,
according to Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, chief
sponsor of the bill. The 2010 legislation reduced the ratio to
18-to-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When one looks at the racial implications of the crack-powder disparity, it has bred disrespect for our criminal
justice system,&#8221; Attorney General Eric Holder told a Senate
Judiciary Committee hearing in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holder later told the U.S. Sentencing Commission that the
revised sentencing policies should be retroactive. The Obama
administration is also pursuing less-harsh sentences for some
non-violent drug offenders, a concept also supported by Senator
Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, and other lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s planned $1 billion
sale of three oil leases in Nigeria was halted by the country&#8217;s
federal high court after a local bidder sued the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Mohammed Yunusa issued an interim injunction
preventing Chevron from inviting or accepting further bids for
its 40 percent interest in the leases, court documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local producer Brittania-U is suing Chevron for failing to
complete deals on three leases after bidding closed Nov. 15,
Brittania-U&#8217;s lawyer, Rickey Tarfa, said in a statement. &#8220;The
principal claim is to validate the sale&#8221; to Brittania-U and
secure damages for failure to uphold the contract, Tarfa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the third-largest oil producer in Nigeria, holds
interests in 10 deepwater oil blocks in the country in
partnership with state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.
In June, it offered its 40 percent stake in five leases with a
view to selling them by year-end. It&#8217;s one of several foreign
producers in Nigeria selling assets as their operations are
plagued by persistent unrest, violence and crude theft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit against San Ramon, California-based Chevron was
filed Dec. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is &#8220;aware of a court action&#8221; in respect of
the leases, Isabel Ordonez, a spokeswoman in Houston, said by e-mail. &#8220;Chevron is a responsible and law-abiding corporate
organization committed to the laws and regulations guiding the
operations of oil companies in the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Brittania-U v. Chevron Nigeria Ltd., Chevron

and KanAm Grund Group, a fund manager based in Frankfurt, own
the MesseTurm on behalf of investors including Italian Insurer
Assicurazioni Generali SpA. (G) Representatives at GLL, KanAm and
Generali declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tishman Speyer finished building the MesseTurm, at the time
Europe&#8217;s tallest building, in 1990. The New York-based developer
sold it to GLL and KanAm in 2002 for about 440 million euros,
according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Moscow Commercial Court approved the settlement,
according to RAPSI. Initially, Apple had sought cancellation of
Kodak&#8217;s &#8220;Retina&#8221; mark, according to the news service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under terms of agreement, Apple will use the mark with

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola had claimed that Frucor was infringing its
trademark by bottling PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) products in bottles the U.S.
company claimed resembled the shape of the Coca-Cola bottles,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s high court agreed with Frucor that the
bottles were sufficiently different and, in each case, clearly
marked with Pepsi&#8217;s brands, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also said it took Coca-Cola almost a year after
the bottles&#8217; introduction to complain about their shape and
hadn&#8217;t filed infringement actions in any other country where
beverages packaged in that particular bottle shape were sold,
according to the Herald. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Boundless Dispute With Textbook Publishers Nears Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boundless Learning Inc., a Boston-based online education
company, is near settlement of a copyright suit brought by three
publishers of college textbooks, according to a Dec. 16 court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearson Plc (PSON)&#8217;s Person Education unit, Cengage Learning Inc.
and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH&#8217;s MacMillan Higher
Education unit sued Boundless in federal court in New York in
March 2012, complaining that the company&#8217;s educational material
infringed their copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their complaint, the publishers said Boundless
&#8220;replacement textbooks&#8221; copied the &#8220;distinctive selection,
arrangement and presentation&#8221; of their own books, along with
&#8220;other original text, imagery and protected expression&#8221; of the
publishers and their authors. The publishers said Boundless gets
&#8220;an F in originality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked the court for awards of money damages, attorney
fees and litigation costs, and for an order barring further
infringement of their works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arial Diaz, founder of Boundless, said in a Dec. 17 blog
posting that there is a confidential settlement in the case, in
addition to a public judgment and court order. He said the
company now has a &#8220;clear path&#8221; for building and marketing its
textbook alternatives, &#8220;without treading on&#8221; the publishers&#8217;
rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs lawyers said in a Dec. 16 court filing that they
are reviewing draft settlement papers. They have requested a
status conference on Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;

prevent virtual money from slipping into a legal gray zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark is the latest nation to prepare standards to
protect its consumers from risks associated with virtual
currencies after the regulator found it lacked authority to
prevent a company creating an exchange for the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most likely outcome would be an &#8220;amendment to existing
financial legislation so that we have regulation covering it,&#8221;
Michael Landberg, chief legal adviser at the Financial
Supervisory Authority in Denmark, said Dec. 18 in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more nations are taking an official stance on
virtual currencies that aren&#8217;t controlled by any government or
central bank. Norway said this month it won&#8217;t recognize Bitcoins
as legal tender and will impose a capital gains tax. Prices sank
as much as 35 percent yesterday after China&#8217;s largest Bitcoin
operator, BTC China, said a third-party payment provider gave
notice it will no longer provide deposit services. That followed
a move by China&#8217;s central bank to bar financial institutions and
payment companies from handling Bitcoin transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark plans to &#8220;align&#8221; itself with other nations in
designing a framework that deals with gray zones created by the
use of Bitcoins and its competitors, Landberg said. The FSA is
preparing draft legislation for lawmakers to consider, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their introduction in 2008, Bitcoins have spread
rapidly, with about 12 million in circulation, according to
Bitcoincharts. They&#8217;re used to pay for goods and services
ranging from hand-made rugs to window cleaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of Bitcoins soared above $1,000 earlier this
year, compared with about $12 a year ago, according to Mt. Gox,
an online exchange dealing in Bitcoins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barnier Welcomes EU Deal on Central Securities Depositaries &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel Barnier, the European Union&#8217;s financial services
commissioner, said negotiators clinched a provisional deal
yesterday on rules for central securities depositaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules will introduce safeguards to address the risks
resulting from the provision of banking services ancillary to
the settlement, according to statement by the EU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safeguards include an additional capital surcharge for
CSDs and banks providing these banking services to CSD users,
the EU said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dutch Sign Agreement With U.S. to Fight Tax Avoidance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands and the U.S. signed an agreement on
automatically exchanging information between the tax authorities
of both nations, Deputy Finance Minister Frans Weekers said in a
letter to parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic exchange of information between the two
nations will start in September 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Sues FDIC Over More Than $1 Billion WaMu Liabilities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. claiming the agency is responsible for more than $1
billion in liabilities faced by the bank as a result of its 2008
takeover of Washington Mutual Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and the FDIC had been arguing over who promised to
cover certain losses related to the bank&#8217;s takeover of
Washington Mutual at the urging of the regulator during the
financial crisis. JPMorgan&#8217;s filing of the suit will leave it up
to a judge to resolve the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in the complaint filed Dec. 18 in federal
court in Washington that the FDIC agreed to shield it from
liability from lawsuits claiming failures by Washington Mutual.
JPMorgan said it took on only limited liabilities in its
purchase of the Seattle-based bank&#8217;s assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it is the subject of numerous lawsuits,
including claims by buyers of securities backed by faulty
Washington Mutual residential loans. The bank is seeking
unspecified damages and a court order declaring that the FDIC is
responsible for the claims against Washington Mutual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Hernandez, an FDIC spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
bank&#8217;s allegations. Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman,
declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan Chase Bank NA v. Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., 13-cv-01997, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC Meets on Proposal For &#8217;33 Act Offer-and-Sale Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission conducted an
open meeting in Washington yesterday to consider whether to
propose rules and forms related to the offer and sale of
securities under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possible rules are being considered as part of the
mandates created by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. &lt;/p&gt;

Insurance Corp., claiming the agency is responsible for more
than $1 billion in liabilities faced by the bank as a result of

&lt;h2&gt;ECB Says Euro Bank-Failure Plan Risks Losing Market Credibility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said
markets will question the credibility of a planned authority for
euro-area bank failures unless it has rapid-response capability
and the power to borrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An urgency procedure should be contemplated in order to
allow a decision in 24 hours,&#8221; Constancio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks during a meeting of European Union
finance ministers in Brussels yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If that is not there, we fear that markets will find the
process too complex and it will not be totally credible that it
can work in certain situations with the speed that is
required.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal for a Single Resolution Mechanism with a
common fund to cover the costs of saving or shuttering lenders
is part of a euro-area effort to break the financial links
between sovereigns and banks by centralizing oversight and
crisis management. The blueprint, presented in July by Michel
Barnier, the EU&#8217;s financial services chief, has met with a
barrage of German-led concerns, leading governments to embark on
extensive changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers are racing to meet a year-end deadline to broker
a deal on the plans so that negotiations with the European
Parliament can be brought to a conclusion before the assembly
breaks for elections in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments last week discussed a governance structure for
the resolution authority that would hand the Council of the
European Union, the EU institution that represents nations, a
dispute-resolution role. This conflicts with Barnier&#8217;s
blueprint, which made the European Commission, the EU&#8217;s
executive arm, the top decision maker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most innovative state in the
U.S. isn&#8217;t California, home of Google Inc. (GOOG) and Stanford
University, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It&#8217;s
Washington, where Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) are based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California came in second and Massachusetts third in the
ranking, which looked at criteria such as the percentage of
professionals in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics, and the number of patents and public technology
companies in each state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington, known for rainy Seattle, abundant greenery and
fleece-clad citizens, had the highest total score, not by
topping any of the categories -- California is highest in patent
activity and five states have more skilled workers -- but by
placing near the top. That&#8217;s due to the large technology
workforce, high productivity rates and plethora of public
companies in aerospace, biotechnology and computer technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am a big believer in the state of Washington,&#8221; said
Sunny Gupta, co-founder, president and chief executive officer
of software-maker Apptio Inc. in Bellevue, Washington, who said
he chose to live in the Seattle region over the San Francisco
Bay area. &#8220;It really comes down to having an incredible network
effect, primarily dominated by Microsoft and Amazon but also a
lot of great entrepreneurial talent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology enterprises make up 21 percent of Washington&#8217;s
public companies, according to the ranking, while they comprise
29 percent in California and Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Engineering Roots &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s strong engineering roots go back to Boeing Co. (BA),
the airplane manufacturer that was based in Seattle until 2001
and still has extensive manufacturing operations in the Puget
Sound area. The company attracted not just employees but also
suppliers to the area, said Ed Lazowska, who holds the Bill and
Melinda Gates chair in computer science and engineering at the
University of Washington in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s 1979 move to the suburbs of Seattle from
Albuquerque, New Mexico, attracted computer engineers throughout
the 1980s and 1990s, as did other area companies such as Aldus
Corp., the maker of publishing-software PageMaker. Nintendo Co. (7974)
chose Redmond, Washington, as its U.S. headquarters, pulling in
game developers, Lazowska said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former employees of these companies have gone on to found
local startups in and around Seattle. The availability of top
engineers has attracted technology firms such as Google,
Facebook Inc. (FB) and Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM), which have set up large
offices in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These companies move here because we, in fact, have a
phenomenal workforce,&#8221; Lazowska said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud Cover &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington state &#8220;arguably owns the cloud,&#8221; said
Lazowska, referring to computing services delivered via the Web
that are offered by companies such as Amazon and Microsoft. The
area also boasts a strong presence in segments such as data
analytics and storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet firms such as Zillow Inc. (Z) and Expedia Inc. (EXPE) merge
the region&#8217;s strength in retail -- as seen with local companies
such as Nordstrom Inc., Starbucks Corp. and Costco Wholesale
Corp. -- with technology expertise, Lazowska said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers are attracted to the Seattle region instead of
Silicon Valley, thanks to more affordable housing and lower
taxes -- Washington has no state income tax -- said Gupta, who
develops software that helps companies manage and monitor their
technology spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 2.8 percent of Washington residents work in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics, more than California&#8217;s
2.3 percent, and below Washington DC&#8217;s 9.2 percent and 3.4
percent in Massachusetts, the data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning Environment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft alums such as Brad Silverberg and Pete Higgins
co-founded venture-capital firms Ignition Partners and Second
Avenue Partners. Rob Glaser founded RealNetworks Inc. after he
left Microsoft and Sujal Patel left RealNetworks to found
storage-company Isilon Systems Inc., which became EMC Corp.&#8217;s
biggest acquisition in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region also has a strong wireless heritage, owing to
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., which became ATT Wireless.
McCaw executive Tom Alberg co-founded the venture firm Madrona
Venture Group LLC, which has funded local firms such as Amazon,
Isilon and Gupta&#8217;s Apptio. T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) is based in
Bellevue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Seattle has developed a reputation for rain and
clouds, the region also offers natural beauty and outside
activities, Gupta said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Skiing is close by. There&#8217;s hiking and kayaking and the
landscape,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only negative is the weather.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Education Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the technology industry benefits the state, residents
and lawmakers should have one major concern, said Lazowska --
how poorly Washington does educating local students. The economy
was built by a labor force educated elsewhere, and Washington
rates 49th in the U.S. in the number of students who graduate
with bachelor&#8217;s degrees from public universities, he said. There
aren&#8217;t enough spots for university students in areas such as
computer science, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a question for the kids that grow up here,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Are they going to be first-tier participants in this
economy, or are they going to be washing people&#8217;s cars and
selling them cars?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Richter" date="Dec 20, 2013  7:33 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-20/gold-climbs-from-lowest-close-since-2010-as-goldman-sees-losses.html"><headline>Gold Climbs From Lowest Close Since 2010 as Goldman Sees Losses</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Gold rose from the lowest close in
more than three years to pare a weekly loss that was spurred by
the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to begin tapering stimulus.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that bullion&#8217;s decline isn&#8217;t over
as it heads for the biggest annual drop since 1981. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal for delivery in February rose 0.2 percent to
$1,195.70 an ounce by 7:13 a.m. on Comex in New York, bringing
the drop this week to 3.2 percent. Futures fell 3.4 percent
yesterday to $1,193.60, the lowest settlement since Aug. 3,
2010. The metal will drop to $1,050 by the end of next year,
Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold is heading for the first annual decline since 2000
after investors lost their faith in precious metals as a store
of value. The Fed said on Dec. 18 it will cut monthly asset
purchases, known as quantitative easing, to $75 billion from $85
billion. U.S. equities jumped to a record. Exchange-traded
products backed by bullion lost about $73 billion in value this
year, and mining companies wrote down at least $26 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold is now likely to grind lower throughout 2014,&#8221;
Jeffrey Currie, Goldman&#8217;s head of commodities research in New
York, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Much of the expected
price decline has been priced in as opposed to a more gentle
process as the Fed backs away from QE. When the gold market sees
these events, it usually tries to price it in immediately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion reached an intraday, 34-month low of $1,179.40 on
June 28, less than two weeks after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
concluded a policy meeting by saying bond buying would slow this
year and he&#8217;d end the program in 2014. Gold rebounded in the
next two months partly as the Fed chief said tapering will
depend on economic performance, including during testimony to
Congress on July 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paulson, Soros &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank&#8217;s decision this week means traders who
were still holding out for a rally are now &#8220;throwing in the
towel,&#8221; Frank Lesh, a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire John Paulson, the largest holder in the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest ETP, said on Nov. 20 that he personally
wouldn&#8217;t invest more money into his gold fund because it&#8217;s not
clear when inflation will quicken. Billionaires George Soros and
Daniel Loeb sold their entire investments in the SPDR Gold Trust
in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Money always goes where it&#8217;s well treated,&#8221; Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Newark, New Jersey-based
Prudential Financial Inc., which oversees more than $1 trillion,
said in an interview. &#8220;If you were doing well in equities, you
didn&#8217;t need to be in gold. As long as the economic data
continues to gain traction, we should see the dollar rise and
the Fed continue to taper. That&#8217;s typically negative for gold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bear Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1,195.46
an ounce after falling 2.5 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The region below $1,200 is where buying may be seen,
especially from the jewelry sector and other industrial users,&#8221;
said David Lennox, an analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney.
&#8220;There&#8217;s still a potential for gold to go lower as the market
expects further curbs on the QE.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold slumped into a bear market in April and has tumbled 29
percent this year. Some investors sold the metal amid low U.S.
inflation and the rally in equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials raised their assessment of the employment
outlook, predicting the jobless rate will fall as low as 6.3
percent by the end of next year, compared with a September
forecast of 6.4 percent to 6.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Projected Inflation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers may hold interest rates close to zero percent
even if unemployment falls below the 6.5 percent rate the
central bank had cited as a catalyst for an increase,
&#8220;especially if projected inflation continues to run below&#8221; the
2 percent goal, the Fed said a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold rose 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the
Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the financial system.
Futures have plunged 38 percent from a record $1,923.70 in
September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other speculators raised their net-long
position in Comex gold by 25 percent to&#160;33,449 futures and
option contracts in the week ended Dec. 10, government data
showed on Dec. 13. Short bets, which slid 6.7 percent to 74,312,
are within about 7 percent of the record in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold will probably reach a bottom by April as the Fed
&#8220;does whatever it takes&#8221; to reach its inflation target,
Michael Pento, the president of Pento Portfolio Strategies in
Colts Neck, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Equities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global equities have advanced to the highest in almost six
years, and U.S. inflation is running at 1.2 percent, almost half
the rate of the past decade. Gold ETP holdings slumped 32
percent this year, headed for the first drop since the products
started trading in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to $19.29 an
ounce. Platinum for April delivery gained 0.7 percent to
$1,329.30 an ounce and palladium for March delivery advanced 0.8
percent to $701.80 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. followed
competitors in banning traders from using chat rooms involving
counterparts at more than one bank as regulators probe alleged
currency-rigging, said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders will still be allowed to communicate one-on-one
with dealers at other firms to discuss business, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the decision
hasn&#8217;t been made public. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based firm, declined to comment on the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are clamping down on traders&#8217; use of chat rooms after
regulators used them as evidence in their investigations into
the manipulation of benchmark interest rates and foreign-exchange rates. JPMorgan Chase  Co., Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) prohibited multidealer
chat rooms this week. Deutsche Bank AG will widen a ban on such
forums to include its entire investment bank and transaction-banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in November it&#8217;s under investigation by
regulators probing foreign-exchange rates and is cooperating
with those inquiries. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank
are among almost a dozen firms that are reviewing millions of e-mails, instant messages and phone records of their foreign-exchange employees for evidence of potential manipulation,
people with knowledge of those probes have said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) lost an appeals
court ruling yesterday that clears sales by South Korea&#8217;s Hanmi
Pharm Co. (128940) of a competing copy of the heartburn treatment Nexium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca&#8217;s patent on the drug is limited to a
specifically named salt, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion posted on its
website. AstraZeneca had conceded that Hanmi&#8217;s version wouldn&#8217;t
infringe the patent if the appeals court ruled in that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexium is AstraZeneca&#8217;s second-biggest product, with sales
of $918 million in the third quarter. Hanmi and partner Amneal
Pharmaceuticals LLC have their own version of esomeprazole, the
active ingredient in Nexium. Pharmacists can&#8217;t automatically
swap out the Hanmi version for Nexium as they would if a generic
drug were on the market, London-based AstraZeneca said in a Dec.
17 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanmi had been banned from selling the drug pending the
appeal, although the Federal Circuit lifted that order and Hanmi
entered the market earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca researchers found that certain types of salt
worked better, and thus limited the patent to a specific class
of salts, the three-judge panel ruled. Nexium is the magnesium
salt of esomeprazole, while Hanmi&#8217;s version is the strontium
salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is AstraZeneca AB V. Hanmi USA, 13-1490, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft, Amazon Propel Washington to Most Innovative State &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most innovative state in the U.S. isn&#8217;t California,
home of Google Inc. (GOOG) and Stanford University, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It&#8217;s Washington, where Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
and Amazon.com Inc. are based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California came in second and Massachusetts third in the
ranking, which looked at criteria such as the percentage of

&lt;p&gt;Adidas AG (ADS), the German maker of athletic gear, filed a
trademark suit in the U.S. against more than 100 defendants,
named and unnamed, for offering fake versions of its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed in federal court in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, the company said its Adidas, Reebok and Mitchell  Ness
trademarks are being used without authorization on counterfeit
items sold on websites, most of which are run from China or
&#8220;other foreign jurisdictions with lax trademark enforcement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fakes include shoes, shorts, shirts, socks, hats,
jackets and track suits, according to the Dec. 16 complaint.
Herzogenaurach-based Adidas said the public is likely to assume
falsely that a connection exists between the sellers and the
maker of legitimate products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adidas asked the court to bar further unauthorized use of
its marks by the defendants, and to order the transfer of the
domain names for the sites accused of promoting and selling
counterfeit goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also requested money damages of $2 million for
each mark that is infringed and $100,000 each for pirated domain
names, along with all profits from the alleged infringement.
Adidas also requested awards of attorney fees and litigation
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Adidas AG v. adidasjeremyscottitalia.eu, 13-cv-62712, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cummins Sues T-Shirt Sellers for Logo Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummins Inc. (CMI), the Indiana-based maker of truck engines,
sued three named and 10 unnamed defendants for trademark
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company claims the defendants are making and selling T-shirts bearing its trademarks without permission. Ready-made
shirts are sold in kiosks in Indiana-area shopping malls, and
they are also printed on demand through the use of iron-on
transfers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummins owns trademark registrations for its logo for
purposes including use with clothing, the company said in its
Dec. 13 complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants are deliberately infringing the trademarks,
according to Columbus, Indiana-based Cummins. The company said
it&#8217;s being harmed and customers are being misled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummins asked the court for an order for the seizure and
destruction of all offending merchandise, including promotional
material and the iron-on transfers. The company also requested a
court order barring further infringement, and awards of money
damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company requested that the damages by tripled to punish
the defendants&#8217; for their actions, and also seeks to be awarded
all the profits derived from the alleged infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cummins Inc., v. T&#8217;shirt Factory, 1:13-cv-01972, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Indiana
(Indianapolis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Choice Foodservices Sues Competitor Nob Hill Over Website &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice Foodservices Inc., a provider of pre-ordered lunches
for schools and other institutions, sued a competitor and a
website developer for copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed Dec. 18 in federal court in San
Francisco, against Nob Hill Catering Inc., of San Carlos,
California, and Redwood City, California-based Elastic Teams
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company accuses Nob Hill of attempting to lure away its
customers by using a copycat Web design and telling school
administrators that Nob Hill&#8217;s new Lunchmaster website would
look &#8220;just like&#8221; Choice Foodservices&#8217;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nob Hill took Choice Foodservices&#8217; website to Elastic Teams
and instructed the developer to copy it, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice Foodservices said it sent Nob Hill a cease-and-desist notice and filed an order under the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which provided Web hosting
services, asking that the site be taken down. Amazon is not a
party to the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice Foodservices is seeking money damages, any profit
from the alleged infringement, attorney fees and litigation
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Nob Hill nor Elastic Teams responded immediately to
e-mailed requests for comment in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Choice Foodservices Inc. v. Nob Hill Catering
Inc., 13-cv-05872, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Iowa Governor Calls for More Security After Seed Theft Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following news of the arrest last week for trade secret
theft of a Chinese national who had attended a state dinner in
Iowa, Governor Terry Branstad said security at such events will
be tightened, the Sioux City Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man arrested by federal authorities was charged with
conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont Co. (DD)&#8217;s DuPont
Pioneer unit and Monsanto Co. (MON), the Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branstad said 1,600 people attended the dinner, and there&#8217;s
no way state authorities would have been able to screen the
guests well enough to detect everyone with a questionable
background, according to the Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governor, who frequently visits China, said news of the
plot to steal seed corn and take its secrets abroad could
present future challenges to U.S.-China relations, according to
the Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alicia Glen, head of urban
investment for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), was named deputy mayor
for housing and economic development by New York Mayor-elect
Bill de Blasio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glen, 47, who has run the department since 2002, arranged
government partnerships and financed more than $5 billion in
dozens of residential, mixed-use and commercial projects in the
U.S., according to Columbia University Business School, where
she&#8217;s an adjunct faculty member. The urban-investment group also
helped finance New York&#8217;s bike-sharing program, the largest in
the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alicia is a pioneer in developing innovative financing
and investments that have improved the lives of thousands of New
Yorkers,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Blasio campaigned for mayor promising to create 200,000
units of below-market &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; in the next 10
years. He also vowed to devote his policies to reducing wealth
inequality in a municipality where 46 percent of four-person
households had incomes of $46,000 or less -- about 150 percent
of the city&#8217;s 2011 poverty level. The richest 1 percent took
home 39 percent of all earnings in 2012, according to the Fiscal
Policy Institute, a New York-based research group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fresh Ideas&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to invest in key emerging industries and
affordable housing so New Yorkers have a better shot at working
their way into the middle class,&#8221; de Blasio, the first Democrat
elected mayor in two decades, said today in a news release.
&#8220;Alicia has the record, fresh ideas and bold outlook to make
that vision a reality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glen replaces Robert Steel, 62, another Goldman Sachs
alumnus, who has been Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#8217;s deputy mayor for
economic development since June 2010. The mayor is founder and
majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can do so much more to lift people up by investing in
our neighborhoods -- especially in the outer boroughs,&#8221; Glen
said in a statement. &#8220;We can raise the floor on workers&#8217; wages,
develop and preserve more affordable housing and give families a
shot to make it here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Goldman Sachs, Glen was New York&#8217;s assistant
commissioner for finance in the Housing, Preservation and
Development Department from 1998 to 2002, responsible for the
rehabilitation and construction of thousands of units of market-rate, moderate- and low-income housing, according to the
release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graduate of Amherst College in Massachusetts and Columbia
Law School, Glen served as an attorney with Brooklyn Legal
Services from 1993 to 1996. She lives on Manhattan&#8217;s Upper
West Side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asia Resource Minerals Plc, formerly
Bumi Plc, will appoint Chris Walton as chairman after splitting
from its Indonesian partner at the end of January to resolve a
dispute between founders that dragged on more than 1-1/2 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton, currently chairman of Goldenport Holdings Inc. and
Lothian Buses Plc, will join the coal producer&#8217;s board on Jan. 1
as an independent non-executive director before becoming
chairman, Asia Resource said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Salmon will become a non-executive director and Julian Horn-Smith, current deputy chairman, will step down Jan. 31, the
company said. Independent director Steve Shapiro won&#8217;t stand for
re-election at the next annual general meeting, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders approved a $501 million deal to separate from
Indonesia&#8217;s Bakrie family and change the name Dec. 18. The two
sides had been working on a split since last year as relations
between co-founder Nathaniel Rothschild and the family soured
amid financial probes in Asia and the U.K. The company plans to
return more than $400 million in proceeds to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-stage separation will see Chairman Samin Tan buying
23.8 percent of Bumi from the Bakries, making him the largest
holder with 47.6 percent. The family will then pay $501 million
for Bumi&#8217;s 29 percent of Jakarta-based PT Bumi Resources. (BUMI) The
deal leaves Asia Resource with 76 percent of PT Berau Coal. (BRAU) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan will remain a non-executive director, according to the
statement. The Bakries have paid a $50 million deposit into an
escrow account with Deutsche Bank AG, while an additional $228
million is needed by Jan. 24 to complete the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Texas in 2006 became the first
state to require advanced algebra for high-school students,
Governor Rick Perry said the policy would better prepare young
people for success in higher education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy worked: by 2011, local students who took
advanced algebra had higher average test scores, and fewer
graduates needed to enroll in remedial math classes in college.
Seventeen other states followed suit, and now about 75 percent
of U.S. high school students completed Algebra II in 2012, up
from less than half in 1986, said Jennifer Dounay Zinth, a
policy analyst at the Education Commission of the States, a
Denver-based research group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Texas is rolling back the requirement for Algebra II
under pressure from lawmakers, some educators and business trade
associations. They say advanced math skills aren&#8217;t needed for
many jobs, including those in the booming drilling industry. The
move is opposed by a coalition of corporate interests including
IBM Corp. (IBM), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and the Texas Association of
Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Texas is doing is absolutely counter the trend,&#8221;
said Linda Gojak, president of the National Council of
Mathematics Teachers and director of a math and science center
at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio. &#8220;Not
requiring Algebra II is a cop-out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perry&#8217;s Reversal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the rollback say businesses need more high-school graduates with vocational skills to take entry-level jobs
in welding, cosmetology and other fields. The emphasis on
preparing students for four-year colleges prompts too many
teenagers to bypass jobs that don&#8217;t require a university diploma
or to drop out of school, said Michael Meroney, an Austin
lobbyist who represents the Jobs for Texas Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two trade groups in the coalition, representing
hundreds of Texas businesses, lobbied the state legislature to
ease the math standard and cut back on end-of-course tests
required for graduation. Perry signed the bill in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governor, who supported the tighter algebra requirement
seven years ago, said the changes struck &#8220;an appropriate
balance between our needs for rigorous academic standards and
the student&#8217;s need for flexibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students are now required to complete four years of math,
including Algebra II, though about 20 percent opt out of the
class to earn a diploma that isn&#8217;t accepted by four-year
colleges. Under the new rules, Texas will require three years of
mathematics, with students who sign up for Algebra II earning a
new &#8220;distinguished&#8221; diploma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Educational Gateway &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas State Board of Education, an elected body that
oversees school policies, approved the changes in the graduation
requirements in November, with a final vote scheduled in
January, said Debbie Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the value of Algebra II is a decades-old debate, no
better alternative has emerged to help teenagers learn logical
thinking, said Richard Riley, who was U.S. Education Secretary
from 1992 to 2001. Among the states requiring the course for
graduation are Arkansas, Michigan and Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve always favored Algebra II as a gateway into higher
education and out of high school,&#8221; said Riley, a former
governor who now practices law in Greenville, South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boom in hydraulic fracturing that has contributed to
increased oil and natural-gas production means that the industry
faces shortages of welders, truckers and other workers who don&#8217;t
need college degrees, said Meroney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Algebra II isn&#8217;t necessarily a good indicator of success
in the future,&#8221; Meroney said. &#8220;How it became the panacea, I
don&#8217;t know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Behind &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas retreat on math standards comes at a time when
the U.S. appears to be falling behind on basic educational
metrics. Math literacy of U.S. students ranked 26th among 34
members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development in 2012, comparable with Hungary, Italy,
Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Sweden, and the
equivalent of at least two years of formal schooling behind top-ranked Shanghai, China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some major employers decry the decision to lower math
standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, with more than 6,000 workers in Austin, says the state
should be strengthening math and science requirements to help
erase a shortage of technology workers, said Sandy Dochen, the
company&#8217;s corporate affairs manager in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Prepared &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A kid from Muleshoe, Texas, who moves to Austin or
someone from the Rio Grande Valley who moves to Dallas needs to
be prepared for the world of work,&#8221; Dochen said. &#8220;In our haste
to make life a little more bearable and to emphasize good
teaching, let&#8217;s not get too soft on our competitiveness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math scores of Texas students on the ACT college entrance
exam improved over the past year, while the national average
declined, according to an August 2013 report by the national
testing service. Composite ACT scores were at an all-time high
for blacks, whites and Hispanics, according to the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board, a state agency in Austin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also said that 48 percent of Texas students were
deemed ready for college algebra, compared with 44 percent
nationally. The results came even as Texas ranked 49th among
U.S. states in 2012-2013 on per-pupil spending for public
schools, according to the National Education Association&#8217;s
annual study on school spending released last December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minimal Route &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s happening in Texas is an anomaly, there&#8217;s no
question about it,&#8221; said Bill Hammond, president of the Texas
Association of Business, based in Austin. &#8220;Too many kids will
figure out how to take the minimal program, or be pushed into
the program by administrators, and they will be prepared for
minimum-wage jobs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida in April joined Texas in dumping the Algebra II
requirement as it created separate diplomas for students seeking
technical training and those who intend to go to college.
Lawmakers had voted in 2010 to require Algebra II for all
students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Texas has been so good about ratcheting up its standards
and now the state has backed off,&#8221; said Susan Hull, director of
mathematics and national initiatives at the University of
Texas&#8217;s Dana Center, a research group. &#8220;Our fear is that other
states will back off, following Texas&#8217;s lead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese mobile phone makers asked
regulators to make sure Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s 5.44 billion euro
($7.5 billion) bid to take over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset business
doesn&#8217;t result in higher patent fees on wireless technology,
said two government officials with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. (000063) asked China&#8217;s
Ministry of Commerce to set conditions on the deal making sure
Microsoft doesn&#8217;t raise patent licensing fees afterward, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The ministry is
conducting an anti-monopoly review of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Nokia announced the planned transaction in
September as the two seek to join forces in the smart-phone
market where both have failed to gain traction amid the
dominance of Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone, and devices running Google
Inc.&#8217;s Android platform. Microsoft won European Union approval
for the bid on Dec. 4, while regulators said they would monitor
Nokia&#8217;s licensing practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Dai, a spokesman for Shenzhen-based ZTE, declined to
comment. Huang Man, a Shenzhen-based spokeswoman for Huawei, and
Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said they
didn&#8217;t immediately have information available on the matter.
Calls to the commerce ministry&#8217;s press office weren&#8217;t
immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Falcone&#8217;s LightSquared Inc.
will send a bankruptcy plan supported by Fortress Investment
Group LLC (FIG), JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Melody Capital Advisors LLC
to creditors to vote, LightSquared lawyer Matthew Barr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standalone plan will compete with two others, one of
which calls for selling most of the satellite-broadband
provder&#8217;s assets to an entity owned by Charlie Ergen, chairman
of LightSquared rival Dish Network Corp. (DISH) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in Manhattan today
allowed LightSquared to go forward with the new plan after a
conference with parties in chambers. She at first questioned the
company&#8217;s change in course, led by a special board committee,
after it previously backed an asset auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The entirety of the plan changed,&#8221; Chapman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standalone plan would include a $2.5 billion exit loan
and at least $1.25 billion in new equity contributions,
according to court papers filed Dec. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LightSquared&#8217;s prior plan rested on an auction for its main
wireless-spectrum assets, led by a $2.22 billion cash bid from
Ergen&#8217;s entity that was valued at $3.5 billion in total. Falcone
and Ergen have battled for control of LightSquared and Falcone&#8217;s
investment firm, Harbinger Capital Partners LLC, is suing Ergen
over the way he bought debt in the bankrupt company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court hearings to evaluate the competing plans will begin
Jan. 9, Barr told Chapman today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ergen Fund &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ad hoc group of lenders that own most of LightSquared&#8217;s
debt objected to the new plan. The group includes SP Special
Opportunities LLC, an Ergen-owned fund with $824.3 million of
LightSquared debt, according to court papers filed in July.
Harbinger and LightSquared say in lawsuits that Ergen shouldn&#8217;t
have been able to buy the debt because his two companies, Dish
and EchoStar Corp. (SATS), are direct competitors of LightSquared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LightSquared &#8220;would have the court and the parties
disregard everything that has happened over the past year-and-a-half&#8221; by avoiding Ergen&#8217;s bid, the lenders said in a court
filing. They described the new plan as &#8220;a classic bait-and-switch at the eleventh hour&#8221; that came after LightSquared
delayed deadlines set under Ergen&#8217;s bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new plan depends on regulatory approvals, as well as
&#8220;billions of dollars of financing&#8221; that LightSquared has
admitted it doesn&#8217;t yet have, according to the lenders. The
lenders would have $285 million more of debt if LightSquared
can&#8217;t implement the plan, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Secured Lenders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bank NA and Mast Capital Management LLC, which have
proposed the third competing plan, also objected. They said
LightSquared&#8217;s new proposal is intended to delay its
reorganization to benefit equity holders at the expense of
secured lenders like themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harbinger invested about $3 billion in Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared, which listed assets of $4.48 billion and
debt of $2.29 billion in its Chapter 11 filing. Harbinger, which
previously planned to submit a fourth alternative to creditors,
said today it will instead back LightSquared&#8217;s plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bank and Mast said they weren&#8217;t given enough time to
fully evaluate the new plan, and how its financing will be
repaid if the Federal Communications Commission fails to modify
LightSquared&#8217;s spectrum license. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company filed for bankruptcy last year after the FCC
blocked its initial proposal to use wireless spectrum,
concluding it would interfere with GPS navigation gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

Khodorkovsky a three-month visa, Swiss foreign ministry
spokeswoman Sonja Isella said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry, citing privacy concerns, declined to comment
further on the so-called Schengen visa, which allows
Khodorkovsky to travel freely in Switzerland and to other
European countries that have accepted and implemented the visa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50-year-old former owner of Yukos Oil Co. arrived in
Berlin Dec. 20 after being imprisoned for 10 years for tax
evasion and fraud. He and his supporters have maintained his
innocence. He last week said he would &#8220;most likely&#8221; settle in
Switzerland after consulting with his wife Inna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprise pardon announced by Russian President Vladimir
Putin Dec. 19 allowed Khodorkovsky to leave a penal colony near
the Finnish border eight months short of completing his 11-year
sentence and fly to Germany to await his family. He faces
possible additional charges and fines in Russia, while his
former business partner Platon Lebedev remains in prison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, could rise to $239 a share were all
its businesses to peak at once, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hintz is maintaining an outperform rating on shares of the
New York-based bank, with a price target of $190, he said today
in a report. His valuation for Goldman Sachs would reach the
$239 peak in a &#8220;utopian scenario&#8221; where revenue from stock
underwriting matched 2000, trading equaled 2007 and the firm cut
the percentage of compensation it paid to bankers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving this zenith &#8220;in the near term is unlikely and
would require a nirvana-like environment,&#8221; Hintz wrote in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said last month at
an investor conference that he&#8217;s been working to improve Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s return on equity, a measure of how well it invests
profits. The firm, which earned an ROE of about 10 percent so
far this year, is unlikely to surpass 15 percent, given new
regulations, according to Hintz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has climbed 38 percent this year to $175.70
at 11:58 a.m. in New York. It&#8217;s too early to sell the stock
because revenue for the investment-banking industry will
probably increase next year, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which before the financial crisis targeted a
long-term ROE of 20 percent, has declined to set a goal since
then, saying it wanted to see the effects of new rules. Recent
international regulations have required banks to hold more
equity capital, pushing down ROE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a bank spokeswoman, declined to comment on
Hintz&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean Meeker, the head of loan and
loan credit-default swap trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
has left the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank,
confirmed the departure in an e-mail. Meeker, who couldn&#8217;t be
reached for comment, joined Goldman Sachs in 2003 and was named
a managing director in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bahl, the head of U.S. high-yield corporate bond
trading, also left Goldman Sachs earlier this month, the bank
confirmed at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield, high-risk bonds are rated
below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a
borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) is again seeking to ban
sales in the U.S. of Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) products that were
at issue in the companies&#8217; first patent trial in California and
are now no longer on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone-maker asked U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San
Jose on Dec. 26 to bar sales of more than 20 models of
smartphones and tablets, such as the Galaxy S 4G and Galaxy Tab
10.1, that a jury last year found to infringe Apple&#8217;s patents.
After Koh rejected Apple&#8217;s bid for a sales ban on the infringing
Samsung devices after the 2012 verdict, a federal appeals court
on Nov. 18 cleared the way for the iPhone maker to pursue an
injunction targeting some of its rival&#8217;s products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Samsung&#8217;s claim that it has discontinued selling the
particular models found to infringe or design around Apple&#8217;s
patents in no way diminishes Apple&#8217;s need for injunctive
relief,&#8221; Apple argued in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington said that Apple could tailor its request to focus on
infringement of patents covering smartphone features, such as
multitouch technology, that were at issue in the 2012 trial. The
company can&#8217;t block Samsung products for infringing patented
designs, according to the opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s top two smartphone makers have spent hundreds
of millions of dollars in legal fees on claims of copying each
other&#8217;s features in a global battle to dominate the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Yates, a spokesman for Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung, declined to comment on Apple&#8217;s request. Apple, based in
Cupertino, California, has another case against Samsung going to
trial in March over newer models, including Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S
III. Should Koh, who is presiding over the case, impose a ban on
the older models, Apple might argue that newer phones are the
same products with new names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics
Co. Ltd., 11-cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). The appeals court case is Apple Inc. v.
Samsung Electronics Co., 13-1129, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Nokia Deal Said to Face China Limits on Patent Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese mobile-phone makers asked regulators to make sure
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s 5.44 billion euro ($7.5 billion) bid to take
over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset business doesn&#8217;t result in higher
patent fees on wireless technology, said two government
officials with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. (000063) asked China&#8217;s
Ministry of Commerce to set conditions on the deal making sure
Microsoft doesn&#8217;t raise patent licensing fees afterward, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The ministry is
conducting an anti-monopoly review of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Nokia announced the planned transaction in
September as the two seek to join forces in the smartphone
market, where both have failed to gain traction amid the
dominance of Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and devices running Google
Inc.&#8217;s Android platform. Microsoft won European Union approval
for the bid on Dec. 4, and regulators said they would monitor
Nokia&#8217;s licensing practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Dai, a spokesman for Shenzhen-based ZTE, declined to
comment. Huang Man, a Shenzhen-based spokeswoman for Huawei, and
Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said they
didn&#8217;t immediately have information available on the matter.
Calls to the commerce ministry&#8217;s press office weren&#8217;t
immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Samsung and Apple dominate global smartphone
shipments, Chinese vendors make up four of the top seven
producers worldwide, market researcher IDC reported in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung had a 31 percent share of the market in the third
quarter. Apple accounted for 13 percent, according to IDC.
Huawei ranked third with 4.8 percent, and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) was
fourth with 4.7 percent, IDC reported. The fifth-place producer
was South Korea&#8217;s LG Electronics Inc., followed closely by two
more Chinese companies: the Coolpad brand of China Wireless
Technologies Ltd. and then ZTE, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AmerisourceBergen Sues FFF Enterprises for Patent Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) sued a California competitor
accusing it of infringing a patent for a system for
pharmaceutical management and tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies provide pharmaceutical services. FFF
Enterprises Inc., of Temecula, California, is accused of
infringing AmersourceBergen&#8217;s U.S. patent 8,285,607. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed by the Chesterbrook,
Pennsylvania-based company, FFF Enterprises&#8217; Verified Cabinet
and Verified Inventory Program infringe the patent, which was
issued in October 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmerisourceBergen said it&#8217;s harmed by FFF Enterprises&#8217;
actions and asked the federal court in Sherman, Texas, to bar
infringing activities by the California company.
AmerisourceBergen also seeks awards of money damages and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFF Enterprises didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed
request for comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group Inc. v. FFF
Enterprises, 13-cv-00755, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Texas (Sherman). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Asics Files Second Suit Over Olympic Athlete&#8217;s Shoe Contract &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asics Corp. (7936)&#8217;s Asics America group filed another trademark
lawsuit stemming from a dispute over shoes worn by Olympic gold
medalist Jordan Burroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asics of Hyogo, Japan, has a contract with Burroughs, who
won a wrestling gold medal in the London Olympic Games in 2012,
according to the complaint filed Dec. 23 in federal court in
Santa Ana, California. Burroughs agreed to endorse Asics
products, and the Japanese company holds rights to use the
athlete&#8217;s name, image and likeness to promote its clothing and
line of shoes, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbus, Ohio-based Lutte Licensing Group, which
represents athletes and athletic brands related to mixed martial
arts, claimed that Asics was interfering with its relationship
with Burroughs. Asics then filed the initial suit in the same
federal court. The case was settled in February, permitting
Burroughs to endorse Asics shoes without interference from
Lutte, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the Japanese company began a marketing campaign
for Burroughs signature wrestling shoes, &#8220;JB Elite.&#8221; Lutte
then began its own campaign for a Jordan Burroughs signature
wrestling shoe that looks like the Asics shoe, the company said
in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being sent a cease-and-desist letter by counsel for
Asics, Lutte continued to market its Burroughs wrestling shoe,
including through Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s social media site, Asics
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutte didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mail sent through
its Facebook page seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asics asked the court to bar Lutte from marketing and
selling its version of Burroughs&#8217;s shoe, and for awards of money
damages, including profits Lutte derived from the alleged
infringement. The company also asked for awards of extra damages
to punish Lutte for its actions and for attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Asics America Corp. v. Lutte Licensing Group
LLC, 8:13-cv-01993, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Santa Ana). The earlier case is Asics America Corp.
v. Lutte Licensing Group LLC, 12-cv-00592, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pub Owner Sued in Limerick Court Over Royalty Payments, License &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners of an Irish pub were sued in Limerick Circuit Court
for copyright infringement, Ireland&#8217;s Limerick Leader reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irish Music Rights Organization filed the lawsuit
claiming that Bourke&#8217;s Bar, on Limerick&#8217;s Catherine Street,
lacks a license permitting the performance of live and recorded
music and has failed to pay more than 4,000 Euros ($5,500) in
royalties, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pub&#8217;s license was revoked in May for not paying
royalties, according to the Leader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counsel for the pub owners told the court his clients
disputed the amount the rights group said was owed and sought a
delay in the court proceedings to prepare a defense to the
charges, the Leader reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest provider of computing services, hasn&#8217;t convinced investors that it can pull out of a sales slump, sending the stock to its first annual decline since the financial crisis in 2008. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as the company boosted its dividend and added about $20 billion to its buyback plan, the stock became the only loser in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) this year. The shares dropped 2.1 percent this year, compared with a 26 percent gain for the index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue has fallen for six straight quarters, dragged down by sluggish demand for computer hardware. That&#8217;s forced Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty to rely on job cuts, tax gains and asset sales to keep increasing earnings per share. Technology investors would prefer a company that&#8217;s growing, said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think investors are going to be paying up for financially engineered EPS,&#8221; said Lowenstein, who helps oversee $17 billion in assets. He no longer holds IBM shares. &#8220;In tech, most people want to see top-line growth, and IBM is just not part of that trend. IBM is part of the cluster of old tech companies considered dinosaurs of yesteryear.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technology giant, based in Armonk, New York, is coping with an industrywide transition into the cloud era, where information is stored online instead of onsite. While IBM is getting an increasing amount of revenue from cloud services, the shift has spawned a new crop of competitors and eroded demand for traditional hardware and services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;On Target &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the company remains on target to reach $20 in adjusted earnings per share in 2015, up from $15.25 last year. Cost reductions and a shift into more profitable businesses have helped maintain the growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael Fay, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment on the stock trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company embarked on a restructuring program this year, cutting jobs globally. More than 3,300 workers were dismissed in the U.S. and Canada alone, according to Alliance@IBM, an employee group. Some U.S. contract workers also were ordered to lessen their hours, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, a more favorable tax rate contributed 30 cents a share to earnings, said David Grossman, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus  Co., in a note at the time. That helped the company boost earnings to $3.99 a share, excluding some items -- 3 cents more than the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Increasingly Concerned &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as earnings per share grew, the stock continued to fall, signaling that investors were increasingly concerned that IBM&#8217;s strategy was failing to produce growth, said Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s now coming to a point where they are almost doing everything they can to get to that earnings number,&#8221; Garcha said. He downgraded IBM&#8217;s stock to the equivalent of a sell rating this year. &#8220;They need to start thinking about some serious reinvestments and repositioning the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Half of the analysts who covered IBM recommended buying it at the beginning of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That has fallen to less than a third today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rometty has identified the nascent cloud industry as one of IBM&#8217;s biggest growth opportunities. In her biggest acquisition since taking over as CEO at the beginning of 2012, IBM bought cloud-computing storage company SoftLayer Technologies Inc. this year -- paying about $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cloud Opportunity &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM reported more than $1 billion in sales from cloud services last quarter, the first time it has disclosed revenue from that segment. That wasn&#8217;t enough to keep total sales from falling for a sixth straight quarter, sending the stock sliding in October to a two-year low. IBM responded with another share buyback increase, adding $15 billion to the program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Competitors, meanwhile, have been building their own cloud offerings. Oracle Corp. has spent about $50 billion to acquire roughly 100 companies over the past decade, helping it adjust to the changing industry. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which Gartner Inc. sees as the cloud leader, defeated IBM for a $600 million government cloud-computing contract this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oracle shares have gained 15 percent this year, while Amazon&#8217;s stock has surged 59 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Losing Weight &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM was ousted from the top spot in the price-weighted Dow in September, when the index underwent its biggest reshuffling in almost a decade. The benchmark added Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Nike Inc. and Visa Inc. -- in part to reduce IBM&#8217;s influence, according to David Blitzer, chairman of the SP Dow Jones index committee. The move means the Dow will be less susceptible to share price swings in IBM. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow&#8217;s changes had little effect on IBM shares, which had already begun their 2013 decline before the rebalancing, having fallen 2.6 percent at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares rose less than 1 percent to $187.57 today at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM still counts some big supporters in its corner, including billionaire Warren Buffett, whose investment company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. was IBM&#8217;s biggest shareholder as of September. The company&#8217;s price-to-earnings ratio hit a four-year low of 11 earlier this month and is now at 12, a discount to the Dow&#8217;s 16. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Information Technology Index, an industry benchmark, trades even higher at about 18. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They will have record per-share earnings this year,&#8221; Buffett said in an interview on the &#8220;Charlie Rose&#8221; show on PBS in October. &#8220;That can be disappointing if you expected more. But it is not a bad record, believe me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM may also gain ground in the cloud-computing business, which is still in its early stages, said Joe Foresi, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC who has a neutral rating on the shares. The challenge is to keep up with the changing technology industry while maintaining the earnings trajectory investors have come to expect, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM has to show that they can grow,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Stephen Bierman" date="Jan 02, 2014  7:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-02/exxon-s-russia-ambitions-show-drilling-trumps-obama-putin-spats.html"><headline>Exxon Russia Ambitions Show Oil Trumps Obama-Putin Spats</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;As Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin
argue over human rights in Russia and the fate of fugitive U.S.
intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, the countries&#8217; biggest oil
companies are preparing to drill for giant discoveries together
in the Arctic Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OAO Rosneft (ROSN) are set to start their
first Arctic well this year, targeting a deposit that may hold
more oil than Norway&#8217;s North Sea. It will kick off a series of
landmark projects and cement an alliance begun in 2011. They
also plan to frack shale fields in Siberia, sink a deep-water
well in the Black Sea and build a natural-gas export terminal in
Russia&#8217;s Far East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a unique partnership,&#8221; Glenn Waller, Exxon&#8217;s
Russian chief, said in an interview in Moscow. &#8220;They have the
world&#8217;s biggest reserves and we have the largest market
capitalization.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deepening alliance shows the two governments&#8217; fractious
relationship is no bar to America&#8217;s most valuable energy company
investing billions in Russia. For Rosneft Chief Executive
Officer Igor Sechin, the Irving, Texas-based company brings
financial heft and the expertise needed to drill offshore in
some of the world&#8217;s harshest conditions for rigs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a whole stack of reasons why it&#8217;s good that
Rosneft is working with Exxon,&#8221; said Richard Sakwa, an
associate fellow at Chatham House in London, who writes on
Russia&#8217;s oil industry. &#8220;There&#8217;s technology and management.
Between Sechin and Exxon, there&#8217;s a degree of trust being built
up that can be nothing but to the good&#8221; to both and to Russia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average pay for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s top U.K. bankers rose 77 percent in 2012 even as it declined at U.S.-based peers amid calls from governments and the public to reduce executive compensation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid an average of $4.67 million in 2012 to U.K. employees deemed by regulators as risk-takers, as well as their managers, up from $2.64 million in 2011, according to figures disclosed by the firm. For similar staff at Citigroup Inc. (C), average pay climbed 9 percent to $2.38 million. At Bank of America Corp. (BAC) it fell 2 percent to $2.36 million, and at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) it slid 3 percent to $3.4 million, totals disclosed separately show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks reported their figures for 2012 as recently as this week under European disclosure rules that are part of a regulatory push to alter pay practices blamed for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis. The filings show a divergence between Goldman Sachs, which shrank headcount while boosting revenue 19 percent in 2012, and competitors such as JPMorgan, which lost more than $6.2 billion that year on botched derivatives bets by London traders. Figures for 2013 won&#8217;t be released until later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which has been
told by U.S. regulators to bolster money-laundering safeguards,
has stopped clearing dollar transfers for Latvian lenders,
according to the Baltic nation&#8217;s banking association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latvia, a hub for ex-Soviet cash, adopted the euro Jan. 1,
focusing the spotlight on $8 billion of non-resident deposits
and claims by Global Witness, a London-based anti-corruption
campaign group, that regulation and client vetting aren&#8217;t
adequate. U.S. regulators have reprimanded lenders including
JPMorgan for lax controls over transfers that could allow
terrorists and drug rings to move money around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exit of the U.S.&#8217;s largest bank leaves Deutsche Bank AG
and Commerzbank AG as the only two Western lenders Latvian banks
can use for international dollar transfers. Some local banks
rely on lenders in Russia or Ukraine who have correspondent
accounts with a U.S. partner to clear dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a
consent order in January 2013 after finding JPMorgan &#8220;has an
inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing&#8221;
for anti-money-laundering compliance. The bank &#8220;failed to
identify significant volumes of suspicious activity&#8221; and to
file reports alerting regulators, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing in consenting to
the regulatory orders at the time, saying in a statement that
the bank has been &#8220; working hard to fully remediate the issues
identified in the consent order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials including Latvian central bank Governor Ilmars
Rimsevics say lenders are being closely monitored. While
regulators fined a local bank in June the maximum 100,000 lati
($195,000) for transferring money in Russia&#8217;s biggest known tax
fraud, they didn&#8217;t name the bank in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as imposing more restrictions on demand deposits
and reconsidering tax incentives that bolster non-resident
deposits, the government may also strengthen law-enforcement
efforts to combat money laundering, according to a June letter
published on the Latvian Finance Ministry&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latvia&#8217;s 27 banks had assets of about 20 billion lati in
the third quarter, banking association data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finra to Focus on Recidivist Brokers, Cybersecurity in 2014 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street&#8217;s
self-funded overseer, released its regulatory and examination
priorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group plans to create an enforcement team to
investigate claims against brokers with a history of customer
complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra&#8217;s examinations of the largest brokers this year will
include liquidity stress tests, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities for the coming year include broker disclosures
about interest-rate sensitive securities, fees for rolling over
401(k) accounts to IRAs, due diligence conducted by brokers in
assuring investors meet net-income and wealth thresholds for
investing in privately offered securities, the IPO market, money
laundering, crowd funding portals, muni advisers and the
advertising of private placements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Germany to Tighten Tax Evasion Declaration, Sueddeutsche Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany wants to tighten conditions for individuals who
declare tax evasion to avoid prosecution, Sueddeutsche Zeitung
reported, citing Carsten Kuehl, a government official in the
state of Rhineland-Palatinate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals will have to declare all tax evaded over the
past 10 years rather than the current five years, the newspaper
reported, citing Kuehl&#8217;s statement in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of individuals who declared tax evasion tripled
to almost 25,000 last year, Sueddeutsche reported, citing its
own survey of German states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cathay United Bank Gets FSC Approval for Shanghai FTZ Sub-Branch &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathay United Bank obtained approval from Taiwan&#8217;s
Financial Supervisory Commission for a sub-branch in the
Shanghai free trade zone, the regulator said in a statement on
its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender is the first local bank to receive approval from
the FSC to establish a presence in the China free-trade zone,
the regulator said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSC cleared the bank to apply for a sub-branch with
Chinese regulators, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saudi Electricity to Offer Investment Sukuk Jan. 9 to Feb. 27 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Electricity (SECO) Co., which generates and distributes
electricity throughout Saudi Arabia, will offer investment sukuk
from Jan. 9 to Feb. 27, according to a statement made to the
Saudi bourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of each unit of the investment sukuk, a form of
Shariah-compliant investing, is to 1m riyals, the company said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tenor, size of sale, and profit distributions are to be
based on demand. The investment sukuk will be unsecured, the
company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Electricity has hired HSBC Saudi Arabia and Saudi
Fransi Capital to manage the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RBS Settles $1.2 Million Bonus Fight With Former Risk Chief &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc settled lawsuits with Gary
Cottle, the former head of risk at its investment banking
division, over a 700,000-pound ($1.2 million) bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS said Cottle didn&#8217;t deserve the final portion of the
2009 award because he turned down alternative jobs before
leaving the Edinburgh-based bank in 2011, according to its
London lawsuit that sought to block the payment. The terms of
the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed by the court or either party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cottle argued that he fell out of favor with RBS after
raising concerns about a &#8220;toxic&#8221; debt deal and was never
offered a suitable replacement role. The former risk officer,
who is now head of global markets for Europe at Nomura Holdings
Inc., also sued RBS. Cottle declined to comment on the
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties have resolved their differences,&#8221; said Sarah
Small, a spokeswoman for RBS. &#8220;Neither party will make any
further public statement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in
November the government would separate RBS&#8217;s toxic assets in an
internal &#8220;bad bank&#8221; as it seeks an exit for its 81 percent
stake. The lender has made five consecutive years of annual
losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) v. Cottle,
12-1948, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC&#8217;s Cohen Focus of Insider Trial as Martoma Rebuffs U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathew Martoma may have the one thing prosecutors have been
unable to find in their probe of SAC Capital Advisors LP: a
direct link between founder Steven Cohen and insider trading.
Having refused to cooperate, Martoma now faces trial for what
the government claims was the biggest illegal trade in U.S.
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury selection in the prosecution of the ex-SAC portfolio
manager is set for Jan. 6, barring a last-minute plea deal. The
trial is expected to take three weeks. He is accused of
benefitting the hedge fund by $276 million in trades of Wyeth
and Elan Corp., using secret tips from a doctor supervising
trials of an Alzheimer&#8217;s drug. The U.S. said SAC reversed a
bullish stance on the drugmakers, liquidating a $700 million
position and selling the stocks short a few days after a 20-minute phone call between Martoma and Cohen in July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure on Martoma, 39, to cooperate with the probe
included questioning by FBI agents at his home and an indictment
unsealed in 2012 on the Friday before Christmas. A steady
drumbeat of convictions of insider traders in the probe,
including SAC portfolio manager Michael Steinberg last month,
may have further ratcheted up the pressure ahead of the trial
next week in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen, who hasn&#8217;t been charged, has said he did nothing
wrong. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard
Verbinnen  Co., declined to comment on the Martoma trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mathew continues to fight the charges and is preparing
for trial,&#8221; his lawyer, Richard Strassberg, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, SAC agreed to plead guilty to securities fraud
and end its investment advisory business as part of a record
$1.8 billion settlement of the government&#8217;s investigation of
insider trading at the firm. The agreement must be approved by a
judge before it can take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If convicted, Martoma, who has pleaded not guilty, faces as
long as 20 years in prison on each of two securities-fraud
counts and five years for a single conspiracy charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Steinberg, 12-cr-00121, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel&#8217;s Sheshinski Sees No Taboo in Changing Resources Taxation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel has the right to revise its tax policies, said the
economist leading a review of the country&#8217;s natural resources
royalties and tax structure, parrying allegations that a
changing regulatory environment would drive away investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government-appointed panel led by economics professor
emeritus Eytan Sheshinski of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem
is due to hold a public hearing on the matter next week. Its
recommendations will reverberate at Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL), which
harvests Dead Sea minerals to make fertilizers, and whose chief
executive, Stefan Borgas, has warned that &#8220;frequent and
unplanned regulation&#8221; is &#8220;poison&#8221; for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments have the right to modify their tax policies,
because while stability and credibility are a &#8220;worthy cause&#8221;,
they must be weighed against other objectives, such as ensuring
the public a fair share of the profits, Sheshinski said.
&#8220;Changing the status quo should not be taboo.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &#8220;firms will have to receive a fair
return on their investment to provide incentives for them to
continue operation in the country,&#8221; he said. The panel will
consider market conditions and sector risks when making its
recommendations, Sheshinski said. Proposals are due in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Yair Lapid appointed the review committee
last June with a mandate to ensure the public receives its due
from natural resources. Recommendations by another Sheshinski-led committee three years ago were the foundation for the
government&#8217;s decision to more than double its share of gas and
oil profits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South African Police Service is
increasing its presence along the southern Cape&#8217;s coast line, an
area known for its beaches and great white sharks, after almost
$10 million of cocaine washed ashore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are increasing visibility by means of our deployment
on sea, as well as on land, and we are trying to get air support
as well, either by helicopter or airplane, to patrol the seas,&#8221;
police spokesman Malcolm Pojie said by phone from the town of
Knysna today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four batches of cocaine bricks, weighing about 100
kilograms (220 pounds) in total, have been found on beaches or
just offshore since Dec. 25 near Mossel Bay in an area about 343
kilometers (213 miles) east of Cape Town where thousands of
South Africans are spending the summer holidays, Pojie said. The
latest find was on the beach between Klein Brak River and
Hartenbos on New Years&#8217; Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the results are positive that this is pure cocaine, it
could have an estimated value of about 100 million rand,&#8221; or
about $10 million, Pojie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each batch of about 25 cocaine bricks was sealed in a black
bag and attached to a blue drum, which helped it to float, Pojie
said. While the origin of the drugs is not clear, it&#8217;s possible
that a passing ship dropped the cocaine in the sea for someone
to pick up, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The finds were sent to our laboratory in Cape Town to be
analyzed and tested and that can of course assist us to
determine the origin of the drugs,&#8221; Pojie said. &lt;/p&gt;
