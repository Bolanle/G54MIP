&lt;p&gt;In the hands of England&#8217;s
government-run health system, Hinchingbrooke Hospital was called
&#8220;a basket case&#8221; in Parliament. Ali Parsa wants to show that
private enterprise can do a better job than the state in
providing medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsa, an ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, wants to
change how U.K. hospitals are run, right down to the meals
served to patients. He&#8217;s chief executive officer of Circle
Holdings Plc (CIRC), which in February became the first for-profit firm
to take over a National Health Service hospital when it began
managing Hinchingbrooke in Huntingdon, England. Circle last
month raised 46 million pounds ($72.3 million) in part to help
the company pursue contracts to manage more NHS sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People told us you can never run a hospital a different
way; you can never change the way NHS staff work,&#8221; Parsa, 47,
says in an interview at the company&#8217;s London headquarters. &#8220;We
have fundamentally changed them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. debates what role government should have in
health care, the U.K. is slowly putting some pieces of its 64-
year-old state-run health system into private hands to try to
improve patient care and reduce costs. Prime Minister David
Cameron says more choice and competition are needed to improve
the NHS. Instilling a profit motive in a government-owned
hospital means patient needs won&#8217;t come first, said Allyson
Pollock, a researcher at Queen Mary, University of London who
opposes privatization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s immoral, it&#8217;s obscene,&#8221; she said in an interview.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a system that&#8217;s going to be built on greed, not need.
It&#8217;s the antithesis of everything that we worked for for 64
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emergency-Room Waits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a medical point of view, Parsa appears to be doing
something right. Emergency-room waits at Hinchingbrooke, 70
miles north of London, have improved from the county&#8217;s worst to
its best and lengths of stay for people getting non-urgent
orthopedic care have dropped 38 percent, freeing up beds. The
company says serious incidents, such as medication errors or
patient falls, fell by 80 percent in May. Circle also will save
1.5 million pounds on purchasing this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle&#8217;s bid for the 10-year contract to run Hinchingbrooke
beat 18 others. The company gets the first 2 million pounds of
profit from any surplus, and a percentage above that amount,
which the union that represents hospital workers has said will
benefit the company and its shareholders at patients&#8217; expense.
Circle must also fund the first 5 million pounds of any loss, a
risk at a hospital that already has 40 million pounds of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patient Perks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle isn&#8217;t new to the NHS. Its two-year-old private
hospital near Bath serves as many NHS patients as private
patients -- at NHS prices. Circle has run the U.K.&#8217;s largest
treatment center in Nottingham since 2008. The company plans to
open another private hospital in Reading in August or September
and has sites for more clinics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsa says it&#8217;s possible not only to provide quality care
and a pleasant patient experience for rich and poor patients
alike, but to make money in the process. At the core of the
business strategy is increased efficiency, primarily through
shorter hospital stays. Patient perks, like inexpensive parking
and food prepared by a chef from a Michelin-starred eatery,
ensure that hospital beds stay full with more rapid turnover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bath, Circle hired a hotel manager and chef from nearby
Lucknam Park Hotel  Spa, a five-star country house hotel.
People from the local village of Peasedown celebrate their
birthdays in the hospital cafe, says Shelagh Meldrum, the
hospital manager. No wonder: A recent lunch served to patients
consisted of scallops and crab salad over dill and cucumber,
followed by a gently grilled salmon main course and lemon posset
for dessert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxi driver Dave McGlennon had a cyst removed from a finger
last year at the hospital. A high point: the food. &#8220;I had a ham
and cheese omelette with potato wedges&#8221; after surgery,
McGlennon says. &#8220;It was to die for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially, Circle has yet to succeed. The company had
revenue of 75 million pounds last year and has lost money every
year since it was founded in 2004. Circle&#8217;s stock has plunged 51
percent to 75 pence since its June 2011 initial public offering,
giving the company a market value of 98 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publicly traded company owns 50.1 percent of a
partnership that operates the hospitals and clinics. Parsa and
institutional investors Lansdowne Partners, BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Odey
Asset Management and Invesco Perpetual are among the
shareholders. Employees, including doctors, own the other 49.9
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taxpayer Funded &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle&#8217;s approach to running a hospital is a radical
departure for the NHS. The government created the agency in
1948, bringing hospitals, doctors and other health-care
providers into one taxpayer-funded medical system for all. The
network now includes 257 general acute-care hospitals like
Hinchingbrooke. About 1.7 million people work for the NHS, which
provides free care for the U.K.&#8217;s 62 million residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A network of three NHS hospitals in South London is holding
talks with the Department of Health about being put under the
control of administrators because it has racked up more debt
than it can pay. The department said June 25 that more than 60
other hospitals may be financially unsustainable and require
restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS budget at its inception was 437 million pounds, or
9 billion pounds at today&#8217;s value, according to the department.
In the current fiscal year, the system will spend 106 billion
pounds. The government has approved an NHS overhaul with a goal
of saving 15 billion to 20 billion pounds on the annual budget
in the four years to 2014-15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partial Strike &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overhaul prompted the British Medical Association,
which represents two-thirds of practicing doctors, to declare a
partial strike for June 21, its first work stoppage since 1975. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the public looks at the U.S. health system and
doesn&#8217;t want to see big encroachment of the private sector in
the British health system,&#8221; said Diane Abbott, a member of
Parliament who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on health
matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending the Circle deal for Hinchingbrooke in Parliament
last year, the Department of Health&#8217;s undersecretary of state,
Frederick Curzon, said: &#8220;This is a hospital that in common
parlance could be described as a financial and clinical basket
case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle&#8217;s bells-and-whistles approach may be a hit with
patients like McGlennon. Skeptics say the company won&#8217;t be
judged on its cuisine as much as on the quality of its care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Clinical Results&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t personally go to a hospital based on Michelin-
starred food; I go to a hospital for clinical results,&#8221; says
Andrew Hine, a partner at consulting firm KPMG in London and a
former NHS hospital executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Circle&#8217;s Nottingham facility, Parsa says patients are
eight times less likely to have to return to the operating room
within four weeks. In 2010-11, the facility had no resistant
Staphylococcus aureus or health-care acquired Clostridium
difficile cases. On the financial side, Parsa said the center
has made an 18 percent annual compound productivity gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says other U.K. hospitals can benefit from Circle&#8217;s
approach. &#8220;If we can deliver what we deliver at NHS prices, why
can&#8217;t everybody else?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock markets can soar or falter in
an instant. One day the European debt crisis is receding, the
next day the region&#8217;s on the brink of disaster. Economic
statistics never give investors the whole picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these jarring times, Bloomberg Markets magazine in its
August issue asked six billionaires for their advice on which
stocks might outperform the market in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their responses showed much disagreement: Peter Hargreaves,
the largest shareholder of Hargreaves Lansdown Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s
biggest retail broker, said water, health care and technology
stocks will outperform in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino mogul Phil Ruffin, who controls the Treasure Island
Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, and Mark Cuban, the owner of the
Dallas Mavericks basketball team, both say to avoid stocks
unless you have better information than the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pay off debt,&#8221; says Cuban. &#8220;Search online for the best
price on items your household needs. Pay local merchants in
cash, while still paying sales tax. You&#8217;ll never lose money or
sleep.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Catsimatidis, the owner of Red Apple Group Inc., which
counts a Pennsylvania oil refinery and the Gristedes grocery
store chain in New York City among its assets, says betting on
banking stocks like JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will pay off. &lt;/p&gt;

of crude oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the private-
jet maker owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Onex Corp. (OCX),
filed a plan to reorganize that would give control of the
company to secured creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holders of secured debt valued at $921.6 million would get
81 percent of the new common stock in the reorganized company,
according to the plan filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan June 30. Estimated recoveries for unsecured creditors
and holders of subordinated notes weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other interests in the company would be canceled, Hawker
said, leaving nothing for existing shareholders, including funds
affiliated with New York-based Goldman Sachs and Onex. Each
owned 49 percent of Hawker stock. Former managers and directors
held the remainder, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Wichita, Kansas, indicated it would
borrow an unspecified amount to exit court protection and repay
a $400 million loan that financed operations while in
bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With a sustainable capital structure aligned with the
debtors&#8217; revised business plan and adequate operating liquidity,
the reorganized debtors will be positioned to compete more
effectively,&#8221; Hawker said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debt Reduced &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outset of its Chapter 11 case on May 3, the
majority of Hawker&#8217;s noteholders had agreed to a rough plan that
would reduce its $2.6 billion in debt. The company&#8217;s initial
proposal drew support from more than two-thirds of its lenders
and senior bond debt holders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank&#8217;s private-equity arm, and Toronto-based Onex bought Hawker
in 2007 for $3.3 billion. Hawker reported net losses totaling
more than $900 million in the past two years as U.S. military
contracts and plane sales declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawker&#8217;s aircraft include the Hawker 4000 business jet and
the Beechcraft King Air propjet. Sales last year fell
13 percent from a year earlier to $2.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliates of GS Capital Partners VI LP and Onex Partners
II LP own about $159.4 million of Hawker notes, according to an
April filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Hawker Beechcraft Inc., 12-11873, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global inflation is poised to fall
below central-bank targets for the first time since 2010,
providing fuel for increased consumer spending and room for
monetary stimulus, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0f 26 central banks the firm monitors that have inflation
targets, prices will decline below them at 23 by year-end,
Joseph Lupton and David Hensley, New York-based economists,
wrote in a note June 29. Global consumer price inflation may
slide to 2.1 percent by the end of 2012, half a percentage point
lower than the average central-bank target, they wrote. The drop
in oil prices may accelerate the decline, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purchasing-power lift is an important cushion to
weakening elsewhere,&#8221; Lupton said in a phone interview. &#8220;It
provides a cushion not only to the real purchasing power of
labor income, but it also increases the purchasing power of
stock market gains. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to
completely offset the softening in the labor market in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for August delivery dropped 27 percent from May
1, when it closed at $106.16 a barrel in New York, to June 28.
It traded yesterday at $83.66, down 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation-linked global government bonds lost 0.82 percent
last month, the most since November 2010, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch bond index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With inflation finally moving back below targets, central
banks are likely to shift their attention more fully to the
increase in downside growth risks in recent months,&#8221; the
JPMorgan economists wrote. &#8220;This is most clear in the emerging
markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economists wrote that they used a &#8220;top-down global
model&#8221; of headline inflation designed to gauge the impact of
commodity prices on inflation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s non-operating Quigley
Co. unit filed a new plan to exit bankruptcy that bars all
asbestos claims against the two companies, except some made
against Pfizer under Pennsylvania law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, in bankruptcy since 2004, filed the sixth version
of its plan June 29. The new plan addresses an April appeals
court ruling on how Pfizer can use Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy to
protect itself from asbestos claims. The court found that law
firm Peter G. Angelos PC can sue Pfizer based on manufacturer
liability under Pennsylvania law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new plan&#8217;s exception for claims under Pennsylvania law
would be &#8220;null and void&#8221; if the Second Circuit&#8217;s decision is
modified upon rehearing or on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court,
Quigley said in the plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. The company will seek plan approval from U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein at a hearing set for Aug. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan builds on a fifth version, under which New York-
based Pfizer increased contributions to a proposed trust into
which all future asbestos lawsuits against the two companies
would be channeled. Such &#8220;channeling injunctions&#8221; allow
companies with ongoing liabilities to exit bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the Quigley bankruptcy proceeding is
moving forward,&#8221; Pfizer spokesman Christopher Loder said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stopped Operations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968. The unit stopped most operations
in 1992 and filed for bankruptcy in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, has said it never
made or sold any Quigley products. Some claimants haven&#8217;t
released Pfizer from alleged &#8220;derivative liability,&#8221; according
to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the sixth amended plan, Pfizer will contribute $260
million in cash to a trust that will pay most future asbestos
claims brought against it and Quigley. Pfizer will also forgive
a secured claim of $95 million against Quigley, a loan of $19
million to Quigley, and an unsecured claim of $33 million. It
will also contribute insurance benefits that cover asbestos
personal injury claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will also contribute a property leased to a
distributor of Anheuser-Busch in Orange County, California, to
pay future asbestos claims. The property has an estimated value
of $43.6 million and produced cash flow of $1.9 million in the
first 12 months since Pfizer acquired it, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appealed Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April ruling from an appeals court had come after
Pfizer had appealed a ruling that found the bankruptcy didn&#8217;t
bar certain lawsuits against the drug company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelos began bringing lawsuits against Pfizer in 1999,
saying that because the drug company&#8217;s logo appeared on Quigley
products, it should have liability for the asbestos-containing
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy, Bernstein has said that Pfizer
manipulated the bankruptcy process, and refused to allow Quigley
to exit Chapter 11 court protection under a deal with Pfizer.
The company has also been at odds with a committee of creditors
known as the &#8220;Ad Hoc Committee of Tort Victims,&#8221; which asked
in October 2010 to have Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy dismissed so it
could bring tort claims, which are otherwise blocked by
bankruptcy law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can&#8217;t Sue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department, had
asked the bankruptcy court to end Quigley&#8217;s Chapter 11, citing
the fact that creditors alleging asbestos-related health issues
have been unable to sue New York-based Pfizer during the case,
and many of them have died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. In November, Pfizer reported a $701
million third-quarter charge for asbestos litigation related to
Quigley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Matt Robinson" date="Jul 02, 2012  4:26 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-02/jpmorgan-s-largest-etn-rises-to-record-premium-after-share-halt.html"><headline>JPMorgan&#8217;s Largest ETN Rises to Record Premium After Share Halt</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) exchange-
traded note tied to oil assets reached a record premium over its
underlying index after the bank limited shares of the security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ), under the ticker AMJ,
closed 2.7 percent above its underlying index on June 29, the
highest level since its inception in April 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based bank&#8217;s ETN, the
largest in the U.S. at $5 billion in market capitalization,
traded at a 5.3 percent premium at 1:48 p.m. in New York, before
retreating to 2.5 percent at 3:50 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan limited share creation to 129 million on June 14,
a threshold reached six days later, raising concern that the
note could become unhinged from its linked index, as occurred in
March with an ETN (TVIX) issued by Credit Suisse AG. The AMJ note,
which tracks partnerships that don&#8217;t pay federal income taxes
and rely on assets such as oil pipelines to generate cash flow,
has added 35 million shares this year, an increase of 37
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone expected AMJ to trade at a premium once the cap
was announced because investors are scrambling for yield,&#8221; said
Samuel Lee, an exchange-traded product analyst for Morningstar
Inc. in Chicago. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect to see crazy, TVIX-level
premiums in this product because that premium becomes too
attractive and people will start to short AMJ,&#8221; he said,
referring to the ticker of Credit Suisse&#8217;s volatility note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alerian MLP-linked security was the fourth-most traded
U.S. ETN on June 29, at 2,717,800 shares, compared with less
than a third that volume on the day before the announcement that
its size would be restricted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TVIX Premium &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 21, Zurich-based Credit Suisse stopped issuing
shares of an ETN tied to the VIX, as the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index is called. A month later, the TVIX
note began diverging from its underlying index to trade at a
premium of as much as 89 percent. Over two days in March, it
lost more than 50 percent of its value, and the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission is probing price gyrations in the
security, a person familiar with the matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan ETN, which has a total return of 10 percent
for the last year, makes up more than a quarter of the ETN
market. It tracks a gauge of 50 publicly traded master limited
partnerships and matches dividends from the Alerian MLP Index
minus a 0.85 percent management fee, according to a prospectus
filed with the SEC. The partnerships typically invest in assets
ranging from pipelines to ships transporting commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who want to bet on master limited partnerships
can choose from at least nine other exchange-traded products.
UBS AG and Credit Suisse offer ETNs, and ALPS Advisors Inc.
sells the largest exchange-traded fund tied to an MLP index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer&#8217;s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of ETNs based on the level of demand
for the securities. That demand typically doesn&#8217;t affect the
price since the ETNs track the performance of an index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) hired Ellen
Cooper to be chief investment officer as lower interest rates
pressure income on a bond portfolio valued at more than $70
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper, 47, joins from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s asset-
management business where she was a managing director and global
head of insurance strategy. She&#8217;ll report to Lincoln Chief
Executive Officer Dennis Glass, 62, the Radnor, Pennsylvania-
based insurer said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers including MetLife Inc., Prudential Financial Inc.
and Aflac Inc. have turned to new money managers to maintain
investment results amid lower yields on the safest bonds.
Lincoln&#8217;s portfolio included more than $60 billion in corporate
bonds as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper, who starts Aug. 6, has &#8220;a deep background in asset
management, risk management and insurance,&#8221; Glass said in the
statement. &#8220;The wealth of experience she brings to the role
will be a benefit to the company and our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has also worked for Aegon NV and Ernst  Young LLP,
according to the statement. Cooper received a bachelor&#8217;s degree
from Temple University in Philadelphia. Cooper takes over duties
previously handled by Fred Crawford, who was hired by insurer
CNO Financial Group Inc. as chief financial officer in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln slipped 2.1 percent to $21.42 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York. The seller of life insurance and annuities fell 27 percent
in the past year as the Federal Reserve said its benchmark
interest rate will remain low until at least late 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Multiyear Headwind&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect low interest rates to be a multiyear headwind&#8221;
for Lincoln, Barclays Capital analysts including Jay Gelb wrote
in a research note today before her hiring was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Siegel, global head of the Goldman Sachs insurance
asset-management operation, will assume Cooper&#8217;s
responsibilities for the insurance strategy team, said Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, in an e-mail
today. The insurance asset-management business oversees more
than $125 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs last month hired Robert Goodman as managing
director, global head of insurance relationships. Goodman, who
previously worked at Deutsche Bank AG as global co-head of
Deutsche Insurance Asset Management, is a graduate of Harvard
Law School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper is the latest departure from the Goldman Sachs
insurance asset-management unit. Eric Kirsch, who was global
head of insurance asset management, left the bank to become
chief investment officer at Columbus, Georgia-based Aflac, the
seller of supplemental health insurance said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Substantial Investment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is making a &#8220;substantial investment&#8221; in
overseeing insurers&#8217; funds as more companies pay external
managers to handle portions of their portfolios, according to
the firm&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have seen an increase in the outsourcing of insurance
asset management globally, which has been accelerated by new
capital regimes, greater demand as a result of the financial
crisis and a sustained low interest-rate environment, making it
more difficult to generate returns,&#8221; CEO Lloyd Blankfein and
President Gary Cohn wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is tightening
its grip on the global corporate bond market while Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) sees its market share decline with issuance on
pace to exceed $3 trillion for a fourth straight year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the most profitable U.S. bank, underwrote 6.8
percent of sales, excluding self-led deals, in the first half of
2012, up from 6.4 percent in all of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America dropped to third, with 5.2 percent from 6.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief executive officer, is
benefiting from debt underwriting as offerings approach $2
trillion, including a record $1.19 trillion in the first three
months of the year. The New York-based lender is the top choice
of companies even as it suffers more than $2 billion of losses
from derivatives tied to corporate credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have an advantage in the marketplace and they&#8217;re
taking advantage of it,&#8221; Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale
Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida, who recommends the firm&#8217;s
stock, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;They have the ability,
given their incredible capital strength, to attract customers
presumably because their cost of capital is lower,&#8221; which they
can pass on to clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has underwritten $110.9 billion of corporate bonds
this year, versus $94.5 billion at New York-based Citigroup
Inc. (C), which ranks second with a 5.8 percent share, the data
show. Citigroup came in fourth in 2011, with a 5.7 percent
share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Difficult Markets&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance for the full year in the U.S. and Europe will
probably trail 2011, as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis threatens global
markets, according to Barclays Plc (BARC) strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan tends to do better in more difficult markets,&#8221;
Jim Casey, co-head of global debt capital markets at the bank in
New York, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;When the going gets
tough, some of the smaller players arguably will reduce their
capital allocation, whereas we tend not to do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate bonds from default in the U.S. declined for a second
day, with the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index,
which investors use to hedge against losses or to speculate on
creditworthiness, decreasing 1.7 basis points to a mid-price of
110.6 basis points as of 11:55 a.m. in New York, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the lowest level on an intra-day basis since May 14
for the index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
bond market stress, rose 1.66 basis points to 26.16 basis points
as of 11:58 a.m. in New York. The gauge widens when investors
seek the perceived safety of government securities and narrows
when they favor assets such as corporate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Citigroup are the most actively traded dollar-
denominated corporate securities by dealers today, with 38
trades of $1 million or more as of 11:57 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of corporate bonds worldwide declined 10.9 percent
last week to $60.1 billion from $67.4 billion in the period
ended June 22, Bloomberg data show. For the first half of the
year, issuance fell to $1.93 trillion from $1.99 trillion in the
corresponding period of 2011, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan managed $42.4 billion of offerings last quarter,
excluding self-led transactions, a 38 percent decline from $68.5
billion in the three months ended March 31, Bloomberg data show.
That compares with a 47 percent drop at Bank of America, which
underwrote $29.3 billion in the April-through-June period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the ways you can grow is by taking share from
others, and the investment bank is probably a place where
JPMorgan is doing this,&#8221; Shannon Stemm, an analyst with Edward
Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re
by no means in a strong capital markets environment, but to the
extent that the economy continues to recover, this segment is a
revenue generator, so I think there&#8217;s a lot of push to grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman at Bank of America, and
Mark Costiglio of Citigroup declined to comment on underwriting
market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are pressing leaders in the 17-nation euro region
to contain a sovereign-debt crisis that&#8217;s threatening a
contagion across the financial system such as the one that
followed the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forecast Lowered &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a summit last week in Brussels, policy makers
dropped requirements that taxpayers get preferred-creditor
status on aid to Spain&#8217;s banks, opening the way to recapitalize
lenders directly. Euro chiefs said they&#8217;re determined to &#8220;break
the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns&#8221; that began in
Greece in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sales of dollar-denominated company debt declined 42
percent in the second quarter from the three months ended in
March, euro issuance dropped 54 percent as the region&#8217;s
faltering economy dissuaded borrowers from tapping debt markets.
The European Central Bank has forecast a 0.1 percent contraction
in the euro-area economy for 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup strategists led by Jason Shoup revised their
issuance estimate for investment-grade debt to $827 billion in
2012, including $462 billion from non-financial companies,
according to a June 29 report. That&#8217;s down from a January
estimate of $855 billion with $490 billion from non-financials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London Whale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For some credits, it&#8217;s currently easier to do a deal in
the U.S. than in Europe,&#8221; said Chris Whitman, head of global
risk syndicate at Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), which ranks fourth in global
underwriting with a 5.2 percent share, down from 5.9 percent in
2011 and coming in third. &#8220;The U.S. benefits from a bigger and
deeper credit market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors added $57 billion to U.S. fixed-income mutual
funds in the second quarter, compared with $2.3 billion of
outflows from European funds, according EPFR Global data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. market has been the most consistently liquid
market,&#8221; Huw Richards, co-head of investment-grade finance at
JPMorgan in New York, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no doubt that having insight on those investor flows, we&#8217;re
definitely able to translate that into international borrowers&#8221;
coming to market to issue dollar-denominated debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s share has increased even as it faces
Congressional scrutiny after its London chief investment office
built a portfolio of credit derivatives so large it distorted
prices and earned trader Bruno Iksil a nickname: the London
Whale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Short-Term Blow&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, the group was ordered to reduce
its positions and instead executed a series of trades that left
the bank with even bigger and harder-to-manage exposures, Dimon
told the Senate Banking Committee in Washington last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the losses amount to &#8220;a short-term blow to their
reputation,&#8221; it probably won&#8217;t be a meaningful problem in the
long run, Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic
Equities LLP who recommends JPMorgan stock, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;Looking across the investment banking landscape,
JPMorgan is one of the best placed to pick up market share&#8221; as
European competitors cut employees, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the top 10 underwriters, excluding self-led
deals, are Barclays at No. 5; HSBC Holdings Plc. at No. 6;
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) at No. 7; Morgan Stanley (MS) at No. 8; UBS
AG (UBSN) at No. 9; and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) at No. 10 with a 3.3
percent share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
expand its new private real estate investment trust to as much
as 300 billion yen ($3.7 billion) to buy Japanese properties as
the Wall Street bank foresees a turnaround in prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s asset management unit will begin the REIT in
August with as much as 30 billion yen including equity and plans
to increase the size to about 300 billion yen in five years,
said Taro Squires, head of real estate investment management at
Goldman Sachs Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs joins Mitsubishi Estate Co., Mitsui Fudosan
Co. and Nomura Real Estate Holdings Inc. (3231) that have set up
private REITs in the past 12 months as four years of price
declines, amid more than a decade of deflation, seem to be
slowing. Office property prices in Tokyo, down about 40 percent
from a 2007 peak, are little changed this year, according to Los
Angeles-based property broker CBRE Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are close to the bottom of the real estate cycle,&#8221;
said Squires in an interview. &#8220;I expect the market to bottom
out within the next six to 12 months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The REIT, which targets a 4 percent to 5 percent dividend
yield, will have a leverage of 50 percent, enabling it to buy as
much as 30 billion yen of real estate at the start, Squires said.
The company has a target to expand the REIT initially to 100
billion yen in two years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office buildings will account for more than 60 percent of
the trust, while residential and retail will represent the rest,
he said, adding that a majority of assets will be in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Different Cycle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index rose the most in more
than two months, gaining 1.4 percent. That compares to the 0.1
percent drop in the benchmark Topix index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Japan is in a different cycle compared with other markets
in Asia-Pacific,&#8221; said Christopher Lee, Hong Kong-based
managing director of corporate ratings for the region at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &#8220;The other markets are coming off from a
cyclical top so they are well under way for correction. Japan
has been in correction for some time now, so it&#8217;s on its way for
a recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the first non-Japanese company to start a
private REIT, is looking to raise money from financial
institutions and corporate pensions in Japan, Squires said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stable Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades of slumping stocks, one of the world&#8217;s lowest
bond yields and an aging population are prompting the nation&#8217;s
pensions to expand investments into alternative assets,
including real estate and hedge funds. The 10-year Japanese
government bond yield is 0.8 percent, the second lowest after
Switzerland. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average is less than a quarter
of its 1989 peak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private REITs (TSEREIT) own buildings and pay investors dividends
from rental income. They are not traded on exchanges so don&#8217;t
have daily price fluctuations that listed REITs have. That
matches the need of pension funds seeking stable income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we are trying to target is to provide investors that
were in publicly listed REITs with more stability, to give
investors that were originally in private real estate funds with
more clarity,&#8221; said Squires. &#8220;For JGB investors, it still
provides them with yen-denominated return albeit at a higher
level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capitalization rate for office buildings that cost more
than $10 million in Japan has declined to 5.57 percent in the
first three months of this year after an average of 5.74 percent
in the past 12 months, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc.,
a New York-based research and consulting company. A drop in the
rate, a measure of investment yield for properties, signals an
increase in prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s $3.36 trillion in pension money is the world&#8217;s
second-largest retirement pool after the U.S., according to
Towers Watson  Co. Japan was the only market among 12 that had
a drop in pension assets because of the poor returns on local
stocks and bonds, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese pensions have 31 percent of investments in
equities and 59 percent in bonds, with only 6 percent in
alternative assets, according to Towers Watson. That compares
with 25 percent in such assets in the U.S. and 23 percent in
Australia, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J-REITs account for 8.3 trillion yen of Japan&#8217;s 23.2
trillion real estate investment market, while private equity
real estate funds represent the rest, according to STB Research
Institute Co. The size of Japan&#8217;s private REIT market is less
than $2 billion, said Squires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Private REIT is really the one product that has been
missing in the market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s still a very young
industry. We expect the market to grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects Ebitda multiple in third paragraph of story
originally published July 3.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal Inc. (MODL), a provider of medical
document processing technology, said it agreed to be bought by a
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit for about $1.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners, JPMorgan&#8217;s private investment arm,
will pay $14 a share in cash for MModal, or 8.3 percent more
than the stock&#8217;s July 2 closing price, the Franklin, Tennessee-
based company said in a statement today. MModal&#8217;s board accepted
the offer, to be made in a tender on or before July 17 and
expected to be completed by September, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition values MModal at 8.46 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and goodwill amortization,
compared with an average 21.3 times among 10 comparable deals,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official at One Equity in Hong Kong wasn&#8217;t able to
immediately respond to an interview request. One Equity manages
about $11 billion of assets, according to the statement. It has
invested about $9 billion since 2001 buying more than 60
companies across the chemicals, health care, technology, travel
and manufacturing industries, the New York-based group said on
its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment funds affiliated with S.A.C. Private Capital
Group LLC represent the largest shareholding in MModal with
about 31 percent, and have agreed to sell their shares in
support of the transaction, according to MModal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal has 12,000 employees in five countries, and more
than 140 patents and licenses for speech recognition and
understanding technology, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macquarie Group Ltd. is acting as lead financial adviser to
MModal, which is also being advised by RBC Capital Markets, with
Simpson Thacher  Bartlett LLP is acting as legal counsel,
MModal said. It said One Equity, which has obtained equity and
debt financing for the transaction, was advised by Bank of
America Corp. and RBC Capital Markets. Dechert LLP is providing
legal counsel, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s refusal to
turn over e-mails in a federal probe of potential energy-market
manipulation is the latest challenge for Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon as the bank faces multiple investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sued JPMorgan
July 2 to release 25 e-mails in an investigation of possible
manipulation of power markets in California and the Midwest by
J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., according to court filings by
the Washington-based agency. FERC opened the probe in August
after complaints from California and Midwest grid operators that
JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding practices were abusive, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s got a PR nightmare in front of him,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. &#8220;It&#8217;s another headline risk, which means more
regulators, which means over-regulation, which will eventually
hit their bottom line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank is struggling to maintain its image
as risk-averse and well-managed after reporting a $2 billion
loss in a London unit that Dimon said &#8220;violated common sense.&#8221;
Dimon, 56, has said that the loss may grow to $3 billion or
more. Analysts including Charles Peabody at Portales Partners
LLC in New York estimate it at about $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Justice
Department are among agencies investigating the cause of the
loss as well as the company&#8217;s public disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Libor Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. may get
stung also by an international investigation into an attempt by
banks in the U.K. and U.S. to rig the London interbank offered
rate, called Libor. London-based Barclays (BARC) Plc was fined 290
million pounds ($455 million) and its top three executives,
including CEO Robert Diamond, said they would step down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a heightened possibility of scrutiny after
recent events at Barclays,&#8221; Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd.
in New York, wrote in a July 2 research note. The banks face
risks of fines, lawsuits, negative news and new regulations,
according to Mayo&#8217;s note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan keeps &#8220;having these little blowups,&#8221; said Paul
Miller. &#8220;It just sounds like a culture that&#8217;s supposed to be
very tight and risk-managed is not being well run.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC, which has pledged to combat manipulation of prices,
said JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding techniques in California and the Midwest
resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments. It
accused the bank of improperly using attorney-client privilege
to withhold or redact 53 e-mails subpoenaed in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;E-Mails Released &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has since released 28 of the e-mails, including
a March 14, 2011, exchange between commodities head Blythe Masters and her chief of principal investments, Francis Dunleavy, regarding an update on the California Independent
System Operator Inc., one of the complainants in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So in your opinion we are better off with me trying to
decide this without your help?&#8221; Masters asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Dunleavy asked to speak directly to Masters, who
wasn&#8217;t available, he said, &#8220;I will handle it but it may not be
pretty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC said in its complaint &#8220;there is no conceivable
argument that any of this is privileged.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in March that the agency
will be vigorous in seeking to stop companies from manipulating
electricity markets, after the agency reached a record $245
million settlement with Constellation Energy Group Inc. for
trading practices in New York and New England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alleged Violations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC has issued 15 notices of alleged violations since
January 2011 for companies including Barclays, BP Plc (BP/), Deutsche
Bank AG and Constellation, according to information posted on
the agency&#8217;s website. Seven of the cases have been settled, FERC
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been responding to a FERC investigation into
certain activities in our federally approved power business,&#8221;
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;We believe we have complied in all respects with the law, as
well as FERC rules and applicable tariffs.&#8221; She declined to
discuss the bank&#8217;s image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator is examining efforts by Houston-based J.P.
Morgan Ventures to extract excessive payments or above-market
prices from California ISO and Midwest Independent Transmission
System Operator Inc., Thomas Olson, a lawyer in the FERC
investigating division, said in a court document. The probe
focuses on winning inflated &#8220;make-whole&#8221; payments, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improper Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any such improper payments to generators are ultimately
borne by the households, businesses and government entities that
are the end-consumers of electricity,&#8221; Olson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California and Midwest grid operators solicit bids from
electricity suppliers each day to meet expected demand.
Typically, 90 percent or more power consumed is secured in what
is known as the day-ahead market. Any supply shortfalls because
of weather or unexpected plant shutdowns are met through bids
placed in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anytime you have allegations like this, it&#8217;s
noteworthy,&#8221; said Paul Patterson, a New York-based analyst at
Glenrock Associates LLC. &#8220;Given the vital nature of
electricity, its inability to be stored and limitations for
transmission, the ability for players to influence prices is a
substantial concern to regulators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fell 1.1 percent to $35.88 yesterday in New York,
the fifth-worst performing stock among 30 companies in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported the FERC investigation earlier
on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12mc352, U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positions in the credit derivatives
index said to contribute to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion
loss fell last week to the lowest in five months as the bank and
hedge funds trading against it unwind bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net amount of credit protection bought or sold through
Series 9 of the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index
fell 4.3 percent to $118.7 billion in the week ended June 29,
the least outstanding since the period ended Jan. 27, according
to the Depository Trust  Clearing Corp. The so-called net
notional outstanding surged an unprecedented 67 percent to $150
billion in the 17 weeks ended April 27 as JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil was said to have amassed a position in the index so large
it distorted the market, earning him the nickname the London
Whale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to stem losses from trades by its chief
investment office in London, where Iksil managed a portfolio of
credit derivatives, which was first reported by Bloomberg News
on April 5. The CIO&#8217;s strategy to reduce risks from hedges
backfired and left the bank with even bigger and harder-to-
manage exposures, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said last
month before the Senate Banking Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index tracks credit swaps tied to 121 companies, all of
which were investment grade more than four years ago, including
now junk-rated bond guarantor MBIA Insurance Corp. and mortgage
insurer Radian Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Winner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time Iksil was said to have been building
positions, hedge funds and other market participants were taking
the opposite bets, people familiar with the trades said at the
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Feldstein, a former JPMorgan executive who helped
the company create the credit-derivatives market, was among fund
managers who bet against the bank, before helping it unwind more
than $20 billion of trades. BlueMountain Capital Management LLC
stands to make as much as $300 million, said market participants
familiar with the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trades, first reported by Bloomberg News on June 20,
are among those that may have helped reduce the bank&#8217;s exposure
to the index by more than half, according to estimates from
market participants familiar with trading activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saba Capital Management LP, Hutchin Hill Capital LP, and
BlueCrest Capital Management LLP also profited from the
dislocations, according to people familiar with the trades. Saba
and Hutchin Hill have closed out their positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales Partners LLC in
New York, estimated the amount has grown to between $4 billion
and $5 billion. The company is scheduled to disclose details
about its losses and its progress unwinding the trades when it
reports earnings on July 13. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Olson, the former head of
credit trading for JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co.&#8217;s chief investment
office in North America, joined Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s bond-trading
unit, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olson started yesterday and reports to David Cohen, head of
investment-grade bond trading for New York-based Citigroup in
North America, according to the people, who asked not to be
named because the matter isn&#8217;t public. He will run the hybrids
and preferred securities trading desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olson, a former U.S. Navy nuclear submarine pilot, left
JPMorgan in December, about five months before the bank
disclosed at least $2 billion in losses from the CIO&#8217;s London
operation. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon pushed
the unit to seek profits by speculating on higher-yield assets
such as credit derivatives before the bets soured, according to
executives who used to work at the company. Olson&#8217;s former
colleague in London, Bruno Iksil, is known as the London Whale
because his bets were so large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, JPMorgan&#8217;s CIO lost $1 billion on securities tied
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when the government-backed
mortgage agencies were put into conservatorship. Olson has said
the only reason he wasn&#8217;t fired at the time was because Dimon
had been &#8220;intimately familiar with those positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarterly Estimate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, may announce a
$3.46 billion second-quarter profit on July 13, according to the
average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Dimon
will lead a two-hour conference call with analysts to discuss
the trading loss, which he said May 10 may be $3 billion or
more. Analysts including Charles Peabody at Portales Partners
LLC in New York estimate the loss at about $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olson joins Citigroup&#8217;s credit-trading team as the firm
grapples with the European sovereign debt crisis. Chief
Executive Officer Vikram Pandit shook up the unit in January,
causing senior debt traders Rohit Bansal and Chris Yanney to
leave the bank, the third-biggest in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average daily trading volume for investment-grade bonds
in June fell 7 percent from a year earlier, David Trone, a JMP
Securities LLC analyst, told clients in a July 2 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit trends stabilized during the month but have
deteriorated since the end of 1Q12,&#8221; according to Trone, who
has a sell rating on Citigroup shares. The profits and share
prices of Wall Street firms will fall over the rest of year
&#8220;due to a confluence of material events, both at home and
abroad, led by an increasingly troublesome situation in
Europe,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to a two-month high, after data
showed factory orders topped estimates and as speculation grew
that global central banks will act to spur economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity (S5MATR), industrial and technology shares had the biggest
gains among 10 groups in the SP 500. Alcoa (AA) Inc., Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) advanced at least 1.1 percent. Ford Motor
Co. (F) rallied 2.2 percent as deliveries of cars and light trucks
beat analysts&#8217; estimates. Facebook Inc. (FB) climbed 1.4 percent as
General Motors (GM) Co. is said to be talking with the largest
social-networking company about resuming advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.6 percent to 1,374.02 at 1 p.m. New York
time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 72.43 points, or
0.6 percent, to 12,943.82. The Russell 2000 Index rallied 1.3
percent to 818.48. The market closed at 1 p.m. today, and will
be shut tomorrow for a holiday. Trading in SP 500 companies was
almost in line with the 30-day average at this time of day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The factory orders report was a good surprise,&#8221; Richard Sichel, who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;Investors are also finding comfort in central bank action. The
Fed has anticipated that they will do whatever it takes to not
let the economy slip, China is doing the same and that the
Europeans seem to be doing that too.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities climbed as factory orders rose in May for the
first time in three months. Yet declining jobs data in the U.S.
this week may prompt the Federal Reserve to initiate fresh
stimulus, BNP Paribas SA said. The European Central Bank is
forecast to cut interest rates this week to help curb the debt
crisis, while a state-owned newspaper in China said the time is
ripe for a reduction in banks&#8217; reserve-requirement ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Tepid&#8217; Recovery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will grow by 2 percent this year and about
2.25 percent in 2013 amid a &#8220;tepid&#8221; recovery and the European
debt crisis, the International Monetary Fund said, lowering its
previous projections. In an April report, the IMF forecast U.S.
growth of 2.1 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Further easing&#8221; by the Federal Reserve might be needed
&#8220;if the situation was to deteriorate,&#8221; IMF Managing Director
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Washington
today. She said she welcomed previous actions by the Fed to help
the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about a global economic slowdown put the SP 500
last month on the brink of a so-called correction, or a 10
percent decline from a recent peak. The index slumped 3.3
percent in the second-quarter, the biggest retreat since the
period ending in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alcoa, Apple &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy rose 1.3 percent. Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, added 3.2 percent to $8.90. Caterpillar, the biggest
maker of construction equipment, advanced 3.3 percent to $86.46.
Apple, the biggest company by market value, gained 1.2 percent
to $599.41. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car companies in the SP 500 (SPX) added 2.1 percent for the
second-biggest gain among 24 groups. General Motors, Ford and
Chrysler Group LLC said U.S. auto sales exceeded estimates in
June. Ford rallied 2.2 percent to $9.60. GM added 5.6 percent to
$20.67. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook climbed 1.4 percent to $31.20. The talks were
reported by two people familiar with the matter. GM said it
would stop advertising on Facebook on the eve of the company&#8217;s
initial public offering in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal Inc. (MODL) surged 8.4 percent to $14.02. The largest
provider of medical transcription services said it agreed to be
bought by a JPMorgan Chase  Co. unit for about $1.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navistar International Corp. (NAV) rose 7.2 percent to $29.04
after the truckmaker scheduled an operations update for
investors this week that may include plans to drop one type of
pollution-control technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Softer&#8217; Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s largest home-improvement retailers declined
after Cleveland Research cited &#8220;softer&#8221; second-quarter sales.
Lowe&#8217;s Cos. (LOW) retreated 3.5 percent to $27.62. Home Depot Inc. (HD)
dropped 2.6 percent to $51.65. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) lost 1.7 percent to $68.69 after
unexpectedly announcing the resignation of Bill Johnson,
previously named to be the chief executive officer after its
takeover of Progress Energy Inc. (PGN) James Rogers, the head of Duke,
is CEO of the merged companies effective immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson, 58, is resigning &#8220;by mutual agreement,&#8221; the
company said. The takeover, announced in January 2011, received
its final regulatory approval yesterday. Tom Williams, a
spokesman for Duke, declined to comment on the reason for the
change. Johnson has been the chairman and CEO of Raleigh, North
Carolina-based Progress since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bearish Sentiment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearish sentiment in an individual investors&#8217; survey has
surpassed the historical average for the longest stretch since
October, when stocks began a rally that lifted the SP 500 24
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll by the American Association of Individual Investors
showed 44.4 percent of respondents say U.S. stocks will fall
over the next six months. That&#8217;s the eighth week that pessimism
stayed above the 25-year average of 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will deepen and the recovery
weaken have erased as much as $1.8 trillion from U.S. equities
since March. The last time the proportion of bears topped the
average for this long was in the 14 weeks through Oct. 20, 2011,
just after the SP 500 bottomed at 1,099.23. The benchmark
measure for U.S. stocks went on to surge as much as 29 percent,
reaching a four-year high of 1,419.04 on April 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Individual investors tend to get in when the markets are
red hot and they tend to get out when the markets are at the
bottom,&#8221; said Robert Carey, who helps oversee $53 billion as
chief investment officer of Wheaton, Illinois-based First Trust
Portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough Speed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains that drove the SP 500 to its biggest June advance
since 1999 may falter because too few stocks are rising with
enough speed, StockCharts.com Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge surged 2.5 percent on June 29, finishing the
month up 4 percent, amid optimism that Europe will prevent bank
losses from multiplying. While the rally drove 64 percent of
shares above their average price during the past 50 days, that&#8217;s
short of the 85 percent threshold that usually accompany longer
rallies, said Arthur Hill, a technical analyst at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 85 percent is where momentum becomes self-sustaining,
equity declines are likely to speed up when the number of stocks
above the 50-day mean slips below 15 percent, Hill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A surge above 85 percent shows strong-enough buying
pressure to suggest that an uptrend is emerging,&#8221; Hill wrote in
a note yesterday. &#8220;It is like a rocket lifting off the launch
pad. A strong up-thrust is needed to insure a sustainable
advance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EON AG fell the most in a week after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc. cut recommendations on
shares of the largest German utility following recent gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EON slid as much as 3.6 percent, the most since June 25. It
was cut to neutral from overweight by JPMorgan, while Citigroup
reduced it to sell. EON, which has risen 15 percent in Frankfurt
in the past month, increased its profit outlook yesterday after
reaching a deal with Russia&#8217;s OAO Gazprom on natural-gas prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The shares could pause for breath,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EON declined by 3.2 percent to 16.63 euros by 12:32 p.m. in
Frankfurt, the second-biggest drop on the benchmark DAX index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal between EON and Gazprom will be backdated to the
fourth quarter of 2010 and add about 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) to EON&#8217;s half-year results, the utility said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazprom was the &#8220;last of positive newsflow,&#8221; Citigroup
said. &#8220;EON&#8217;s equity story is about execution of its dual
strategy of cost-cutting and re-investment outside Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V)&#8217;s general counsel, Joshua Floum, generated $1.37 million in proceeds this week by
exercising company stock options as shares in the world&#8217;s
largest bank-card network climbed to records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floum converted 16,949 options into stock and sold the
shares at a price of $125 on July 2, according to a filing today

options, granted in 2008 with an exercise price of $44, was made
May 21. Floum still owns more than 118,000 options and 39,000

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
seeks to cancel billions of dollars in payment claims by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), asked a judge to help by reconsidering
parts of an $8.6 billion lawsuit against the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, a key lender to Lehman in the 2008 credit crisis,
says it is owed $6.3 billion by the defunct investment bank.
Lehman, as part of an effort cut creditors&#8217; claims to
$300 billion to meet its target of repaying at the rate of
18 cents on the dollar, is fighting JPMorgan in a lawsuit and a
separate challenge in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revised ruling by the judge who dismissed part of the
lawsuit in April might bring &#8220;significant relief,&#8221; Lehman said
in a filing. While it won&#8217;t try to &#8220;relitigate&#8221; his decision
on the law, he could reinstate part of the lawsuit &#8220;based on
other theories, such as fraud,&#8221; the defunct firm said in the
July 3 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan is struggling to maintain its image as
risk-averse and well-managed after reporting a $2 billion loss
in a London unit that Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
&#8220;violated common sense.&#8221; Dimon said the loss may grow to
$3 billion or more. Analysts including Charles Peabody at
Portales Partners LLC in New York estimate it at about
$5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on Lehman&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Safe Harbor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its suit, Lehman, once the fourth-largest investment
bank, accused New York-based JPMorgan of helping to cause its
2008 collapse by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral as backing
for loans. JPMorgan, saying it lent Lehman $70 billion around
the time of its 2008 collapse, sued back, saying it was deceived
into making the loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck told Lehman in April that
it cannot sue JPMorgan over transactions governed by so-called
safe harbor law, devised to protect banks dealing with weak
companies. Doing so, he took away Lehman&#8217;s easy way of getting
money from the bank or canceling its claims, leaving it &#8220;to
pursue the remaining &#8216;&#8216;complex and fact driven causes of
action,&#8217;&#8217; according to a written decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman has twice asked Peck to reconsider. JPMorgan said in
February it would give Lehman almost $700 million to settle part
of the lawsuit, though it continues to fight for most of its
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dismissal &#8216;Premature&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck said this week it would be &#8216;&#8216;premature&#8217;&#8217; to throw out
objections to the claims by Lehman and its creditors committee,
as the bank asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which exited bankruptcy in March, intends to pay
creditors $53 billion in six years or so. Lehman filed the
biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008, listing
$613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered by a
federal judge to explain why it shouldn&#8217;t be compelled to turn
over e-mails sought by U.S. regulators in a probe of potential
energy-market manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington
today gave JPMorgan until the end of the day on July 13 to
respond. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sued
JPMorgan on July 2 to release 25 e-mails in an investigation of
possible manipulation of power markets in California and the
Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan shall address why it should not be required to
produce the 25 at-issue e-mails in unredacted form or to submit
them to the court for in camera review,&#8221; Kollar-Kotelly said in
the three-page order. &#8220;JPMorgan must present declarations or
other competent evidence to support each of the essential
elements of any claimed privilege.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC opened the probe in August after complaints from
California and Midwest grid operators that JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding
practices were abusive, according to the agency&#8217;s initial court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe we have complied in all respects with the law,
as well as FERC rules and applicable tariffs, governing this
market,&#8221; Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail. &#8220;We stress that this investigation is ongoing and
that no conclusions have been reached or findings adjudicated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Court&#8217;s Assistance&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said &#8220;we welcome the court&#8217;s assistance in resolving
this dispute over documents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC, which has pledged to combat manipulation of prices,
said JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding techniques in California and the Midwest
resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments. It
accused the bank of improperly using attorney-client privilege
to withhold or redact 53 e-mails subpoenaed in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has since released 28 of the e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator is examining efforts by Houston-based J.P.
Morgan Ventures to extract excessive payments or above-market
prices from and Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator
Inc. and California ISO, Thomas Olson, a lawyer in the FERC
investigating division, said in a court document. The probe
focuses on winning inflated &#8220;make-whole&#8221; payments, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grid Operators &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California and Midwest grid operators solicit bids
from electricity suppliers each day to meet expected demand.
Typically, 90 percent or more power consumed is secured in what
is known as the day-ahead market. Any supply shortfalls because
of weather or unexpected plant shutdowns are met through bids
placed in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s order, the judge said the parties should meet
and file a brief on July 10 advising whether they would consent
to having the case handled by a magistrate judge with any
appeals taken directly to the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington. She said such an arrangement might result in a
quicker decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has begun
disclosing its own valuations for structured notes in offering
prospectuses, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
recommended that banks include such an estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. regulator advised banks to add &#8220;fair value&#8221;
disclosures in a letter to lenders it didn&#8217;t identify that was
posted on its website April 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe issuers should consider prominently disclosing
the difference between the public offering price of the note&#8221;
and the fair value estimated by the issuer or its affiliate, the
SEC said in its April letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a May 15 offering from Goldman Sachs of &#8220;Absolute
Return Knock-Out Notes,&#8221; the bank wrote that the securities are
&#8220;equal to approximately $960 per $1,000&#8221; note issued. A
similar May 4 deal lacked such details, instead using language
that the price received for the notes may be &#8220;significantly
less than the original issue price,&#8221; according to prospectuses
filed with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s earliest use of valuation estimates was in mid-
May, according to a search of SEC records online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a New York-based spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. structured-note industry has come under scrutiny
from regulators for the securities&#8217; complexity and lack of
transparency. Banks sold $45.9 billion of SEC-registered
securities in 2011, down from a record $49.5 billion a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, which requested a written reply to its letter
within 10 days, also asked the issuers to explain how they set
up a secondary market for the notes, how they use the proceeds
raised from sales and how important the business is to their
funding needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters Plc Chief Executive
Officer Robert Walters said the recruitment company is looking
for growth opportunities in Brazil and the Asia-Pacific region,
which he described as a &#8220;hot market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based firm, which specializes in professional
recruitment worldwide, reported that net income fees fell by 3
percent to 47.6 million pounds ($74.1 million) in the second
quarter from 49.2 million pounds for the same period in 2011.
The company&#8217;s share price declined 5.86 percent to 196.75 pence
at 11.55 a.m. in London trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters said in an interview that the firm delivered a
stable performance against deteriorating worldwide market
conditions, with the Americas and South Africa the only areas
that saw growth in the second quarter, as net income there rose
4 percent to 1.6 million pounds from 1.5 million pounds in the
same period a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company opened three new offices in Milton
Keynes, north of London, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro, and is
looking to open more in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re sitting on a goldmine - the infrastructure, IT, and
marketing is in place. We have cash, no debt and a diversified
portfolio. I sleep well at night,&#8221; Walters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s net cash fell to 4.5 million pounds as of
June. 30, from 10.7 million pounds in the same period in 2011
due to &#8220;growth of business contracts&#8221;, Walters said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s European
Chief Economist Huw Pill predicts the European Central Bank will
leave its deposit rate unchanged at 0.25 percent, while cutting
its benchmark rate to 0.75 percent, Boersenzeitung reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB shouldn&#8217;t increase purchases of euro-area
peripheral sovereign debt as the central bank can&#8217;t keep yields
low forever, Pill told the German newspaper in an interview.
Countries like Italy need to implement reforms to regain trust,
Pill was cited as saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. (BLK) closed European money market funds
to new investments after the European Central Bank lowered
deposit rates to zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the world&#8217;s biggest provider of money-market
funds, won&#8217;t accept new cash in five euro-denominated money-
market and liquidity funds because the rate cut may result in
losses for investors, the company said in a notice to
shareholders. Goldman Sachs won&#8217;t accept new money in its GS
Euro Government Liquid Reserves Fund, and BlackRock, the world&#8217;s
largest asset manager, is restricting deposits in two European
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The European market environment is in unchartered
territory with such historically low -- or even negative --
yields for high-quality issuance,&#8221; Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a memo
to fund shareholders, citing the ECB&#8217;s rate cut. &#8220;It is not
currently feasible for our portfolio managers to deploy capital
without substantially diluting the yield for the existing base
of shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB yesterday reduced its benchmark rate to a record
low of 0.75 percent and took its deposit rate to zero. Money
funds have been struggling to invest client assets at a profit
as interest rates globally are near record lows and Europe&#8217;s
sovereign debt crisis has reduced the supply of available debt.
Managers have been forced to cut fees to keep customer returns
above zero, and some have abandoned the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three firms said the restrictions are temporary and
they will monitor market conditions. Investor redemptions from
the funds are not being limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Negative Territory&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s five closed funds had 23.7 billion euros ($29.2
billion) in assets as of July 5, the bank said in an e-mail,
about 22 percent of all euro-denominated money funds. The funds
are JPMorgan&#8217;s Euro Liquidity Fund (JPMEULC), Euro Government Liquidity
Fund, Euro Money Market Fund, Euro Liquid Market Fund and
JPMorgan Series II Funds -- EUR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposit rate cut &#8220;will almost certainly move cash bids
in short-dated instruments into negative territory, and so we
have taken the step to restrict subscriptions and switches into
the funds in order to protect existing shareholders from yield
dilution,&#8221; JPMorgan said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had $417 billion in money fund assets as of May
31, making it the world leader, according to Crane Data LLC, a
research firm based in Westborough, Massachusetts. The entire
euro-denominated money fund industry has about 108 billion
euros, Crane Data&#8217;s statistics show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BlackRock&#8217;s Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other global liquidity funds are at risk of being
closed, &#8220;but we will not hesitate to restrict investments if we
feel the market environment warrants such action in order to
protect the interests of existing shareholders,&#8221; JPMorgan said
on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock is restricting subscriptions into two funds in
its Institutional Cash Series, the Institutional Euro Liquidity
Fund and the Institutional Euro Government Liquidity Fund,
Jessica Greaney, a spokeswoman for the firm, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re continuing to monitor the situation and evaluate
options that are consistent with the best interest of fund
shareholders,&#8221; Greaney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$2.5 Trillion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguard Group Inc., the world&#8217;s largest mutual-fund firm,
closed two money funds in 2009 and the funds have remained
closed, spokesman John Woerth said in an e-mail. The two funds,
Vanguard Admiral Treasury Money Market Fund and the Vanguard
Federal Money Market Fund, have about $18 billion in assets,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based firm said at the time
of the closing that the action was taken to protect existing
shareholders. Vanguard has $1.8 trillion in U.S. mutual fund
assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, based in Boston, restricted
investments in four of its money market funds in December 2008.
The funds were reopened in July 2010, spokesman Adam Banker said
in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We took those measures because we believed they were in
the interests of the funds&#8217; shareholders at the time,&#8221; Banker
wrote. Boston-based Fidelity had $403 billion in money fund
assets of May 31, according to Crane Data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2.5 trillion U.S. money fund industry has been
wrestling with the impact of low interest rates since the
Federal Reserve cut rates to near zero in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrywide revenue fell from about $12.5 billion in 2008
to $4.7 billion in 2012, according to Crane Data. Yields that
reached 5 percent in 2007 today average about 0.06 percent,
President Peter Crane, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have lost hundreds of billions of dollars of
interest income,&#8221; Crane said. While industry profits have been
squeezed, very few major players have left the business, Crane
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong authorities seized a record
649 kilograms of cocaine worth HK$760 million ($98 million) from
a container that originated in Ecuador, the government said
today. Three people were arrested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cocaine haul, the biggest seizure from a single bust in
Hong Kong, was found after the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration told local authorities suspicious shipments were
headed for the city, Hong Kong customs drug investigator John
Lee said at a briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs were believed to be en route to China and
southeast Asia, Lee said. Hong Kong customs agents have been
working with the DEA and South American authorities since the
start of the year to combat drug trafficking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to be a step ahead of the traffickers,&#8221; Lee
said. &#8220;It is uncommon that containers are used to ship drugs,
but the volume in each shipment is very large.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hong Kong is not a drug transport hub,&#8221; Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong police seized HK$600 million worth of cocaine in
an operation last September. On July 3, a 63-year-old man
arriving from Sao Paulo, Brazil, was arrested after agents found
almost two kilograms of cocaine worth HK$2.2 million hidden in
his underwear and shoes, according to the customs agency
website. &lt;/p&gt;

saying where it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;

funds. The writ could be filed as early as today in London&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Israeli technology developers are
poised to lure global acquirers after International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) entered the market, said Shlomo Kramer, who co-founded the world&#8217;s second-largest security
networks maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel is a &#8220;clear target for mergers and acquisitions
because the quality of innovation is at par with the best areas
in the world,&#8221; Kramer, the chairman of Imperva Inc. who helped
found Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP), said by phone on
July 6 from Tel Aviv. &#8220;Even when times are tough, Israel&#8217;s
technology is at the top of the list for major organizations
looking to spend on innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel is the second-biggest source of foreign listings on
the Nasdaq Stock Market behind China and technology developers
led gains on the Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN) this year,
with Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)&#8217;s share price more than
doubling. The gauge was little changed last week and is up 0.9
percent this year. The TA-25 fell 0.6 percent at the close in
Tel Aviv today, bringing the drop for the year to 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mounting interest in Israeli technology has surfaced this
year as initial public offerings remain dormant and companies
seek quicker access to cash, Kramer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said on Jan. 31 that it will buy New York-based
Worklight Inc., while Apple acquired Herzliya-based Anobit
Technologies Ltd. on Jan. 10. EMC Corp. purchased Herzliya,
Israel-based XtremeIO for $430 million in May. Caesar Stone Sdot
Yam Ltd. (CSTE), a maker of stone products, was the only company to
hold an initial public offering in New York this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook, Intel Acquire &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 82 deals totaling $5.4 billion in 2012, Israel is the
No. 2 take-over target in the Middle East and Africa after
Egypt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covidien Plc (COV) bought Oridion Systems Ltd., the Israeli
medical-safety device maker, on July 3 for a cash payment of
$295 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB), owner of the world&#8217;s largest social-
networking website, last month acquired Face.com, the Israeli
maker of technology that helps users tag photos and find images
online by distinguishing facial features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC), the largest semiconductor maker, bought
Israeli security company Insightix Ltd. for $5 million in cash
in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Key Players&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of key players like Apple and Intel that
love the Israeli technology,&#8221; Alon Harnoy, head of mergers and
acquisitions at Shiboleth LLP, said in an interview at Bloomberg
headquarters in New York on June 27. &#8220;The trend of acquisitions
by the big tech names is going to continue as more companies try
to establish a presence there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to Switzerland&#8217;s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after
China. The nation is also home to more startup companies per
capita than the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 companies globally, including at least 13
technology companies representing a total deal size of $1.17
billion, postponed or withdrew initial public offerings this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average size
of those deals was about $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caesar Stone, which had its initial share offering in New
York on March 21, has added 9 percent to $12 since the listing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mellanox Leads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellanox, based in Yokneam Elit, Israel, is the best
performing New York-traded Israeli stock this year with a gain
of 127 percent to $73.72. The Tel Aviv shares have surged 135
percent. They were down 3.9 percent today to 292 shekels, or the
equivalent of $73.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perrigo (PRGO), the largest U.S. over-the-counter drugmaker, fell
0.2 percent to $118.08 in New York on July 6, paring its five-
day advance to 0.1 percent. The Tel Aviv shares lost 1 percent
to 464 shekels, or $117.58. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Allegan, Michigan-based drugmaker was downgraded to
equal weight from overweight at Morgan Stanley, according to a
July 6 report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a
fan of Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Minnie Mouse and &#8220;Beauty and the
Beast.&#8221; The feeling isn&#8217;t mutual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim and a crew of clapping generals watched a performance
on July 6 by a band whose members dressed as Winnie the Pooh,
Tigger, Minnie Mouse and other characters, according to footage
shown on KRT, the country&#8217;s state-run television. Women in
strapless gowns and black dresses performed while clips of
movies such as &#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; and &#8220;Dumbo&#8221; played on
a paneled backdrop for the show in the capital of Pyongyang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney didn&#8217;t authorize or license the totalitarian state&#8217;s
use of company characters for the concert, Michelle Bergman, a
spokeswoman for the Burbank, California-based company said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since succeeding his late father Kim Jong Il in December,
Kim further isolated his impoverished country by launching a
long-range rocket in April that squelched a deal for U.S. food
aid. Thought to be under 30, the new leader has worked to
bolster his image through visits to military units and by
rebuking officials over their management of an amusement park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim has ignored U.S. and South Korean appeals to abandon
his country&#8217;s nuclear program. His regime is building a new
launchpad in the northwest to fire larger long-range rockets and
has resumed construction of a light-water atomic reactor,
according to the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins
School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Grandiose Plan&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-run Korean Central News Agency made no mention of
the Disney films or characters, saying only that the concert by
the band, called Moranbong, included the traditional folk tune
&#8220;Arirang&#8221; and upbeat foreign songs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim &#8220;organized the Moranbong band as required by the new
century, prompted by a grandiose plan to bring about a dramatic
turn in the field of literature and arts this year,&#8221; KCNA said
in its account of the concert. &#8220;The performers showed well the
indomitable spirit and mental power of the servicepersons and
people of the DPRK dashing ahead for the final victory in the
drive to build a thriving nation under the guidance of Kim Jong
Un.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DPRK refers to the country&#8217;s official name, the Democratic
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission&#8217;s probe of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) demonstrates a
renewed focus on market manipulation as the agency beefs up its
oversight of the multibillion dollar energy-trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC on July 2 sued New York-based JPMorgan to release
e-mails, revealing an investigation of possible gaming of power
markets in California and the Midwest. Since January 2011 the
agency has announced 11 probes of alleged manipulation in
electricity and natural gas markets and a record $245 million
settlement with Constellation Energy Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency issued in December a preliminary determination
that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) manipulated the California power market.
In April, the FERC issued a notice of alleged violations to
Barclays Plc. (BARC) Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Amanda Williams and
Barclays spokesman Michael O&#8217;Looney declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see a fairly steady activity in the enforcement area,&#8221;
Susan Court, a former director of the FERC&#8217;s Office of
Enforcement, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There is a theme
here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, the FERC created a division within its
enforcement office to police the markets, where electricity is
bought and sold by power generators and utilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it will buy
Perceptive Pixel Inc., a maker of large touch-screen display
monitors that can be used by multiple people at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to sell Perceptive Pixel&#8217;s large screens,
which can run its latest operating system, Windows 8, the
Redmond, Washington-based software company said at a conference
in Toronto today. Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a lot riding on the success of Windows 8, due
to be released later this year. Perceptive Pixel&#8217;s 82-inch
multi-touch screen, used by customers including news broadcaster
CNN and oil-services provider Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), can respond to
finger movements and a stylus at the same time, helping users
mimic real-world work environments, according to the company&#8217;s
website. It will be another vehicle for Windows 8 sales to big
customers such as corporations and schools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just a very big Windows 8 tablet, but people &#8216;Ooh
and ah&#8217; at it,&#8221; Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer
said at the conference. &#8220;Our challenge is to make that
technology more affordable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The displays currently sell for about $80,000, he said. The
screens can connect to standard corporate computers and already
work with Windows 8; Microsoft demonstrated one running the
program at a conference in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 will be shipped to manufacturers the first week
in August and go on sale by the end of October, Microsoft said
today. In the coming year, Microsoft expects to sell &#8220;a few
million&#8221; units of its Surface tablet, Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Election Use &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perceptive Pixel Founder Jeff Han, who demonstrated multi-
touch technology at the TED conference in 2006, will join
Microsoft, with his team becoming part of the company&#8217;s Office
division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company gained prominence in 2008 when
cable-news network CNN used one of its displays as a large
interactive U.S. map for presidential election coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Han, who says many of his company&#8217;s biggest customers
are top-secret defense and government projects, wants to take
the products more mainstream. To do that, he needs Microsoft&#8217;s
muscle and better integration with Office programs like the
OneNote note-taking application and Lync conferencing software,
he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects the acquisition to close this summer, and
it will work hard to lower the price of Perceptive Pixel
products, Giovanni Mezgec, a Microsoft general manager, said in
an interview. He declined to give a specific month or say how
much lower the prices may fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to make this mainstream,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will do
anything possible to get the cost down and to get new forms of
this out in the market places in any way possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg, the
former chief executive officer of American International Group
Inc. (AIG), said it is &#8220;outrageous&#8221; that lawmakers demanded JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon testify about trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many companies have transactions that go bad,&#8221; Greenberg
said today on &#8220;In the Loop With Betty Liu&#8221; on Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s not paraded down to Washington to
testify.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon told the Senate Banking Committee last month that he
was too complacent overseeing bets with credit derivatives at
the bank&#8217;s chief investment office in London and that trades
intended as hedges &#8220;changed into something I cannot publicly
defend.&#8221; He said the bank has the financial strength to
withstand the losses, which were at least $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, was among
lawmakers who criticized the New York-based bank for taking too
much risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see consumer lenders in Columbus losing
their jobs because cowboys in London make too many risky bets,&#8221;
Brown said last month, referring to 19,000 JPMorgan employees in
his state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He handled it OK,&#8221; Greenberg said of Dimon, 56. &#8220;It was
really outrageous to have the CEO come down and testify before
Congress because of a transaction that didn&#8217;t work out well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a bank spokesman, declined to comment. A
spokeswoman for the lender said in May, when Dimon agreed to
testify, that the bank will be open and transparent with
regulators and Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers have been pushing firms to account for losses
after government rescues amid the 2008 financial crisis. Dimon
has repaid U.S. funds while New York-based AIG, once the world&#8217;s
largest insurer, is majority-owned by the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg joins Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein in cautioning against a backlash against occasional
losses by financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you put too much penalty on risk judgment, what kind
of world are you going to have?&#8221; Blankfein, 57, said last month
in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg, 87, was forced to retire from AIG in 2005 after
38 years running the insurer. He&#8217;s now chairman and CEO of C.V.
Starr  Co., an investment and insurance company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg was called to testify about losses at AIG that
led to a 2008 government rescue that swelled to $182.3 billion.
He missed the hearing that year because of an illness and
submitted prepared testimony in which he blamed successors for
AIG&#8217;s downfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Virtually Destroyed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I left AIG, the company operated in 130 countries
and employed approximately 92,000 people,&#8221; Greenberg said in a
written statement to the House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform in Washington. &#8220;The company we built up over
almost four decades has been virtually destroyed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg said in today&#8217;s interview that occasional losses
are common in banking. Still, financial firms shouldn&#8217;t make
risky bets with deposits, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you ought to use depositors&#8217; money to do
transactions that may have risk,&#8221; Greenberg said. &#8220;You can do
that by having a separate subsidiary that&#8217;s capitalized by
itself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. say a weaker-than-forecast June jobs gain in the
U.S. will lead the Federal Reserve to keep its benchmark
interest rate at almost zero until the middle of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed, which has pledged to hold the rate low through at
least late 2014, will amend its so-called forward guidance
before deciding on a new round of bond purchases, according to
the companies. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are two of the
21 primary dealers that trade directly with the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The &#8216;late 2014&#8217; formulation has now &#8216;aged&#8217; by six months
since it was first adopted, but the economy still looks no
better,&#8221; Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs in
New York, wrote in a report yesterday. The central bank may
announce the change as soon as its next policy meeting July 31
to Aug. 1, Hatzius wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Ben S. Bernanke faces jobs growth that slowed in
the second quarter to one-third the pace of the prior three
months. The gain in June was 80,000, the Labor Department
reported July 6, versus 100,000 projected by a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. Bernanke hasn&#8217;t ruled out more bond
purchases, and he said June 20 that more easing probably will be
needed unless there is &#8220;sustained improvement in the labor
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asset Purchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing, known as QE1 and QE2, from 2008
to 2011 to support the economy. In September it embarked on a
plan to replace $400 billion of short-maturity Treasuries in its
portfolio with longer-term debt to cap long-term borrowing
costs. It expanded the effort, known as Operation Twist, on June
20 by $267 billion and extended it until year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy setting Federal Open Market Committee will
probably implement a new round of asset purchases when Operation
Twist ends, according to Hatzius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on retail sales, industrial production and orders for
durable goods will determine when the Fed acts, Michelle Meyer
and Joshua Dennerlein, economists at Bank of America in New
York, wrote in their report July 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In our view, the next step is to push out the forward
guidance from late-2014 to mid-2015, followed by further asset
purchases of $500 billion,&#8221; the economists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yields Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields declined one basis point
today to 1.54 percent as of 7:20 a.m. in London, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They are approaching the all-time
low of 1.44 percent set June 1. The price of the 1.75 percent
security due in May 2022 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 30/32. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the Fed&#8217;s target for overnight bank
lending, known as the funds rate, and five-year yields is
shrinking. The spread has narrowed to 38 basis points from this
year&#8217;s high of 94 basis points in March. The gap was 37 basis
points on June 1, the least since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the Fed rate and 10-year yields
narrowed to 1.29 percentage points from 2.13 in March. Money
managers usually demand higher rates to invest for longer terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Forward guidance brings down bond yields not only via a
lower expected funds rate, but also via a smaller term
premium,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s Hatzius wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies  Co.
in New York, predicts the Fed will announce QE3 at its December
meeting, unless the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe or political
wrangling over the budget deficit in the U.S. curtails growth
and prompts action sooner. Jefferies is another primary dealer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re not even forecasting sustained improvement in the
labor market, so my interpretation of that is that they expect
to do more,&#8221; McCarthy said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to do it now
that they&#8217;ve already put something else in place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with shoppers, so with nations:
What they buy reveals what they need and desire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s acquisitions in recent years have included tons of
copper inside a Peruvian mountain, 20 years&#8217; worth of Russian
crude, and vast tracts of fertile land across Africa and South
America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of conquest couldn&#8217;t be clearer. The Chinese
have embarked on a &#8220;commodity crusade,&#8221; becoming the
preeminent buyer of resources ranging from metals to foodstuffs,
as Dambisa Moyo writes in &#8220;Winner Take All,&#8221; a book that
investor Jim Rogers calls a must read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astonishing thing, judging from this jeremiad, isn&#8217;t
that China is locking in supplies. The real curiosity is that
other nations aren&#8217;t doing more to stave off potential shortages
of food, energy and water as surging populations and wealth put

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With precision, execution and foresight, China is doing

millions of Africans instead of helping them. In &#8220;How the West

their lead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB, the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said second-quarter profit
fell 16 percent on a reduction in the value of its wireless
investment. Sales beat analysts&#8217; forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income slid to 1.4 billion pesos ($105 million), from
1.66 billion pesos a year earlier, Televisa said today in a
filing to Mexico&#8217;s stock exchange. Sales rose 12 percent to 17
billion pesos, topping the average estimate of 16.6 billion
pesos by seven analysts tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa recorded financial costs of 945 million pesos in
the quarter, double last year&#8217;s total, mostly for a reduction in
the value of its $1.6 billion investment in Grupo Iusacell SA,
Mexico&#8217;s third-largest wireless carrier. The writedown for
accounting purposes didn&#8217;t involve a cash expense. The
broadcaster, based in Mexico City, acquired a 50 percent stake
in the mobile-phone company last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising for Televisa&#8217;s over-the-air channels was little
changed from a year earlier at 5.57 billion pesos, even after a
Mexican law banned government advertising before the nation&#8217;s
presidential elections on July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite the impact that the electoral campaign had in
Mexico during the quarter, and consequently the temporary
absence of certain advertisers, sales growth beat our
expectations,&#8221; Julio Zetina, an analyst at Vector Casa de Bolsa
SA in Mexico City, said today in a research note. &#8220;This was a
good report.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa boosted its forecast for 2012 sales in the content
unit, which includes broadcast advertising, syndication revenue
and sales from Televisa&#8217;s cable channels. Content revenue will
rise 7 percent to 8 percent in 2012, compared with an earlier
forecast for growth of 6 percent to 7 percent, said Alfonso de Angoitia, executive vice president, today in a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company added 267,090 satellite TV subscribers for a
total of 4.55 million. Its three cable units, all controlled by
Televisa, added more than 14,500 video subscribers, 36,100
Internet customers and 15,400 phone lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose 0.9 percent to 57.06 pesos at the close in
Mexico City. The shares have dropped 2.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index rose 0.2 percent to 40,049.59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Pochteca SAB (POCHTECB)  fell 7.2 percent to 2.85
pesos, trimming recent gains in the stock after growth optimism
spurred a 33 percent rally in the two days ended July 6. Antonio
del Valle, who invested in a 300 million peso ($22.5 million)
capital increase for Pochteca in April, said in an interview
published July 4 that the company would pursue acquisition-
driven growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, rose 0.9 percent to 57.06 pesos.
Sales increased 12 percent in the second quarter to 17 billion
pesos, beating the average estimate of 16.6 billion pesos by
seven analysts tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB (WALMEXV MM), Latin America&#8217;s
largest retailer, gained 1.8 percent to 35.45 pesos. The
company&#8217;s same-store sales rose 5.3 percent in June, according
to a statement e-mailed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s multibillion-
dollar trading loss exposed an industry practice that U.S.
regulators are now likely to clamp down on: Banks keep investors
in the dark about how they calculate trading risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing
JPMorgan&#8217;s belated May 10 disclosure that a change to its
mathematical model for gauging trading risk helped fuel the loss
in its chief investment office. While the SEC would have to
prove that the biggest U.S. bank improperly kept important
information from investors, regulators probably will press Wall
Street firms to tell more about the risks they&#8217;re taking, three
former SEC lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC and investors are learning that apparently the
compliance folks and financial folks at very senior levels at
JPMorgan do not think it&#8217;s important to share really significant
modeling changes,&#8221; said Elizabeth Nowicki, a former attorney in
the SEC general counsel&#8217;s office who&#8217;s now an associate law
professor at Tulane University in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, New York-based JPMorgan has added a warning in its
most recent quarterly report that risk models are continually
tweaked to account for &#8220;improvements&#8221; in modeling techniques,
and the head of the SEC has publicly asserted that banks should
disclose significant changes and the reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and the U.S.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agreed to let a magistrate
judge handle their dispute over the production of e-mails sought
by the agency in a probe of possible manipulation of energy
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a one-sentence joint filing yesterday in federal court
in Washington, JPMorgan and the agency accepted a judge&#8217;s
suggestion that the case be assigned to a magistrate judge &#8220;for
all purposes&#8221; with any appeal going directly to the U.S. Court
of Appeals in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the filing was submitted, U.S. District Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ordered that the case be assigned to a
magistrate judge, noting in her order that one would be selected
at random by the court clerk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC sued JPMorgan on July 2 to release the e-mails in an
investigation of possible manipulation of power markets in
California and the Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp.
FERC opened the probe in August after complaints from California
and Midwest grid operators that JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding practices
were abusive, according to the agency&#8217;s initial court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU to Propose Single Supervisor for All Banks, Barnier Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single supervisor for banks called for by euro-area
leaders last month should oversee all lenders in the bloc, not
only those deemed to be systemically important, Michel Barnier
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new supervisory mechanism should be in place by the end
of the year as part of plans for a banking union to help tame
the euro debt crisis, Barnier, the EU&#8217;s internal market
commissioner, said at a hearing in Brussels yesterday. The body
should, at a minimum, supervise banks in all 17 countries that
use the single currency, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it will need to cover all banks, of course,&#8221;
Barnier told lawmakers in the European Parliament&#8217;s economic and
monetary affairs committee. Responsibilities could be delegated
to national regulators through decentralization, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro leaders said on June 29 that it&#8217;s &#8220;imperative to
break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.&#8221; To this
end, they said that once a single supervisor, involving the
European Central Bank, is established, the euro area&#8217;s permanent
bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, could
recapitalize banks directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders called on the European Commission to present
proposals for a single bank supervisor &#8220;shortly.&#8221; Barnier said
the commission will unveil its plan in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;European Banks Able to Meet Capital Targets, Bank Watchdog Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks reached a target of raising 114.7 billion
euros ($141 billion) in fresh capital by the end of June,
according to a European Union document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;capital shortfall&#8221; has &#8220;been largely raised from
private sources and where necessary public backstops were
activated,&#8221; according to a memorandum prepared for EU finance
ministers for a Brussels meeting today that was obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Banking Authority told lenders to meet a core
Tier-1 capital ratio of 9 percent by the end of June, and hold
additional reserves, called a sovereign buffer, against the debt
of weaker euro-area countries, based upon the market price of
the bonds. The measures were part of a response to the sharp
fall in the value of securities issued by euro-area governments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The EBA exercise was a necessary step on the road to
repair banks&#8217; balance sheets and strengthen their capital
base,&#8221; the document said. &#8220;The recommendation will remain in
force until the normalization of risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preliminary report will be released tomorrow, according
to the document, with more detailed results to be published in
September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franca Rosa Congiu, a spokeswoman for the EBA in London,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone voice-mail message seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tucker Says No Public Official Told Him to Lean on Barclays &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker said no
government minister or official pressured him to instruct
Barclays Plc (BARC) or any other U.K. commercial bank to lowball its
Libor submissions during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; Tucker told lawmakers in London
yesterday, when asked if anybody from the civil service or the
then Labour government leaned on him to ask banks to lower their
Libor submissions. He also said some of a memo written by former
Barclays Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond after an October
2008 phone call between the two gave &#8220;the wrong impression.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker&#8217;s two-hour testimony followed the record 290
million-pound ($449 million) fine imposed on Barclays last month
for manipulation of the London interbank offered rate. The
scandal, which Tucker described as a &#8220;cesspit,&#8221; has
jeopardized his position as the front-runner to replace Mervyn
King as governor of the Bank of England. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vivendi Reviews Due as Agency Toughens Policing of Mergers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s Antitrust Authority will decide by July 24 whether
to approve the revised union of Vivendi SA (VIV)&#8217;s Canal Plus pay-
television unit with Television Par Satellite, its chief said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator in September canceled the 2006 deal after
finding that Canal Plus hadn&#8217;t met all the conditions imposed to
ensure the merger didn&#8217;t harm competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in the deal are seeking diversity in the pay-TV
industry, a greater range of packages for consumers, and steps
that don&#8217;t &#8220;destabilize&#8221; the film industry, Bruno Lasserre,
the agency&#8217;s chief, said yesterday in Paris. The regulator won&#8217;t
require the company to sell off its CanalSat distribution arm,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Authority has taken a tough stand on merger approval
since 2009, when it took responsibility for authorizing deals
from the finance ministry. So far this year, it has imposed
conditions on seven deals, the same number as in 2011 and 2010
combined. The regulator has also fined companies for not living
up to the conditions of merger authorizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its cancellation of the Vivendi merger was the first time
the Authority has done so for failure to comply with terms. The
authority also imposed a 30 million-euro ($37 million) fine on
Canal Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Vivendi, Canal Plus and Bigard didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls seeking comment on the regulator&#8217;s
actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan Checking Possible Insider Trading of ANA, Official Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s securities watchdog is examining possible insider
trading of All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) shares before last week&#8217;s
announcement of a public offering, a government official with
direct knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission is
studying share movements before the July 3 announcement and will
conduct hearings to determine whether underwriters leaked
information, said the official, who requested anonymity as the
investigation is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese regulators are cracking down on insider trading
after finding that employees of firms including Nomura Holdings
Inc. (8604) tipped off clients about share sales they managed in 2010.
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said such leaks may be &#8220;more than a
rare occurrence&#8221; and the loss of confidence from the scandal
will damage local securities firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading volume of All Nippon Airways shares reached a
three-month high the day before news of the 211 billion yen
($2.6 billion) issuance became public, led by short-selling,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The moves were
&#8220;unnatural,&#8221; ANA spokesman Ryosei Nomura said on July 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANA&#8217;s Nomura said the airline currently has no plan to take
action after receiving assurances from the four underwriters --
Nomura Holdings, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) -- that they didn&#8217;t leak information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen at the four banks declined to comment. An SESC
spokesman who asked not to be named also declined to comment,
saying he wasn&#8217;t authorized to discuss individual companies with
the media. ANA spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka said the carrier is
unaware of the regulator&#8217;s examination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANA, Japan&#8217;s biggest carrier, announced its share sale at 4
p.m. on July 3. Investors traded 24 million ANA shares on the
previous day, the most since March 27, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The stock declined as much as 2.7 percent
on July 2 before closing 0.9 percent lower, while the benchmark
Topix Index dropped 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dendreon, Prostate Drug Maker, Sued Over 2011 Stock Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendreon Corp. (DNDN), the maker of the prostate-cancer medicine
Provenge, was sued by an investor claiming the company withheld
information about sales that led to a 2011 share price drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company officers and directors misused proprietary
information about Provenge, which costs $93,000 per therapy
cycle, by not revealing that doctors were reluctant to prescribe
it because they had to pay up front and may have trouble getting
reimbursed from Medicaid or private insurers, Investor Herbert
Silverberg claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reimbursement issue was &#8220;a consistent topic of concern
internally,&#8221; while officials &#8220;touted lofty goals&#8221; for the
drug, according to the Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed
yesterday in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provenge was approved in the U.S. in 2010 as the first
therapy designed to train the body&#8217;s immune system to attack
cancer cells as if they were a virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year, the company &#8220;acknowledged that
acceptance of Provenge would be a much more gradual process,&#8221;
than first thought, according to the complaint. Dendreon shares
fell 67 percent, from $35.84 on Aug. 3 to $11.69 the next day,
plaintiff&#8217;s lawyers contend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the so-called derivative lawsuit, Silverberg asks a
judge to award damages from officials to the company,
&#8220;disgorgement of all profits&#8221; from wrongdoing and positive
corporate governance provisions to protect shareholders in the
future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it is our practice not to comment on litigation, we
believe this suit is baseless and without merit,&#8221; Lindsay
Rocco, a spokeswoman for Dendreon, said in an e-mailed message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Silverberg v. Gold, CA7646, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL)  fell 8.2 percent to 163.32

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL), Latin America&#8217;s
largest bottler of the soft drink, plunged the most in three
years after executives at companies the soda maker bought out
last year sold a portion of their stakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 8.2 percent to 163.32 pesos at the close of
trading, the biggest decline since February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge in selling volume reflects moves by some former
owners of bottlers acquired by the company in 2011 to trim their
stakes, said Jose Castro, head of investor relations at Coca-
Cola Femsa. Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to acquire three Mexican Coke
bottlers in 2011, paying for them with shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we are seeing today is certain family members
monetizing the shares,&#8221; Castro said in a telephone interview
from Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first minute of trading, Morgan Stanley executed
a trade for 2.25 million shares at 166.93 pesos, 6.2 percent
below yesterday&#8217;s close. Daily trading volume increased to 5.4
million shares, almost seven times the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors selling multi-million share blocks of thinly-
traded stocks should expect to receive a below-market rate, said
Carlos Ponce, an analyst with Grupo Financiero Ve Por Mas SA.
Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s volume yesterday was less than 1 percent of
America Movil SAB, Mexico&#8217;s most-traded stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottler&#8217;s stock rallied 34 percent this year through
yesterday, probably making the sellers more willing to accept a
lower price, according to Ponce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the accumulated profit, they probably decided they
were willing to do it with this discount,&#8221; Ponce said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a

&lt;p&gt;When 70-year-old Bill Price signed
on in 2006 to become one of the early testers of the Alzheimer&#8217;s
drug bapineuzumab, he held high hopes the injections would stop
the disease that was starting to claim his memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intended to eliminate plaques in the brain that are a
hallmark of the illness, bapineuzumab is a project of Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Elan Corp. (ELN) The three companies are
racing Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) to market the first broadly available
drug designed to target a cause of Alzheimer&#8217;s, rather than just
its symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Price, the drug was a disappointment. He left the trial
early after experiencing headaches and hallucinations, side
effects that may have been due to brain swelling. Such drawbacks
aren&#8217;t the only issue facing bapineuzumab. Early data suggests
that even if it shrinks plaques, the drug may not greatly aid
cognition. Price is hopeful the study&#8217;s final data will show
that other patients were helped though he was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see the handwriting on the wall,&#8221; Price, a former
teacher who lives in Opelika, Alabama, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;I&#8217;m desperately trying to do whatever I can to keep
the disease in check. I feel the onslaught.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While details of late-stage data on the two drugs aren&#8217;t
scheduled to be reported before October, the therapies will be
discussed among researchers and geriatric specialists at next
week&#8217;s Alzheimer&#8217;s Association International Conference in
Vancouver, according to William Thies, the chief medical and
scientific officer of the Chicago-based Alzheimer&#8217;s Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shared Urgency &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients, doctors, drugmakers and investors share Price&#8217;s
sense of urgency. If the drugs work well, they could be paired
with recent testing advances to alter the landscape of health
care in the U.S., curbing an illness that may affect 16 million
Americans by 2050, an increase from 5.4 million now, according
to U.S. health officials. In 2012, the cost of care for those
with the disease will be $200 billion, the association said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alzheimer&#8217;s disease ends your dignity, separates you from
all your resources and torments your family,&#8221; Thies said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There is more and more concern that we
can&#8217;t afford the end stage that we are going to experience in
the middle of the century. Its impact on various segments of the
economy is becoming clearer and clearer as the cost it presents
to Medicare and Medicaid goes up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Industry Spur &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatments may help reinvigorate an industry grappling
with patent losses estimated to wipe out $171 billion in sales
by 2015, according to research group IMS Health, based in
Norwalk, Connecticut. The market could quickly exceed $10
billion a year, said David Heupel, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-
based portfolio manager with Thrivant Financial for Lutherans,
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In large-cap health care, that&#8217;s about as big as it
gets,&#8221; Heupel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the drugs fail, it may be years before the next
promising therapy comes into focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at the ISI group in New York,
gives only a 25 percent chance of approval for bapineuzumab from
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ, New York-based Pfizer and
Elan, based in Dublin. Indianapolis-based Lilly&#8217;s solanezumab
has a 15 percent chance, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ rose less than 1 percent to $67.90 at the close in New
York, while Pfizer dipped less than 1 percent to $22.34. Elan&#8217;s
American depositary receipts fell less than 1 percent to $13.68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs are based on one of the first research strategies
designed to combat the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After autopsies of Alzheimer&#8217;s victims showed an
accumulation of beta amyloid plaques in their brains, drugmakers
began focusing on that as a potential cause. Since then, other
contributing factors have surfaced, including the
overdevelopment of a different protein, known as tau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bapineuzumab and solanezumab &#8220;represent a crucial test of
the current dogma,&#8221; Jordan Holtzman, a professor of medicine at
the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said by telephone.
&#8220;If they fail to show a significant benefit, it would be
imperative for the pharmaceutical industry to search for new
models.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only therapy on the immediate horizon that has shown
success against the illness in mid-stage human trials is Baxter
International Inc. (BAX)&#8217;s Gammagard, an expensive, relatively scarce
treatment derived from donated blood plasma that replaces
antibodies in people whose immune systems can&#8217;t protect them
from infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gammagard Results &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not clear precisely how Gammagard, on the market for
years, works against Alzheimer&#8217;s. Early results suggest it may
raise the level of antibodies to beta amyloid in the blood and
spinal fluid of patients. The Deerfield, Illinois-based company
is betting the result will be to slow or stop the disease and a
final-phase study may be completed next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach targets the tau protein that was first
characterized in 1975. By the mid-1980s, it was thought to play
a role in some brain disorders. It wasn&#8217;t until the 1990s,
though, that evidence began to accumulate that tau deposits more
closely reflected a patient&#8217;s mental state than beta amyloid
plaques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its healthy form, tau helps supply nutrients to cells in
the brain. When damaged, it becomes tangled, chopping off the
supply lines and becoming part of the mass of plaques seen in
the brains of people with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Singapore&#8217;s TauRx &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closely held company, TauRx, based in Singapore, is
developing drugs based on the tau model. TauRx&#8217;s tau aggregation
inhibitors have been tested in Phase 2 clinical trials, and the
company plans to make an announcement about its Phase 3 clinical
trials later this year, said Claude Wischik, the executive
chairman and co-founder of the company, in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other theories are being explored, including malfunctioning
mitochondria, the part of cells that convert nutrients into
energy. The brain may also start using insulin inefficiently,
leading some to speculate the condition is &#8220;diabetes of the
brain.&#8221; Others are examining whether the coating that protects
nerves in the brain, called myelin, has been damaged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if bapineuzumab and solanezumab are found in the
latest studies not to work, they shouldn&#8217;t be dismissed, said
Randall Bateman, a professor of neurology at Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings may just be a reflection of bad timing, while
the brain-swelling that chased Bill Price away from the trial
may be an immune reaction that must be monitored but will likely
dim over time, Bateman said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Too Late&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs may have been given &#8220;too late, after other
degenerative processes have already begun or there&#8217;s too much
damage done,&#8221; he said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s like treating a heart-attack patient with a
cholesterol-lowering statin, he said: While that may prevent
future damage, it doesn&#8217;t reverse trauma that already occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials are being planned to evaluate whether earlier
intervention will help people who are at added risk for
Alzheimer&#8217;s due to family history or because they carry certain
biomarkers for the disease without showing impairment. Those
trials will be discussed at the Vancouver meeting, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impetus for the newer studies is that it&#8217;s still not
clear when it&#8217;s best to begin treatment, said Bateman, who is an
investigator in the planned clinical trials. Brain changes that
presage Alzheimer&#8217;s begin about 15 years to 20 years before
patients become symptomatic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Very Valuable &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials involving bapineuzumab and solanezumab &#8220;will be
very valuable whether the drugs work or not,&#8221; said Thies of the
Alzheimer&#8217;s Association. &#8220;If they work, that leads us
relatively quickly to a therapeutic. There would be great
pressure to treat people as early as possible, to stabilize them
at the highest quality of life possible, and lower costs because
they won&#8217;t need as much care.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they don&#8217;t work, &#8220;it rapidly tells us that maybe we
need to change the way we are using these medications or the
kinds of medications we are testing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price, who taught English as a second language on an Indian
reservation in Arizona before retiring to Alabama, has an early
stage of the disease, he said. He is still able to drive, help
shop and prepare meals and contribute to his family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an effective treatment is found quickly, he and others
with a similar stage of the disease are most likely to benefit.
If not, he says he will try to participate in other clinical
trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I feel like before I go into oblivion, I want to help
other people and maybe even help myself if it&#8217;s not too late,&#8221;
Price said. &#8220;I want to help find an answer to the Alzheimer&#8217;s
dilemma.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, hired Andrew Williams, a former
U.S. Treasury Department spokesman, for its corporate
communications unit, said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams, 39, who currently works for General Electric Co. (GE),
will join New York-based Goldman Sachs as a vice president at
the end of the month, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to comment publicly.
Williams will report to David Wells, head of U.S. media
relations, the people said. The Financial Times reported the
hiring earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams joins about four months after Goldman Sachs hired
Richard L. &#8220;Jake&#8221; Siewert, another former aide to U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, to take charge of
corporate communications. Before Williams joined Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE, he worked for Geithner at Treasury and the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Geithner was president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former Goldman Sachs chief executive officers have
served as Treasury secretary and Geithner&#8217;s chief of staff, Mark Patterson, is a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist. The ties between
the firm and the government have led some to question whether
Goldman Sachs has too much influence on policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was discovered in 1976,
Mexico&#8217;s offshore Cantarell oil field was one of the world&#8217;s
largest, and it quickly became a money machine for Petroleos
Mexicanos, the giant state-owned oil company known as Pemex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this bonanza, Mexico became one of the top three
sources of crude for the U.S. and Pemex became the biggest
source of tax revenue for the government. Cantarell seemed to
justify Mexico&#8217;s expulsion of the big British and American oil
companies in 1938, and its policy ever since of forbidding
outside investors from exploring and producing in the country,
Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its July 16-22 edition. The
ban on major outside investment in Pemex is even enshrined in
the Mexican constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Cantarell&#8217;s output is shrinking. Pemex&#8217;s total
production declined to 2.5&#160;million barrels a day last year, from
3.4&#160;million in 2004, and in the last quarter oil exports to the
U.S. hit the lowest quarterly average since 1993. Pemex
estimates it has 27&#160;billion barrels of untapped oil in the
deepwater Gulf, but it is relying on limited in-house experience
and third-party technology to exploit it. So far it has failed
to find any commercially viable crude after 20 attempts. Pemex
lost $7.4&#160;billion last year on $126&#160;billion in revenue, its
fifth consecutive annual loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto has declared that
overhauling Pemex will be his &#8220;signature issue.&#8221; His
Institutional Revolutionary Party-led alliance wants outside oil
companies to invest in Pemex&#8217;s exploration and development
activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Extraordinary Step Forward&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He knows it would be an extraordinary step forward, as
extraordinary as was Nafta,&#8221; says historian Enrique Krauze,
referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was
implemented in 1994. Nafta spurred a sixfold increase in Mexican
sales to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of Pena Nieto allowing outside investment in
Mexico&#8217;s oil fields has caught the attention of companies such
as ExxonMobil. Mexico needs to open up to &#8220;partnerships and
collaborations and bringing technology&#8221; to bear on its
resources, ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerson said on June 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The interest would be huge from the international
standpoint, similar to Iraq,&#8221; says Jeremy Martin, an oil
specialist at the Institute of the Americas in La Jolla, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening up the oil sector may boost gross domestic product
by as much as 0.8&#160;percent a year, according to research firm
Capital Economics. Combined with the discovery of significant
amounts of shale gas in northern Mexico, tapping deepwater oil
could create an era of low energy costs for the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transform the Psychology &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inviting outsiders to invest in Pemex could also transform
the psychology of business in Mexico. To change Pemex, Pena
Nieto will have to challenge entrenched interests, from the
unions to local officials, who have all benefited from Pemex&#8217;s
largesse. If he succeeds he could tackle other monopolies and
duopolies in power generation, telecom, and cable television
that make life so expensive for Mexicans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not be easy for Pena Nieto to pull off an ambitious
reform of Pemex. The alliance led by his party, known in Mexico
as the PRI, will have 240 seats in the 500-seat lower house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves the PRI well short of the two-thirds majority
needed for constitutional changes to open up the oil industry to
private investment. One thing in Pena Nieto&#8217;s favor: The
National Action Party, or PAN, of outgoing President Felipe
Calderon may back his plans to reform Pemex. PAN Senator Ruben
Camarillo said on July 3 that his party favors opening the
energy industry and will support reforms that benefit Mexico
regardless of who proposes them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Consensus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular opinion is also starting to shift in favor of big
changes at Pemex. Brazil&#8217;s success in turning around its oil
industry and mastering the art of deepwater drilling has
Mexicans wondering why Pemex can&#8217;t do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&#8217;s fear of the so-called straw effect, in which
some oil deposits that straddle international boundaries in the
Gulf might be exploited first from the U.S. side, leaving no
crude by the time Pemex manages to obtain the technology and
experience it needs to produce from those depths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto has said he may present the needed
constitutional changes after the new congress begins work
Sept.&#160;1 and before he takes office Dec.&#160;1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may have gone some way toward building consensus for the
constitutional changes within the PRI party by consulting with
Pemex&#8217;s powerful oil workers&#8217; union and other labor groups,
which have traditionally supported the party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More investment means more jobs,&#8221; Pemex labor union
leader and PRI Senator-elect Carlos Romero Deschamps said in a
June 19 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president-to-be also has to woo holdouts in his own
party, which created Pemex. &#8220;Support from PRI factions is
fundamental to pass reform,&#8221; says Jorge Chabat, a political
science professor at the Center for Economic Research and
Teaching in Mexico City. Some party member may still be
&#8220;against the idea of opening the sector to foreign investment,
but at the end of the day they will fall into line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) eliminated several
hundred jobs, mostly in advertising sales and marketing, as part
of a review of staff tied to the start of a new fiscal year, a
person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company confirmed there were job cuts in a statement
yesterday without specifying the magnitude. In addition to
reductions in the advertising unit, a small number of jobs were
trimmed in several other businesses, said the person, who asked
not to be named because the details haven&#8217;t been disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has been
working to control expenses as personal-computer sales have
stagnated and its Internet-advertising business hasn&#8217;t generated
as much revenue as the company once expected. The lackluster
online performance prompted the company to record a $6.2 billion
writedown for the quarter that ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company is also facing higher
costs in areas such as marketing for its Windows 8 operating
system, due in October, and selling more software as an
Internet-based cloud service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Like any company, Microsoft continually evaluates its
operations and works to align the business to key priorities,&#8221;
according to the e-mailed statement. The company is &#8220;thinking
about the exciting new opportunities that Windows 8, Xbox and
Skype present for our advertising and marketing partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the staff who were notified that their jobs were cut
yesterday was advertising evangelist Mel Carson, one of the
public faces of Microsoft&#8217;s ad business. Carson announced his
firing on his personal blog and Twitter Inc.&#8217;s microblogging
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft in February cut a small percentage of marketing
positions after a review of that area that was designed to
reduce overlap and help the company more nimbly respond to
rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job cuts were reported yesterday by the Search Engine
Land website, which didn&#8217;t specify a number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trio of banks led by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) are planning about $1 billion of bonds tied to
Blackstone Group LP (BX)&#8217;s acquisition of the Motel 6 lodging chain,
according to three people familiar with the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction, which may be offered in October, will be
composed of debt taken on by the New York-based private-equity
firm to acquire the motels, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are preliminary. JPMorgan is
working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Citigroup Inc. (C) to arrange the
offering, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks are funneling cash to the most
creditworthy property owners, aiding borrowers and boosting
values even as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and slowing economic growth
in the U.S. fuel volatility in the $550 billion commercial-
mortgage bond market. Blackstone, with $48 billion in real-
estate assets, agreed to pay about $1.9 billion for Motel 6 in
May in the largest deal in the U.S. lodging industry since the
$3.93 billion acquisition of Extended Stay America Inc. in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, Amanda Williams of Deutsche Bank, Scott Helfman of Citigroup and Peter Rose of Blackstone, all based in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotel investments are attracting yield-starved investors as
the Federal Reserve&#8217;s unprecedented efforts to revive the
economy keeps interest rates near record lows for a fourth year.
The three banks have already sold $450 million in lower-ranking
mezzanine debt linked to the Motel 6 deal with yields ranging
from 7.5 percent to 10 percent, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, which is preparing to unload office buildings
acquired during the past six years, is adding to its holdings of
hospitality properties. The world&#8217;s largest private-equity firm
was part of the group that bought Extended Stay out of
bankruptcy, and it announced a $950 million deal to purchase
U.K.-based Mint Hotel in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone is buying Motel 6 and an extended-stay chain
called Studio 6 from Paris-based Accor SA, Europe&#8217;s largest
hotel operator. The acquisition includes 1,102 hotels in North
America with more than 107,000 rooms, Accor said in a May 22
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Motel 6 chain, known for the advertising slogan &#8220;We&#8217;ll
leave the light on for you,&#8221; was founded in 1962 in Santa
Barbara, California, taking its name from the original cost of a
night&#8217;s lodging, according to its website. The chain was bought
in the 1980s by New York-based private-equity firm KKR  Co.,
which sold it to Accor in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stunted Recovery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders have arranged about $15.8 billion of securities
tied to skyscrapers, shopping malls and hotel loans this year,
compared with $28 billion in all of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Forecasts for 2012 issuance range from
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)&#8217;s $25 billion to Credit Suisse Group AG&#8217;s
projection of as much as $45 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price swings on the debt, which can eat into banks&#8217; profit
margins on new deals, have stunted the market&#8217;s recovery after
being shut down during the credit crisis in 2008. Sales have
fallen from a record $232 billion in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index may extend its
climb beyond a two-year high after rising above a key technical
level, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge closed yesterday at 83.568, breaking through a
resistance level at 83.55 as it exceeded its June 1 high, Niall O&#8217;Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at the firm, wrote
today in a client note. It now may rise to 84.93, he said in an
interview. The dollar has gained as the euro and higher-yielding
currencies have slid amid European financial turmoil, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dollar&#8217;s strength has been through the euro&#8217;s
weakness, and the Dollar Index has been range-bound,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor
said. &#8220;Now, we&#8217;re starting to see other dollar pairs weaken
against the dollar, like we&#8217;ve seen in the commodity currencies
today, so it&#8217;s more confirmation of a broader dollar move.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index rose as much as 0.3 percent today to 83.829, the
highest since July 2010. The greenback strengthened against all
of its 16 most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg except
the yen. The Australian and New Zealand dollars, whose countries
export commodities, fell against most peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses the Dollar Index to
track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners. The 84.93 level, the highest since June 2010,
is the 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of a two-year decline.
A drop below 82.95 may signal a short-term end to the rally,
O&#8217;Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance is a level on a chart where sell orders may be
clustered. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices
increase or decrease by certain percentages after reaching new
highs or lows. In technical analysis, investors and analysts
study charts of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes
in a security, commodity, currency or index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was January 2011, and markets
were rallying around the globe, driven by optimism that the U.S.
and European economies were on the rebound. One rising stock was
Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS), the Denver-based asset management
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors were betting that Janus, with its lineup of
growth-oriented mutual funds, would benefit from the surge.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) analyst Kenneth Worthington disagreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sifting through Janus&#8217;s funds, he saw that returns had
begun to taper off about six months earlier, Bloomberg Markets
magazine reports in its August issue. Worse, the firm had
recently instituted so-called performance fees on a half dozen
of its funds, meaning that the funds pay fees to Janus Capital,
their &#8220;adviser,&#8221; based on performance against their benchmarks.
When fund performance lags, those fees decline, hitting profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Performance collapses, earnings collapse, the stock
collapses&#8221; was the scenario that Worthington says he saw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan analyst put a sell recommendation on Janus on
Jan. 7, 2011, when shares were trading at $13.45. The stock rose
as high as $14.54 in February before nose-diving, finishing the
year at $6.31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was one of the worst-performing stocks in the SP 500
last year, and we caught it all,&#8221; Worthington says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janus shares, since upgraded to a hold by Worthington,
 closed at $7.20 on July 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worthington&#8217;s sell call on Janus helped make him the top
U.S. stock picker of brokerage and asset management firms,
according to a ranking of U.S. stock analysts by consulting firm
Greenwich Associates in association with Bloomberg Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, under Americas equity research head Noelle Grainger, scored the largest number of highly ranked analysts,
making it the No. 1 firm in U.S.&#160;equities research. Bank of
America was No. 2, followed by Morgan Stanley. (MS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compile the ranking, Stamford, Connecticut-based
Greenwich Associates surveyed 980 buy-side analysts at 216
investment management firms, mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions
and insurers. The analysts were asked to name the Wall Street
research teams they considered their most important sources of
advice on investments in 58 industries. Those were winnowed to
35&#160;to ensure a statistically significant number of responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers were then weighted by the amount of trading
commissions each buy-side firm paid out to banks and brokerages
-- $30 million on average, or a total of $5.6 billion. A vote
for an analyst by a firm that paid $20 million in commissions
was thus given twice the weight of a firm that paid $10 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Secular Trends&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street research directors say it&#8217;s harder than ever to
earn money from the kinds of calls that Worthington made. Ever
since the credit crisis began to unfold in 2007, markets have
been driven by macroeconomic events that have little to do with
single-stock fundamental research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70 percent of a typical stock&#8217;s performance is
determined by forces linked to macroeconomic shifts rather than
issues specific to a company, such as earnings or management
changes, according to Morgan Stanley research completed in early
May. That compares with just 33&#160;percent in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a heck of a lot harder to make money on a stock-
specific basis in the short term,&#8221; says Stephen Penwell,
director of North American equity research at Morgan Stanley.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to identify secular trends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank and brokerage research directors say they&#8217;re confident
they can cut through the macro forces that are driving markets
to come up with useful investment advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Connecting Dots&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decline of Wall Street research is vastly overblown,&#8221;
JPMorgan&#8217;s Grainger says. &#8220;There continues to be a demand for
high-quality talent. Investors still want to know what is going
on in an industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So analysts today are more focused on churning out
exhaustive studies of trends and industries, with colleagues on
several continents providing insights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in the business of connecting the dots,&#8221; says David Bleustein, Zurich-based UBS AG (UBSN)&#8217;s head of U.S. equities research.
&#8220;We can tell you how a longshoremen&#8217;s strike in Australia is
likely to affect a U.S. coal company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, for example, Zurich-based Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN), which is tied at No. 4 among the top-ranked firms,
issued its Emerging Consumer Survey Databook 2012, a 179-page
tome compiled with pollster Nielsen Holdings NV. (NLSN) It surveyed
nearly 14,500 people in Brazil, Russia and six other emerging
markets on everything from their credit card debt to their
perfume expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;54 Percent Return &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be an investigator now,&#8221; says Stefano Natella, Credit Suisse&#8217;s co-head of securities research and
analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The databook shows that 24 percent of Brazilians surveyed
who had after-tax monthly income of 8,151 to 11,410 reais
($4,002 to $5,602) and who had purchased jewelry in the past
three to 12 months had bought foreign brands. Portfolio manager
Catherine Wood at AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB), which managed
$400 billion as of May 31, says such surveys help her refine her
investment themes. In this case, it reinforced her thesis that
expanding wealth in emerging markets was benefiting luxury goods
purveyors Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, L&#8217;Oreal SA (OR) and LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA. (MC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we move into a macro-driven environment, thematic
long-term investing outperforms,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for
global themes that are disruptive and cut across economic
sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep-Dive Research &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America application and systems software analyst
Kash Rangan, who tied for No. 3 in that category of the ranking,
is using deep-dive research to pick out groups of companies that
are profiting from global technology trends. He co-authored a
four-part series of reports totaling 586 pages that mapped out
the dynamics of cloud computing and the companies likely to
benefit from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2010, Rangan&#8217;s team used the research to make a
dozen stock recommendations -- including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and
Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) -- that generated a 54 percent return over
12&#160;months. The Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) rose 33 percent during the
same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You want to identify the theme that can make money for
clients and then you want to identify the companies that are
most leveraged to that theme,&#8221; Rangan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Pitzer, the Credit Suisse semiconductor analyst who is
tied for No. 1 in that category, harnessed the firm&#8217;s
proprietary database of 3,200 suppliers and customers to assess
the likely impact of Japan&#8217;s March 2011 earthquake and Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear-power-plant disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fukushima Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Credit Suisse report, by London-based Richard Kersley,
head of global equity research product, focused on Shin-Etsu
Chemical Co., whose sidelined plant in the Fukushima prefecture
made 22 percent of the global supply of 300-millimeter silicon
wafers used by companies such as Intel Corp. (INTC) and Micron
Technology Inc. (MU) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitzer maintained his buy recommendations on the two chip
companies after concluding that any supply disruptions wouldn&#8217;t
be sufficient to impact their earnings. From March 17, 2011, the
date of Kersley&#8217;s report, to July 11, Intel stock returned
32.9&#160;percent while Micron lost 39.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s buy-side portfolio managers who
pick stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our clients think for themselves,&#8221; says Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)&#8217;s
Rod Lache, the top-ranked auto analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Money &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lache has a track record of prescient against-the-grain
calls. In April 2010, investors were driving down the price of
auto parts maker Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) on the theory that the
worsening euro-zone economic outlook would hit its earnings; the
Milwaukee-based company derived a third of its revenue from
Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lache saw it differently. He judged that JCI&#8217;s battery unit
would profit from the signing of a new contract with Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. He also saw signs of a rebound in Johnson Controls&#8217;
auto interior and building controls divisions. He upgraded the
$31.20 stock to a buy on May 6, 2010, with a $36 price target.
Shares bottomed at $25.90 in early June before rebounding to $39
on Dec. 7, when Lache downgraded it to a hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to be contrarian,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s how you
make money in this part of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse&#8217;s Thomas Gallagher, who tied for the No. 1
spot in Greenwich Associates&#8217; life and health insurance
category, made a nuanced call when, on July 14, 2010, he
upgraded Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG),
an insurance and asset management firm, to a buy from hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proprietary Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rationale: In a declining stock market, the company,
which has a big 401(k) retirement plan business, should hold up
better than its peers because those saving for retirement tend
to do so regardless of market gyrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal was also cheap. Using a common valuation metric,
Gallagher calculated that it could be liquidated at 1.6 times
the price at which it was trading, half the multiple of rival
Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) Investors
agreed: Shares returned more than 30 percent during the next six
months, to $33.07 on Jan.&#160;5, 2011, before Gallagher downgraded
them again to hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary data can help an analyst make those kinds of
calls. In January 2011, Morgan Stanley restaurant analyst John Glass commissioned a survey of 1,500 coffee buyers, personally
writing the questions. Seattle-based Starbucks (SBUX) Corp. had
recently disclosed that it was interested in the single-serving,
packaged-coffee market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key question was, &#8216;Does single-serve coffee
cannibalize your visits to Starbucks coffee shops?&#8217;&#8221; Glass says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few respondents said it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shrinking Commissions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on that and other responses, Glass concluded that
Starbucks would quickly garner 30 percent of the fast-growing,
$3 billion single-serve market and that the new product could
help push up earnings growth to as much as 20 percent. He put a
buy on the stock at $33.12 with a $40 target price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later, after Starbucks announced plans to
partner with Waterbury, Vermont-based Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters Inc. (GMCR) in the single-serve market, shares jumped to
$37.97. The stock traded at $52.16 on July 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as analysts work to make themselves indispensable to
investors, their world is shrinking. Investors are trading less
these days, which reduces commissions. Average daily trading
volume peaked at more than 12.3 billion shares in March 2009 and
fell to 6.6 billion by March 2012, according to New York-based
Rosenblatt Securities Inc. Asset managers, including hedge
funds, will pay an estimated $13.3 billion in U.S. equity
commissions in 2012, down from $17.5 billion in 2009, according
to Tabb Group LLC, a New York-based capital markets consultancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of exchange-traded funds has further reduced the
need for researchers. ETFs comprised 14.9 percent of stock
market volume in 2011, up from 4.6 percent in 2005, according to
Rosenblatt. Big ETFs, like index funds, have little use for
research and generate much lower trading commissions, often
using electronic networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be a challenge for our business,&#8221; says
Jonathan Rosenzweig, Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s Americas equity research
director. &#8220;The fact is that passive investing continues to
grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the prominence of researchers has diminished, so has
their pay. It&#8217;s off 20 percent since 2007 to an average of
$500,000 for midlevel analysts, according to Alan Johnson,
managing director of compensation consulting firm Johnson
Associates Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unheralded Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superstar analyst of the 1990s bringing home millions
of dollars a year is gone, partly as a result of 2003
settlements with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
and other regulators that walled off analysts from their firms&#8217;
investment-banking divisions. Senior-level researchers today get
two-thirds of their pay in deferred stock awards. Before 2007,
just a third of their pay was deferred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One growing and unheralded role analysts play is in
connecting their buy-side clients to managers of the companies
they cover through meetings, conferences and field trips. In one
recent high-end excursion, an analyst signed up 15 top clients,
chartered a plane and took off to meet with executives at half a
dozen companies in the course of a few days. One buy-side firm
paid the analyst more than $100,000 in trading commissions for
the trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face-to-face meetings are the latest offering by an
industry hurt by a poorly kept Wall Street secret: Its
traditional buy-sell-hold recommendations get scant heed from
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The upgrades and downgrades are secondary,&#8221; Credit Suisse
life insurance analyst Gallagher says. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more about
finding relevant information, being helpful in explaining issues
that are important over a multiyear period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the analysts who do find favor with investors are
those who manage to grind out good investment ideas even in
equity markets that are governed by fear, correlation and
aversion to risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Botched trades by a JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) unit that Jamie Dimon had pushed to boost profit were masked
by weak internal controls and may ultimately saddle the bank
with a $7.5 billion loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office has lost $5.8 billion on
the trades so far, and that figure may climb by $1.7 billion in
a worst-case scenario, Dimon, the bank&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, said yesterday. Net income fell 9 percent to
$4.96 billion in the second quarter, the bank said. It restated
first-quarter results to reduce profit by $459 million after a
review of the unit found employees may have hid souring bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, had brushed off concerns raised by some of his
most senior advisers, including heads of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment
bank, about the lack of transparency and the quality of internal
controls in the CIO in past years, Bloomberg News reported last
month, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Capping the potential loss&#8217;s size and revamping management of
the unit responsible may help him restore investor confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock jumped 6 percent yesterday as shareholders
expressed &#8220;relief that it wasn&#8217;t worse,&#8221; Gary Townsend, head
of Hill-Townsend Capital LLC, said of the loss. &#8220;The loss is
substantially better than many of the estimates that I was
hearing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the shares are down 19 percent since April 5, when
Bloomberg News reported that the CIO had amassed an illiquid
book of credit derivatives. The slump equates to a $32 billion
drop in the firm&#8217;s market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London Whale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mounting losses have focused regulators&#8217; and investors&#8217;
attention on the CIO. Dimon transformed the once-conservative
unit in recent years to boost profit by buying higher-yielding
assets such as structured credit, equities and derivatives,
Bloomberg News reported on April 13, citing former employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One trader, Bruno Iksil, amassed positions in credit
derivatives so big and market-moving he became known as the
London Whale. Bets on credit-default swaps known as the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Series 9 backfired this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon dismissed reports about the London operation as a
&#8220;tempest in a teapot&#8221; when the bank reported first-quarter
earnings April 13. He reversed course less than four weeks
later, disclosing a $2 billion loss that he said could grow to
$3 billion or more during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managers Ousted &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said yesterday it ousted managers responsible for
the transactions and will claw back their pay after an internal
inquiry found traders may have intentionally tried to hide
souring bets during the first quarter. The company didn&#8217;t name
the managers. Iksil&#8217;s boss Javier Martin-Artajo and former
Europe CIO head Achilles Macris were among executives who also
oversaw the trades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said e-mails
sought by U.S. regulators in a probe of potential energy-market
manipulation are communications involving the advice of its
attorneys and shouldn&#8217;t be turned over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in a filing today in federal court in Washington,
said the 25 e-mails were sent after the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission opened its investigation and after the
bank hired outside counsel to respond to the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each of the e-mails relates to the advice of counsel with
respect to the investigation -- not the adoption of the bidding
practices under investigation,&#8221; Michele Roberts, a lawyer for
JPMorgan, wrote in the filing. &#8220;The only possible use the
commission could make of the e-mails would be to peer into the
details of respondent&#8217;s legal strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sued JPMorgan
on July 2 to release the e-mails in an investigation of possible
manipulation of power markets in California and the Midwest by
J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly gave JPMorgan until today to explain why the
e-mails shouldn&#8217;t be turned over to investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan submitted copies of the e-mails to
the court today so they can be examined by a judge, according to
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC opened the probe in August after complaints from
California and Midwest grid operators that JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding
practices were abusive, according to the agency&#8217;s initial court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, and Mary O&#8217;Driscoll, a FERC spokeswoman, declined to comment on today&#8217;s
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gauge of risk for investors in
JPMorgan Chase  Co. debt fell to the lowest in two months as
the biggest U.S. bank said it shut down a credit-derivatives
group that caused $5.8 billion in trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-year credit-default swaps on JPMorgan fell 6.4 basis
points to a mid-price of 122.4 basis points as of 4:54 p.m. in
New York, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. That&#8217;s about the lowest since May
10, the day JPMorgan first disclosed a loss from credit
derivatives traded in its chief investment office in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today it shifted almost all of its credit
derivatives trades in the CIO unit to its investment bank after
a botched hedging strategy. The bank also shut down the trading
group, which had amassed positions that had a pretax loss of
$4.4 billion in the second quarter, according to a statement.
Second-quarter profit dropped 9 percent to $4.96 billion as the
loss spoiled what Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called
&#8220;really good underlying performance&#8221; in other businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit investors are taking comfort that the trade issues
are moving to the rear-view mirror,&#8221; Joel Levington, managing
director of corporate credit at Brookfield Investment Management
Inc. in New York, wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;Core earnings were
solid. What&#8217;s left is a well-capitalized bank that can earn $20
billion annually.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reasonable&#8217; Outcome &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-derivatives losses offset gains in mortgage fees
and retail banking revenue. Earnings for the quarter ended June
30 were also boosted by $1 billion in securities gains, $2.1
billion in reserve releases and an $800 million accounting gain
on the cost of the bank&#8217;s debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss &#8220;is within the market&#8217;s scope of reasonable
outcomes,&#8221; Adrian Miller, director of global markets strategy
at GMP Securities LLC in New York, wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;Jamie
has seemingly succeeded at mostly righting the ship after an
initial black eye.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., said the trading loss was &#8220;not that
significant&#8221; and hadn&#8217;t swayed his opinion of JPMorgan&#8217;s
reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough mistakes of my own that I&#8217;m very
forgiving when something like that happens,&#8221; Buffett said today
on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop With Betty Liu&#8221; in an
interview from the Allen  Co. media conference in Sun Valley,
Idaho. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CDX Index &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benchmark credit-default swaps gauge in the U.S.
declined, with the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index falling 1.4 basis points to a mid-price of 111.9 basis
points at 5 p.m. in New York, Bloomberg prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure decreased even as a report showed U.S. consumer
confidence unexpectedly dropped in July to the lowest level this
year. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of
consumer sentiment fell to 72 from a reading of 73.2 in June.
The decline missed estimates that had called for a rise to 73.5,
according to the median forecast of 69 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-swaps index, used to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, typically
falls as investor confidence improves and rises as it
deteriorates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DirecTV (DTV)&#8217;s 20 million customers,
following the loss of Nickelodeon kids&#8217; programming because of
the satellite-TV provider&#8217;s dispute with Viacom Inc. (VIAB), will begin
receiving the 24-hour Disney Junior channel tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Junior, created by Walt Disney Co. (DIS) to target viewers
ages 2 to 7, will be permanently added to DirecTV&#8217;s lineup as a
basic channel, according to a statement today from the
companies. Disney Junior began last year as a daytime
programming block within the Disney Channel, before becoming its
own 24-hour station this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move lets DirecTV bolster its children&#8217;s programming
after blacking out Viacom&#8217;s 26 channels, including Nickelodeon
kids&#8217; shows such as &#8220;Dora the Explorer&#8221; and &#8220;SpongeBob
SquarePants.&#8221; DirecTV dropped the programs just before midnight
on July 10 following stalled negotiations over the fees that the
satellite company pays for the shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Junior&#8217;s programs include cartoons and live-action
shows, including &#8220;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&#8221; and &#8220;Handy
Manny.&#8221; The channel also airs movies from Walt Disney Studios
and its Pixar division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to add the channel was already in the works before
the Viacom impasse, said Robert Mercer, a spokesman for El
Segundo, California-based DirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-TV
provider. Even so, the deal mitigates the need for other kids&#8217;
channels, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the unsurpassed quality of Disney Junior&#8217;s family-
friendly programming, there&#8217;s no reason to watch anything
else,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment
bank cut the amount earmarked for compensation by 22 percent to
$2.01 billion in the second quarter as the division generated 7
percent less revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit set aside $4.91 billion for pay in the first six
months of the year, enough to compensate each of the 26,553
employees an average of $184,989 for the period, according to a
figures posted today on the New York-based company&#8217;s website.
That&#8217;s down from the first half of 2011, when the firm set aside
$211,358 for each of the unit&#8217;s 27,716 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay at the world&#8217;s biggest lenders has drawn extra scrutiny
since the 2008 credit crisis, with regulators and lawmakers
saying compensation plans encouraged bankers to take too much
risk. JPMorgan said today it intends to claw back two years of
compensation from three employees in the firm&#8217;s chief investment
office after a $5.8 billion trading loss. The lender accepted an
offer from Ina Drew, 55, the former head of the CIO, to forfeit
her pay for the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank&#8217;s compensation costs equaled 33 percent
of revenue excluding accounting gains for the second quarter,
down from 36 percent a year earlier. The unit allocated $2.6
billion to pay traders, dealmakers and other personnel in the
same period of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the investment bank, run by Jes Staley, 55,
fell to $1.91 billion in the quarter from $2.06 billion the
previous year. The unit generated 39 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s $4.96
billion in profit, up from 38 percent in the same period last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit had 846 more people than at the end of the first
quarter and 1,163 fewer than a year earlier, according to
today&#8217;s disclosure. Companywide, the staff expanded to 262,882
as of June 30 from 261,453 at the end of the first quarter and
250,095 at the middle of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit derivatives trades in
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s chief investment office that triggered
$5.8 billion in losses have been &#8220;significantly reduced,&#8221; with
the remainder moved to its investment bank, the lender said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, shut down synthetic
trading in its CIO unit with the exception of an $11 billion
short position in &#8220;basically liquid indexes&#8221; to hedge other
credit assets, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a
meeting in analysts today. Positions in Series 9 of the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a credit-swaps
benchmark known as IG9 that&#8217;s at the heart of much of the loss,
were cut by 70 percent, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The residual portfolio, largely trades in so-called
tranches of indexes that wager on the degree to which companies
will default together, was transferred to the investment bank,
where they have &#8220;the expertise&#8221; to manage it, Dimon said. The
bank transferred about $30 billion of risk-weighted assets to
the investment bank, an amount that is &#8220;down substantially&#8221;
from the peak and back to levels at the end of 2011, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank shifted the positions as it seeks to stem losses
from a group in London that included Bruno Iksil, the trader who
became known as the London Whale because the size of his bets
grew so large they drove price disparities in the market. Total
losses from those trades this year reached $5.8 billion, Chief
Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said today in a meeting with
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, the billionaire
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), said JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s
reputation is intact as far as he&#8217;s concerned, after the bank
posted a trading loss on credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough mistakes of my own that I&#8217;m very
forgiving when something like that happens,&#8221; Buffett said today
on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop With Betty Liu&#8221; program
in an interview from the Allen  Co. media conference in Sun
Valley, Idaho. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, said today it&#8217;s closing
the group that traded so-called synthetic credit at the chief
investment office, after a $4.4 billion trading loss at the unit
in the second quarter. The company also restated first-quarter
results after finding a &#8220;material weakness&#8221; in its reporting
and said in a regulatory filing that employees may have sought
to hide losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, who has a personal stake of about 1 million
JPMorgan shares, was asked by Liu if the blunder would hurt the
reputation of the New York-based bank. &#8220;Not with me,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you do big things, you&#8217;re going to get big swings&#8221; in
earnings, Buffett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billionaire, whose company is the biggest investor in
American Express Co. (AXP), said JPMorgan&#8217;s loss is small compared to
the damage from a fraud at the credit-card lender in the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, reported a $4.4 billion trading loss in its chief
investment office, bigger than analysts estimated, that helped
drive second-quarter profit down 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $4.96 billion, or $1.21 a share, from
$5.43 billion, or $1.27, in the same period a year earlier, the
New York-based company said today in a statement. Six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimated the CIO trading loss at $4
billion. The company also restated first-quarter earnings,
reducing net income by $459 million, and used securities gains
and an $800 million accounting benefit to help boost profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading loss may complicate efforts by Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, to restore investor confidence after
losing $39.7 billion in market value since April 5, when
Bloomberg News first reported that the company had amassed an
illiquid book of credit derivatives at the London unit. The firm
also is being probed over the possible gaming of U.S. energy
markets and was subpoenaed in global investigations of interest-
rate fixing in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The restatement is not good, and at first glance, the
numbers are so-so,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank and analyst at FBR Capital
Markets Corp. in Arlington, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose to $34.79 in New York trading at 7:36 a.m.
from $34.04 yesterday. The shares were down 2.4 percent this
year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysts&#8217; Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income excluding the effect of
accounting adjustments known as DVA was $1.09 a share. Excluding
DVA, loan-loss reserve reductions and a Bear Stearns-related
recovery, profit was 67 cents. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
had estimated adjusted earnings per share of 76 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a departure from his customary earnings-day conference
call, Dimon is meeting analysts in person for two hours starting
at 7:30 a.m. today at the bank&#8217;s New York headquarters to field
questions about the loss and what he&#8217;s doing to contain the
damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon dismissed reports about the London operation as a
&#8220;tempest in a teapot&#8221; when the bank reported first-quarter
earnings on April 13. He reversed course less than four weeks
later, disclosing a $2 billion loss that he said could grow to
$3 billion or more during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Securities Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said May 10 that it had taken $1 billion in
profits from securities sales in the CIO to mitigate the trading
loss and planned more asset sales if needed to offset the
damages, which was caused by a wrong-way bet on credit
derivatives by London trader Bruno Iksil. Dimon hired Iksil&#8217;s
boss, London CIO chief Achilles Macris, in 2006 with a mandate
to generate profits. Macris and Iksil eventually built up a
position in credit derivatives that was so large it couldn&#8217;t be
unwound without roiling markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today that it recently discovered information
that suggests some individuals at the company may have been
trying to avoid showing the full amount of the losses. All
employees working on synthetic credit derivatives in the CIO
have left the bank, the company said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have already completely overhauled CIO management and
enhanced the governance standards within CIO,&#8221; Dimon said in the
statement. &#8220;We believe these events to be isolated to CIO, but
have taken the opportunity to apply lessons learned across the
firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the CIO loss may increase by $800 million
to as much as $1.6 billion in an extreme scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ina Drew &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 55, retired four days
after the loss was disclosed with about $57.5 million in stock,
pension and other pay, according to regulatory filings and
estimates from consulting firm Meridian Compensation Partners
LLC. About $21.5 million of that money, based on the May 14
closing price, would have been automatically forfeited if she
had been fired for cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today it will claw back compensation from
individuals responsible for the losses on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon is also grappling with historically low interest
rates that have compressed profit margins on lending as well as
yields on investments. Moshe Orenbuch, of Credit Suisse Group
AG, was among analysts who lowered earnings projections for
banks amid weak trading revenue and market turmoil caused by
Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bond issuance dropped almost 19 percent in the
second quarter from $927 billion a year earlier as companies
backed away from plans to raise capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Europe Damper &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe continues to put a damper on just about
everything,&#8221; said Nancy Bush, an analyst and contributing
editor at SNL Financial LC, a research firm based in
Charlottesville, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer credit is one bright spot for the industry as
delinquency rates decline. Fewer borrowers fell behind on their
credit-card payments in May, 2.35 percent, from 3.09 percent a
year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Government programs and mortgage rates near record lows have
also helped fuel higher volume and bigger profits on home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan set aside $335 million more toward its litigation
costs during the second quarter. Dimon previously told
shareholders that the company would be making as much as $24
billion in annual profit if it weren&#8217;t for all of its mortgage
losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 16 percent to $22.9 billion from $27.4 billion
during the second quarter of last year. Revenue at the
investment-banking unit fell 7 percent to $6.77 billion from
$7.31 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixed Income &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equity-markets revenue excluding
accounting adjustments dropped to $4.54 billion from $5.36
billion a year earlier, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are in the middle of the industry&#8217;s worst two
years of revenue growth since the Great Depression, according to
Mike Mayo, an analyst with independent research firm CLSA Ltd.
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail banking, which includes home loans and checking
accounts, earned $2.27 billion, up from $383 million a year
earlier. The bank&#8217;s net interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, declined to 2.47 percent from 2.72 percent a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan benefited from gains in mortgage lending as low
interest rates and federal incentive programs encouraged
homeowners to refinance. Mortgage fees and related revenue
totaled $2.27 billion, up from $1.1 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unemployment Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for loans rose as the unemployment rate fell to 8.2
percent from 9.1 percent in the same period of 2011. Mortgage
originations industrywide probably climbed 28 percent to $372
billion in the second quarter from the same period last year,
driven by refinancings spurred by federal programs, according to
the Mortgage Bankers Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer consumers fell behind on their credit-card payments
in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2011.
Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal of future write-offs,
fell to 2.14 percent from 2.98 percent in 2011. Write-offs
dropped to 4.35 percent from 5.82 percent the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, restated first-quarter results to reduce
net income by $459 million after a review of the firm&#8217;s chief
investment office found that employees may have hid losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was $4.92 billion, rather than the $5.38 billion
previously reported, the New York-based bank said today in a
regulatory filing. The CIO was responsible for trading losses
that the bank estimated at $2 billion in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Recently discovered information raises questions about
the integrity of the trader marks, and suggests that certain
individuals may have been seeking to avoid showing the full
amount of the losses being incurred in the portfolio during the
first quarter,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is seeking to restore
confidence in the bank after initially calling reports on the
CIO&#8217;s trades a &#8220;complete tempest in a teapot&#8221; as the bank
released first-quarter earnings in April. The bank today said it
found a material weakness in internal controls for that period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine
filed a motion seeking to lead a proposed class-action lawsuit
against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) involving the activities of a U.K.
trader known as the &#8220;London Whale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio pension funds lost more than $27.5 million due to the
alleged fraud, DeWine&#8217;s office said today in a statement.
Spokesman Dan Tierney, speaking in a telephone interview, said
the state is seeking lead plantiff status in the case because of
&#8220;the size of the losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said its chief investment office has had $5.8 billion in
losses on the trades so far, and that figure may climb by $1.7
billion in a worst-case scenario. One trader, Bruno Iksil,
amassed positions in credit derivatives so big and market-moving
he became known as the London Whale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio said its pension fund managers were given &#8220;false and
misleading information&#8221; that hid the true nature of the bank&#8217;s
trades. The suit was filed on behalf of the Ohio Public Employee
Retirement System, the School Employees Retirement System of
Ohio and the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti declined to comment when
reached via e-mail by Bloomberg News today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class-action status allows plaintiffs more leverage in
negotiations with defendant banks. Lead plaintiffs direct the
litigation on behalf of the class, determining strategy while
usually reaping the largest share of any verdict or settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Four Class Actions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio is seeking to lead a class action initiated by
Louisiana, Tierney said, one of four class actions that have
been filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public pension funds in Oregon and Arkansas as well as a
Swedish national pension fund are seeking to join the Louisiana
lawsuit, the Ohio statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, JPMorgan was sued by the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System for alleged securities fraud
tied to a trading loss of at least $2 billion. The state claimed
the biggest U.S. bank and top officials misled investors about
its risk management and financial condition from February 2010
to May 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 12-cv-4729, U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard Inc. (MA) and
American Express Co. (AXP) were among companies to win partial support
from World Trade Organization judges in a U.S. claim that China
unfairly restrains the payment processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTO judges in Geneva yesterday agreed with the U.S. that
China unfairly discriminates against foreign suppliers of
electronic-payment services by imposing requirements on them
that aren&#8217;t applied to domestic companies. They rejected the
U.S. argument that China UnionPay Data Co., the world&#8217;s fastest-
growing bank-card network, monopolizes the handling of domestic-
currency payment-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is definitely a mixed bag for both parties,&#8221; Scott
Lincicome, an attorney at White  Case LLP, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;The one thing we can safely say for sure is that
both sides are going to appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has reservations about some parts of the ruling, Shen Danyang, a spokesman for the Commerce Ministry, said in a
statement on the ministry&#8217;s website yesterday, without giving
details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. protested to the WTO about the limits on payment
processing, saying China favors Shanghai-based UnionPay and
forbids foreign companies from issuing their own bank cards
denominated in its currency, building networks to support such
cards or handling interbank point-of-sale transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pave Way &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are hopeful that this ruling will pave the way for
international payment companies to participate in the domestic
payments marketplace in China,&#8221; said Will Valentine, a
spokesman for San Francisco-based Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest
bank-card network. &#8220;In the meantime, our existing business in
China is healthy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the No. 2 network, forecast in September 2010
that China will overtake the U.S. as the largest market for
credit cards by 2020, with about 900 million cards in
circulation. Total cards probably will increase 11 percent a
year as transaction value climbs 14 percent annually until 2025,
the Purchase, New York-based company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MasterCard has long been of the view that open payment
systems promote growth by reducing the need for cash payments,
fostering innovation and reducing system risk,&#8221; Jim Issokson, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leslie Sutton, a spokeswoman for Riverwoods, Illinois-based
Discover Financial Services (DFS), which has an agreement with
UnionPay to process the Chinese firm&#8217;s card transactions in the
U.S., declined to comment. Molly Faust, a spokeswoman for New
York-based American Express, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard advanced in New York yesterday after
announcing on July 13 that they had agreed along with card-
issuing banks to pay $6.6 billion in settling a U.S. antitrust
lawsuit brought by merchants. Visa climbed 2.5 percent to
$127.15, while MasterCard rose 1.7 percent, AmEx added 1.2
percent and Discover gained 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Reif, general counsel at the U.S. Trade
Representative&#8217;s office, called yesterday&#8217;s ruling a &#8220;decisive
victory&#8221; that may produce 6,000 new jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have achieved a landmark finding by the WTO against
every aspect of China&#8217;s regulatory regime,&#8221; Reif told
journalists on a conference call in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UnionPay employee at the firm&#8217;s U.S. office in Jersey
City, New Jersey said she couldn&#8217;t comment and directed
inquiries to the company&#8217;s headquarters in Shanghai. Wang
Kongping, a spokesman based in the Chinese city, wasn&#8217;t
immediately available to comment by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China&#8217;s Promise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the WTO judges found that China imposes four
different requirements that violate the organization&#8217;s rules,
the U.S. failed to establish that China UnionPay is the sole
supplier of electronic-payments services, Lincicome said. &#8220;The
extent to which American service providers see this CUP issue as
a very big deal, they will stand to be disappointed,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign banks must &#8220;co-brand&#8221; with Chinese operators to
execute payments through UnionPay. The U.S. says the rules clash
with the promise China made when it joined the WTO to open up
its credit- and debit-card markets to foreign processing
companies by the end of 2006. WTO judges agreed with the U.S.
that China had made pledges on market access when it became a
member of the trade arbiter in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnionPay, which supplanted American Express as the world&#8217;s
third-biggest payments network in 2010, processed $2.36 trillion
in credit- and debit-card purchases last year, a 46 percent
increase from 2011, according to the Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. Visa handled
purchases totaling $5.38 trillion, a 12 percent gain, while
MasterCard spending climbed about 15 percent to $2.43 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s assertion
that traders at its London chief investment office may have
intentionally mismarked trades, masking losses that total at
least $5.8 billion, makes little sense, according to former
executives with direct knowledge of the unit&#8217;s operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank restated first-quarter results, paring profit by
$459 million, in part because an internal review revealed that
U.K. traders had priced their books &#8220;aggressively,&#8221; Mike Cavanagh, head of Treasury  Securities Services, said in a July
13 meeting with analysts. The mispricing made losses on a
portfolio of credit derivatives look smaller than they were, and
executives concluded that traders may have sought to hide the
&#8220;full amount of losses,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan requires traders to mark their positions daily so
the firm can track their profits, losses and risk. An internal
control group double-checks the marks against market prices
monthly and at the end of each quarter, said three former
executives from the CIO and a senior executive in market risk.
The firm uses the control group&#8217;s prices, not what individual
traders submit, to calculate earnings, making it difficult for
one trader or trading desk to rig prices, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We just have questions about whether the traders were
doing what they need to do for accounting, which is put a mark
on their positions where they think they can exit,&#8221; Cavanagh,
who led the internal review, said on a conference call with
reporters. &#8220;Instead, it felt more like they were pricing their
marks a little bit more aggressively, but generally inside the
bid-ask spread.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London Whale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread is the difference between what an investor would
pay to buy a security and the price at which someone is willing
to sell the same asset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his
positions became so large, ran the credit derivatives book that
generated the losses. He personally apologized in recent weeks
to almost everyone in the London unit for causing turbulence
within the group, according to one of the former CIO executives
who had been told about it by two people in the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil and Raymond Silverstein, his attorney, didn&#8217;t return
phone and e-mail messages seeking comment. The New York Times
quoted Silverstein saying that Iksil is innocent of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deciding to Restate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to restate results for the first three months
of 2012 was made one day before New York-based JPMorgan reported
second-quarter net income of $4.96 billion, and after executives
and lawyers interviewed employees, and reviewed thousands of
hours of calls and about 1 million e-mails, said Cavanagh, 46. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm didn&#8217;t elaborate on the content of those e-mails
and Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on the doubts expressed by the former executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s shares fell 2.7 percent to $35.09 in New York.
The KBW Bank Index of 24 U.S. lenders dropped 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, has
seen its market value plunge $36 billion since April 5, when
Bloomberg News first reported the London unit&#8217;s illiquid bets on
credit derivatives were big enough to move markets. The trade, a
wrong-way bet on credit derivatives, cost the bank $5.8 billion
in the first six months of this year and the tab could climb by
$1.7 billion, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price Verification &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 55, who retired four
days after the initial losses were disclosed on May 10,
voluntarily forfeited as much as two years of compensation.
JPMorgan said it ousted the three London executives responsible
for the loss and that it will claw back as much as two years of
their bonuses, without naming the individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, and former Europe CIO
head Achilles Macris were among executives who also oversaw the
trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some securities, such as interest-rate derivatives or
foreign-exchange contracts, are easier to price because they&#8217;re
generally traded on exchanges, making them more transparent to
investors. Credit derivatives and other securities traded by
Iksil were more difficult to price because they traded less
frequently, and not on open exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, traders have to submit documentation verifying
their pricing and the internal control group generally would
solicit prices from about two dozen outside firms to verify the
marks, the people said. Executives including Dimon had said
previously that Iksil&#8217;s positions were &#8220;marked-to-market,&#8221;
indicating that they were available market prices that confirmed
his valuations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIO also valued some trades at prices that differed
from those of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, people familiar with
the matter said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Position &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, shut down all
synthetic trading at the chief investment office and transferred
the rest of the position to the investment bank. The CIO has
retained an $11 billion short position in &#8220;basically liquid
indexes&#8221; to hedge other credit assets, Dimon, 56, said during
the meeting with analysts. Positions in Series 9 of the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a credit-swaps
benchmark known as IG9 that&#8217;s at the heart of much of the loss,
were cut by 70 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank has the expertise to manage it, Dimon
said. The bank transferred about $30 billion of risk-weighted
assets to the investment bank, an amount that is &#8220;down
substantially&#8221; from an earlier peak and back to levels at the
end of 2011, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Investigations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock jumped 6 percent on July 13 as investors
expressed &#8220;relief that it wasn&#8217;t worse,&#8221; said Gary Townsend,
head of Hill-Townsend Capital LLC, said of the trading loss. It
was &#8220;substantially better than many of the estimates that I was
hearing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agencies scrutinizing the bank&#8217;s handling of the loss
include the Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Justice
Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said July 14 that he is
seeking to lead a proposed class-action lawsuit against JPMorgan
after state pension funds lost more than $27.5 million due to
the &#8220;alleged fraud.&#8221; Two funds for state employees held about
10.2 million JPMorgan shares as of March 31, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pension-fund managers acting on behalf of Ohio retirees
were given&#160;false and misleading information by JPMorgan Chase
that hid the true nature of the bank&#8217;s risky trades, causing
Ohio teachers, school employees and public employees to lose
tens of millions of hard-earned retirement dollars,&#8221; DeWine
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon transformed the unit in recent years to boost profit
by buying higher-yielding assets such as structured credit,
equities and derivatives, Bloomberg News reported on April 13,
citing former employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon dismissed initial news reports about the London
operation as a &#8220;tempest in a teapot&#8221; when the bank reported
first-quarter earnings April 13. He reversed course less than
four weeks later, disclosing a $2 billion loss that he said
could grow to $3 billion or more during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, dragging the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index lower for the seventh time in eight
days, after the International Monetary Fund cut its global
economic forecast and retail sales unexpectedly dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) lost 2.7 percent while Home Depot Inc.
and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) dropped more than 1 percent to lead the Dow
Jones Industrial Average lower. Equities pared losses as energy
companies rose with the price of oil while Visa (V) Inc. and
MasterCard (MA) Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest payment networks, gained at
least 1.7 percent after agreeing to a settlement of at least
$6.05 billion in a price-fixing case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 declined 0.2 percent to 1,353.64 at 4 p.m. New
York time after earlier retreating as much as 0.6 percent. The
Dow slipped 49.88 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,727.21 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The retail sales gives you another indicator that
uncertainty has showed up in the consumer side,&#8221; James Dunigan,
who helps oversee $112 billion as chief investment officer in
Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re in a bit of the summer doldrums.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is down 4.6 percent from a four-year high in
April as economic data trails forecasts and investors brace for
what is projected to be the first decrease in quarterly earnings
since 2009. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S.,
which measures how much data from the past three months is
beating or missing the median estimates in Bloomberg surveys, is
at minus 64, near the almost 11-month low of minus 64.9 reached
last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retail Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. retail sales dropped 0.5 percent in June, following a
0.2 percent decrease in May, Commerce Department figures showed
today. The decline was worse than the most-pessimistic forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey in which the median projection called
for 0.2 percent rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF cut its 2013 global growth forecast as Europe&#8217;s
debt crisis prolongs Spain&#8217;s recession and slows expansions in
emerging markets. Growth worldwide will be 3.9 percent next
year, less than the 4.1 percent estimate in April, the fund
predicted in an update of its World Economic Outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing in the New York region expanded in July at a
faster pace than anticipated, signaling factories will keep
contributing to growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s
general economic index rose to 7.4 from 2.3 in June. The median
forecast of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
an increase to 4.0. Readings greater than zero signal expansion
in the so-called Empire State Index that covers New York,
northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings beat estimates at 21 of the 32 companies in the
SP 500 that have reported quarterly results so far, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Profits probably decreased 2.1
percent in the second quarter, the first drop in almost three
years, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 2.7
percent to $35.09 after rallying 6 percent on July 13 as Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon predicted the company will still
post record earnings this year despite a $4.4 billion trading
loss in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s assertion that traders at its London chief
investment office may have intentionally mismarked trades,
masking losses that total at least $5.8 billion, makes little
sense, according to former executives with direct knowledge of
the unit&#8217;s operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Depot, the nation&#8217;s largest home-improvement retailer,
slumped 1.2 percent to $51.45. Caterpillar, the world&#8217;s biggest
maker of construction equipment, declined 1.1 percent to $81.15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. lost 0.9 percent to $19.59, helping
send industrial shares down 0.6 percent as a group for the
biggest drop among 10 industries in the SP 500. Morgan Stanley
reduced its recommendation on the world&#8217;s biggest maker of jet
engines, power generation equipment and locomotives to
equalweight from overweight, citing the stock&#8217;s higher valuation
relative to peers with or without GE Capital Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal Stocks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) declined 10 percent to $6.85
as Bank of Montreal cut its rating to underperform from
outperform, citing potential financing issues. Arch Coal Inc. (ACI),
the fourth-largest U.S. producer of the fuel, sank 3.9 percent
to $5.90 after BMO cut the stock to underperform from market
perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy stocks added 0.3 percent after earlier falling as
much as 0.8 percent as the price of crude oil reversed earlier
declines to rise 1.5 percent to $88.43 a barrel. Chevron Corp.,
the second-largest U.S. energy company, climbed 0.7 percent to
$106.78. Denbury Resources Inc., the oil and natural-gas
producer, rallied 3.8 percent to $14.77. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard advanced 1.7 percent to $436.89 and Visa rose
2.5 percent to $127.15 after they agreed to settle a price-
fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card swipe fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup, Gannett &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, advanced 0.6
percent to $26.81 after reporting second-quarter profit that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates on revenue from advising on mergers and
underwriting stocks and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income declined to $2.95 billion, or 95 cents a share,
from $3.34 billion, or $1.09, a year earlier. Excluding
accounting adjustments and a loss from the sale of a stake in a
Turkish bank, earnings were $1 a share, compared with the
average estimate of 89 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 18
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gannett Co., the owner of 82 daily newspapers including USA
Today, rallied 2.7 percent to $14.69. The company reported
second-quarter profit that topped analysts&#8217; estimates, bolstered
by growing Internet revenue. Excluding some items, profit was 56
cents a share in the period, beating the 53-cent average
estimate by analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, unveiled the next version of its Office software
with social and cloud features that will work with touch-screen
devices powered by its Windows 8 operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are taking bold steps at Microsoft,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said at an event today in San Francisco.
&#8220;The new, modern Office will deliver unparalleled productivity
and flexibility for both consumers and business customers. It is
a cloud service and will fully light-up when paired with Windows
8.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s business division, the company&#8217;s
largest, increased 6.4 percent to $17.7 billion in the nine
months ended March 31, the company said. Microsoft is trying to
sell customers Web-based versions of its Word, Excel and e-mail
programs and add social features to its marquee software suite
to stave off competition from Google Inc. (GOOG) and Jive Software Inc. (JIVE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated Office will save documents to Microsoft&#8217;s
Internet-based cloud storage service SkyDrive, enabling access
to files via tablets, computers and phones. Customers will also
be able to buy the software as a subscription, which will let
them use the cloud to stream applications to any Windows-based
PC. Subscribers also get future upgrades automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Huge Bet&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing Microsoft update almost its entire product
line this year with laser alignment around touch interfaces
built into Windows 8,&#8221; said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC, in an
e-mail. &#8220;This is clearly a process that is several years in the
making and should be seen as a huge bet the company is making to
usurp the disruptive innovation brought about by touch screens
and cloud services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides touch controls, the program will also allow users
control programs and take notes with a stylus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social features will include tools Microsoft is gaining
from its $1.2 billion purchase of corporate social-network
operator Yammer Inc. last month. Yammer offers a Facebook-like
experience that enables employees to collaborate in the
workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tool, called People Card, lets users see their
contacts anywhere in Office, including photos, status updates
and information on whether they are online. The Office suite
also comes with Skype Internet-calling, which Microsoft gained
in its $8.5 billion purchase of Skype Technologies SA last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the most ambitious release of Microsoft Office
we&#8217;ve ever done,&#8221; Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Touch-Enabled &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has said it will
provide the touch-enabled versions of Word, Excel, OneNote and
PowerPoint available on its upcoming Windows RT operating
system, which will be released in late October and is designed
for tablet computers to rival Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test version of the Office 15 programs was shared with
select partners and customers starting in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company updated its online corporate-software offerings
a year ago to include a full Web-based version of Office 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Business Division, which is largely made up of
Office revenue, contributed 32 percent of total sales during the
nine months through March 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator is preparing
about 50 million reais ($25 million) in fines against Chevron
Corp. (CVX) related to an oil spill last November at the Frade field
off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Agencia Estado reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron won&#8217;t be able to resume drilling at the Frade field
until the regulator completes an investigation of a second spill
at the area in March, Estado quoted Magda Chambriard, the head
of Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator ANP, as saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBCUniversal paid
about $300 million to buy out Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s half of their
MSNBC.com news-website joint venture, according to a person with
knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person declined to be named because the terms weren&#8217;t
made public when NBCUniversal announced the agreement earlier
today. The July 13 transaction ended a 16-year partnership
between the two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking complete control over the website, NBC can link
it more closely with the MSNBC television channel, a property it
already bought back from the Microsoft joint venture. The MSNBC
site will redirect to NBCNews.com for now, and then get its own
makeover in 2013 to help it match the cable channel. Microsoft,
meanwhile, will continue to provide news through a new software
application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have already built up a profitable business with
healthy margins with Microsoft,&#8221; NBC News Senior Vice President
Vivian Schiller said on a conference call. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
tremendous amount of value wrapped up in the venture. Now
instead of owning 50 percent of the business, we&#8217;ll own 100
percent. That&#8217;s what we paid for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will bring all of NBC News&#8217;s online properties
into a new division called NBC News Digital, which will be
overseen by Schiller. She declined to comment on the price paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;24-Hour News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and NBC started MSNBC in 1996, teaming up to
create a 24-hour news channel and companion website. NBC agreed
to acquire the news channel in 2005, leaving the Internet
portion as a joint venture. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable-
television provider, purchased a majority stake in NBC Universal
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest deal will allow Comcast to better sell
advertising against a unified MSNBC TV and MSNBC.com, according
to David Joyce, an analyst at Miller Tabak  Co. in New York. He
values all of MSNBC at $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn&#8217;t leaving the news business, said Bob Visse,
general manager of the company&#8217;s online services division.
Microsoft will rely on its new Bing News app for Windows 8 to
provide &#8220;a broader perspective on what&#8217;s happening in the
world,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Multiple Perspectives&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A big part of why we wanted to unwind the joint venture
is we had an exclusivity clause where we had to use the
MSNBC.com news content only,&#8221; Visse said in an interview. &#8220;We
were hearing from users who wanted us to show multiple
perspectives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Philadelphia-based Comcast were little changed in
today&#8217;s trading, closing at $31.83. Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Washington, rose less than 1 percent to $29.44. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction gives NBC News complete control over the
MSNBC Digital Network, including MSNBC.com, Today.com,
NightlyNews.com, BreakingNews.com and other sites. Microsoft&#8217;s
MSN Web portal, which competes with Yahoo! Inc. and AOL Inc.,
will remain a distribution site for NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &#8220;MS&#8221; in the name relates to Microsoft, NBC
won&#8217;t rename MSNBC, which has become a valuable brand, said NBC
News President Steve Capus. Now NBC wants the website to better
reflect what people are seeing on their televisions, Capus said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cable deserves its own dedicated home online, and we&#8217;d
like there to be brand alignment with the name,&#8221; Capus said on
the conference call. &#8220;This is going to clear up the brand
confusion that does exist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won dismissal of
Novell Inc.&#8217;s antitrust lawsuit over the WordPerfect computer
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz granted Microsoft&#8217;s
request to close the case in an order issued today. A mistrial
was declared in December after jurors in Salt Lake City said
they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell &#8220;did not present evidence sufficient for a jury to
find that Microsoft committed any acts that violated&#8221; federal
antitrust laws &#8220;in maintaining its monopoly in the operating
systems market,&#8221; Motz wrote in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell sought as much as $1.3 billion in damages over
allegations that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, while
developing the Windows 95 operating system in 1994, blocked an
element of the software to thwart Novell&#8217;s WordPerfect and
Quattro Pro programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell is disappointed in the ruling, &#8220;still believes in
the strength of its claim and we do intend to pursue an
appeal,&#8221; Jim Lundberg, vice president of the company&#8217;s legal
department, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell, which was bought by Seattle-based Attachmate Corp.,
claimed WordPerfect&#8217;s share of the word-processing market fell
to less than 10 percent in 1996 from almost 50 percent in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPerfect&#8217;s value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994
to $170 million in 1996, when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel
Corp., Novell said. Novell settled separate antitrust claims
against Microsoft for $536 million in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve maintained throughout this case that Novell&#8217;s
arguments lack merit, and we&#8217;re gratified with today&#8217;s ruling
dismissing the last of Novell&#8217;s claims and putting this matter
to rest,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft deputy general counsel, said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees of Goldman Sachs Group (GS)
Inc., the biggest source of donations directly to Mitt Romney&#8217;s
presidential campaign, are also the top givers to the joint
fundraising committee he has set up with the Republican Party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman employees contributed $902,310 to Romney Victory,
according to a computer-assisted analysis of Federal Election
Commission reports. Overall, Romney Victory has raised more than
$140 million since being established on April 5. Employees of
Boston-based Bain Capital LLC, the private-equity firm co-
founded by Romney, were its second biggest contributors, giving
$820,400. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of Elliott Management Corp., a New York-based
hedge fund, were third with $808,150 in donations to Romney
Victory, which raises money for the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee and state and local party committees. Paul Singer, the president and founder of Elliott Management, has
also given $1 million to the pro-Romney super political action
committee Restore Our Future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super-PAC, which operates independently of Romney&#8217;s
presidential campaign, raised a record $20 million in June,
spokeswoman Brittany Gross confirmed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adelson Check &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super-PAC&#8217;s haul, which exceeds by double any previous
month, includes a $10 million check from Las Vegas casino
billionaire Sheldon Adelson. Other donors will be included in a
report to the FEC due July 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of New York-based Goldman and their families also
have contributed $593,080 to Romney&#8217;s own campaign, more than
those of any other company, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group that
tracks campaign contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman employees and their families gave $1 million to
President Barack Obama for his 2008 campaign, more than those at
any other company. They&#8217;ve given $100,424 to him for his re-
election, according to the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Romney is the candidate of Wall Street now, of course,&#8221;
said Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York
University&#8217;s Wagner School. &#8220;Obama was seen as the logical
candidate for economic stimulus in 2008, but has now launched a
campaign based on inequality and taxation of the 1 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney Victory reported raising $140.3 million through June
30 and had $57.7 million in the bank after transferring $68.8
million to the Romney campaign, the Republican National
Committee, and state parties in Idaho, Massachusetts, Oklahoma
and Vermont. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Contributors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also supporting Romney Victory are several corporate PACs,
including Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), which gave $40,000, and
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI), which contributed $15,000. A lobbyist
for Anheuser-Busch, Michael Roche, brought in $25,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Kansas Governor Bill Graves, president and chief
executive officer of the Arlington, Virginia-based American
Trucking Associations, raised $587,500 for the joint fundraising
committee. Patrick Durkin, a lobbyist for London-based Barclays
Plc (BARC), brought in $184,630. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217; chief executive officer, Robert Diamond, resigned
his position earlier this month after the bank said it rigged
global interest rates. Diamond won&#8217;t co-host a forthcoming
London fundraiser for Romney, as originally planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC supporting Obama, took
in $6 million last month, co-founder Bill Burton told Bloomberg
Television on July 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both super-PACs are using most of their cash to air attack
ads in battleground states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super-PACs can accept donations in any amount, while limits
are imposed on how much can be given to joint fundraising
committees such as Romney Victory and directly to the
candidates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telefonica SA (TEF), Spain&#8217;s largest phone
company, is working with UBS AG (UBSN) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to
prepare for an initial public offering of its German unit,
according to people with knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica is discussing a sale of a 20 percent stake in
the O2 division for about 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion), one
of the people said, asking not to be identified because the plan
is confidential. The company intends to hold the sale this year
and the final size will depend on demand, the person said. It
may add other banks to help with the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s former phone monopoly said in May it will explore
stock sales for O2 Germany and its Latin American businesses as
the operator speeds up attempts to cut its net debt of more than
57 billion euros. O2 vies with Royal KPN NV (KPN)&#8217;s E-Plus as the two
smaller of Germany&#8217;s four wireless network operators, led by
Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) and Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a very difficult deal amid the current
market environment,&#8221; said Nuno Matias, an analyst at Espirito
Santo in Lisbon. &#8220;It needs to explain to investors what the
long-term prospects would be, such as whether or not there could
be any potential understanding with Slim to consolidate E-
Plus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Madrid-based Telefonica, JPMorgan and UBS
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-Plus Deal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica and KPN had explored a combination of their
German units and an IPO of the joint carrier earlier this year
while the former Dutch phone monopoly was fending off an
unsolicited offer by Carlos Slim&#8217;s America Movil (AMXL) SAB. America
Movil won the 28 percent stake it sought in KPN on June 28,
after increasing its holding in Telekom Austria AG (TKA) the same
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s Telefonica and The Hague, Netherlands-based KPN had
been in talks about a possible merger of their German operations
for the past three years, another person familiar with the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Slim&#8217;s offer for KPN was announced in May, KPN
accelerated the talks with Telefonica, the person said, asking
not to be identified because the talks were private. The
companies reached a deal for Telefonica to buy the stake Slim
wanted to acquire, and then consolidate the carriers&#8217; German
businesses, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal collapsed after credit rating companies warned
Telefonica could be downgraded to junk status if it were to take
on any more debt, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight IPOs have been announced in Germany so far this year,
down 53 percent from the 17 announced in the year-earlier
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of those,
Evonik Industries AG and Schiesser Group AG pulled their plans.
Five of the six IPOs that have price were for Chinese companies,
including Vange Software Group AG (VWA), a provider of information-
technology services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica&#8217;s German unit had wireless-service revenue of
758 million euros last quarter, making it the smallest of the
country&#8217;s mobile-network operators. The division, which also
offers fixed-line phone and Internet services, reported 18.6
million mobile-phone customers as of March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Atento Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O2 and E-Plus would have a combined mobile-phone customer
base of 41.7 million users, which would leapfrog Vodafone&#8217;s 36.5
million and Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s 35.1 million. Based on wireless-
service revenue in the first three months of this year, a
combined E-Plus and O2 remains smaller, with about 1.53 billion
euros, compared with Vodafone&#8217;s 1.7 billion euros and 1.66
billion euros for T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica fell 2.2 percent to 9.75 euros at the close of
trading in Madrid. The shares had fallen 27 percent this year,
valuing the company at about 44.4 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanish operator last month sold a $1.4 billion stake
in China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. to help cut debt. It has also
put its call-center division Atento on the block. Last week,
Telefonica said it had received several offers, without
identifying the bidders. The company is seeking about 1 billion
euros for the asset, people familiar with the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;

a.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut its 12-month price estimate to 520 pence
from 980 pence today, according to an e-mailed note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks to the stock&#8217;s valuation include &#8220;rising costs&#8221; and
&#8220;relatively high leverage and capital expenditure limiting
scope for debt repayment and upside in dividends in the near
term,&#8221; Yulia Chekunaeva and other analysts wrote in an e-mailed
research note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT),
whose products run at least 80 percent of the world&#8217;s personal
computers, are set to report lackluster sales growth as China&#8217;s
slowing economy exacerbates stalling demand for PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, the largest maker of microprocessors, and Microsoft,
the No. 1 software company, will report quarterly earnings this
week. Analysts project both will say sales rose 5 percent or
less from a year earlier, as consumers choose tablet computers
and smartphones over PCs or hold off on purchases altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth is slackening in China, the world&#8217;s largest PC
market since last year. That&#8217;s fueling concern that electronics
makers can&#8217;t count on Asia to counterbalance diminished demand
in recession-ravaged Europe or in the U.S., where a recovery is
taking hold at a slower-than-predicted pace. With Intel and
Microsoft yet to gain market share in tablets against Apple
Inc., the PC industry may struggle to grow at all this year,
according to research by Robert W. Baird  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current picture is lousy,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr., a
fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management
Inc., which owns Intel and Microsoft shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s Europe, it&#8217;s
the chain reaction into the emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts&#8217; estimates, helped by pricing increases in North
America late last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was little changed at $2.79 billion, or $1.21 a
share, compared with $2.8 billion, or $1.20, a year earlier,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Excluding
some items, profit totaled $1.22 a share. Analysts projected
$1.19, the average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent raised pricing last
year to help recoup higher costs for ingredients such as
sweeteners and plastic for bottles. Pricing rose 3 percent in
the second quarter, helped by a 5 percent jump in soft drink
pricing in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coca-Cola delivered another solid and better-than-
expected quarter in an increasingly challenging macro
environment,&#8221; Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Wells Fargo  Co.,
said today in a research note. The results are &#8220;confirmation of
KO&#8217;s durability.&#8221; She rates the shares outperform, the
equivalent of a buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola rose 1.6 percent to $77.69 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity costs this year may increase about $300 million
from 2011, less than the $350 million to $450 million Coca-Cola
had forecast in February. The recent jump in corn futures has
been factored into the company&#8217;s full-year commodity guidance,
Kent said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Corn is not our only commodity, it&#8217;s a combination of
coffee and PET and metals and oils and everything else,&#8221; Kent
said, refering to polyethylene terephthalate, the plastic used
in bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gross Margin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the quarter advanced 2.7 percent to $13.1
billion, according to the statement. The volume of drinks sold
globally increased 4 percent, including a 1 percent gain in
North America. Volume sales in China rose 7 percent while Europe
declined 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In Europe, the consumer is pretty confused,&#8221; Kent said.
&#8220;Less people traveling overall, less people eating out, less
people driving, less people spending and that&#8217;s Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross margin softened in May and June and the trend will
continue through the year, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard
said today during a conference call. The U.S. dollar&#8217;s strength
against other currencies reduced the value of some sales and
shifts in consumer spending to lower-margin products are also to
blame, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overall, in Europe, USA, and Western economies
particularly, we&#8217;re going to see a protracted recovery,&#8221; Kent
said in the interview. &#8220;The U.S. will come out of this first
and better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) rose to an all-time
closing high after Bank of America Corp. recommended buying the
stock because fiscal 2013 profit estimates may be too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney added 3.1 percent to $49.35 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain in four months. The shares have advanced
32 percent this year, re-establishing the record high most
recently on July 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s earnings estimate of $3.62 a share for
the year that starts in October is 15 cents higher than the
average on Wall Street, analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said in a
research note. Profit may be driven higher by the company&#8217;s
theme parks, improving film studio and interactive unit, and
cable networks, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, the company opened Cars Land at California
Adventure in Anaheim, California, after raising theme-park
ticket prices. Cars Land, along with lower launch costs at the
parks unit, may add 10 cents in fiscal 2013, Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s the Avengers,&#8221; the movie based on comic-book
heroes such as The Hulk, Iron Man and Thor, has generated $613.7
million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales for Disney since May 4
and $1.46 billion worldwide, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. The film, third in revenue all-time to James Cameron&#8217;s
&#8220;Avatar&#8221; and &#8220;Titanic,&#8221; countered &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; which
lost $200 million for Disney this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Avengers&#8221; may add 11 cents a share to Disney&#8217;s profit
this year, Cohen said. She told clients to buy the stock,
increasing her recommendation from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
cut $500 million of expenses this year, mostly from
compensation, after reporting the lowest first-half revenue and
earnings in seven years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re controlling the levers that we can, which are
expenses and capital,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar,
56, said today on a conference call with analysts. &#8220;We
obviously don&#8217;t want to go too far on either one because we
think that the world will get better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, who has run
the company for six years, cut 3,200 jobs in the past 12 months
to contend with a slowdown that he said was a temporary reaction
to the 2008 financial crisis. After revenue in all of the firm&#8217;s
businesses fell in the first half of 2012, the company is adding
new cost cuts to the $1.4 billion achieved since last year,
Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income slid to $962 million, or $1.78 a
share, in the three months through June 30, from $1.09 billion,
or $1.85, a year earlier, New York-based Goldman Sachs said
today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings beat the highest estimate among 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, boosted by a gain in asset-management
revenue. Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
climbed 0.3 percent to $97.98 in New York trading at 4:15 p.m.,
below the company&#8217;s $126.12 in tangible book value per share at
the end of June. The company bought back $1.5 billion of shares
during the quarter, it said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Managing Well&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are managing well in a difficult environment,&#8221;
Thomas Brown, CEO of Second Curve Capital LLC, said in an
interview with Betty Liu on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the
Loop.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s still low profitability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on equity, or ROE, a measure of how well the firm
reinvests shareholders&#8217; money, fell to 5.4 percent in the second
quarter from 6.1 percent a year earlier and 12.2 percent in the
first three months of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would not expect that we&#8217;re going to have appropriate
ROEs in a macro environment like this,&#8221; Viniar said, adding
that markets were slower on concern about European government
finances and economic growth in the U.S. and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
week said second-quarter profit at its investment bank fell 7
percent from a year earlier even as it reduced costs 12 percent.
Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, reported a 12
percent drop in second-quarter earnings yesterday and said it
lowered total operating expenses 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asset Management &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s second-quarter revenue from asset
management rose 5 percent to $1.33 billion, exceeding the $1.18
billion average estimate of seven analysts. The figure was
boosted by $217 million in so-called incentive fees, which the
funds collect from clients based on their performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar said incentive fees were helped this quarter by an
April sale by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity funds of $2.5
billion in shares of Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,
known as ICBC. Without that transaction, the fees would have
been less than $100 million, he said in response to an analyst&#8217;s
question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing  Lending, the segment that includes Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s profits and losses from stakes in private-equity and
hedge funds as well as from companies such as ICBC and Facebook
Inc. (FB), produced a $203 million gain in the second quarter, down
from a $1.04 billion gain a year earlier. The estimates of seven
analysts polled by Bloomberg ranged from a $700 million loss to
a $200 million gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Volatile Business&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing  Lending &#8220;is a volatile business -- you do ask
questions as to whether investors want to be in this business,&#8221;
said Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Mediobanca SpA in
London, who rates Goldman Sachs shares neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Facebook&#8217;s initial public offering in May, Goldman Sachs
sold 6.18 million of the 14.2 million shares in its own account
as well as 22.5 million of the 51.7 million shares held in funds
managed for clients, according to the Facebook prospectus. After
being sold at $38 apiece in the IPO, which Goldman Sachs helped
to manage, Facebook shares have dropped, closing yesterday at
$28.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major global stock market indexes including the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 (SPX) and Hang Seng Index (HSI) dropped in the second quarter
amid signs of slowing economic growth in China and the
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Market conditions deteriorated and activity levels for
both corporate and investing clients were lower given continued
instability in Europe and concerns about global growth,&#8221;
Blankfein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banking Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that Goldman
Sachs is targeting $100 billion in loans from its banking
subsidiary, up from $12 billion at the end of March, as it
places more emphasis on a deposit-taking and lending unit run by
Esta E. Stecher. Blankfein was quoted in the article saying &#8220;it
is a no-brainer that we&#8217;ll build our banking business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the plans on today&#8217;s conference call, Viniar
downplayed them, calling the account an &#8220;overstatement&#8221; of the
company&#8217;s strategy of offering loans to wealthy individuals and
corporate clients from its banking unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re raising deposits and we&#8217;ll use some of those
deposits for private individual loans, some of it for corporate
loans, but we&#8217;re not a retail bank,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
have branches, we&#8217;re not going to bring in $1 trillion of
deposits, and so there is no change in the strategy of Goldman
Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $50.9 billion in deposits at the end of
March, a fraction of the $1.13 trillion held by JPMorgan,
according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter revenue at Goldman Sachs fell 9 percent from
a year earlier to $6.63 billion and was down 33 percent from the
first quarter. The average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for $6.25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first six months of the year, Goldman Sachs
produced $16.6 billion of revenue, down 14 percent from a year
earlier and the lowest since $11.2 billion in 2005. Net income
of $3.07 billion in the first six months was the lowest since
the company made $2.38 billion in the first half of fiscal 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which began counting consultants and temporary
workers in its staff numbers in 2009, said today it employed
32,300 people on June 29, down from 32,400 at the end of March.
At the end of the first half of 2008, the company had 21,800
full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter expenses of $5.21 billion were down 8
percent from a year earlier. Compensation, the biggest portion
of the firm&#8217;s expenses, fell 9 percent to $2.92 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compensation Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first six months of the year, the compensation
cost, which includes salaries, bonuses, benefits and the expense
for awards granted in previous years, totaled $7.29 billion, or
44 percent of revenue. That&#8217;s an average of $225,789 per
employee, down from $237,662 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar said he expects most of the extra $500 million in
cost savings to be &#8220;people related,&#8221; even though he said the
number of employees at the firm will probably increase when the
firm brings in junior recruits this summer. Compensation will
decline because &#8220;we&#8217;ll have a more junior and less senior
weighted headcount,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) did business with
firms linked to terrorism, failed to guard against money-
laundering violations in Mexico and bypassed U.S. sanctions
against Iran, according to U.S. Senate investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC affiliates worldwide gave terrorists, drug cartels and
criminals a portal into the U.S. financial system, the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations said in a 335-page report
yesterday detailing a decade of lax controls. Lawmakers plan to
question senior executives from the London-based bank, Europe&#8217;s
largest, at a hearing in Washington today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate investigators focused on New York-based HSBC Bank
USA NA as a &#8220;nexus&#8221; for U.S. dollar services and transfers.
Their report will be the basis of a hearing in which senators
question senior executives including Irene Dorner, president and
chief executive of HSBC North America Holdings Inc., and the
U.S. regulators accused in the report of failing to act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will acknowledge that, in the past, we have sometimes

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peregrine&#8217;s Fraud Went Undetected in Two U.S. Government Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission reviewed
operations at Peregrine Financial Group Inc. at least twice
since 2006 without detecting the fraud that led to the collapse
of the futures broker and a $200 million shortfall in client
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based agency conducted examinations at
Peregrine in 2007 and 2008, according to a list of CFTC reviews
obtained through a public records request. The list, which
includes reviews between 2006 and Nov. 9, 2011, does not detail
what records or procedures examiners evaluated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third review was listed in 2011. A CFTC official said the
2011 exam was scheduled to oversee compliance with foreign
exchange regulations but didn&#8217;t take place because of limited
resources. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because
the agency was still reviewing the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, is scheduled to testify today
at the Senate Agriculture Committee, which has jurisdiction over
the agency. Stephanie Allen, a CFTC spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC sued Peregrine over the shortfall on July 10, less
than a year after being scolded for poor oversight following the
collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), which left an estimated
$1.6 billion gap in customer funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Libor Manipulation Losses Investigated by Five U.S. State &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general in at least five states are conducting
investigations tied to alleged manipulation of the London
interbank offered rate, adding to probes by U.S. and U.K.
authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probes by New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Florida
and Maryland are in different stages, according to the states.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and George Jepsen in
Connecticut are working together, and Massachusetts is talking
with other states about possible coordination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The New York and Connecticut attorneys general have been
looking into these issues for over six months, and will continue
to follow the facts wherever they lead,&#8221; James Freedland, a
spokesman for Schneiderman, said yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain&#8217;s second-biggest bank by assets, last
month was fined 290 million pounds ($453 million) for submitting
false rates for Libor, a benchmark interest rate for financial
products valued at $360 trillion. Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS), UBS AG, Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) are
among lenders facing inquiries over alleged rigging of Libor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays traders who allegedly manipulated rates from 2005
to 2007 may be charged by U.S. prosecutors before Labor Day,
Sept. 3, according to a person familiar with the U.S. Justice
Department&#8217;s investigation. The scandal led to the resignation
of Robert Diamond as the bank&#8217;s chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York and Connecticut are investigating whether the
states incurred losses as the result of manipulation, according
to Schneiderman&#8217;s office. Jaclyn Falkowski, a spokeswoman for
Jepsen, said the states are investigating &#8220;with the goal of
providing restitution to state agencies, municipalities, school
districts and not-for-profit entities nationwide that may have
been harmed by any illegal conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts is looking into the effect on state
investments and is working with state agencies and
municipalities, said Brad Puffer, a spokesman for Attorney
General Martha Coakley. Massachusetts is talking with other
states about the possibility of working together. Puffer
declined to name the states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are currently investigating the serious allegations
around the manipulation of the Libor and working diligently to
determine what, if any, impact it may have on Massachusetts
investments,&#8221; he said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi&#8217;s office is &#8220;reviewing
the matter,&#8221; spokeswoman Jenn Meale said. The inquiry isn&#8217;t a
formal investigation, she said. Maryland Attorney General
Douglas Gansler is &#8220;looking into&#8221; the allegations, spokesman
David Paulson said. Meale and Paulson declined to comment
further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ohio Files Motion to Lead JPMorgan &#8216;Whale&#8217; Fraud Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine filed a motion seeking to
lead a proposed class-action lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) involving the activities of a U.K. trader known as the
&#8220;London Whale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio pension funds lost more than $27.5 million due to the
alleged fraud, DeWine&#8217;s office said July 13 in a statement.
Spokesman Dan Tierney, speaking in a telephone interview, said
the state is seeking lead plaintiff status in the case because
of &#8220;the size of the losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said its
chief investment office has had $5.8 billion in losses on the
trades so far, and that figure may climb by $1.7 billion in a
worst-case scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti declined to comment when
reached via e-mail by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio is seeking to lead a class action initiated by
Louisiana, Tierney said, one of four class actions that have
been filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public pension funds in Oregon and Arkansas as well as a
Swedish national pension fund are seeking to join the Louisiana
lawsuit, according to the Ohio statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees
Retirement System v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 12-cv-4729, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA), Europe&#8217;s biggest discount airline,
asked a U.K. appeals court to block an antitrust regulator&#8217;s
&#8220;unlawful&#8221; investigation of its 30 percent stake in Irish
competitor Aer Lingus Group Plc. (AERL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryanair, which started a bid last month to buy the rest of
Aer Lingus for 694 million euros ($851 million), sued to block
the U.K. Competition Commission from investigating the minority
stake it acquired six years ago. The airline said it would
overlap with any parallel merger review by the European Union,
according to a document describing the case posted yesterday on
the website of the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe by the British watchdog is &#8220;oppressive and
prejudicial to the proper conduct of both investigations&#8221; and
&#8220;is contrary to the public interest,&#8221; lawyers for Ryanair told
the court, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryanair has been fighting with regulators over the stake
since it acquired the Aer Lingus shares in 2006 as part of an
earlier takeover bid that was ultimately blocked by the European
Union on competition grounds. The two airlines, both based in
Dublin, carry more than 80 percent of the 370,000 passengers
that travel between the U.K. and Ireland each month, regulators
have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Competition Commission, which said last month it would
decide by Nov. 29 on Ryanair&#8217;s stake, put the investigation on
hold until the court rules on the matter, Rory Taylor, a
spokesman for the agency in London, said yesterday in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in the law that says what exactly should
happen in this situation,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;We&#8217;d be looking at
the minority share and Europe will be looking at the takeover of
the whole company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryanair is also seeking a court order allowing it to
withhold information the Competition Commission requested for
the probe, according to the document. Another hearing in the
case was scheduled for July 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Schwab Executive Daifotis to Pay $325,000 in SEC Accord &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) fund manager Kimon Daifotis agreed
to pay $325,000 to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit alleging he misled investors about the
company&#8217;s YieldPlus mutual fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daifotis, who led the fund&#8217;s investments, knew or should
have known that the fund&#8217;s regulatory filings masked violations
of its concentration policy, the SEC said in a 2011 complaint
filed in federal court in San Francisco. Daifotis didn&#8217;t admit
or deny wrongdoing, according to a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daifotis agreed to pay a $75,000 fine and $250,000 in
disgorgement, according to the filing, in addition to a three
year bar from the securities industry. Schwab, based in San
Francisco, last year agreed to pay $119 million to resolve an
SEC lawsuit over the YieldPlus Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund fell to $1.8 billion in assets in 2008 from a peak
of $13.5 billion in 2007 after deviating from its stated policy
by investing more than 25 percent of fund assets in private-
issuer, mortgage-backed securities, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In light of the time-limited nature of the bar, Mr.
Daifotis looks forward to exploring the possibility of returning
to the securities business at the appropriate time,&#8221; said
Covington  Burling partner David Bayless, lead counsel for
Daifotis. Daifotis &#8220;is pleased to put this matter behind him,&#8221;
Bayless said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Daifotis, 11-137, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visa Among Payment Firms to Win Partial WTO Ruling on China &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard Inc. (MA) and American Express Co. (AXP) were
among companies to win partial support from World Trade
Organization judges in a U.S. claim that China unfairly
restrains the payment processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTO judges in Geneva yesterday agreed with the U.S. that
China unfairly discriminates against foreign suppliers of
electronic-payment services by imposing requirements on them
that aren&#8217;t applied to domestic companies. They rejected the
U.S. argument that China UnionPay Data Co., the world&#8217;s fastest-
growing bank-card network, monopolizes the handling of domestic-
currency payment-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. protested to the WTO about the limits on payment
processing, saying China favors Shanghai-based UnionPay and
forbids foreign companies from issuing their own bank cards
denominated in its currency, building networks to support such
cards or handling interbank point-of-sale transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are hopeful that this ruling will pave the way for
international payment companies to participate in the domestic
payments marketplace in China,&#8221; said Will Valentine, a
spokesman for San Francisco-based Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest
bank-card network. &#8220;In the meantime, our existing business in
China is healthy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the No. 2 network, forecast in September 2010
that China will overtake the U.S. as the largest market for
credit cards by 2020, with about 900 million cards in
circulation. Total cards probably will increase 11 percent a
year as transaction value climbs 14 percent annually until 2025,
the Purchase, New York-based company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MasterCard has long been of the view that open payment
systems promote growth by reducing the need for cash payments,
fostering innovation and reducing system risk,&#8221; Jim Issokson, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leslie Sutton, a spokeswoman for Riverwoods, Illinois-based
Discover Financial Services (DFS), which has an agreement with
UnionPay to process the Chinese firm&#8217;s card transactions in the
U.S., declined to comment. Sarah Meron, a spokeswoman for New
York-based American Express, didn&#8217;t return an e-mailed request
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Schering-Plough&#8217;s K-Dur Antitrust Ruling Reversed by Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. (MRK)&#8217;s Schering-Plough unit must face a challenge to
its agreement with competitors to keep generic versions of its
drug K-Dur off the market, an appeals court ruled, reversing a
lower-court antitrust decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wholesalers and pharmacies sued Schering-Plough beginning
in 2001 over allegedly unlawful agreements to delay the entry
into the market of generic versions of K-Dur, a treatment for
low blood levels of potassium. Consumers incurred extra costs of
more than $100 million because of the deals, according to the
plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lower court ruled in favor of the company in 2010. The
federal appeals court in Philadelphia overturned that decision
yesterday and asked the lower court to reconsider its ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed with today&#8217;s ruling,&#8221; Ron Rogers, a
spokesman for Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are reviewing the decision and
will consider all our options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck bought Schering-Plough in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal appeals panels in New York, Atlanta and Washington
have upheld such agreements as long as they don&#8217;t delay generic
drugs beyond the expiration of the underlying patents. The U.S.
Federal Trade Commission has campaigned to block the deals,
which are sometimes reached on the eve of patent trials, saying
they cost consumers about $3.5 billion a year in higher
prescription drug prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We cannot agree with those courts that apply the scope of
the patent test,&#8221; the Philadelphia panel said in its opinion.
&#8220;In our view, that test improperly restricts the application of
antitrust law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Third Circuit Court of Appeals seems to have gotten
it just right: These sweetheart deals are presumptively
anticompetitive,&#8221; said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz in a
statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for the pharmaceutical companies to
return to the side of consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, 10-2077,
10-2078, 10-2079, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
(Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s Stoker Misled Investors, SEC Argues at Trial&#8217;s Start &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former director of Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s collateralized debt
obligation structuring group misled investors in the deal at the
center of the bank&#8217;s proposed $285 million settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, an agency lawyer told
jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claims that Brian Stoker negligently violated
securities law in putting together the assets underlying a $1
billion collateralized debt obligation, or CDO, called &#8220;Class V
Funding III.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brian Stoker made untrue statements and material
misstatements to investors,&#8221; Jeffrey Infelise, an SEC lawyer,
told the jury yesterday at the start of Stoker&#8217;s civil trial in
Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claims Citigroup structured and sold the CDO in
2007 without telling investors that it helped pick about half
the underlying assets and was betting they would decline in
value by taking a $500 million short position. The SEC seeks an
order requiring Stoker to disgorge profits from the deal and pay
a fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoker&#8217;s lawyer, John Keker, urged jurors to look beyond
any dislike they may have for Citigroup or for trading in
synthetic CDOs, which he called &#8220;high-stakes, high-level
gambling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who is overseeing the
Stoker trial, last year rejected Citigroup&#8217;s $285 million
settlement with the SEC in which the bank wasn&#8217;t required to
admit any liability. That ruling is on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff last week denied Stoker&#8217;s request to dismiss the
SEC&#8217;s claims, ruling that there is enough evidence for a jury to
find him liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stoker, 11-cv-7388, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Peregrine&#8217;s Wasendorf Sued for Mixing Firm and Client Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell Wasendorf Sr., the chief executive officer of
bankrupt futures brokerage Peregrine Financial Group Inc. facing
criminal charges, was sued by a customer claiming the CEO and
his son illegally commingled firm and client money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators sued the Cedar Falls, Iowa-based firm and
Wasendorf Sr. in federal court in Chicago on July 10 alleging
they misappropriated at least $200 million in client money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael LaSalvia of Naperville, Illinois, in a complaint
filed in the same courthouse July 13, seeks class-action, or
group, status on behalf of anyone who had money on deposit with
Peregrine from January 2010 to July 10, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell Wasendorf Jr., who served as Peregrine&#8217;s chief
operating officer, and two other executives are named as co-
defendants in the complaint, which seeks unspecified money
damages for alleged violations of the U.S. Commodity Exchange
Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasendorf Sr., 64, is charged criminally with making false
statements to Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulators
about how much client money the firm had on deposit. Jane Kelly,
a federal public defender representing Wasendorf Sr. in the
criminal case, declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is LaSalvia v. Wasendorf, 12-cv-05546, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). The
criminal case is U.S. v. Wasendorf, 12-mj-131, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Iowa (Cedar Rapids). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Peregrine Financial Group
Inc., 12-27488, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago). The regulatory case is U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission v. Peregrine Financial Group Inc.,
12-cv-05383, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Wins Ruling Ending Novell Suit Over WordPerfect &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won the dismissal of Novell Inc.&#8217;s
antitrust lawsuit over the WordPerfect computer program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz granted Microsoft&#8217;s
request to close the case in an order issued yesterday. A trial
of the suit ended in a mistrial in December after jurors in Salt
Lake City said they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell &#8220;did not present evidence sufficient for a jury to
find that Microsoft committed any acts that violated&#8221; federal
antitrust laws &#8220;in maintaining its monopoly in the operating
systems market,&#8221; Motz wrote in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell sought as much as $1.3 billion in damages over
allegations that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, while
developing the Windows 95 operating system in 1994, blocked an
element of the software to thwart Novell&#8217;s WordPerfect and
Quattro Pro programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Lundberg, vice president of the company&#8217;s legal
department, said in an e-mailed statement that the company is
disappointed in the ruling and &#8220;still believes in the strength
of its claim and we do intend to pursue an appeal,&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell, which was bought by Seattle-based Attachmate Corp.,
claimed WordPerfect&#8217;s share of the word-processing market fell
to less than 10 percent in 1996 from almost 50 percent in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPerfect&#8217;s value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994
to $170 million in 1996, when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel
Corp., Novell said. Novell settled separate antitrust claims
against Microsoft for $536 million in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews and Speeches &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Antitrust Probe Should Be Settled, EU Regulator Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union&#8217;s antitrust chief said he&#8217;d rather
settle an antitrust probe over claims Google Inc. (GOOG) discriminates
against rivals than pursue an enforcement action against the
world&#8217;s largest Web-search engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In these fast-moving markets with new activities, new
products and new services, I prefer to find remedies as soon as
possible and this is easier,&#8221; EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said yesterday in an interview, referring to a
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Google outlined a proposal to end the
EU antitrust investigation. The probe is reviewing allegations
that the company promotes its own specialist search-services,
copies rivals&#8217; travel and restaurant reviews, and has agreements
with websites and software developers that stifle competition in
the advertising industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said last month he would send Google an antitrust
complaint if the proposed accord didn&#8217;t eliminate the issues
identified by the EU. Such a complaint could lead to a fine or
limits on conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are seeking &#8220;to clarify some of the aspects of
the answers we received from Google,&#8221; Almunia said. &#8220;We have
not yet concluded our conversation, but I hope that in the near
future we will finally decide&#8221; whether to settle the probe or
send a statement of objections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said the
company was cooperating with the commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) can&#8217;t show that
25 e-mails sought in an investigation of possible energy-market
manipulation contain advice from lawyers and should remain out
of reach of regulators, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission told a federal magistrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency, in a filing today in U.S. District Court in
Washington, said that JPMorgan made identical attorney-client
privilege claims for 28 other e-mails that were later turned
over to regulators. Some of the earlier e-mails that JPMorgan
claimed contained legal advice were messages that said &#8220;Great
job compliance,&#8221; &#8220;Are you being sarcastic?&#8221; and &#8220;Plse call
ASAP,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan&#8217;s current privilege claims are the same as those
it improperly made about unprivileged documents,&#8221; Thomas Olson
and Vivian Chum, lawyers for the agency, wrote in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC sued JPMorgan on July 2 to release the e-mails in an
investigation of possible manipulation of power markets in
California and the Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp.
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly directed JPMorgan to
explain why the e-mails shouldn&#8217;t be turned over to
investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, submitted copies of the e-
mails to the court on July 13 so they can be examined by U.S.
Magistrate Deborah Robinson, who is handling the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Advice of Counsel&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each of the e-mails relates to the advice of counsel with
respect to the investigation -- not the adoption of the bidding
practices under investigation,&#8221; Michele Roberts, a lawyer for
JPMorgan, wrote in the bank&#8217;s filing. &#8220;The only possible use
the commission could make of the e-mails would be to peer into
the details of respondent&#8217;s legal strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC opened the probe in August after complaints from
California and Midwest grid operators that JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding
practices were abusive, according to the agency&#8217;s initial court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately comment on today&#8217;s filing because she hadn&#8217;t seen it
yet. Mary O&#8217;Driscoll, a FERC spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Jul 17, 2012 11:53 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-17/goldman-sachs-cuts-pay-as-revenue-drops-to-lowest-since-2005.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Cuts Pay as Revenue Drops to Lowest Since 2005</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut jobs
and money to pay employees and will seek $500 million in
additional cost reductions this year after first-half revenue
fell to the lowest since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation, which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses
and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, dropped
14 percent to $7.29 billion in the first six months, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. Revenue in the same
period dropped 14 percent to $16.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, has cut 1,000 jobs this year to
counter the slowest first-half since before he became chairman
and chief executive officer in mid-2006. Trading, which
contributed about 60 percent of the bank&#8217;s revenue in 2011,
dropped 6 percent in the first half from a year earlier.
Blankfein said last month he thinks the slowdown is a temporary
reaction to the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very cognizant of the returns our shareholders get
versus what our employees get,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar said on a conference call with analysts. Compensation
will probably be the primary target for additional cost
reductions, he said. The bank will add junior employees and will
try to strike a balance to avoid losing talent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) risks European Union
penalties for failing to comply with a settlement to give users
a choice of web browsers, more than two years after it tried to
end a decade-long clash with antitrust regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commission Joaquin Almunia said Microsoft
may have misled regulators by failing to display a browser
choice screen to users of the Windows operating system since
February 2011. The world&#8217;s largest software company blamed a
technical error for not showing the screen to some users and
offered to extend its commitment until March 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already been fined 1.68 billion euros ($2.06
billion) in EU antitrust probes, including an 899 million-euro
penalty for failing to obey an order to share data with
competitors. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed to
offer access to rival browsers as a part of a 2009 settlement to
repair its relationship with the bloc&#8217;s regulators. It told
regulators last December that it was complying with its
commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I trusted that the company&#8217;s reports were accurate,&#8221; EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;If, following our investigation, the infringement
was confirmed, Microsoft should expect sanctions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it only learned this month that it didn&#8217;t
offer its browser choice software to some 28 million computers
running Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the computers
that should have received it. It blamed a technical error and
said it has already started distributing a fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep &#8216;Regret&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We deeply regret that this error occurred and we
apologize for it,&#8221; Microsoft said in a statement. &#8220;We
understand that the commission may decide to impose other
sanctions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said he may have to step up how regulators
supervise companies&#8217; commitments to end antitrust probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent binding pledges by Standard  Poor&#8217;s (MHP) and Electricite
de France SA (EDF) &#8220;are particularly complex and require
strengthening of our monitoring,&#8221; Almunia told reporters in
Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Privitera, a spokesman for Standard  Poor&#8217;s in New
York, declined to immediately comment. EDF in Paris declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators only became aware that Microsoft&#8217;s browser
choice screens weren&#8217;t working when they received complaints, he
said, without identifying who had alerted the EU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s new probe is a &#8220;real surprise, given Microsoft&#8217;s
long and painful past&#8221; with regulators and earlier fines
imposed for not complying with the earlier investigation, said
Mark Tricker, a lawyer with Norton Rose LLP in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repeat Offenses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any fines for Microsoft may take into account repeat
offenses, Almunia said in a reference to the EU&#8217;s 2008 penalty
for the company&#8217;s failure to obey an earlier EU decision. That
ruling ordered it to provide information to software developers
to make compatible products. EU antitrust fines are usually
capped at 10 percent of yearly revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of Microsoft&#8217;s 2009 pledge, consumers who
buy personal computers were given a choice of the 12 most widely

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s plan for an
exchange-traded fund linked to copper will disrupt supplies to
the market and drive up prices to &#8220;create a bubble and burst
cycle&#8221; in the metal, Senator Carl Levin told regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds backed by copper would stockpile the metal and leave
less available for industrial users, including manufacturers and
builders, Levin said in a letter dated yesterday to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Levin, a Michigan Democrat
and chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
said a proposed rule change to list and trade the firm&#8217;s JPM XF
Physical Copper Trust should be denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs trade like stocks, giving investors access to
commodities such as copper without taking physical delivery.
NYSE Arca Inc., the electronic platform of NYSE Euronext, filed
with the SEC to list and trade JPM XF Physical Copper Trust,
according to an April 2 document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and ETF Securities Ltd. have said
they planned to start exchange-traded funds for industrial
metals. ETF Securities started the first exchange-traded
products backed by copper, nickel and tin in London in December
2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Street Corp. (STT), the third
largest custody bank, has purchased Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s
hedge fund administration unit for $550 million in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal makes State Street the largest servicer of hedge
funds in the world with $877 billion under administration as of
June 30, the Boston-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business of hedge-fund administration has been
consolidating since the conviction of fraudster Bernard Madoff
in 2008 spurred new regulation for hedge funds and companies
that keep records for them. State Street added $170 billion of
hedge-fund and private-equity assets when it bought Mourant
International Finance Administration, based in Jersey in the
Channel Islands, in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gross, who runs the world&#8217;s
largest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said
the U.S. is approaching a recession as BlackRock Inc. (BLK) expects
the Federal Reserve to take more steps to support growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-year Treasury yields slid to a record 0.577 percent
yesterday after an unexpected drop in U.S. retail sales
rekindled speculation Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will use
testimony today to hint at further monetary easing. That
followed data earlier this month showing American employers
added fewer-than-estimated workers to payrolls. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and Deutsche Bank AG cut forecasts for U.S. growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is &#8220;approaching recession when measured by
employment, retail sales, investment, and corporate profits,&#8221;
Gross, who manages the $263 billion Pimco&#8217;s Total Return Fund (PTTRX),
wrote on Twitter yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year Treasury yields added one basis point to 1.48
percent as of 4:11 p.m. in Singapore, compared with the all-time
low of 1.44 percent reached June 1. The MSCI World Index (MXWO) of
shares rose 0.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke will present his semi-annual monetary policy
report to lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives
today and tomorrow. He said on June 20 that the central bank
will be prepared to take more steps, including additional asset
purchases, if the labor market doesn&#8217;t improve continuously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everything &#8216;Weaker&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail sales fell 0.5 percent in June, figures from the
Commerce Department showed yesterday, exceeding the most
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. U.S. employment
increased 80,000 last month, according to a Labor Department
report, trailing the 100,000 increase projected by economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pretty much everything is way weaker,&#8221; Ewen Cameron Watt, chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment
Institute, told reporters today in a teleconference from London.
&#8220;There will be some more action from the Federal Reserve, but
not probably dramatic action in a sense of massive stimulus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of so-
called quantitative easing from 2008 to 2011, seeking to cap
borrowing costs and bolster the economy. Last month, it expanded
the program known as Operation Twist that replaces short-term
Treasuries in its portfolio with longer-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With U.S. debt yielding nears record lows, Treasuries are
&#8220;already expensive,&#8221; Cameron-Watt said. The securities have
returned 5.2 percent this year on an annualized basis, which
would be the smallest yearly gain since 2009, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cooling job market is sapping household spending that
makes up 70 percent of the economy, curbing sales at retailers
such as Target Corp. (TGT) and Macy&#8217;s Inc. Fed Bank of Kansas City
President Esther George said yesterday the U.S. economy probably
won&#8217;t grow much faster than 2 percent in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts led by Jan Hatzius cut their
estimate for second-quarter economic growth to 1.1 percent from
1.3 percent, while Deutsche Bank chief U.S economist, Joseph LaVorgna, reduced his forecast to 1 percent from 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sharp downward momentum in the economy&#8221; increases
the probability of further Fed easing either in the form of
another round of quantitative easing or other nonconventional
measures, LaVorgna wrote in a note yesterday. &#8220;We need a couple
of more weak employment reports, with figures near zero and with
the unemployment rate increasing, for the Fed to undertake
easing action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

today to 5.79 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co&#8217;s GBI-EM

started to compile the data in 2003. The yields have dropped 49
basis points over the past month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House opened the doors to
Wall Street today with a visit from Lloyd Blankfein, the chief
executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), who was in the
capital to speak at the Economic Club of Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein was to meet with Jack Lew, President Barack Obama&#8217;s chief of staff, according to an administration official.
Obama isn&#8217;t scheduled to see the Goldman chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president has had an icy relationship with Wall Street
during his time in office as he&#8217;s pushed for greater regulation
of the financial industry. He&#8217;s recently been criticized in the
financial community for what some see as a vilification of the
industry as he campaigns against Republican presidential
candidate Mitt Romney, the co-founder of Boston-based private
equity firm Bain Capital LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of Goldman Sachs are the biggest single source of
donations directly to the Romney presidential campaign and are
the top givers to the joint fundraising committee he has set up
with the Republican Party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 57, hasn&#8217;t donated to either Romney or Obama,
according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics
in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time Blankfein visited the White House was on Oct.
12 for a meeting with Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama
who is also an administration liaison to the business community.
Before today, visitor logs show he had been to 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave. 15 times, six of those times to meet with the president. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegations of interest-rate rigging
by global banks are hurting the financial system by undermining
trust, said Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The biggest impact is once more undermining the integrity
of the system that has already been undermined so
substantially,&#8221; Blankfein, 57, said today at a lunch held by
the Economic Club of Washington, where he was interviewed by
Carlyle Group LP (CG) co-CEO David Rubenstein. &#8220;There was this huge
hole to dig out of in terms of getting trust back and now it&#8217;s
just that much deeper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, isn&#8217;t
among the banks serving on panels that set the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor. Barclays Plc&#8217;s chairman, CEO and chief
operating officer all said they would step down after that bank
agreed to pay 290 million pounds ($454 million) for manipulating
Libor. Other banks remain under investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, whose firm reaped 58 percent of first-half
revenue from trading, said financial markets are damaged by a
lack of trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Uncertainty is something that puts a burden on things --
it makes spreads wider, harder to transact,&#8221; Blankfein said.
&#8220;But also a lack of trust is certainly at least a cousin of
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday it plans to cut $500 million
of expenses this year, mostly from compensation, after reporting
the lowest first-half revenue and earnings since 2005.
Blankfein, who has run the company for six years, said last
month that business is suffering a temporary slump in reaction
to the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Natural Optimist &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sentiment is very bad, and for real reasons,&#8221; Blankfein
said today. &#8220;But by and large the world advances and gets
better most of the time,&#8221; he said, adding that he is optimistic
partly because it&#8217;s his personality and partly because history
shows things eventually improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His own firm&#8217;s business units are affected by global growth
and market sentiment, he said, adding that &#8220;you could not find
a part of the cycle where all those activities would be at a
lower ebb&#8221; than today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are certain things that are cyclical which we don&#8217;t
want to overreact to,&#8221; he said. Still, &#8220;cycles can be severe,
and last a long time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, in an opinion piece published today on
Politico.com, called on U.S. politicians to agree on a long-term
deficit-reduction plan modeled on recommendations by former
Republican Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, chief of
staff under former President Bill Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Folly March &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wrote a note earlier today arguing militantly for
moderation and compromise because this is really a march of
folly to have things go to extremes,&#8221; Blankfein said at the
lunch. &#8220;I would capitulate on either side rather than have
these things go on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein was set to visit the White House today to meet
with Jack Lew, President Barack Obama&#8217;s chief of staff,
according to an administration official. Obama isn&#8217;t scheduled
to meet with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Blankfein said he&#8217;s &#8220;worried&#8221; about Europe and sees
a &#8220;not insignificant possibility that there could be an
unraveling&#8221; of the euro currency bloc, he doesn&#8217;t expect that
to happen. He said he finds it easier to forecast emerging
markets 10 years into the future than 10 months, as short-term
setbacks could interrupt what he perceives to be a positive
trend for those faster-growing countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Job Applications &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had 12 percent more applicants for jobs this
year than a year earlier and more than 80 percent accepted
offers. He said that even Harvard University, where Blankfein
attended college and law school, would be pleased to have a
yield above 80 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has learned it has to make more of an effort
to help the public understand its business, Blankfein said. When
Rubenstein asked if he has any aspiration to go into government
like many of his predecessors, Blankfein quipped: &#8220;I have
aspirations to be desired.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he wants his legacy at Goldman Sachs to be about
leading the firm through strong years as well as in the
aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein wants to &#8220;make sure that we prove ourselves
resilient and come out as a firm stronger on the other side
financially and in terms of the contributions we make and
frankly with an enhanced reputation with the general public,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 460 people attended the lunch at the 25-year-old
Economic Club of Washington, which has about 600 members.
Blankfein&#8217;s discussion today follows appearances at the St.
Petersburg International Economic Forum, the Chicago Club and on
MSNBC last month. His public appearances have increased since
the firm hired Richard L. &#8220;Jake&#8221; Siewert Jr., a former aide to
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, as global head of
communications in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past &#8220;we were a little mysterious and that was a
big problem,&#8221; Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s dollar may strengthen
against the euro beyond the record it reached on July 16,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kiwi, as the currency is nicknamed, has traded between
NZ$1.5507 and NZ$1.5324 against the euro for most of July as the
17-nation currency&#8217;s bearish momentum slowed, Niall O&#8217;Connor, a
technical analyst at JPMorgan in New York, wrote today in a
client note. Concern the euro bloc&#8217;s debt crisis is worsening
still could push the kiwi to NZ$1.51, beating the NZ$1.5324
record it set two days ago, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The euro-kiwi still looks like it could go lower because
the euro is likely to go lower,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;There is further downside for the cross, since it
hasn&#8217;t done anything bullish yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s currency gained 0.5 percent to NZ$1.5349 per
euro today in New York. It rose 0.2 percent to 79.93 U.S. cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drop by the New Zealand dollar against its American
counterpart below the support range of 78.40 to 78.70 U.S. cents
may confirm a &#8220;deeper corrective phase&#8221; and cause the kiwi to
weaken further, according to O&#8217;Connor. The pair is forming a
&#8220;head-and-shoulders&#8221; pattern on its price chart, a bearish
signal, O&#8217;Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A head-and-shoulders pattern comprises three consecutive
peaks on a chart, with the middle being the highest. A breach of
a neckline, drawn across the base of the three peaks, is seen to
indicate a trend is about to reverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a potential pattern developing suggesting a
weaker tone developing,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;If it breaks the
support level, that would suggest that there is further
downside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A support level is an area on a chart where buy orders may
be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) banker
Alexander Wright pleaded guilty to conspiring with a former UBS
AG broker in 2002 to rig bids on a bond deal involving a New
Jersey hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright, 45, pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiring
to commit wire fraud in a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Frank Maas in federal court in Manhattan today. Rebecca Meiklejohn, a lawyer with the Justice Department&#8217;s Antitrust
Division, told Maas that Wright will testify in the criminal
trial of three former UBS bankers, including Gary Heinz, whom
Wright identified as his partner in the conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright told Maas that in June 2002 he and Heinz agreed to
fix the bidding for a transaction involving a New Jersey
hospital, which he didn&#8217;t name. Wright submitted a low bid, then
raised the bid to a price suggested by Heinz, so he would win on
behalf of JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I knew at the time that my actions were wrong and against
the law,&#8221; Wright told Maas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright will pay $29,600 in victim restitution under the
terms of his plea agreement with prosecutors. He faces as long
as five years in prison when he&#8217;s sentenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Ghavami, former co-head of UBS&#8217;s municipal
derivatives group, Heinz and Michael Welty are scheduled to be
tried July 30 on bid-rigging charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright was released on $100,000 bond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) listed an exchange-traded
note tied to the same index of master-limited partnerships as a
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) security that capped new share issuance
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank, started trading the ETRACS
Alerian MLP Index (AMZ) ETN today under ticker AMU. The note tracks
the Alerian MLP Index, a group of 50 publicly traded companies
that don&#8217;t pay federal income taxes and rely on assets, such as
pipelines, to generate cash flow for taxable payouts to holders.
The note is the second tied to the gauge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for notes tied to MLPs has surged as new
technologies such as hydraulic fracturing increase oil and gas
production, Ethan Bellamy, a Robert W. Baird  Co. equity
analyst, said in May. Investors also have flocked to them
because they can require fewer tax filings than investing
directly in partnerships, for which separate tax returns may be
needed in each state a partnership does business, Bellamy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MLPs continue to be a highly-favored asset for investors
seeking attractive yields and relatively low correlation to
other asset classes,&#8221; Christopher Yeagley, UBS&#8217;s head of U.S.
equity structured products, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan limited the creation of shares in its Alerian MLP
Index ETN (AMU), the largest U.S. ETN by market value, to 129 million
on June 14. It reached that threshold six days later, raising
concern that the note could become unhinged from its underlying
index, which happened in March with an ETN issued by Credit
Suisse AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pipelines, Ships &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan note, which makes up more than 40 percent of
the U.S. ETN market, has added 35 million shares this year, an
increase of 37 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s ETN matches the returns from the Alerian index,
which has returned 13.6 percent the past year, before a 0.85
percent management fee. The UBS security charges 0.8 percent,
according to prospectuses filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Master limited partnerships, which trade
publicly, typically invest in assets ranging from pipelines to
ships transporting commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich-based Credit Suisse on Feb. 21 stopped issuing
shares of an ETN tied to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, known as the VIX. A month later, the TVIX note
began diverging from its underlying index to trade at a premium
of as much as 89 percent. Over two days in March, it lost more
than 50 percent of its value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is probing price gyrations in the security, a
person familiar with the matter said in March, asking not to be
identified because the inquiry isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer&#8217;s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of the notes based on the level of
demand for the securities. That demand typically doesn&#8217;t affect
the price since the ETNs track the performance of an index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Douglas Niemann to be a managing
director as it builds a group to oversee about $39.5 billion in
general account assets for insurance clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niemann, who previously worked at American International
Group Inc. (AIG), joined JPMorgan this month to lead the unit&#8217;s
strategy and analytics, according to Matt Malloy, head of global
insurance solutions at the New York-based bank&#8217;s asset-
management arm. Malloy has made at least four other senior hires
since the beginning of the year, bringing his team to more than
30 people globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to see a lot of opportunity to partner with
insurance companies,&#8221; Malloy said in a phone interview
yesterday. &#8220;We&#8217;ve invested in people, and a lot of that has
culminated over the last several months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and BlackRock Inc. (BLK) are
among firms vying to manage money for insurers facing pressure
from low interest rates and new regulations. General-account
assets overseen by the largest fund managers surged by about 20
percent annually from 2001 to 2009, to more than $1 trillion,
according to a report by Swiss Re Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That trend will probably continue, said Malloy. Mandates
from insurers in the U.S. and developed parts of Asia have been
driving growth while outsourcing from European insurers will
increase, he said. JPMorgan has boosted its number of insurance
asset-management clients by about 40 percent since the end of
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Income &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plunging bond yields have put pressure on insurers&#8217; income
as they&#8217;re forced to reinvest proceeds from maturing securities
at lower rates. That&#8217;s made it more difficult for life insurers
to meet returns they&#8217;ve guaranteed customers on retirement
products and for property-casualty insurers to post a profit
when they lose money on underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Niemann&#8217;s job will be to advise insurance clients
on investments, said Malloy. Niemann has worked at Zurich
Insurance Group AG, where he managed the market risk for
investment portfolios worldwide. He holds an MBA from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Business and a
bachelor&#8217;s degree from Northwestern University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent hires in the group include managing directors
Greg Tell, who joined this month from MetLife Inc. (MET) to oversee
fixed-income investments in New York, and Pat Tuttle in Chicago.
Neil Moge was hired as an executive director in London in
January, while Jeffrey Xia joined the group as a vice president
in the first quarter. JPMorgan has also been investing in its
technology to support its insurance clients, Malloy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and BlackRock had the most insurer general
account assets under management at the end of last year, with
more than $200 billion apiece, according to a preliminary survey
by Insurance Asset Manager, a trade publication. Conning was the
third-largest with $86 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, with $59.5 billion in general account assets
under management, has boosted investment in its business that
oversees insurer funds, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
and President Gary Cohn wrote in the bank&#8217;s most recent annual
report. Outsourcing has been accelerated by &#8220;new capital
regimes, greater demand as a result of the financial crisis and
a sustained low interest rate environment,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd. should match
MasterCard Inc.&#8217;s lower fees for credit cards to settle a
European Union antitrust investigation, the EU&#8217;s antitrust chief
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said he hoped
that Visa Europe, operator of the largest payment-card network
in the 27-nation EU, would reduce the fees it charges for cross-
border credit-card transactions to &#8220;the level we have agreed in
the past with MasterCard&#8221; to end a five-year probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the best way to advance is, as a first step, to
agree on this 0.3 percent to be on equal terms with its main
competitor MasterCard,&#8221; Almunia told Bloomberg News in an
interview on July 16. &#8220;In this area it&#8217;s better to reach
agreements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said in May that total costs retailers face to
handle payments haven&#8217;t decreased since 2006. Regulators settled
earlier probes into Visa Europe and MasterCard concerning the
fees they charge on debit card transactions outside a user&#8217;s
home country. Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard and some of the biggest U.S.
banks this month agreed to a U.S. settlement of at least $6.05
billion in a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-
card swipe fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe &#8220;is committed to continuing dialog to reach a
commercially acceptable agreement setting credit and deferred-
debit interchange&#8221; fees, said Amanda Kamin, a spokeswoman for
the company in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debit Cards &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe reduced similar fees for debit cards last year
to settle a 2009 EU complaint. The company split from Visa Inc.
before the U.S. card company&#8217;s initial public offering in early
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia will meet with Visa Europe&#8217;s Chief Executive
Officer Peter Ayliffe next week, he said. The EU is continuing
its investigation into the card fees and is still waiting for
proposals from the company on any possible settlement. He didn&#8217;t
rule out sending an antitrust complaint to Visa Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a possibility during the next steps of investigation
additional objections can appear,&#8221; Almunia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU commissioner said a May court decision backing
regulators&#8217; curb on MasterCard (MA)&#8217;s cross-border card fees should
encourage Visa &#8220;to follow the route of an agreement and not to
continue the confrontational&#8221; approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s General Court rejected MasterCard&#8217;s challenge to
the EU decision that it unfairly inflated the transaction fees
paid by retailers for processing payments. MasterCard will
appeal the case to the EU&#8217;s highest court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers have long complained about the cost they are
charged to accept card payments. Unlike for checks, banks charge
interchange fees to process debit- and credit-card payments.
Card operators set the amounts, own the payment networks and
pass the money to the lenders. The retailer&#8217;s bank pays the fees
to the customer&#8217;s card issuer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission proposed penalties of $29.8 million for alleged
manipulation of New England&#8217;s power market in the agency&#8217;s
expanding investigations that also ensnared JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumford Paper Co. and Lincoln Paper and issue LLC, two
paper mills, along with consultant Competitive Energy Services
LLC and an employee were ordered to pay fines and give up
financial gains made by claiming &#8220;phantom&#8221; cuts in electricity
use in 2007-2008, according to documents released July 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since January 2011, the agency announced 11 investigations
of alleged manipulation in electricity and natural-gas markets
and reached a record $245 million settlement with Constellation
Energy Group Inc. this year. The agency on July 2 sued New York-
based JPMorgan to release e-mails in a probe of possible gaming
of power markets in California and the Midwest. The company
denies the FERC allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does show their vigilance and their focus on
identifying market manipulation,&#8221; said Patrick M. Gerity, a
Hartford, Connecticut-based senior counsel at law firm Day
Pitney LLP, said of the FERC action, noting he isn&#8217;t familiar
with the JPMorgan case. &#8220;Market manipulation can occur.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumford, part of NewPage Corp., and Lincoln own and run
paper mills in Maine. The companies curtailed generating their
own electricity and bought more power from the grid to inflate
their usage while the operator was measuring average customer
demand. After the review period, Rumford resumed onsite
generation, cut demand from the grid and was rewarded under a
program aimed at reducing use, the FERC documents showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Strongly Disagree&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged violations occurred from July 2007 to February
2008. Competitive Energy Services and employee Richard Silkman
aided Rumford, according to FERC documents. The companies have
30 days to response to the agency&#8217;s action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We strongly disagree with FERC&#8217;s allegations,&#8221; Keith Van Scotter, chief executive officer at the Lincoln plant, said in
an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re just a small manufacturer. How can we
manipulate power markets?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Competitive Energy Services and Dr. Silkman deny that
they did anything improper or unreasonable,&#8221; Peter Brann, a
spokesman for the Portland, Maine-based company, said by phone
today. &#8220;They did not involve in any market manipulation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewPage spokeswoman Shawn Hall declined to comment on the
agency&#8217;s action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. allegedly made bids that
resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments to
generators, according to the FERC. The investigation came to
light when the FERC went to court seeking internal e-mails from
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to a two-month high, amid better-
than-estimated earnings and bets that disappointing economic
data will lead the Federal Reserve to add stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), the biggest
computer-services provider, and EBay Inc. (EBAY), the largest Internet
marketplace, gained at least 3.7 percent as profits beat
forecasts. Walgreen Co. (WAG) surged 12 percent after renewing a
contract with Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) Morgan Stanley (MS) slid 5.3
percent after missing estimates as trading revenue plunged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 (SPX) advanced 0.3 percent to 1,376.51 at 4 p.m. New
York time, the highest since May 3. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average added 34.66 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,943.36. The
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.8 percent to 2,965.90. Volume
for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 7 billion shares
today, up 4.8 percent from the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been watching very good earnings, but there were
too many disappointing economic reports today,&#8221; Richard Sichel,
who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a phone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s
some comfort based on the idea that if things get worse, the Fed
will do something. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s advance extended a three-day rally in the SP 500
to 1.7 percent. Earnings have exceeded analyst estimates at
about 71 percent of the 102 SP 500 companies that have reported
quarterly results so far, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Analysts project a 2.1 percent decline in second-
quarter profits, the data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors also watched economic data. Sales of existing
U.S. homes unexpectedly dropped and manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region contracted for a third month. Other reports
today showed consumer confidence weakened, claims for
unemployment benefits rose and an index of leading economic
indicators declined more than forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said policy makers are studying options for further easing that
could be deployed in case economic growth remains too feeble to
produce a lasting decline in unemployment. The Federal Open
Market Committee meets Aug. 1 to continue debating whether
further action is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bets on more stimulus measures and better-than-estimated
earnings helped send the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of
companies most-tied to the economy up 2.7 percent in three days.
Technology companies, which make up about 20 percent of the SP
500, added 1.4 percent today for the best gain among 10 groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM (INDU) climbed 3.8 percent, the most since Jan. 20, to
$195.34. IBM, which accounts for more than 11 percent of the
Dow, added 54 points to the share price-weighted average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology Spending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s decade-long shift to higher-margin software
sales helped it overcome a slowdown in technology spending last
quarter. IBM aims to get half of its earnings from software by
2015 -- a move away from less-profitable hardware and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay soared 8.6 percent to $43.95, the highest price since
2006. Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe has increased
spending on advertising and new technology to expand beyond
EBay&#8217;s auction roots and let shoppers buy more items in instant
sales, similar to those on Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) increased 4.3 percent to $58.44. The largest
seller of mobile-phone semiconductors gained after quarterly
results showed consumers in emerging markets are trading up to
next-generation handsets, lifting profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textron Inc. (TXT) rallied 12 percent to $26.50 as earnings beat
estimates. The company is considering a bid for part or all of
Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the bankrupt business-jet maker in
exclusive talks with China&#8217;s Superior Aviation Beijing Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital One &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) climbed 2.7 percent to $56.37.
The lender that gets more than half of its revenue from credit
cards reported second-quarter results that exceeded some
analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreen soared 12 percent, the most since 2008, to $34.62.
The largest U.S. drugstore chain renewed a contract to provide
Express Scripts customers with prescriptions, ending a dispute
that contributed to an 11 percent drop in the retailer&#8217;s
quarterly profit. Express Scripts rallied 1.9 percent to $58.76.
CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) lost 6.5 percent to $45.43. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) jumped 4.8 percent to $20.66. Bill Ackman,
the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management LP, reiterated
his confidence in Chief Executive Officer Ron Johnson&#8217;s
turnaround efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Solar Inc. (FSLR) added 4.6 percent to $15.13. The world&#8217;s
largest maker of thin-film solar panels advanced after two
Mumbai-based companies secured U.S. loans to buy panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Electronic Arts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) surged 6.7 percent to $12.27. The
second-largest video-game publisher gained after Chief Executive
Officer John Riccitiello suggested investors are overlooking the
company&#8217;s growth potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the largest financial institutions declined today.
Morgan Stanley slumped 5.3 percent to $13.25. The New York-based
company reported a 50 percent drop in earnings and said it will
cut more jobs as revenue from trading stocks and bonds declined
the most among Wall Street banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) dropped 3.6 percent to $7.26.
Citigroup Inc. (C) lost 1.9 percent to $26.59. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
retreated 1.4 percent to $34.46. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone shares had the biggest decline among 10 groups in the
SP 500, falling 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon (VZ) Communications Inc., the second-largest U.S. phone
company, dropped 2.9 percent to $44.54. Second-quarter net
income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.29 billion, or 64
cents a share, from $3.6 billion, or 57 cents, a year earlier.
That matched the average estimate of analysts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson Controls Inc. dropped 7.9 percent to $26.07. The
largest U.S. auto supplier lowered its forecast for profit for
the fourth quarter because of softness in global markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) slipped 2.4 percent to $54.99.
Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley said profit margins are
being squeezed in its Medicare and Medicaid plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhill  Co. retreated 3.5 percent to $36.36. The
advisory firm founded by Robert Greenhill reported a 90 percent
drop in second-quarter net income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safeway Inc. (SWY) slid 4.2 percent to $15.80. The second-largest
U.S. grocer reported a 17 percent decline in quarterly profit
from continuing operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millionaires added U.S. stocks more than any other asset in
the latest year as average investors fled to bonds, according to
a survey by Fidelity Investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1,020 Households &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty percent of the 1,020 households surveyed said they
bought individual domestic equities in the 12 months ended in
March, the Boston-based mutual fund firm said. Cash ranked
second, with 13 percent saying they added to that asset class.
Eleven percent purchased exchange-traded funds, and 10 percent
each added individual U.S. bonds or domestic stock funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broader investing public has sought refuge in fixed
income since the global credit crisis sent the SP 500 down 38
percent in 2008, eight years after the meltdown in technology
stocks. U.S. equity mutual funds suffered net withdrawals of
$130 billion in the 12 months ended March 31, according to
Chicago-based research firm Morningstar Inc. Bond funds
attracted $191 billion. The SP 500 gained 9.2 percent this year
through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re probably ahead of the average investor in how
they view opportunities,&#8221; Bob Oros, executive vice president in
Fidelity&#8217;s institutional wealth services group, said of
millionaires in an interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re becoming less and less
risk-averse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ravery, 55, is currently vice chairman of European

&lt;p&gt;Colombia, the largest supplier of
cocaine to the U.S., is increasing anti-drug operations in
coordination with its South American neighbors as its production
of the narcotic falls to a two-decade low, the nation&#8217;s top
anti-drug official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia is developing plans for near-simultaneous strikes
with neighbors including Peru and Ecuador on drug crops and
hidden laboratories in border areas, General Luis Alberto Perez
Alvaran said yesterday in an interview in Bogota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It affects traffickers in both countries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
have border areas with illicit crops on both sides.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia has intensified attacks against drug-funded
guerrilla groups that process and export the cocaine --including
in disposable submersibles. The government wants to push
production of the narcotic down by 25 tons to about 320 tons
this year while shrinking the area where rebels and crime
organizations grow coca leaves, the main ingredient in cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government already is working with neighboring
countries to capture traffickers, track the ingredients used to
process cocaine and find the location of processing
laboratories, Perez Alvaran said from his headquarters near an
airfield. Concern about slowing global economies hasn&#8217;t affected
demand for the drug in a market where the dollar remains the
favored currency by traffickers, Perez Alvaran said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia is targeting areas near its borders that are among
the last strongholds for cocaine production because thick jungle
in many areas helps provide camouflage for labs and makes access
by the military difficult. Because the government doesn&#8217;t spray
pesticides near its borders, coca plants have to be manually
pulled out by the root in border areas often dotted with
landmines, Perez Alvaran said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reducing Plantings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia wants to cut the total area planted with coca to
less than 50,000 hectares (124,000 acres) this year from as much
as 64,000 hectares last year and 165,000 hectares in 2000. The
goal is less than 30,000 hectares in 2014, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Colombia, the nation&#8217;s police will begin increasing
their presence in areas where coca has been eradicated to
prevent the drug from being replanted, he said. Planted areas
have become smaller, making it tougher to locate and eradicate
them, especially in areas defended by guerrillas and criminal
groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to move our troops to those
sites,&#8221; Perez Alvaran said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 90 percent of cocaine in the U.S. originated in
Colombia, according to a June 2011 United Nations&#8217; report.
Declines in the nation&#8217;s output reduced global cocaine
production even as supplies grew from Peru and Bolivia. The
three nations produced 100 percent of global supplies of coca
leaf for a global cocaine market worth about $85 billion in
2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, his wife and a limited-liability company
linked to him bought $17.1 million of the bank&#8217;s shares after
the stock slid amid trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusts tied to Dimon and the limited-liability firm sold
$13.5 million in preferred shares in the New York-based bank,
according to a regulatory filing today with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The transactions occurred yesterday and
today, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has declined 24
percent since Bloomberg News first reported on April 5 that a
unit of the New York-based bank had amassed credit-derivative
bets big enough to move markets. The firm said July 13 that
losses on the trades had reached $5.8 billion this year and may
eventually amount to as much as $7.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I expect this is meant as a sign of his confidence in the
bank,&#8221; John Coffee, a securities-law professor at Columbia
University Law School, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, and his wife directly or indirectly hold more
than 5.6 million shares of the bank, according to the filing.
The holdings are worth about $190 million, based on today&#8217;s
closing price of $33.90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on Dimon&#8217;s transactions. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Inyoung Hwang, Whitney Kisling and Nina Mehta" date="Jul 20, 2012  5:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-20/hourly-price-swings-whipsaw-investors-in-ibm-coke-mcdonald-s.html"><headline>Investors Whipsawed by Price Swings in IBM, Coca-Cola</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Investors in three of the biggest
Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) stocks were whipsawed by price
swings that repeated every hour yesterday, fueling speculation
the moves were a consequence of computerized trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), McDonald&#8217;s
Corp. (MCD) and Coca-Cola Co. (KO) swung between successive lows and highs
in intervals that began near the top and bottom of each hour,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. While only IBM finished more
than 1 percent higher, the intraday patterns weren&#8217;t accompanied
by any breaking news in the three companies where $3.42 billion
worth of shares changed hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have increased scrutiny of computerized
strategies that rose to prominence in the U.S. after more than a
decade of market structure reform. The Securities and Exchange
Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission blamed a
broker&#8217;s algorithm for setting into motion the events that
caused the May 2010 market crash that briefly erased $862
billion from U.S. equities in less than 20 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Somebody probably has software that&#8217;s running an
algorithm that&#8217;s either selling in 30-minute intervals or
buying,&#8221; Bruce W. Weber, dean of the Alfred Lerner College of
Business and Economics at the University of Delaware, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;For the market value of Coke to be going
up and down in this way, oscillating every hour, is a pretty
disconcerting observation. This is not going to raise investors&#8217;
confidence in the mechanics of our market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Value Traded &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment
on the trading, as did Kent Landers, a spokesman for Coca-Cola.
Vineeta Durani of IBM didn&#8217;t return a call and e-mail requesting
comment. McDonald&#8217;s didn&#8217;t immediately make a representative
available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not aware of any issues,&#8221; said Rich Adamonis, a
spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, where the companies
are listed. &#8220;Nor were there any circuit breakers or other halts
applied to those stocks. We didn&#8217;t receive any complaints in our
market. Everything was fine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1.5 percent to $192.45 today, while McDonald&#8217;s
slipped 1.3 percent to $91.58. Coca-Cola lost 0.7 percent to
$77.03. Apple Inc. (AAPL), which also had hourly price swings
yesterday, dropped 1.6 percent to $604.30 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Programs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithms are trading strategies that break larger buy or
sell orders into smaller pieces over a specified period of time
such as an hour or day. Traders at fund managers or brokers use
them to mute price impact and mask activity as they try to scoop
up visible and hidden orders spread across exchanges and
alternative venues such as dark pools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A volume-weighted average price, or VWAP, strategy seeks to
buy or sell stock over a certain period, weighted for the number
of shares traded at different levels. A time-weighted average
price algorithm tries to buy or sell over set intervals of time.
More aggressive and tailored algorithms exist to fine-tune
trading based on market conditions such as volume, volatility or
the price movements of indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the three Dow stocks represented 14 percent of
the value of trading in the index yesterday. IBM, which reported
results July 18, made up 8.1 percent, with $2.03 billion
changing hands, more than every stock in the index except Pfizer
Inc., the data show. Yesterday had the highest value traded for
the three stocks since March 16, when $3.52 billion changed
hands, and it is almost twice the 2012 average of $1.96 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple traded $9.56 billion of shares yesterday, the most
since July 11, data show. The stock rose about 0.5 percent six
times at the start of the hour and lost part of the gains by the
end, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scratching Heads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every fundamentally oriented trader/investor is
scratching their head,&#8221; Nicholas Colas, the New York-based
chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;These are high-dollar stocks, and major weightings, relatively
speaking, in indexes such as the Dow and SP 500.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10.4 million shares of IBM changed hands yesterday,
twice the daily average of the past 12 months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. About 9.03 million shares of Coke changed hands,
25 percent more than the three-month average. The total number
of shares traded in McDonald&#8217;s yesterday was 7.43 million, 13
percent more than the three-month average. The number of Apple
shares traded jumped 72 percent yesterday from July 18. About
15.6 million shares of Apple changed hands or 7.3 percent below
the average in the past three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Significantly Higher&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Volume was significantly higher in most of those names
yesterday, which combined with the exaggerated price moves would
indicate that there were large orders placed in the algo,&#8221; said
Mark Turner, head of U.S. sales trading at New York-based
Instinet Inc., which accounts for almost 5 percent of daily U.S.
equities volume, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s intraday low was $76.50 at 9:58 a.m. The stock
rose to $77.25 at 10:28, fell 0.7 percent to $76.71 at 11 a.m.,
rose 0.9 percent to $77.40 at 11:29 a.m., and fell 0.8 percent
to $76.79 at 11:59 a.m. It hit successive highs at 12:29 p.m.,
1:22 p.m. and 2:29 p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s conceivable there was an algo involved but most
don&#8217;t run on the half hour,&#8221; said Bernard Donefer, a professor
at Baruch College who wrote the April 2010 article &#8220;Algos Gone
Wild&#8221; for the Journal of Trading. &#8220;They run every couple of
minutes, or seconds or even faster. That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.
It doesn&#8217;t seem like something you would see with a normal
algo.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, whose earnings topped analyst estimates, closed up 3.8
percent at $195.34, the biggest gain in the Dow. During the day,
the stock climbed 0.77 percent or more to an intraday high six
times, each time losing almost all of its gain in an hour. The
shares reached highs of $196.59 at 12:28 p.m., $196.44 at 1:27
p.m. and $196.49 at 2:29 p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like some bad trading,&#8221; David Mechner, chief
executive officer of Pragma Securities LLC, a New York-based
firm that provides algorithmic trading tools and analytical
services, said in a phone interview about the activities across
the four companies. &#8220;There&#8217;s probably some kind of systematic
trading in one interval that stops or reverses in the next. The
unknown is what was driving that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of aggressive half-hour orders is a more likely
explanation than a large buyer and seller alternately pushing
the prices up and down, Mechner said. Gaming activity isn&#8217;t
likely since that usually occurs at much shorter time frames and
involves less financial risk, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Get Punished&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies that make mistakes like that get punished by
losing money,&#8221; Mechner said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a threat in terms of
systematic risk to the market. It was very odd to see swings
that represent so much value that were so regular, but I think
the market worked fine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swings may have resulted from hedging long equity
options since the contracts were due to expire today and the
largest deals were at levels close to the stock price,
increasing the risk their owners faced, according to Marko Kolanovic, global head of derivatives and quantitative strategy
at JPMorgan  Chase Co. If the price of the stock underlying the
option rises, the owner would need to sell shares to manage
risk, or buy to manage the option position if shares decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repeating Patterns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four stocks with repeating price patterns yesterday had
the biggest net long options positions among SP 500 Index
companies, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s calculations, Kolanovic said
in a note to clients today. The amount traded in the stocks was
also consistent with what traders would have had to buy or sell,
indicating that the patterns could be &#8220;almost entirely
explained&#8221; by their need to hedge, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the price pattern of KO, IBM, MCD and
AAPL yesterday was caused by hedging of options by a computer
algorithm,&#8221; Kolanovic said in the note that referred to the
companies by their ticker symbols. &#8220;It was likely an experiment
in automatically hedging large option positions with a time-
weighted algorithm that has gone wrong for the hedger.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audit Trail &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC voted last week to require exchanges and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to build a single system
to monitor and analyze trading activity on U.S. equity and
options markets. The rule mandates a so-called consolidated
audit trail to expedite surveillance across 13 equity exchanges,
10 options markets and more than 200 broker-dealers that execute
stock trades away from public venues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort is part of the agency&#8217;s response to the May 6,
2010, stock rout that temporarily sent the Dow down almost 1,000
points. The so-called flash crash was triggered by a mutual fund
firm&#8217;s algorithmic trade that sparked the rapid selling of
financial futures because it took into account volume but not
price or time, according to a report released by the SEC and
CFTC in October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s probably disconcerting to people who want to feel
stocks are always priced efficiently,&#8221; Mechner said about
yesterday&#8217;s price moves. &#8220;But it&#8217;s well known that trading
activity can push prices out of equilibrium and when aggressive
trading stops, prices revert.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX)
fell, capping the biggest decline in about a month, as the euro
tumbled after Spain said the recession will extend into next
year and concern about its regional governments&#8217; finances grew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) dropped at
least 1.6 percent, amid a plunge in European lenders, as Spain&#8217;s
bond yields rose to a euro-era record. Raw material shares in
the SP 500 fell on news China won&#8217;t relax property control
policies, intensifying concern an economic slowdown could reduce
demand for commodities. Restaurant shares tumbled as Chipotle
Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) plunged 22 percent on disappointing sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 lost 1 percent to 1,362.66 at 4 p.m. New York
time. It rose 1.7 percent over the previous three days. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average fell 120.79 points, or 0.9 percent, to
12,822.57. The euro weakened to the lowest versus the yen since
November 2000. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was
6.8 billion shares, about in line with the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The problem is everywhere,&#8221; said Tom Wirth, who helps
manage $1.6 billion as senior investment officer for Chemung
Canal Trust Co., in Elmira, New York. &#8220;Once the disease starts,
it seems hard to stop and you wonder whether the euro will
survive. There&#8217;s also concern about China&#8217;s statement because
their actions have been more supportive of asset prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global equities fell in a vote of no-confidence to European
authorities after the final approval of a bailout of Spanish
banks. Valencia, the second-most indebted region, said it would
tap an emergency-loan fund. Italy&#8217;s Prime Minister Mario Monti
blamed unrest in Spain for surging borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Spanish Ghost&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The problem hasn&#8217;t gone away and the unnerving part is
that it&#8217;s deepening,&#8221; said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more
than $20 billion as chief investment strategist at the private-
banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland. &#8220;The Spanish ghost is
rising again. It&#8217;s not only the banks. The regional governments
also need help. Things are not better yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about a global slowdown also grew today as China
will seek to keep a &#8220;firm grip&#8221; on the real estate market to
prevent a rebound in housing prices, Xinhua News Agency
reported. The Morgan Stanley (MS) Cyclical Index, which tracks
companies most-dependent on economic growth, slid 1.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations for stimulus measures and better-than-
estimated profits still gave the SP 500 its second straight
weekly gain. Earnings have exceeded analysts&#8217; forecasts at 73
percent of the 118 SP 500 companies that have reported
quarterly results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial shares dropped the most among 10 SP 500 groups,
declining 1.5 percent. Bank of America lost 2.6 percent to
$7.07. JPMorgan fell 1.6 percent to $33.90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s five biggest banks reported the worst start
to a year since 2008. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. (C),
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley had combined first-
half revenue of $161 billion, down 4.5 percent from 2011 and the
lowest since $135 billion four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw material shares also slumped as a rally in the U.S.
dollar reduced the appeal of commodities. The SP GSCI gauge of
commodities slid 0.4 percent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold
Inc. (FCX), the biggest publicly traded copper producer, retreated 1.9
percent to $33.77. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 24 stocks in the SP Supercomposite Restaurants Index
retreated. Chipotle Mexican tumbled 22 percent, the most since
its initial public offering in 2006, to $316.98. The best-
performing restaurant (S15REST) stock in the SP 500 last year reported
second-quarter sales that trailed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Restaurants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD), the largest restaurant chain, dropped 1.3
percent to $91.58. Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM), owner of the KFC and Taco
Bell brands, lost 1.4 percent to $64.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xerox Corp. (XRX) slumped 6.8 percent to $6.70. The provider of
printers and business services cut its full-year profit forecast
as the economic slump in Europe crimped demand for technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) tumbled 13 percent to $4.22,
the lowest price since 2009. The maker of processors for
personal computers predicted a revenue decline as a sluggish
economy curbs PC sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. lost 6.5 percent to $9.55. The
maker of semiconductor processors forecast third-quarter revenue
that missed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avon Products Inc. (AVP) slipped 5.3 percent to $15.73 as
investors reacted to an announcement that general counsel Kim Rucker plans to leave the company for another post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cepheid Inc. (CPHD) decreased 18 percent, the most since 2009, to
$36.01. The maker of health-care diagnostics said 2012 profit
would be lower than previously forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flash Memory &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) rallied 10 percent, the most since May 2010,
to $38.70. The shares also had the biggest gain in the SP 500.
The maker of flash memory for mobile devices reported second-
quarter profit that topped analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) advanced 3 percent to $610.82. The owner of the
most popular search engine said second-quarter revenue surged 35
percent, helped by its acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings
and as more users clicked on advertisements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy shares in the SP 500 rose even as oil dropped for
the first time in eight days. Natural gas futures closed above
$3 for the first time in six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) jumped 9.2 percent to $45.59 after the
third-largest oilfield-services company reported second-quarter
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) added 1 percent to $69.33. The world&#8217;s
largest oilfield-services provider said second-quarter profit
rose as customers increased their quest for crude outside the
U.S. and Canada onshore market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GE&#8217;s Results &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. (GE) rose 0.4 percent to $19.87. Earnings
climbed 7 percent in the second quarter after profit growth at
the finance and energy units overcame a drop in wind-turbine
orders. Revenue rose 2 percent to $36.5 billion, trailing
analysts&#8217; estimates of $36.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of homebuilders in SP indexes jumped 2.6
percent. PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) rallied 3.7 percent to $10.86. D.R.
Horton Inc. added 2.2 percent to $18.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) and Kayak (KYAK) Software Corp. jumped in
their trading debuts after raising more than planned in initial
public offerings, bolstering the revival in technology IPOs.
Palo Alto, a provider of Internet-firewall technology, climbed
27 percent to $53.13, while Kayak, the travel-site operator,
rose 28 percent to $33.18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) increased 12 percent to $76.38 as
a treatment for a deadly blood cancer won U.S. approval, giving
the company its first wholly owned drug to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protection Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting against U.S. equity losses is
dropping at the fastest rate in more than three years, pushed
lower by speculation the Federal Reserve will stimulate the
economy as concern about Europe recedes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puts with an exercise level 10 percent below the SP 500
cost 8.73 points more than calls 10 percent above on July 18,
the lowest since May 2011, according to data on three-month
contracts compiled by Bloomberg. The price relationship known as
skew shrunk 32 percent since its June 15 high, the biggest
decline since March 2009 over comparable periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. shares jumped in the past month as optimism grew that
European leaders would be able to contain the region&#8217;s crisis
and investors speculated the Fed will increase stimulus
measures. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke this week told senators
the central bank is prepared to act to boost growth if the labor
market doesn&#8217;t improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The acute concern about Europe&#8217;s debt crisis has faded
somewhat, and markets have become a bit more complacent,&#8221; Kevin Caron, a market strategist in Florham Park, New Jersey, at
Stifel Nicolaus  Co., which has more than $120 billion in
client assets, said yesterday in a phone interview. &#8220;The market
has moved very quickly to now speculate about the next round of
monetary easing, anticipating some kind of policy response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered to
identify the person with the most knowledge of possible
regulatory probes of its J.P. Morgan Investment Management and
Chase units related to the labeling of residential real estate-
backed securities as part of a lawsuit by billionaire Len Blavatnik, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 55, sued New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, in 2009, claiming it put twice as much
money into risky mortgages as his investment guidelines allowed
while Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was unloading such
securities from the bank&#8217;s books. Blavatnik says the bank lost
$98 million of his funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York state Supreme Court Justice Melvin L. Schweitzer
yesterday ordered JPMorgan to identify the person or provide a
sworn affidavit that there is no such investigation after a
&#8220;thorough and appropriate inquiry&#8221; within 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik&#8217;s lawyers had served JPMorgan with a notice to
name witnesses on a variety of topics, including one related to
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and regulatory probes of
the units, under an agreement to identify witnesses for the
purpose of taking depositions in the case, according to
Schweitzer&#8217;s order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Discovery Disputes&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There have been a number of discovery disputes in this
case and we&#8217;re gratified that the court sees this our way,&#8221;
David Elsberg, a lawyer for Blavatnik at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart
 Sullivan in New York, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is scheduled to go to trial in December, according
to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment on the ruling in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan objected to the request and refused to identify
the person, saying Blavatnik&#8217;s lawyers hadn&#8217;t shown that any
such investigation exists or is likely to exist and that it
would be &#8220;overly burdensome&#8221; to determine, and that any such
probe would be &#8220;irrelevant,&#8221; according to Schweitzer&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court finds none of these arguments to be
persuasive,&#8221; Schweitzer wrote. &#8220;It is not up to&#8221; the
plaintiff &#8220;to first show the likelihood of an SEC investigation
before it can ask&#8221; JPMorgan &#8220;to identify any person most
knowledgeable about it,&#8221; according to the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Industry Practice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had also said that any such probe would be
irrelevant because it has shown that the way it classified the
investments followed industry practice, an argument that
Schweitzer also rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8216;Industry practice&#8217; in worldwide banking is not always
necessarily synonymous with acceptable or sometimes even lawful
banking practice,&#8221; Schweitzer said. So even if J.P. Morgan
Investment Management&#8217;s &#8220;practice of classifying securities
collateralized by subprime mortgages as asset-backed securities
complied with industry practice, any SEC investigation relating
to that practice would be relevant,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management
Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) had a bigger gain in
multiyear software deals than analysts predicted last quarter, a
sign that businesses are flocking to the company&#8217;s programs as
consumers delay purchases or opt for competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter unearned revenue, a yardstick of future
sales, was $20.1 billion in the three months that ended June 30,
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said yesterday in a
statement. Analysts on average expected $19.4 billion, according
to Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Bellini&#8217;s own estimate was for $18.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unearned sales got a boost as companies placed long-term
orders for such products as Office and database software.
Business buying helped compensate for diminished demand from
consumers awaiting the Oct. 26 release of Windows 8, the next
version of Microsoft&#8217;s main operating system, or opting for
tablets made by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other computer manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is a very strong enterprise player, Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis Sayles  Co., said in an interview
yesterday. &#8216;&#8216;There was lots evidence in tonight&#8217;s report that
they are a force to be reckoned with in the enterprise.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit -- excluding a writedown that gave Microsoft its
first loss as a publicly traded company -- also topped estimates
after Microsoft reined in expenses. Excluding the writedown,
related to the purchase of AQuantive Inc., profit was 67 cents a
share. That exceeded the 62-cent average estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 4 percent to $18.1 billion, compared with
the $18.2 billion average projection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expense Reduction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales and marketing costs dropped 3.5 percent to $3.78
billion. Those savings, as well as a tax rate that was lower
than analysts had predicted, contributed to profit, Microsoft
Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 1.8 percent to $30.12 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 16 percent this year. It fell 5.2
percent in the three months through the end of June, compared
with a 3.3 percent drop for the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, Microsoft wrote down $6.2 billion for
the impairment of goodwill related to its $6.3 billion purchase
of Internet-advertising company AQuantive, an indication the
company&#8217;s online business won&#8217;t grow as quickly as Microsoft
once projected. That non-cash charge is not factored into
analysts&#8217; quarterly profit estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said operating expenses for the year that began
July 1 will be $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion, reiterating a
projection made in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PC Weakness &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the Windows division fell 13 percent to $4.15
billion, below the $4.44 billion average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. That was the fifth time in seven quarters
that the unit has fallen short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer PC demand was weaker than corporate demand in the
period, as was the case in other recent quarters, Klein said.
The trend will probably start reversing with the release of
Windows 8, he said. He declined to give a projection. Windows
sales have suffered as some consumers opt for tablets instead of
cheaper laptops running Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Windows 8 has to work for them,&#8221; Ursillo said. &#8220;Tablets
are a big phenomenon on the consumer side, and it&#8217;s a big pool
of revenue that Microsoft needs to participate in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global PC shipments stalled in the quarter, marking a
seventh-straight quarter of tepid growth, amid weakness in
Europe and the growing popularity of tablets, research released
this month by Gartner Inc. showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top chipmaker Intel Corp. (INTC) this week scaled back its annual
sales forecast as personal computer-demand fails to rebound
among consumers in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low Expectations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablets with Windows 8, including Microsoft&#8217;s first-ever
foray into the computer hardware market with its own Surface
tablet, are set to go on sale Oct. 26. Until then, Microsoft
won&#8217;t be able to materially reverse the trend of customers
defecting to rivals&#8217; tablets, Klein has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the Business Division, largely made up of Office
software, rose 7.1 percent to $6.29 billion. That compares with
the $6.35 billion average analyst estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also in the final stages of development on a
new version of Office, code-named Office 15, which was unveiled
and released in a public test version this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server and Tools revenue rose 13 percent to $5.09 billion.
Analysts had estimated $5.18 billion, on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in Entertainment and Devices, the unit that
includes the Xbox gaming console, rose 20 percent to $1.78
billion. That compares with a $1.66 billion average estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a great fourth-quarter for them in terms of
signing contracts,&#8221; said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Partners LP. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest, it wasn&#8217;t the highest bar for
them this quarter because of the poor macroeconomic environment
and the PC market. People weren&#8217;t expecting that much.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) won a ruling that blocks
generic versions of its drug Lyrica until 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Gregory M. Sleet ruled yesterday that
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and other generic-drug
makers infringed some claims of patents covering Lyrica. He
issued an order barring the generics manufacturers from making
and selling products that infringe until after the patents&#8217;
expiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also ordered the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from
approving the generic forms of the drug until the patents&#8217;
expiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware, in April 2009, with Pfizer alleging that patents
6,197,819 and 6,001,876 were infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the patents was issued to Northwestern University,
which licensed it exclusively to Pfizer&#8217;s Warner-Lambert unit.
The university is a co-plaintiff in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrica is used to control seizures and to treat nerve pain,
including fibromyalgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 09-
cv-00307, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Samsung Asks to Restrict Apple References to Steve Jobs at Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) asked a federal judge to restrict
references by Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s lawyers to the company&#8217;s late founder
Steve Jobs at a jury trial scheduled for July 30 over mobile-
device patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harold McElhinny, a lawyer for Apple, told U.S. District
Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, yesterday that he plans
to show jurors two slides of Jobs during opening statements in
the case. The slides include one when Jobs announced the release
of the iPhone in 2007 -- an &#8220;announcement that went around the
world,&#8221; the lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see an opening statement where jurors see
15 images of Steve Jobs,&#8221; Charles K. Verhoeven, a Samsung
attorney, told Koh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether Mr. Jobs made a presentation is not relevant to
their case&#8221; and excessive use of his image is &#8220;prejudicial to
the jury,&#8221; Verhoeven said. &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be a popularity
contest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute over the use Apple plans to make of its iconic
founder came at the conclusion of arguments and rulings over
pretrial issues. In the lawsuit, Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung and Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world&#8217;s two
biggest makers of high-end phones, have accused each other of
copying designs and technology for mobile devices. The companies
are fighting patent battles on four continents to retain their
dominance in the $219 billion global smartphone market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not doing a complete prohibition of Steve Jobs, but
it needs to be relevant,&#8221; Koh said, adding that she wants to
see the images Apple intends to display before she issues a
final ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 12-
cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Twinings Sued Over &#8216;Bedtime Blend&#8217; by Oregon Tea Company &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Oregon tea company founded by members of a Sikh sect
sued Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)&#8217;s Twinings North America unit
for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendant is one of the U.K.&#8217;s oldest continually
operating businesses, having been active in the tea trade since
1706, according to the company website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East West Tea Co. of Springfield, Oregon, is suing
Twinings, claiming its &#8220;Bedtime&#8221; trademark is infringed. East
West was previously known as Golden Temple of Oregon LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Sikh leader, Yogi Bhajan, served his students a spiced
tea blend that became known as &#8220;Yogi Tea,&#8221; and the students
formed a company to sell and market the tea. He licensed his
name and likeness to the company, and, after his death in 2004,
that license was disputed by his widow. The tea label no longer
bears his likeness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden Temple of Oregon changed its name to East West Tea
Co. in March, as part of bankruptcy proceedings, according to
the SikhDharmaWorldwide website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the trademark-infringement suit, East West said it&#8217;s
harmed by Twinings&#8217;s sale of a &#8220;Bedtime Blend&#8221; tea. The Oregon
company claims the public is confused by the name similarity,
and is likely to assume falsely that an affiliation exists
between the two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East West asked the federal court in Eugene, Oregon, to bar
Twinings&#8217;s use of &#8220;Bedtime&#8221; and &#8220;Bedtime Blend,&#8221; and for a
recall and destruction of all products and promotional material
bearing the allegedly infringing marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, East West seeks money damages, Twinings&#8217;s
profits derived from the alleged infringement, and awards of
litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twinings didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is East West Tea Co. LLC v. R. Twining  Co Ltd.,
12-cv-01298, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon (Eugene). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Party Pieces Website Offerings Run Afoul of Olympics Trademarks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family of Prince William&#8217;s wife Catherine Middleton was
asked to make some changes on its Party Pieces website to avoid
running into trademark problems related to the London Olympics,
the U.K.&#8217;s Telegraph newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games asked
the Middletons to make &#8220;minor changes&#8221; in some of the copy
that mentioned &#8220;Games,&#8221; according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sells a wide range of party-related products
and was offering a ring toss game in the Olympic colors, the
Telegraph reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOCOG, which is charged with protecting intellectual-
property rights related to the Olympics, has been looking at ad
copy throughout the U.K. for such protected words as &#8220;gold,&#8221;
&#8220;Games,&#8221; &#8220;2012,&#8221; &#8220;summer&#8221; and &#8220;London,&#8221; according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft, RIAA, Comcast&#8217;s NBCUniversal Lead Takedown Requests &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) filed the most requests with Google Inc. (GOOG) to
take down links to infringing content in the past month,
according to a Google website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requests, made under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, topped 475,000 for the Redmond, Washington-based software
company. The Recording Industry Association of America, a music-
industry trade and advocacy group, came in second, with 427,000
takedown requests. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBCUniversal unit came in
third, with 218,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google lists all the websites for which takedown requests
have made. TorrentFreak.com, an anti-copyright website, said
that in the process of making this information available, the
search engine company has, in effect, built the biggest database
in the world of links to pirated media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CCC Sets Up Special License for University-Affiliated Hospitals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright Clearance Center Inc., the Massachusetts-based
nonprofit that provides content licensing for businesses and
schools, set up a special copyright license for university-
affiliated hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The license, which is available to any hospital with a
medical school, enables content-sharing from journals, books,
blogs, newspapers and e-books. It covers the sharing of content
among employees, faculty, researchers and students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special license was developed because university-
affiliated hospitals have &#8220;unique needs&#8221; that involve both
academic and corporate users and users in a shared environment,
the center said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;WIPO Responds to U.S. Concerns About IT for Iraq, North Korea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Intellectual Property Organization, a United
Nations agency, is taking another look at its technical
assistance programs because of concerns raised about equipment
provided to nations that are subject to UN sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, any WIPO activity in a country subject to UN
sanctions will be referred to the agency&#8217;s legal counsel for
guidance and clearance, WIPO said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision of what WIPO calls &#8220;standard IT equipment&#8221;
to intellectual-property offices in North Korea and Iran that
has already occurred under the organization&#8217;s business-
modernization program is being referred to the appropriate UN
sanctions committee, WIPO said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIPO promotes the use and classification of intellectual
property and is mandated by its 185 member nations to provide
materials to help developing countries modernize their patent
offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. was pressuring WIPO to allow an external probe of
shipments it made to Iran and North Korea because the computer
technology could have been used for military applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 17, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Howard Berman, members
of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to
WIPO Director General Francis Gurry asking for &#8220;unfettered
access to all documents and witnesses relating to these
transfers to Iran and North Korea.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee has also asked the U.S. government to freeze
all WIPO contributions, according to a separate July 12 letter
from Ros-Lehtinen to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. plans to use &#8220;all elements of American power&#8221; to
prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, Clinton told
reporters in Jerusalem. Iran has been the subject of four rounds
of UN sanctions, including the supply or sale of equipment and
technology, aimed at curbing the development of such weapons.
The WIPO shipments may violate UN and U.S. sanctions, said Ros-
Lehtinen and Berman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran and North Korea were beneficiaries of &#8220;standard
information-technology equipment&#8221; after meeting WIPO&#8217;s needs-
assessment and validation procedures, Edward Kwakwa, legal
counsel at the Geneva-based organization, said July 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer (PFE) Inc. must pay $10.4 million
in damages to a woman who blamed the company&#8217;s Prempro menopause
drug for her breast cancer, an appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors properly awarded Audrey Singleton, who sued Pfizer&#8217;s
Wyeth unit over Prempro, compensatory and punitive damages for
the company&#8217;s marketing of the drug, the Pennsylvania Superior
Court ruled yesterday. Singleton&#8217;s lawyers alleged that Wyeth
hid the drug&#8217;s health risks and a jury awarded her damages on
those claims in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wyeth&#8217;s concerted effort to misdirect physicians from the
dangers of Prempro illustrates the consciousness that its
conduct was not at all reasonable,&#8221; the three-judge panel said
in upholding the jury&#8217;s findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes as Pfizer officials are working to settle
lawsuits over the menopause drugs. The drugmaker has settled
about 60 percent of cases over the medicines and paid out $896
million, executives said in a May filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has set aside an
additional $330 million to resolve the remaining cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. At
one point, Pfizer and its units faced more than 10,000 lawsuits
over the medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Many Patients &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many patients combined Premarin, Wyeth&#8217;s
estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made by
Pfizer&#8217;s Pharmacia  Upjohn unit. Wyeth combined the two
hormones in Prempro. The drugs are still on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Loder, a spokesman for the company, said &#8220;the
evidence in this case does not support the plaintiff&#8217;s claims,&#8221;
and that the company is &#8220;evaluating its next steps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esther Berezofsky, one of Singleton&#8217;s lawyers, said she was
pleased the intermediate appellate court backed the jury&#8217;s
finding that Wyeth officials misled patients and doctors about
Prempro&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court affirmed that the evidence established Wyeth&#8217;s
conscious and deliberate disregard for the cancer risk
associated with Prempro,&#8221; Berezofsky said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singleton, a mother of three from Alabama, began taking
Prempro in August 1997, according to court filings. The results
of a mammogram at that time were normal, her lawyers said during
the trial. She stopped taking the drug in January 2004 after her
breast cancer diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2010 Verdict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sued Wyeth, later acquired by Pfizer, in state court in
Pennsylvania where the company has extensive operations. A
Philadelphia jury awarded her $3.4 million in compensatory
damages and $6 million in punitive damages in February 2010. The
judge in the case later added almost $1 million in interest to
the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellate panel found Singleton&#8217;s lawyers presented
enough evidence that Wyeth officials downplayed or hid Prempro&#8217;s
health risks to justify the compensatory award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors also properly weighed whether Wyeth should be held
liable for punitive damages and reasonably concluded &#8220;Wyeth&#8217;s
actions were not justifiable,&#8221; the judges said in a 30-page
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is nothing in the record that illustrates the $6
million punitive damages award was grossly excessively as to
shock our sense of justice,&#8221; the panel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Singleton v. Wyeth Inc., 050102885, Court of
Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. homebuilders are an attractive
investment as the housing market starts a &#8220;strong&#8221; recovery
that may drive a surge in new-home sales, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing has a &#8220;long list of positives,&#8221; including rising
prices, job growth, supportive government policies and a decline
in the so-called shadow inventory of homes, Goldman Sachs
analysts Joshua Pollard and Anto Savarirajan wrote in a note to
clients. They raised their rating on the homebuilding industry
to attractive from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public homebuilders, which have been taking market share
from closely held companies, reported increasing orders this
year as mortgage rates fell to record lows and the supply of
existing homes for sale shrank. Construction of single-family
houses rose 4.7 percent in June to a 539,000 annual rate, the
fastest in two years, the Commerce Department said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The super cyclical housing market has turned and a strong
recovery in new-home sales is ahead,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs
analysts wrote. &#8220;Over the last year a number of risks to the
housing market have abated, giving us confidence that rising
home prices will drive a 3-7 year up-cycle in the U.S. market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollard and Savarirajan added MDC Holdings Inc. (MDC) to its
conviction buy list, raised KB Home (KBH) to buy from neutral,
increased Ryland Group Inc. (RYL) to neutral from sell and lowered NVR
Inc. (NVR) to sell from neutral. They maintained buy ratings on Toll
Brothers Inc. (TOL) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stocks Gain &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDC Holdings jumped 5.7 percent, the most since February,
to $33.18 in New York trading. KB Home climbed 3.6 percent to
$10.16, while Ryland added 3.5 percent to $26.64. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 13-member Bloomberg Industries homebuilder index
reversed earlier losses and increased 1.1 percent. The measure
has rallied 55 percent this year, compared with a 7.4 percent
gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy has created enough jobs since the end of
the recession in 2009 to fuel new-home sales at an annual rate
of 550,000 to 600,000, the analysts said. New houses sold at a
pace of 369,000 in May, the highest rate since 2010, the
Commerce Department reported last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs analysts estimated new-home sales would
reach 700,000 in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Policies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government policies have improved in the past year by
addressing supply instead of demand, the analysts wrote. Recent
programs include the bulk sale of foreclosed single-family homes
to investors who are converting them to rentals, and the
expanded Home Affordable Refinance Program, which allows
refinancing of properties worth less than their mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors &#8220;have yet to grasp the significant decline in
shadow inventory,&#8221; as the supply of homes for sale has fallen
to six months from 10 months  in the past two years, Pollard and
Savarirajan wrote. Shadow inventory, or the homes projected to
hit the market through foreclosures and short sales, is down 15
percent in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada and Texas, while
growth in building permits indicates a 34 percent increase in
demand in those states, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are quickly swallowing new foreclosure supply,
limiting shadow inventory and creating a floor for home
prices,&#8221; Pollard and Savarirajan wrote. &#8220;We expect any further
decline in inventory to serve as a platform for price
appreciation, further aiding sales.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) were
among companies that reached a settlement of patent-infringement
claims by NTP Inc., the licenser that extracted a $612.5 million
settlement from Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM) six years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed in federal court filings
in Richmond, Virginia, seeking dismissal of suits filed by NTP
beginning in 2007. The agreements cover most of the wireless
phone industry, including phone service companies like ATT Inc. (Y)
and Verizon Wireless, handset manufacturers such as LG
Electronics Inc. (066570) and e-mail service providers like Yahoo! Inc.. (YHOO) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute was over wireless e-mail technology developed
by NTP founder Thomas Campana. NTP battled with RIM for more
than four years before reaching a settlement, and then sued
other companies in the phone industry. The cases were delayed as
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviewed the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each of the parties in this arrangement are in some way
making use of NTP&#8217;s, of Tom Campana&#8217;s, original wireless e-mail
invention, although they&#8217;re at different levels of the
industry,&#8221; NTP lawyer Ron Epstein said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Some are providing wireless services,
others e-mail, others the handset, but they all are getting the
same license.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismissal requests also were filed in cases against
Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)&#8217;s Palm unit, Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and HTC
Corp. (2498) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trial Victory &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campana was an electrical engineer who set up NTP with his
patent lawyer, Don Stout, to hold patents on inventions he
developed separate from work he did on contract. He died of
cancer in June 2004, the day after his trial victory in the case
against RIM was argued before an appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents cover a way e-mail is transmitted automatically
to electronic devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of use of this term patent troll to
trivialize the discussion around what is the source of
innovation,&#8221; said Epstein, who also is chief executive officer
of patent brokerage Epicenter IP Group LLC in Redwood City,
California. &#8220;Ultimately, there was a recognition that Tom
Campana had in fact, back in the early 90s, developed a system
that did wireless e-mail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, Brenda Raney, with Verizon Wireless, and Laura
Young, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said the companies had no
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC, in an e-mailed statement, said it was &#8220;pleased to see
this issue resolved reasonably and without further litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials with the other companies didn&#8217;t immediately
return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases have been on hold pending NTP&#8217;s appeal of the
patent-office findings that rejected elements of Compana&#8217;s
patents. An appeals court last year ordered the agency to
reconsider findings that invalidated elements of seven NTP
patents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. and Statoil ASA failed
to sell North Sea Forties crude even after they lowered their
offers from the end of last week. No bids or offers were made
for Russian Urals in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s largest oil producer, plans to reduce
exports of benchmark Qua Iboe crude to 10 cargoes of 950,000
barrels each in September, two less than August, a loading plan
obtained by Bloomberg News shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude exports scheduled for July and August from Total SA&#8217;s
Girassol field in Angola are being delayed after an incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron offered a Forties cargo for Aug. 5 to Aug. 7
loading at parity to Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 25
cents on July 20, while Statoil failed to sell at 5 cents more
than the benchmark for Aug. 10 to Aug. 12, down 15 cents from
the previous session, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc didn&#8217;t manage to sell Forties for Aug. 13 to Aug. 15
at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc was unable to sell at a premium of 10 cents for Aug. 7
to Aug. 9, the survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol Group failed to buy Forties for Aug. 14 to Aug. 18 at
5 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, while Phibro, a unit of
Occidental Petroleum Corp., didn&#8217;t find sellers for the blend
for Aug. 13 to Aug. 18 at a discount of 15 cents, according to
the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was at 3 cents a barrel less
than Dated Brent, the lowest since July 3, compared with a
premium of 4 cents on July 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for September settlement traded at $103.62 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $106.50 on July 20. The October contract was
at $102.86, a discount of 76 cents to September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnooc Ltd.  agreed to pay $15.1 billion in cash to acquire
Canada&#8217;s Nexen Inc. in the biggest overseas takeover by a
Chinese company. Nexen operates the Buzzard field, the biggest
in the Forties system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s largest offshore oil and gas explorer is paying
$27.50 for each common share, a premium of 61 percent to
Calgary-based Nexen&#8217;s closing price on July 20, according to its
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. Nexen&#8217;s board
recommended the deal to its shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mediterranean/Urals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urals was 55 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, the lowest since July 2, compared with a
discount of 25 cents on July 20, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Surgutneftegas sold two Urals crude cargoes of 100,000
metric tons each via a tender to Repsol YPF SA for loading from
the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk, according to three traders who
participate in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One shipment is for Aug. 4 to Aug. 5 and the other for Aug.
8 to Aug. 9, according to the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Africa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria plans to reduce exports of benchmark Bonny Light
crude to five cargoes of 950,000 barrels each in September,
according to a loading plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation will also export six shipments of Forcados, four
Brass River, four Usan, three Antan, two Abo, one lot each of
EA, Okwori and Pennington, separate plans showed. Cargo sizes
range from 300,000 barrels to 950,000 barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total, which operates the Girassol field, declared force
majeure from July 17 to July 19 after a &#8220;a minor technical
incident&#8221;, Florent Segura, a spokesman for the company, said by
phone today from Paris. Force majeure protects a company from
liability when it can&#8217;t fulfill a contract for reasons beyond
its control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girassol cargoes for loading in the second half of July
were deferred by six to seven days and those for August were
delayed by three to four days, according to the loading program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPC Corp., a Taiwan state-owned oil company, issued a
tender to buy low-sulfur crude oil for loading in September, a
document obtained by Bloomberg News shows. The tender closes at
10 a.m. local time on July 24, with offers valid until 7 p.m. on
July 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qua Iboe for loading from Nigeria rose 2 cents to $1.12 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Bank of America Corp.
executive was indicted for allegedly participating in what
prosecutors said was a &#8220;far-reaching conspiracy&#8221; to defraud
municipal bond investments through bid rigging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillip D. Murphy, former head of Bank of America&#8217;s
municipal derivatives desk, was charged with conspiracy to
defraud the U.S., wire fraud and conspiracy to make false
entries in bank records, according to the indictment filed July
19 in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murphy &#8220;allegedly participated in a complex fraud scheme
and conspiracies to manipulate what was supposed to be a
competitive process,&#8221; Scott D. Hammond, a deputy assistant
attorney general in the Justice Department&#8217;s Antitrust Division,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The division recently convicted
at trial several individuals in this investigation, which is
ongoing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 13 individuals from banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) have pleaded guilty in
the Justice Department&#8217;s investigation. Bank of America,
JPMorgan, UBS, Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and General Electric Co. have
paid more than $700 million in restitution and penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, which self-reported the illegal activity,
has been cooperating for more than four years with Justice
Department prosecutors who say that bankers paid kickbacks to
CDR Financial Products to rig bids on investment contracts sold
to local governments. Municipalities bought the contracts with
money raised through bond sales, which allowed them to earn a
return until the funds were needed for schools, roads, and other
public works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Necheles, Murphy&#8217;s lawyer, said her client would
plead not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government has been investigating this for, I
believe, seven years,&#8221; Necheles said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s indicative
of the lack of evidence against him that it took such a long
time for them to bring any charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte-based Bank of
America, declined to comment on the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Murphy, 12-cr-00235, U.S. District
Court, Western District of North Carolina (Charlotte). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UPS Faces Extended EU Antitrust Investigation Over TNT Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), the world&#8217;s biggest package-
delivery company, faces an in-depth European Union antitrust
review over its bid for TNT Express NV. (TNTE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal may reduce the number of so-called integrated
express delivery services from four to three across Europe, the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement. It extended
the deadline to rule on the deal until Nov. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed acquisition could in particular reduce
competition for the provision of the fastest express delivery
services, to the detriment of direct customers and ultimately of
European consumers,&#8221; EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin
Almunia said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPS is seeking to expand in Europe with the biggest deal in
its 105-year history. It will vault to equal footing there with
Deutsche Post AG (DPW)&#8217;s DHL, the market-share leader. The tie-up with
money-losing TNT will immediately add to earnings on an adjusted
basis once the deal is done, the company said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlanta-based UPS said earlier this month it expects the
acquisition to close in the fourth quarter because EU regulators
needed more time to examine the impact of the deal. It plans to
extend its 5.16 billion euros ($6.3 billion) cash offer for TNT
beyond Aug. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to wait and see what&#8217;s going to happen,&#8221; said
Anton van der Lande, a Brussels-based UPS spokesman. &#8220;We retain
dialogue with the commission and remain confident that we will
receive clearance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators said there are potential competition concerns
for small parcel delivery services, in particular international
express services, in several European countries where the
companies would have very high combined market shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During the next two weeks, UPS and TNT Express will
continue to have a dialogue with the commission,&#8221; said Ernst
Moeksis, a Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based TNT spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said both companies &#8220;remain confident that we will
receive clearance for the proposed acquisition within the fourth
quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Duke Board Lost Confidence in New CEO After Nuclear Delays &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)&#8217;s board lost confidence in Bill Johnson
as its next chief executive officer after he missed deadlines
and failed to provide adequate information about a troubled
nuclear reactor, the lead director said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson, the CEO of Progress Energy Inc. before its
acquisition by Duke, made the board wait nine weeks after it
requested a meeting with the Crystal River nuclear plant&#8217;s
insurer, Ann Maynard Gray testified to the North Carolina
Utilities Commission on Friday. That was a &#8220;tipping point,&#8221;
she said at the hearing in Raleigh. She never spoke to Johnson
about her concerns on the delay, which followed &#8220;many failed
deadlines&#8221; for the reactor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Utilities Commission on Friday held its
third day of hearings on why Duke&#8217;s board replaced Johnson hours
after the $17.8 billion merger closed on July 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC Is Requesting Comment on JPMorgan&#8217;s Proposed ETF for Copper &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting
comments on JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s proposed exchange-traded fund
in copper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is seeking comments within 30 days after
publication in the Federal Register, according to a notice on
its website on July 19. It is seeking information on the copper
market, factors affecting stockpiles and whether the planned
product will affect the supply of copper. JPMorgan spokesman
Patrick Burton declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds backed by copper would stockpile the metal and leave
less available for industrial users, including manufacturers and
builders, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman
of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in a
letter dated July 16 to the SEC. He said a proposed rule change
to list and trade the firm&#8217;s JPM XF Physical Copper Trust should
be denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs trade like stocks, giving investors access to
commodities such as copper without taking physical delivery.
NYSE Arca Inc., the electronic platform of NYSE Euronext, filed
with the SEC to list and trade JPM XF Physical Copper Trust,
according to an April 2 document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, BlackRock Inc. and ETF Securities Ltd. have said
they planned to start exchange-traded funds for industrial
metals. ETF Securities started the first exchange-traded
products backed by copper, nickel and tin in London in December
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC Methods for Estimating Losses to Fund &#8216;Deficient,&#8217; GAO Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is correcting
deficiencies in how it estimates certain losses to the fund that
protects depositors when banks fail, according to the Government
Accountability Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAO found &#8220;deficiencies in controls&#8221; over loss-
estimation methods at the agency, it said in a report released
July 20. The FDIC needs to better document how it estimates its
share of losses under agreements with firms buying the assets of
failed banks and needs to verify data in its loss models, the
GAO recommended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC accepted the GAO&#8217;s recommendations. In a response
letter signed by FDIC Chief Financial Officer Steven O. App, the
agency pledged it would fix each of the shortcomings this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC dismantles failed U.S. banks and uses its Deposit
Insurance Fund to make sure customers don&#8217;t lose money when
banks collapse. When selling off the banks&#8217; assets, the FDIC
makes agreements with the buyers to share a portion of any loss
connected with the assets. The GAO reviewed that process in an
April report that cited a &#8220;significant deficiency,&#8221; and the
report released July 20 made further recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Ordered to Identify Witness in Blavatnik Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. was ordered to identify the person
with the most knowledge of possible regulatory probes of its
J.P. Morgan Investment Management and Chase units related to the
labeling of residential real estate-backed securities as part of
a lawsuit by billionaire Len Blavatnik, according to a court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 55, sued New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, in 2009, claiming it put twice as much
money into risky mortgages as his investment guidelines allowed
while the bank was unloading such securities from its books.
Blavatnik says the bank lost $98 million of his funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York state Supreme Court Justice Melvin L Schweitzer on
July 19 ordered JPMorgan to identify the person or provide a
sworn affidavit that there is no such investigation after a
&#8220;thorough and appropriate inquiry&#8221; within 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik&#8217;s lawyers had served JPMorgan with a notice to
name witnesses on a variety of topics, including one related to
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and regulatory probes of
the units, under an agreement to identify witnesses for the
purpose of taking depositions in the case, according to
Schweitzer&#8217;s order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan objected to the request and refused to identify
the person, saying Blavatnik&#8217;s lawyers hadn&#8217;t shown that any
such investigation exists or is likely to exist, that it would
be &#8220;overly burdensome&#8221; to determine so, and that any such
probe would be &#8220;irrelevant,&#8221; according to Schweitzer&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a telephone message and an e-mail
seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management
Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meat Industry Loses Challenge to Renewable Fuel Standard &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Chicken Council and two other meat-industry
groups lost a court challenge to the EPA&#8217;s national renewable-
fuel standard that they said will increase feed prices in the
U.S as more corn is used to produce ethanol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the U.S. Appeals Court in Washington
on Friday rejected the group&#8217;s lawsuit accusing the
Environmental Protection Agency of improperly exempting some
ethanol producers from requirements that their fuels have fewer
greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuels. The judges found
the groups lacked the authority to bring the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The petitioners fail to show a &#8217;substantial probability&#8217;
that qualifying ethanol plants would reduce their ethanol
production,&#8221; if the rule were vacated by the court, U.S.
Circuit Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote in the opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown said the court&#8217;s decision didn&#8217;t foreclose a later
challenge to the rules, noting in the ruling that a different
lawsuit &#8220;could allow us to address the merits of EPA&#8217;s
reading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups, which include the National Turkey Federation
and the National Meat Association, claimed EPA didn&#8217;t have the
authority to exempt certain ethanol producers from the fuel
standards. They argued they had the right to sue because the
exemption will lead to an increase in the amount of corn being
diverted to produce ethanol, thus leading to an increase in
prices for animal feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although we are disappointed with the result reached by
the court in this case, we are heartened by the court&#8217;s
concluding point that the merits of this questionable regulation
remain open to challenge,&#8221; Tom Super, a spokesman for the
National Chicken Council, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Chicken Council v. Environmental
Protection Agency, 10-1107, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Limits Upheld by U.S. Appeals Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. limits for sulfur-dioxide emissions from power plants,
factories and industrial sources were upheld by a federal
appeals court, which rejected a lawsuit brought by North Dakota
and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three judge panel of the U.S. Appeals Court in Washington
said on Friday that the Environmental Protection Agency didn&#8217;t
act &#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; in setting the 2010 rule that restricts
sulfur-dioxide levels in the air to 75 parts per billion over a
one-hour period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;EPA cites evidence that current levels of SO2 in the
ambient air, even when the air quality meets the current SO2&#8221;
standards, &#8220;still cause respiratory effects in some areas,&#8221;
U.S. Circuit Judge David Sentelle wrote in the opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation revokes standards for the pollutant adopted
in 1971 that included limits of 140 parts per billion measured
over 24 hours. North Dakota and Texas were among five states
that sued over the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA cited research that shows short-term exposure to
sulfur pollution poses a greater health threat than past rules
took into account, including risks to children, the elderly and
people with asthma. Power plants account for almost 70 percent
of sulfur dioxide in the air, according to the EPA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 13, a different appeals court panel in Washington
upheld EPA&#8217;s standards for nitrogen dioxide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Environmental Development
Association&#8217;s Clean Air Project v. Environmental Protection
Agency, 10-1252, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UISA Finance Appeals $146 Million Merrill Lynch Award &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UISA Finance and Usinas Itamarati SA appealed a
$146 million federal court judgment won in April by Bank of
America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan assessed the damages
in April in a breach-of-contract suit against UISA Finance and
Usinas Itamarati involving a derivatives transaction in 2008.
Sullivan conducted a five-day trial without a jury in June 2011.
UISA Finance and Usinas Itamarati filed the appeal on July 20 in
federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UISA Finance is the financial arm of Usinas Itamarati, a
Brazil-based manufacturer of sugar and ethanol. UISA and Usinas
are owned by Companhia Itamarati de Investimentos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch sued in 2009 seeking $146 million in damages.
UISA borrowed $125 million from Merrill in 2007, according to
court filings. After the loan, UISA made an agreement with the
bank for an interest-rate swap in order to reduce its interest
payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the financial crisis deepened in late 2008, UISA was
unable to provide acceptable collateral to Merrill and the swap
was terminated, according to the judgment. At that time UISA and
Itamarati, the guarantor of the agreement, owed
$146 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Merrill Lynch Capital Services v. UISA Finance,
09-02324, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Impossible for Traders at 5 Banks to Rig Euribor Rates, EBF Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders at five banks would have found it impossible to
successfully manipulate the euro interbank lending rate known as
Euribor, said the head of the European Banking Federation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible for those five banks to really have an
impact on the daily Euribor index,&#8221; Guido Ravoet, the EBF&#8217;s
chief executive officer, told Bloomberg Television in an
interview on Friday. &#8220;You need at least more than 15 banks
really aligning their quotes to have any effect on the
Euribor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence in the Euribor and London interbank offered
rate, or Libor, benchmarks for trillion of dollars&#8217; worth of
financial products worldwide, has been dented by Barclays Plc (BARC)&#8217;s
admission that it submitted false rates. Robert Diamond, who
resigned as London-based Barclays&#8217;s CEO after the bank was fined
290 million pounds ($455 million), told British lawmakers this
month that other banks also lowballed Libor submissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravoet said in a separate interview that he had no direct
knowledge of whether any traders had attempted to rig Euribor
and was referring to press articles that cited the involvement
of traders at five banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he is confident that Euribor rates weren&#8217;t
successfully manipulated because of the difficulty of
coordinating rates between the 44 banks on the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217;s submitters received at least 58 requests for how
they should report the Euribor rate from September 2005 to May
2009, 20 of them from traders at other banks, the U.K. Financial
Services Authority said last month. Short-term interest-rate
contracts valued at 241 trillion euros ($295 trillion) are based
on the three-month Euribor futures contract, making it the
world&#8217;s fourth-largest interest-rate futures contract by volume,
the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union antitrust regulators in October raided banks
that offer financial derivatives linked to the Euribor rates,
saying they were investigating possible collusion. The European
Commission is also separately reviewing the governance of
interbank lending rates, which are based on banks&#8217; own estimates
of what it would cost to lend or borrow every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Treasury Says Lack of Data Threatens Financial System &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators face &#8220;significant gaps&#8221; in understanding the
financial system, and the lack of adequate data threatens
stability, the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s research arm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of Financial Research, in its inaugural report
to Congress released by the Treasury on Friday, said the gaps
remain in analytical work by regulators because &#8220;none of them
individually has authority to look across the entire financial
system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office, created by the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul
law, helps the Financial Stability Oversight Council in trying
to prevent another crisis. The council, which includes Treasury
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke, analyzes potential threats to U.S. financial
stability, including the European debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gaps in analysis, data, and data standards represent
threats to financial stability, and helping to fill those gaps&#8221;
is part of the research office&#8217;s mandate, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of the London interbank offered rate
&#8220;resulting from an opaque and closed process that allows a
small number of firms to have significant influence -- poses
significant risks to market integrity and investor trust, and
will require continuing regulatory focus,&#8221; the OFR said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research office also said better data are needed for
regulators to adequately analyze the repurchase-agreement
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Understanding the repo market requires collection of
transactions-level data about the repo market -- information
that is presently unavailable to regulators,&#8221; the office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research unit said it is working with U.S. regulators
to get transaction, position and pricing information on credit-
default swaps contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CFPB Says Students Victimized by &#8216;Subprime-Style&#8217; Lending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students grew indebted and went into default at the hands
of a &#8220;subprime-style&#8221; private loan market that contracted amid
the 2008 financial crisis, a U.S. government report issued on
Friday concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our findings reveal that students were yet another group
of consumers that were hurt by the boom and bust,&#8221; Richard
Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Too many student loan borrowers
are struggling to pay off private student loans that they did
not understand and cannot afford.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Secretary Arne Duncan, whose department co-wrote
the study, urged students to make federal loans their &#8220;first
option&#8221; to pay for college. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Subprime-style lending went to college and now students
are paying the price,&#8221; Duncan said in the statement. &#8220;We still
have some work to do to ensure that students who take out
private student loans have the same kinds of protections offered
by federal loans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private loans can have higher interest rates and lack the
same protections as federal loans, including fixed rates,
deferments and income-based repayment programs. They represent
about 15 percent of the $1 trillion educational debt load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to protect
them consumer from abuses related to financial products
including student loans, mortgages and credit cards. The act
required it and the Education Department to report on the
private loan industry one year after the CFPB officially started
work on July 21, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cordray recommended that Congress require schools to
certify that private loans being offered do not exceed the
borrower&#8217;s need and that it reconsider a 2005 law that made it
harder to discharge student debt in bankruptcy. He also called
for better publicly available data on private loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conference call with reporters, Cordray declined to
specify what the CFPB might do with its authority under the
Dodd-Frank law to regulate private loan terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan made similar recommendations in the report. He also
suggested Congress require schools to determine whether students
exhaust their eligibility for federal loans, which often have
lower interest rates, before resorting to private lenders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate donors kept a tighter hold
on cash in 2011 even while increasing their total gifts of money
and products to $17.1 billion, according to the Chronicle of
Philanthropy&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donations by 166 U.S. companies surveyed by the Chronicle
gained 15 percent from 2010, according to data released
simultaneously today by the newspaper and Bloomberg Rankings.
The cash portion grew more slowly, rising 4.4 percent in 2011
after a 13 percent jump a year earlier, as companies showed more
caution amid waning consumer confidence and a debt crisis in
Europe, Chronicle editor Stacy Palmer said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, was corporate
America&#8217;s largest donor for a third straight year, granting $3.1
billion in gifts in 2011. The New York-based company&#8217;s total was
little changed in 2011 and cash donations dropped 18.5 percent
as grant partnerships ended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every company is stepping back and making sure that its
philanthropy is as efficient and effective as it can be,&#8221;
Caroline Roan, president of the drugmaker&#8217;s Pfizer Foundation,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We are not looking to make huge
new investments, but are assessing opportunities as they come
and making sure that people have access to the health care they
need.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies did manage to increase their cash
contributions. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the world&#8217;s largest
retailer, led the list of cash donors with $342.4 million, a 7.2
percent increase, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy&#8217;s
data. Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) almost tripled its cash giving to $30.5
million last year, the Seattle-based coffee-shop operator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demand Increases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for aid from nonprofits has increased at a faster
pace than philanthropic giving by companies, Palmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because of the small growth, many nonprofits aren&#8217;t
getting the money they need to do their jobs,&#8221; Palmer said.
&#8220;They are having to look to other sources like individuals
since they can no longer depend as heavily on these large
companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Stock Index hold
about $1.45 trillion in cash on their books, up from about $1.36
trillion a year earlier, according to their latest quarterly
filings compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore and Christine Harper" date="Jul 24, 2012  3:56 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-24/goldman-sachs-may-not-issue-bonds-to-match-maturities.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs May Not Issue Bonds to Match Maturities</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may not issue long-term debt to
match the $11.8 billion it has in second-half maturities, said
Treasurer Elizabeth &#8220;Liz&#8221; Beshel Robinson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously, the market is a little bit more challenging
today that it&#8217;s been in the past,&#8221; Robinson said on a
conference call today for fixed-income investors, the first of
its kind hosted by the New York-based company. She said the firm
has a &#8220;number of levers&#8221; to replace the funding, including
raising deposits or shrinking the firm&#8217;s balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which was Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable
securities firm before converting to a bank in 2008, last week
reported its lowest first-half profit in seven years. The report
showed net interest income fell 25 percent in the six-month
period from a year earlier as a 5 percent decline in interest
expense failed to match the 13 percent drop in interest income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs issued $13.7 billion of unsecured long-term
debt in the first half of the year, $12 billion of which was in
U.S. dollars and the rest in Japanese yen, Robinson said. That
compared with $15.1 billion of maturities. While the bank will
&#8220;certainly&#8221; issue some long-term debt in the second half, how
much will depend on the environment, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our view on funding has always been to raise debt
opportunistically when we see attractive opportunities in the
market,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;Attractive for us around funding
means term and diversity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Raising Deposits&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to expand its regulated-bank unit to
obtain more federally insured deposits, a lower-cost form of
borrowing than the firm&#8217;s other sources of funding. Goldman
Sachs held $57.3 billion in deposits at the end of June,
compared with $1.12 trillion held by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
largest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has increased deposits by $11.2 billion this
year. Much of the growth has come from brokered certificates of
deposit and relationships with broker-dealer aggregators that
sweep client cash to Goldman Sach&#8217;s bank subsidiary, Robinson
said. Those categories account for more than half the firm&#8217;s
deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDs have a weighted-average maturity of three years,
and are 2 percentage points cheaper than funding through three-
year debt at the parent-company level, Robinson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re raising deposits, and we&#8217;ll use some of those
deposits for private individual loans, some of it for corporate
loans,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a July 17
conference call after the firm released earnings. &#8220;We&#8217;ll use
those deposits that we have and grow them and use them wisely
for profitable opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Impact&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the regulated bank unit overseen by
Esta E. Stecher, has higher credit ratings for both long-term
deposits and short-term debt than the parent company. Last month
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service cut the credit ratings on Goldman
Sachs Group&#8217;s long-term debt two levels to A3 and on its short-
term debt to P-2. Goldman Sachs Bank USA had its long-term
deposit rating cut to A2 and its short-term rating affirmed at
P-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moody&#8217;s downgrade had &#8220;no impact&#8221; on the firm&#8217;s
funding, and collateral outflows related to its derivative
portfolio were less than $100 million, Robinson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of buying protection against a default on $10
million of Goldman Sachs debt for five years was $287,845 as of
July 23, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. While that&#8217;s
below the $376,642 cost for Morgan Stanley debt, it&#8217;s higher
than the rate charged on so-called credit default swaps for Bank
of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. or JPMorgan, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, 57, has been the Goldman Sachs executive who has
addressed investors, analysts and the media about quarterly
earnings since the company went public in 1999. As treasurer
since 2005, the 43-year-old Robinson has the job Viniar held
before he became CFO and has been trained by him to handle the
firm&#8217;s financing and liquidity needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinson is viewed by some analysts as a candidate to
succeed Viniar if he decides to leave. Another contender is
Sarah E. Smith, the bank&#8217;s controller and chief accounting
officer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) must consider
letting disabled patrons use Segways at its theme parks, a U.S.
appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court today overturned a judge&#8217;s decision throwing out
a lawsuit by a woman with muscular dystrophy who claimed
Burbank, California-based Disney violated the Americans with
Disabilities Act by not allowing her to use a Segway. In earlier
lawsuits, she said she had to use a wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based appeals court ruled that Disney
must take into account evolving technologies that make it
cheaper and easier for the disabled to have the same experience
at its theme parks as non-disabled people. It sent the case back
to the trial court in Santa Ana, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have every confidence that the organization that, half
a century ago, brought us the Carousel of Progress and Great
Moments with Mr. Lincoln can lead the way in using new
technology to make its parks more welcoming to disabled
guests,&#8221; Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote on behalf of the
three-judge appeals panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney may be able to bar Segways if it can prove that the
two-wheeled electric vehicles can&#8217;t be operated safely in the
parks, the appeals panel said. Any safety requirements Disney
imposes must be based on actual risks, &#8220;not on mere
speculation, generalizations or stereotypes about individuals
with disabilities,&#8221; Kozinski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Imagination Left&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting Walt Disney himself, the judge wrote: &#8220;As the man
who started it all said, &#8216;Disneyland will never be completed as
long as there is imagination left in the world.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Bliss, a Disney spokeswoman, said the company hasn&#8217;t
allowed visitors to use two-wheeled vehicles like Segways &#8220;due
to the safety risks they present in our unique theme park
environments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All this decision does is return to the trial court the
issue of whether Segways are permissible despite their safety
risks,&#8221; Bliss said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Baughman v. Disney, 10-5592, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to pay
$100 million to settle credit-card holder claims that the bank
increased their required minimum payments after promising a
fixed interest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord resolves a class action, or group lawsuit, filed
on behalf of 1 million cardholders pending in federal court in
San Francisco. The $100 million settlement fund represents about
one-half of the up-front transaction fees cardholders paid on
their credit card loans, lawyers for customers said in a court
filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial in the case was scheduled to begin this month,

&lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Citigroup Inc. (C), sued for $2 billion by Thornburg Mortgage
Inc. for allegedly helping it fail, lost a bid to move the case
from bankruptcy court to district court as a Maryland judge said
almost all the issues could be decided in bankruptcy court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee for what is now TMST Inc. accused the banks
last year of extracting more than $700 million of margin and
interest payments from the former Thornburg by making
&#8220;unjustified&#8221; margin calls. The banks, including Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN), Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and UBS AG, or their
affiliates, said three of the 31 counts involved allegations of
breach of contract and fraudulent conveyance, which a bankruptcy
judge can&#8217;t rule on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Benson Everett Legg told them yesterday
in a written order that the bankruptcy judge can still uncover
the facts and send his findings to a district judge, even if the
banks are right in arguing that &#8220;that the bankruptcy court
lacks final adjudicatory authority.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was named in the TMST suit because it bought
assets from Bear Stearns Cos., a lender to Thornburg. Thornburg
was organized as a real-estate investment trust and mainly
invested in residential mortgage-backed securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Thornburg Mortgage Inc., 09-17787,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore). The
lawsuit in bankruptcy court is Joel Sher v. JP Morgan, 11-ap-
00340, and the district court case is, 12-cv-00157. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasuries investors raised bets the
securities will gain in price, becoming the most bullish since
February, according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of net longs, or bets the securities will
rise versus those they will fall, increased to 13 percentage
points in the week ending yesterday. The percentage of outright
longs rose to 26 percent from 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is still ongoing concern around Europe,&#8221; Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Positions appear stretched and are too
long. You have to be tactical about the market and, in a world
where positions seem a little too long, a tactical pullback is
likely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of outright shorts, or bets the securities
will fall in value, was unchanged at 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors cut neutral bets to 60 percent from 68 percent.
Neutrals rose to 74 percent in the week ending June 25, the
highest level of outright neutrals since October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.44 percent at 8:16 a.m. in
New York. The yield touched a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on March
20 and reached a record low 1.396 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     July 25 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp. obtained a record-low 1.875 percent coupon on $1 billion
of 10-year bonds, the least for dollar-denominated debt of that
maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider sold the
debt at 98.398 cents on the dollar to yield 2.053 percent, or a
relative yield of 65 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coupon beat the previous 2 percent record held by 3M
Co.&#8217;s 10-year notes sold on June 21, Bloomberg data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The yield is reflective of the overall bond market
environment, with Treasuries sitting at an all-time record-low
yield,&#8221; said Anthony Valeri, a market strategist in San Diego
at LPL Financial, in a telephone interview. &#8220;IBM picked the
perfect time to come to market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year Treasury note&#8217;s yield dropped as low
as 1.38 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also shares the record low with Sysco Corp. for three-
year debt with its 0.55 percent bonds due February 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new debt may be rated Aa3, the fourth-highest level of
investment grade, by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Proceeds will go
toward general corporate purposes, said Doug Shelton, an IBM
spokesman, who declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fresh Name&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG
managed the sale, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM last sold 10-year bonds in October 2011, issuing $500
million of 2.9 percent debt to yield 62.5 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The Armonk, New York-based
company&#8217;s securities traded at 108.34 cents on the dollar to
yield 1.91 percent on July 19, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is &#8220;a fresh name in the 10-year space,&#8221; Valeri said.
&#8220;You give the market a liquid 10-year issue, and it kind of
sells itself when you have a solid name like IBM.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Alex Barinka and Will Robinson" date="Jul 25, 2012  4:56 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-25/mmodal-low-buyout-premium-signals-jpmorgan-bump-real-m-a.html"><headline>MModal Low Buyout Premium Signals JPMorgan Bump: Real M&amp;amp;A</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;MModal Inc. (MODL)&#8217;s agreement to be taken
private by JPMorgan Chase  Co. at the medical information
industry&#8217;s lowest premium in seven years won&#8217;t be enough to
cement the deal, according to traders who wager on acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For eight straight days, MModal closed above the $14-a-
share proposal from JPMorgan&#8217;s One Equity Partners that valued
the company at about $1.1 billion including net debt. The 9.2
percent premium to MModal&#8217;s 20-day average was about a quarter
of the average among similar-sized deals for medical information
systems providers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
MModal shares were 1.9 percent higher than the bid yesterday,
more than any other pending U.S. deal greater than $200 million,
a sign traders expect a sweetened offer, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After accepting the buyout unit&#8217;s proposal on July 2,
Franklin, Tennessee-based MModal disclosed in a regulatory
filing that it had rejected a $17-a-share bid from a competitor
because of antitrust concerns. MModal is still worth at least
that much in a takeover based on the company&#8217;s projections that
profit will rise more than 45 percent next year, according to
Caris  Co. While MModal said its biggest shareholder would
tender its 31 percent stake, Tullett Prebon Plc and GFI Group
Inc. said One Equity still may need to increase its offer to win
over investors and fend off a potential rival bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal &#8220;is trading higher based on the premise that
there&#8217;s this $17 offer out there and there is a wait-and-see
approach,&#8221; Sachin Shah, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based special
situations and merger arbitrage strategist at Tullett Prebon,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;They should not have rushed to
the deal. If you&#8217;re going to go private, it should not be at
$14, it should be higher. This is a growth subsector of tech.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patient Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Levy, an outside spokesman for MModal, said the
company couldn&#8217;t comment on the deal process beyond the
information that has been made public. Tasha Pelio, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan (JPM) in New York, said the company declined
to comment on One Equity&#8217;s bid for MModal or whether it would
consider increasing the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal develops speech-recognition and data-processing
tools for capturing and organizing patient data used in
electronic health records, medical coding and billing. Its
clients include about 3,000 hospitals and clinics and 850
physician practices, as well as electronic health record
application providers and medical transcription organizations,
according to a March company filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal&#8217;s shares climbed 34 percent this year through July
2, the day it announced the agreement with One Equity. The next
day, MModal rose past the offer price, and the shares closed at
or above the bid level on all but three trading days since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Price &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock ended yesterday at $14.26, 1.9 percent higher
than One Equity&#8217;s bid and a sign some merger arbitragers are
wagering that a higher offer will emerge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly, investors think that there&#8217;s another offer
coming,&#8221; Steven Halper, a New York-based analyst at Lazard
Capital Markets LLC, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the shares rose 0.8 percent to $14.37. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal hired financial advisers in March to help consider
possible transactions after holding talks or receiving
expressions of interest in previous months from suitors
including an unnamed competitor and One Equity, according to a
July 17 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As MModal gauged interest from financial firms, 20
potential bidders including One Equity signed confidentiality
agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sell Now &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By June, most bidders had dropped out, and MModal was
contacted by the unnamed competitor over a potential sale, the
filing said. The competitor -- most likely Nuance Communications
Inc. (NUAN), according to Halper and Tullett Prebon&#8217;s Shah -- offered
as much as $17 a share in cash and stock. The bid was rejected
in favor of One Equity&#8217;s $14 cash proposal, in part because of
concerns antitrust approval may take too long, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MModal &#8220;is basically saying, &#8216;Now is the time to sell,&#8217;&#8221;
Shah said. &#8220;From my perspective, shareholders should not
approve the $14 deal and the board should go back to Nuance
because I think they may be still interested.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Mack, a spokesman for Burlington, Massachusetts-
based Nuance, said he couldn&#8217;t comment on speculation as to
whether the company approached MModal or is considering a bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure of the other bid &#8220;gives people hope that
perhaps someone else may come in&#8221; with a higher offer, said Leo Carpio, an analyst at Caris in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity&#8217;s bid was about 9.2 percent higher than MModal&#8217;s
average share price in the 20 days before the announcement, the
smallest premium among takeovers valued at more than $300
million in the medical information systems and health-care cost
containment industries since August 2005, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Multiple &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including net debt, the buyout values MModal at 12.4 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
20 percent less than the median multiple for deals in the group,
the data show. Based on analysts&#8217; estimates for 2012 Ebitda, the
deal values MModal at 8.7 times. Nuance, a $6 billion maker of
voice-recognition software, offered to buy smaller rival
Transcend Services Inc. in March for $302 million, valuing the
company at 12.63 times Ebitda, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you compared the deal metrics to the Transcend deal,
that would translate to $14.75 to $14.80&#8221; a share for MModal,
Alfredo Scialabba, a special situations analyst for GFI Group in
New York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caris&#8217;s Carpio estimates MModal is worth $17 to $18 a share
in a takeover, citing in part earnings projections included in
the company&#8217;s July 17 filing. That would be as much as 29
percent more than One Equity&#8217;s offer. MModal estimated Ebitda
will climb 47 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Darn Cheap&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are trading on the expectation that anybody who
wasn&#8217;t participating in the first round of this deal might come
back and look at those revised earnings projections and decide
this company&#8217;s just too darn cheap and too attractive,&#8221; Carpio
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halper at Lazard said it&#8217;s unlikely that a new suitor would
emerge, given the number of firms that participated in the deal
process and already had a chance to make an offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of companies walked away or offered less,&#8221; Halper
said. &#8220;At this point, I can&#8217;t imagine another company coming
out of the blue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With MModal&#8217;s largest shareholder, SAC Capital Advisors LP,
agreeing to go along with One Equity&#8217;s bid and tender its 31
percent stake, the buyout firm may have an easier time gaining
enough investor support at the current price, Halper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worth Wait &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, knowing that another bidder was willing to pay more
for MModal may keep some shareholders from agreeing to One
Equity&#8217;s terms, Tullett Prebon&#8217;s Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a richer bid from Nuance or another competitor could
take more time to clear regulatory hurdles than MModal&#8217;s
management might prefer, the higher potential returns would be
worth the wait for shareholders, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For management, &#8220;it&#8217;s a bird in the hand situation&#8221; to
accept JPMorgan&#8217;s price, Shah said. For investors, &#8220;you&#8217;re
definitely willing to wait for an extra $3&#8221; a share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL), Latin America&#8217;s
biggest Coke bottler, fell the most in two weeks after posting a
second-quarter profit that trailed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares slid 7.2 percent to 152.96 pesos in Mexico City,
the largest drop since July 11. Net income declined to 2.71
billion pesos ($198 million), the company said late yesterday.
Analysts expected a 2.96 billion-peso profit, based on the
average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa absorbed blows from a weaker Mexican peso,
rising labor costs and more expensive high-fructose corn syrup.
The peso slid 12 percent against the dollar during the year
ended June 30, and Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said
the weakening currency magnified the Mexico City-based company&#8217;s
dollar-based materials costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The first read-through is pretty weak across the board,&#8221;
said Alan Alanis, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in New York
who has a neutral rating on Coca-Cola Femsa. &#8220;Flat volumes,
contracting margins and shrinking earnings per share: Those are
the highlights of the quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While three acquisitions in Mexico over the past year
boosted sales 28 percent to 36.3 billion pesos, beverage volume
excluding the new units was little changed, Coca-Cola Femsa
said. The company&#8217;s operating income as a percentage of sales
fell to 13 percent from more than 15 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Net Income &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income amounted to 1.35 pesos per share, down 9 percent
from a year earlier, Coca-Cola Femsa said in a statement to the
Mexican stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher labor costs in Venezuela and Argentina and steeper
freight costs in Argentina and Brazil helped push operating
expenses up 38 percent from a year earlier. Trevino said the
company would benefit from steadier costs in the second half of
the year, especially if the peso stabilizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Should currency volatility recede, we look forward to a
more stable cost environment for the second half of 2012,&#8221; he
said on a conference call with analysts and investors. &#8220;All in
all, I do see a second half of the year that will be better on
the margins than what we are presenting in this quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa closed transactions in 2011 to buy Grupo
Tampico for 9.3 billion pesos and Grupo Cimsa for 11 billion
pesos, including debt. It completed the purchase of Grupo
Fomento Queretano for 6.6 billion pesos in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;On Track&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said in a statement
that the company is &#8220;fully on track to meet our previously
announced net synergy targets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams of Coca-Cola Femsa employees are studying the
operations and finances of Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s Philippines unit, as
the Mexican company evaluates whether to make its first foray
outside Latin America, Trevino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Coca-Cola Femsa entered a 12-month exclusive
agreement with Atlanta-based Coca-Cola to discuss buying a
controlling stake in the Filipino unit. The U.S. company owns
about 30 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa, which is majority-owned by
Monterrey, Mexico-based Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Trevino said in April that a decision could come by
the end of September, he said yesterday that it might take until
the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We feel enthusiastic about this idea,&#8221; he said on the
conference call. &#8220;During the second half of the year, we should
be able to reach a decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. has set up a
contingency plan allowing it to resume trading the bonds of any
nation exiting the euro area to avoid disruption to its clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank by assets said while a break-up of
the 17-nation currency zone was not its central view, the
possibility has convinced it to establish procedures to limit
any disruption to its bond-trading activities. The implied
probability of a country leaving the monetary union is 59
percent for next year, and 66 percent by the end of 2014, based
on bets at Intrade.com. Spain hasn&#8217;t ruled out quitting the
euro, El Confidencial reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been doing some contingency work to ensure that we
have a robust system and ability to absorb shocks if on a Sunday
night a sovereign decides to leave the euro,&#8221; Carl Norrey, head
of European rates securities at JPMorgan in London, said in
interview on July 23. &#8220;The probability of a country exiting the
euro is no longer zero.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial turmoil in the euro area deepened this week as
the Spanish region of Valencia said it will need aid from the
central government, and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service put a negative
outlook on the Aaa ratings of Germany, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg, saying they may need to spend more bailing out other
member nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish and Italian bonds slumped this week, adding to
speculation the nations will need financial assistance. Spain&#8217;s
10-year yields surged to a euro-era record of 7.751 percent
today, while the rate on its two-year notes breached 7 percent
for the first time. Greece, Ireland and Portugal sought external
help after their borrowing costs rose above that level. Italian
10-year yields climbed to 6.71 percent, the most since Jan. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exit Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey published by JPMorgan on July 17 showed that 29
percent of the 145 clients who responded believed that Greece
would leave the euro this year, and as much as 5 percent
predicted a core country would exit the single currency in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler told broadcaster ARD
on July 22 he was &#8220;very skeptical&#8221; Greece could be rescued.
The Spanish government hasn&#8217;t ruled out leaving the euro as it
considers options including an international bailout, the El
Confidencial newspaper reported, citing people close to Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If one of the euro countries leave, we would be able to
segregate all the securities, have them in different books,
format new international securities identification numbers, and
be ready to trade with clients in as short a period of time as
possible,&#8221; Norrey said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a massive task. You don&#8217;t want
to be starting that process from scratch on Monday morning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Primary Dealer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has no plans to withdraw from any nation in the
euro area where it is a market maker even as the debt crisis
makes it become more &#8220;expensive&#8221; to be a primary dealer,
Norrey said. JPMorgan trades directly with every sovereign
issuer in the euro area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one can say it&#8217;s easy to be a primary dealer at the
moment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Auctions have become expensive in an
environment of low flow but high volatility. But as a major bank
and a provider of liquidity, we need to be there to assist our
clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary dealers are firms obliged to bid at government bond
sales to ensure there is enough demand to keep borrowing costs
low. They have to purchase a certain amount of the debt issued
each year and take the risk they may be unable to sell the
securities afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return, primary dealers benefit because, in most cases,
investors buy the securities on offer. Central banks and some
pension funds will only do business with such financial
institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being a primary dealer gives you unparalleled insight into
the challenges that clients face at the point of issuance right
through to deal performance in secondary-market trading,&#8221;
Norrey said. &#8220;It gives you a stronger case to be at the table
again and again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies&#8217; overseas share
sales will rebound next year as regulators root out fraud and
misconduct that contributed to erasing $6.4 billion in value for
mainland firms listed in the U.S., the senior investment banker
in China for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be &#8220;a flurry of deals&#8221; once foreign investors&#8217;
confidence in Chinese companies returns, Fang Fang, chief
executive officer of China investment banking for New York-based
JPMorgan, said in an interview in Beijing yesterday. The bank is
ranked third among managers of overseas share sales by Chinese
companies since the start of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m hopeful that sometime in the second half, investors
will come back to the table,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Investors will
eventually see the value and have to do something. They can&#8217;t
just sit on a pile of cash for too long.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revival in overseas equity sales, on track this year to
raise about a third of 2010&#8217;s $61.5 billion, would bolster
growth in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. Only one Chinese
company has made its U.S. trading debut in 2012, compared with
about 60 in the previous three years, as short sellers such as
Muddy Waters LLC said companies including Sino-Forest Corp.
misstated accounts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are just a lot of companies who want to raise
money,&#8221; Fang said. &#8220;We need investors to come back to the
table.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investor Caution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cautioned
investors in June 2011 about buying stakes in foreign companies
entering the U.S. through so-called reverse mergers. The
process, which entails the purchase of publicly traded shell
companies to gain U.S. listings, may be prone to &#8220;fraud and
other abuses,&#8221; the regulator had said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Chinese Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO), which tracks
82 such companies, has lost 46 percent of its value since May
31, 2011, two days before Muddy Waters issued a report saying
Sino-Forest overstated production. The allegation sparked a 74
percent drop in the Hong Kong- and Mississauga, Ontario-based
timber company&#8217;s stock and drove borrowing costs above 60
percent before it filed for bankruptcy protection in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muddy Waters founder Carson Block became the face of the
short-selling wave against Chinese companies after his research
led regulators to suspend trading in four of his first five
targets, including Sino-Forest. Companies that have been
highlighted more recently by the short seller include New
Oriental Education  Technology Group Inc. (EDU), China&#8217;s largest
private education services provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Oriental &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Oriental last week plunged 57 percent over two days in
New York trading after the Beijing-based company said it was
under investigation by the SEC and Muddy Waters questioned its
accounting practices. The stock has since rebounded by 29
percent after New Oriental said July 19 that the allegations by
Muddy Waters contained errors and were misleading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investors filed a lawsuit against New Oriental on July
23 in Los Angeles seeking damages for the stock losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies on the reverse mergers index have lost as much as
99 percent of their value over the past year, led by China
Nutrifruit Group Ltd. (CNGL) and Qiao Xing Universal Resources Inc.
Those declines compare with the 25 percent drop in the Bloomberg
China-U.S. Equity Index, which tracks the 55 most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S., and the 0.07 percent gain in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. (SPX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Development Bank Corp., the nation&#8217;s biggest policy
lender, is providing more than $1 billion to help companies
leave the U.S. stock market, as allegations against other local
firms surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fushi Copperweld &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fushi Copperweld Inc. has gained 13 percent to $8.84 since
the company said June 28 that it agreed to be bought out for
$9.50 a share in a deal financed by CDB. The stock fell to a
six-month low of $5.81 in April after Muddy Waters said the
maker of copper-clad aluminum and steel wire &#8220;presents a high
risk of fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fushi denies those allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-sellers such as Muddy Waters provide a &#8220;healthy
mechanism to help clean the ecosystem,&#8221; said JPMorgan&#8217;s Fang,
46. His bank has managed two overseas IPOs for Chinese companies
this year, down from four last year and 14 in 2010, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Practical View&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have always been a proponent of having those mechanisms
in place,&#8221; he said at his office yesterday. &#8220;Corporates need
to take a practical view on why people sell short their stocks
and shouldn&#8217;t feel emotionally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fang, who is also vice chairman of Asia investment banking
for the U.S. lender, began his career in 1993 as an associate at
Merrill Lynch  Co. in New York. He joined JPMorgan in 2001 as
an investment banker in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Fang was appointed as a member of the Chinese
People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference, making him the only
executive from a U.S. financial company to be a part of the
nation&#8217;s top advisory body to the government. The five-year
term, set to end in March, gave Fang the authority to propose
legislation, which he has used to promote greater
internationalization of the yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and the U.S. must also resolve a dispute over
regulation of accounting firms to ensure that mainland companies
listed in the U.S. can attract investors and that American
companies such as Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) and General Electric Co. can
operate in China, Fang said yesterday. Yum, owner of the KFC and
Taco Bell restaurant brands, has more than 4,600 locations in
the Asian nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deloitte Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC on May 9 sued Shanghai-based Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu CPA Ltd., alleging that the auditor refused to provide
documents related to a China-based company under investigation
for potential accounting fraud. The regulator last week asked
for a six-month stay of a separate lawsuit against Deloitte so
it can continue talks with Chinese authorities to obtain
documents tied to a company in China, according to Bloomberg
BNA, a division of Bloomberg LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte has said that under Chinese rules, accounting
firms in the country aren&#8217;t allowed to hand documents to any
foreign regulator without government approval. The firm argued
in an April 11 filing to a U.S. district court that the SEC&#8217;s
dispute is with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and
should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, according to
a Bloomberg BNA Law report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both sides need to come to the table and hash out an
arrangement,&#8221; said JPMorgan&#8217;s Fang. &#8220;It will be a six- to 12-
month process to sort it out, and for people to feel comfortable
that the bad ones are weeded out, to get back to normal life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Historic Ties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s ties to China go back to 1911, when it led a
syndicate in managing a $7.5 million bond sale by the Huguang
Railway, according to the lender&#8217;s website. In 1921, Equitable
Eastern Banking Corp., one of the bank&#8217;s predecessor firms,
opened a Shanghai branch. The U.S. firm last week opened its
seventh branch in the nation, in the city of Suzhou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender in May increased capital at JPMorgan Chase Bank
(China) Co., its locally licensed banking unit, by 2.5 billion
yuan ($391 million) to 6.5 billion yuan. That was the second
infusion since the subsidiary was incorporated in 2007, and will
allow JPMorgan to increase loans to its largest clients in
China, where foreign banks may lend a maximum of 10 percent of
their net capital to a single borrower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 114 trillion yuan of assets at the end of last year,
China&#8217;s banking system is larger than the combined size of the
30 other emerging markets tracked by Fitch Ratings, and smaller
only than the U.S. and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joint Venture &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. lender&#8217;s other operations in the country include
asset management, venture capital and a commodity futures joint
venture. It started offering investment banking services in
China last year, after receiving approval for its joint venture
with Shenzhen-based First Capital Securities Co. The venture, 33
percent-owned by JPMorgan, had 117 employees at the end of 2011,
according to its financial report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan First Capital ranks 46th this year among
underwriters of Chinese domestic corporate bonds, having worked
on three sales for 2.64 billion yuan, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan this year has managed five overseas equity and
equity-linked offerings by Chinese companies that raised $678.7
million, the data show. That gives it a market share of 6.3
percent, putting the bank behind rivals including Bank of
America Corp., Morgan Stanley (MS) and UBS AG. (UBSN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fang said the importance of China to U.S. companies such as
Yum, and China&#8217;s need for foreign capital, means both sides
&#8220;need to resolve&#8221; the dispute over regulation of accounting
firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraising by Chinese companies in overseas markets
through equity offerings is set to lag behind that of previous
years. Mainland firms have raised $10.8 billion through 52 such
sales this year, compared with $27.2 billion in all of 2011 and
$61.5 billion for 2010, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the Chinese government has the intention to
cut off that financing avenue,&#8221; Fang said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd. may receive an
antitrust complaint from European Union regulators over credit
card fees, the EU&#8217;s competition commissioner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are preparing a supplementary statement of
objections,&#8221; Joaquin Almunia told reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe reduced similar fees for debit cards last year
to settle a 2009 EU complaint. Almunia said earlier this month
that he hoped the operator of the largest payment-card network
in the 27-nation EU would reduce cross-border fees for credit
cards and deferred-debit transactions to the same level as
MasterCard Inc. (MA) He said in May that total costs retailers face
to handle payments haven&#8217;t decreased since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa Europe is committed to continuing dialogue to reach
a commercially acceptable agreement for setting credit and
deferred debit interchange,&#8221; said Amanda Kamin, a spokeswoman
for the company in London. &#8220;We believe this can be done
amicably and relatively speedily.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard and some of the biggest U.S. banks
this month agreed to a U.S. settlement of at least $6.05 billion
in a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card
swipe fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe split from Visa Inc. before the U.S. card
company&#8217;s initial public offering in early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers have long complained about the cost they are
charged to accept card payments. Unlike for checks, banks charge
interchange fees to process debit- and credit-card payments.
Card operators set the amounts, own the payment networks and
pass the money to the lenders. The retailer&#8217;s bank pays the fees
to the customer&#8217;s card issuer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest oil company by market value, earned less than expected
as oil demand stalled in the world&#8217;s largest economies and U.S.
natural-gas prices dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income was $15.9 billion, or $3.41 a
share, compared with $10.7 billion, or $2.18, a year earlier,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today. Excluding
one-time gains that accounted for almost half of the quarter&#8217;s
profit, per-share income was $1.80, or 15 cents lower than the
average of 15 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon fell short of estimates for the second straight
quarter amid a widening production decline that Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is attempting to reverse
with $37 billion in capital spending this year. The company
pumped the equivalent of 4.15 million barrels of crude a day
during the April-to-June period, the lowest in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was another sub-par quarter for Exxon,&#8221; said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, who has a
hold rating on Exxon&#8217;s shares. &#8220;They are struggling to grow
production and commodity prices are working against them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 1.5 percent to $127.4 billion. Exxon rose 1.5
percent to $86.52 at the close in New York amid a broader market
rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Items Guidance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon initially announced during a conference call with
news organizations that its per-share profit of $3.41 didn&#8217;t
include any special or one-time gains. An e-mailed statement
released within minutes of the call showed the $7.5 billion in
gains that accounted for 47 percent of the per-share figure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asset divestment and acquisitions have become a normal
part of our ongoing operations,&#8221; David Rosenthal, an Exxon
spokesman, said during a later conference call with analysts
today. &#8220;This is an ongoing piece of the business for us.&#8221; The
U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission&#8217;s criteria for what
qualifies as a special item has evolved in recent years, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s oil, averaged $108.76 a barrel during the quarter, a 7
percent decline from a year earlier. Oil demand in the U.S. and
China, which together consume almost one-third of the world&#8217;s
crude, stagnated at 28.2 million barrels a day, little changed
from a year earlier, according the International Energy Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas futures traded in New York fell 46 percent compared to
a year earlier to average $2.354 per million British thermal
units, the lowest quarterly average since 1999, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Tillerson warned last month that
Exxon and other gas producers have been &#8220;losing our shirts&#8221;
amid a glut of North American supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Losing Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas, the most-widely used U.S. furnace fuel and the
nation&#8217;s second-largest source of electricity, has been a losing
bet for the biggest energy explorers. Innovations in drilling
and cracking subterranean rock formations allowed explorers to
flood the U.S. and Canada with supply, pushing prices to the
lowest in a decade earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon spent $35 billion on the 2010 acquisition of XTO
Energy that enabled it to surpass Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) as the
largest U.S. gas producer. Since that deal closed, gas has
fallen 33 percent to about $3.08 per million Btus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Cheng, an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. in New
York, told clients in a July 9 note that other major oil
companies are more compelling investment opportunities because
of concern &#8220;that the XTO operation will remain a drag on the
company&#8217;s performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Glut &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon boosted U.S. gas production by 1.4 percent to 3.9
billion cubic feet a day even as a glut of North American supply
depressed prices for the fuel, according to a filing made after
its earnings release today. U.S. wells accounted for one-third
of the company&#8217;s global gas output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from U.S. oil and gas wells plunged 53 percent to
$678 million, according to the filing. Outside the U.S., oil and
gas production income rose 8.3 percent to $7.68 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining profit quadrupled to $6.65 billion after the
company sold part of its Japanese business to TonenGeneral
Sekiyu KK. (5012) Chemical profit jumped 9.7 percent to $1.45 billion.
The Japanese sale contributed $5.3 billion to second-quarter
results. On a per-share basis, the entire $7.5 billion in one-
time gains accounted for $1.61 of net income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those one-time gains were the swing factor,&#8221; Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Phoenix Group Partners LP
in New York, said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;Liquids
production was down and they were impacted like everybody else
by lower global liquids prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) earlier today said second-quarter
profit fell 13 percent, excluding one-time items and inventory
changes, to $5.7 billion, missing the $6.3 billion average of 10
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chevron Corp. (CVX),
Exxon&#8217;s largest U.S.-based rival, is scheduled to report results
tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led Wall Street&#8217;s largest securities firms in
average compensation per employee at midyear, widening a lead
over JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies set aside $870 million in the first six months of
its fiscal year, enough to pay its 3,809 employees an average of
$228,407. Goldman Sachs set aside $225,789 for each of its
32,300 workers. Average pay for the 26,553 people in JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank was $184,989, or at least 18 percent less than
Jefferies&#8217;s and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reported figures. It was 10
percent less than both in fiscal 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms are grappling with how much to pay staff
as a slump in trading and mergers pressures revenue. Jefferies
and Goldman Sachs, both based in New York, have been positioning
themselves for a rebound in securities businesses while
JPMorgan, which is 64 times larger than Jefferies, absorbs a
$5.8 billion trading loss this year in its chief investment
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re extremely large in today&#8217;s economy, chances are
you&#8217;re trying to scale down or cut costs,&#8221; said Jeanne Branthover, a managing director at Boyden Global Executive
Search Ltd. &#8220;By staying nimble, flexible and smaller, you can
keep your costs down, you can hire the best because you can give
them the incentives needed to be the best and stay there,&#8221; she
said of Jefferies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), grappling with
a $5.8 billion trading loss and a securities-industry slump,
promoted Matt Zames to co-chief operating officer in a
management shuffle that replaced the head of its investment
bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames, 41, who was enlisted this year to staunch the loss
in the firm&#8217;s chief investment office, will take the co-COO role
alongside Frank Bisignano, the bank said yesterday in a
statement. The overhaul catapults Zames, a former fixed-income
trader, into the pool of potential successors to Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon. James &#8220;Jes&#8221; Staley, 55, who ran the
investment bank, will relinquish daily operational duties as
Mike Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto oversee an expanded version of
the division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley, once seen as a possible CEO candidate, was moved to
a new post as chairman of a unit that combines the investment
bank, treasury and securities services and the global corporate
bank. Dimon, 56, said in an interview yesterday he hopes to
continue leading the firm for &#8220;many, many more years,&#8221; and
that the shuffle doesn&#8217;t indicate any immediate succession
plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Staley&#8217;s basically becoming a diplomat,&#8221; said David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in New York. &#8220;He&#8217;s
working on the big picture issues, but the day-to-day activities
seems to be gravitating to Cavanagh and Pinto.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overhaul combines several of JPMorgan&#8217;s units into two
new divisions. In addition to the corporate and investment bank
overseen by Cavanagh and Pinto, a combined consumer and
community banking business will be led by Gordon Smith and Todd
Maclin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Normal Progression&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see this as a continued response to the embarrassment
and the gaffe that was the last quarter,&#8221; said Michael Holland,
chairman of New York-based Holland  Co., referring to the CIO
losses. Holland, whose firm oversees more than $4 billion
including shares of JPMorgan, said it was typical for Dimon to
remake the management team, &#8220;which after all is the key to all
of these successes and failures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in the interview that the changes were part of
&#8220;a normal progression,&#8221; and &#8220;had nothing to do with anything
else,&#8221; including the CIO&#8217;s loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose 3 percent to $36.89 yesterday in New York.
The firm&#8217;s shares have climbed 11 percent this year, compared
with a 17 percent gain for the 24-company KBW Bank Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes as some finance leaders including former
Citigroup Inc. CEO Sanford &#8220;Sandy&#8221; Weill call for the breakup
of the biggest U.S. banks, which grew larger after the repeal of
the Depression-era law that required companies backed by
government insurance to be separate from investment banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;New Leaders&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan and some other large institutions were ports of
safety in the storm,&#8221; Dimon said, referring to the financial
crisis. Breaking them up would make have made them riskier
&#8220;because they&#8217;d be less diversified,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley will hand off &#8220;his current responsibilities to new
leaders in the business,&#8221; JPMorgan said in the statement.
Within the corporate and investment bank, Cavanagh, 46, will
head the banking business, which includes investment banking,
the global corporate bank and treasury services. Pinto, 49, will
be the main contact for markets and investor services, which
will include fixed income, equities, commodities, prime services
and securities clearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said Staley played a role in the decision to change
his responsibilities. &#8220;Jes himself would always say &#8216;When the
time comes that it&#8217;s time to promote some great new talent, then
I should move up,&#8217;&#8221; Dimon said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reporting Lines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames will still be in charge of the CIO, the firm said.
Bisignano, 52, who was appointed to run mortgage banking last
year, will hand off that responsibility to Smith, who will
become sole CEO of consumer and community banking by the end of
next year as Maclin assumes the role of the unit&#8217;s chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 51, who previously
reported to Dimon, will report to Zames, Dimon said yesterday in
a memo to employees, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. Barry Zubrow, 59, who runs corporate and regulatory
affairs, will also report to Zames instead of Dimon, according
to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a promotion for Matt Zames,&#8221; Dimon said in the
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the heads of businesses such as the corporate
and investment bank will report directly to him, rather than to
Zames and Bisignano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset management and commercial banking will remain
separate from the other units. Mary Erdoes, 44, will continue to
run asset management, and Douglas Petno will remain as head the
commercial bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Botched Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is grappling with a trading loss spurred by bets
on synthetic credit. The loss, which was disclosed May 10 after
it surpassed $2 billion, had grown to $5.8 billion by the end of
the second quarter. The botched trades led to the retirement of
former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 55, and the shutdown
of the London-based team that built the position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators, investors, analysts and lawmakers have called
for the break-up of too-big-to-fail banks to unlock shareholder
value and prevent another financial crisis. JPMorgan&#8217;s trading
loss gave ammunition to those who favor stricter bank
regulation, including supporters of the Volcker rule, which
would bar most proprietary trading by deposit-taking
institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan needs to &#8220;ensure that we comply with all new
regulatory requirements, which will have a significant impact on
global markets, products and services,&#8221; Dimon, who has fought
the Volcker rule, said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Ridiculous Concept&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, also reorganized earlier this year, dividing the firm
into consumer and institutional businesses and naming a pair of
co-COOs to manage them. David Darnell heads the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank&#8217;s consumer and business banking division,
and Thomas K. Montag, 55, runs trading and investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this could help fuel the speculation that some
of the larger banks may look to more formally separate their
consumer and investment banking operations,&#8221; Jason Goldberg, an
analyst at Barclays Plc who has an overweight rating on the
shares, said yesterday in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a bank breakup occurs, it will result from shareholder
pressure and will happen slowly over time, said Paul Miller, an
analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in Arlington, Virginia, who
has a market perform rating on JPMorgan shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My guess is the mindset of Jamie and the rest of the
senior management team of JPMorgan is, that&#8217;s a ridiculous
concept,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to eventually
happen, I think it&#8217;s going to happen against a lot of these
wills, and Jamie might not be there when it happens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hedging Risks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames shook up the CIO&#8217;s leadership after taking over the
unit and announced a &#8220;renewed focus&#8221; on hedging risks.
JPMorgan hired Zames from Credit Suisse First Boston in 2004 to
run trading in Treasuries, agencies and interest-rate swaps and
options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Zames and Pinto were picked to run fixed income
after Staley took over the firm&#8217;s investment bank from William
Winters and Steven Black. Under Zames and Pinto, JPMorgan has
become the top bank globally in fixed-income trading. The firm&#8217;s
17 percent market share in 2011 was a record for Wall Street,
Staley told shareholders earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Matt has done an exceptional job overseeing our global
fixed-income business, and more recently, jumping in to
skillfully help us deal with the difficult CIO issue,&#8221; Dimon
said in the memo. &#8220;We are fortunate to be able to leverage his
skills and counsel across the entire firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Led Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisignano has been JPMorgan&#8217;s chief administrative officer
since 2005, when he left Citigroup, where he ran global
transaction services, to rejoin Dimon. Bisignano worked at Smith
Barney in the late 1990s. At JPMorgan, Bisignano took on the
additional role in February 2011 as head of Chase Home Lending.
JPMorgan praised his work there, saying he led &#8220;the highly
successful transformation of mortgage banking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, who will run the corporate and investment bank
with Pinto, led JPMorgan&#8217;s internal investigation into the
trading loss and previously ran treasury and securities
services. A longtime Dimon loyalist, Cavanagh was hired by the
firm&#8217;s chief at Salomon Smith Barney in 1993 and then again in
2000 at Bank One Corp., which merged with JPMorgan in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The same clients that I&#8217;ve been calling on in my old job
will be the same clients I&#8217;m calling on in the new job,&#8221;
Cavanagh said yesterday in an interview, referring to the
customers of the units he oversaw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Go-To Guy&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holland of Holland  Co. said Cavanagh is &#8220;the one name
consistently that keeps coming up as a go-to guy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The change, particularly bringing on the younger people,
is an important part of continuing to strengthen the management
team,&#8221; Holland said. &#8220;As a shareholder, I&#8217;m pleased with the
continuation here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley has worked at JPMorgan since 1979, including an
eight-year stint as head of the bank&#8217;s money-management
division. He became head of the investment bank in September
2009 when Dimon announced that Winters and Black, the division&#8217;s
co-heads, would step aside after leading the bank through the
2008 financial crisis. Winters departed immediately, surprising
analysts who had viewed him as a potential successor to Dimon.
Black, 60, was named executive chairman and left the firm in
early 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Risk Controls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 2000s, Staley was among executives -- along
with Winters and Black -- who questioned Dimon on why risk
controls inside the CIO weren&#8217;t as extensive or robust as in
other departments, according to people who participated in or
witnessed the conversations. Staley told Fortune magazine in
April 2010 that he considered himself a contender to succeed
Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Jamie doesn&#8217;t leave, then I probably need to leave
myself in a few years,&#8221; Staley added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired Smith to run its Chase card services group
in 2007. He was previously president of the global commercial
card unit at American Express Co. (AXP), where he had worked for more
than 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNN President Jim Walton, who
presided over the once-dominant cable-news business as it lost
viewers to Fox News, will resign after almost a decade in the
job, saying the network needs &#8220;new thinking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Kent, chief executive officer of CNN parent Turner
Broadcasting, will lead the search for a replacement, according
to a statement from the company, which is owned by Time Warner
Inc. (TWX) Walton, who has spent his entire 30-year career at CNN,
plans to step down at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CNN needs new thinking,&#8221; Walton said in a memo to staff.
&#8220;That starts with a new leader who brings a different
perspective, different experiences and a new plan, one who will
build on our great foundation and will commit to seeing it
through.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN is suffering through a ratings slump, with prime-time
viewership dropping 8 percent to 627,000 on average this season
through mid-May, compared with a year earlier, according to
Nielsen. CNN ranks behind News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Fox News, which drew an
average prime-time viewership of 1.85 million in the same
period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, CNN has increased profit at a rate of 12 percent to
15 percent every year since 2004, Walton said in a December
interview. Even with a decline in ratings, CNN has pulled in
additional revenue through affiliate fees as it&#8217;s become more
widely available on pay-TV systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Go-To Guy&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holland of Holland  Co. said Cavanagh is &#8220;the one name

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The change, particularly bringing on the younger people,
is an important part of continuing to strengthen the management

continuation here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley has worked at JPMorgan since 1979, including an
eight-year stint as head of the bank&#8217;s money-management
division. He became head of the investment bank in September
2009 when Dimon announced that Winters and Black, the division&#8217;s
co-heads, would step aside after leading the bank through the
2008 financial crisis. Winters departed immediately, surprising
analysts who had viewed him as a potential successor to Dimon.
Black, 60, was named executive chairman and left the firm in
early 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Risk Controls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 2000s, Staley was among executives -- along
with Winters and Black -- who questioned Dimon on why risk
controls inside the CIO weren&#8217;t as extensive or robust as in
other departments, according to people who participated in or
witnessed the conversations. Staley told Fortune magazine in
April 2010 that he considered himself a contender to succeed
Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Jamie doesn&#8217;t leave, then I probably need to leave
myself in a few years,&#8221; Staley added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired Smith to run its Chase card services group
in 2007. He was previously president of the global commercial
card unit at American Express Co. (AXP), where he had worked for more
than 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects oil-production mix percentages in last paragraph
in story published July 27.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company by market value, topped the highest profit
estimate from analysts after an 80 percent increase in refining
returns helped make up for falling oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income fell to $7.21 billion, or $3.66 a
share, from $7.73 billion, or $3.85, a year earlier, the San
Ramon, California-based company said in a statement today. The
result was 35 cents more than the average of four analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, which ranged from $3.10 to
$3.47. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s oil refineries and filling stations earned $1.88
billion as U.S. refining margins climbed to a second-quarter
record average of $28.98 a barrel when crude costs fell faster
than gasoline prices. Brent crude, the benchmark for two-thirds
of the world&#8217;s oil, fell 7 percent from a year earlier to
average $108.76 a barrel amid concern that slowing growth in
China and Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crises will stifle energy
demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strong refining margins helped them a lot,&#8221; Allen Good,
an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview today. &#8220;In contrast to some of their
competitors, Chevron&#8217;s heavier exposure to oil and minimal
exposure to low natural-gas prices helped keep the upstream
afloat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Core&#8217; Holding &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 9.2 percent to $62.6 billion. Chevron rose 0.9
percent to $109.26 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s refining profit included about $200 million in
proceeds from the sale of a power business in South Korea and
other assets, according to the statement. Income from oil and
gas wells fell 18 percent to $5.62 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I view them as the core energy holding investors should
have,&#8221; Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St.
Louis, said in an interview after the results were announced.
&#8220;They&#8217;re more profitable per barrel, they have way more cash
than debt and they pay a good dividend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production declined 2.6 percent to the equivalent of 2.62
million barrels a day. The company won&#8217;t meet its full-year goal
of producing the daily average equivalent of 2.68 million
barrels of crude, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President
George Kirkland said during a conference call with analysts
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintenance Disruption &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing factors to the shortfall include the temporary
shutdown of the Frade field in Brazil after oil seeps on the sea
floor angered government regulators, as well as maintenance work
at the company&#8217;s Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, he said. Chevron
shares dropped more than 1 percent in the first two minutes
after Kirkland&#8217;s comments, before rebounding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson expanded
the capital-projects budget 12 percent this year to $32.7
billion as part of a long-term plan to boost daily production by
one-fifth to the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels by the end of
2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s exploration plans include a pair of wells
scheduled for next year in Iraq&#8217;s Kurdistan region. Chevron
agreed in a deal announced last week to buy Reliance Industries
Inc.&#8217;s stakes in two Kurdistan blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Effects &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. energy explorers were hurt by a 46 percent slide in
gas prices during the second quarter compared to a year earlier,
to an average of $2.354 per million British thermal units, the
lowest since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the least-exposed of the major U.S. energy
producers to tumbling gas prices because its output is more
heavily weighted to crude than its largest domestic rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s production slate was 69 percent crude oil in
2011, with the rest comprised of gas, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. For Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S. energy
company by market value, the oil portion of total output was 51
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next three largest U.S.-based explorers --
ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) and Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC) -- crude accounted for 54 percent, 61 percent
and 32 percent of overall production, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, is following Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in
hosting its first-ever conference call for fixed-income
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, will host the call
at 8 a.m. New York time on Aug. 3 with Treasurer David Russo and
Tom Wipf, head of resource management, the New York-based firm
said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porat has spoken in recent presentations about changes in
the firm&#8217;s funding profile and liquidity reserve as the company
seeks to reassure debtholders of Morgan Stanley, which has the
highest priced credit-default swaps among the nation&#8217;s biggest
banks. The firm cut its outstanding debt by $21 billion in the
past 12 months and doubled common equity since 2007, according
to Porat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs held its call, hosted by Treasurer Elizabeth &#8220;Liz&#8221; Beshel Robinson and CFO David A. Viniar, on July 24.
Robinson told investors that the firm may not issue long-term
debt to match the $11.8 billion it has in second-half maturities
and detailed efforts to boost deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., the third-largest U.S. bank, holds a
conference call for fixed-income investors every quarter a few
days after reporting earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

managers today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no immediate succession in this,&#8221; Dimon, 56,
said in an interview. &#8220;I obviously serve at the pleasure of the
board, it&#8217;s completely up to them, but I would hope it&#8217;s many,

&lt;p&gt;Abby Joseph Cohen, the senior U.S.
investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said equities
will generate better returns than bonds for investors in the
medium-to-long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we were to look just at fair-value estimates over the
next year to three, we think that returns that are roughly 8 to
10 percent on the stock market are sensible,&#8221; she said in an
interview on Bloomberg Surveillance today with Tom Keene. &#8220;It
is sensible as well for a long-term outlook, even though we
assume that economic growth will not be as robust as it was in
the years immediately prior to the financial crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) has surged 25 percent from
its 2011 low in October as economic data beat forecasts and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said policy makers
stand ready to act if more stimulus measures for the U.S.
economy are needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the financial crisis, many companies have repaired
their balance sheets, boosting returns for shareholders, said
Cohen, who is based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The focus has been on margins, ROEs and returning capital
to shareholders,&#8221; she said, referring to so-called return on
equity. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen dividends increase, we&#8217;ve also seen share
repurchases increase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California will borrow an estimated
$10 billion from Wall Street the week of Aug. 13, money the most
indebted U.S. state will use to pay its bills for the rest of
the year, Treasurer Bill Lockyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockyer&#8217;s office will first offer the revenue anticipation
notes to individual investors for two days beginning Aug. 14,
said his spokeman Tom Dresslar. The state will complete the sale
Aug. 16 when institutions such as money-market funds can order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and local governments typically sell short-term notes
to bolster cash flow until tax receipts increase later in the
year. A $10 billion sale would be California&#8217;s largest since
2010. In September, the biggest state by population borrowed
$5.4 billion and had to seek another $1 billion in February this
year after tax collections fell short and spending exceeded
expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) will be joint
senior managers and Los Angeles-based bond firm De La Rosa  Co.
will co-manage the sale, Lockyer has said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s attempt to
dismiss claims in a lawsuit over its mortgage modification
program was rejected by a federal judge in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns turned down JPMorgan&#8217;s
request to have some claims dismissed for lack of jurisdiction
and failure to state a claim, according to a filing July 27 in
Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation consolidates lawsuits brought by homeowners
in more than a dozen states that claim JPMorgan made &#8220;false and
misleading promises&#8221; about modifications to their mortgages.
The homeowners also claim the bank foreclosed on some homes
despite promises they could stay in them while new payment terms
were being negotiated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to participate in the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s Home
Affordable Modification Program in 2009. According to court
papers, banks were required to suspend foreclosure proceedings
during the modification process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We strive to comply with all HAMP guidelines,&#8221; Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, said in

&lt;p&gt;Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA, the Brazilian steelmaker that posted net losses in two of
the past five quarters, jumped to the highest in more than a
month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) recommended buying the
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred shares of Usiminas, as the Belo Horizonte,
Brazil-based company is known, gained 5.7 percent to close at
7.01 reais in Sao Paulo, the highest since June 20. The
company&#8217;s voting shares, a less traded type of stock, climbed 6
percent, leading gains in the Brazilian benchmark Bovespa index
today. The preferred stock has tumbled 31 percent this year
while the common stock has dropped 53 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usiminas is Goldman&#8217;s new top pick within Latin American
steel stocks, analysts led by Marcelo Aguiar in Sao Paulo said
in a note to customers today after upgrading their
recommendation on the equity to buy from sell. The company
stands to profit from a recovery in Brazil&#8217;s flat steel demand
and an operational &#8220;turnaround&#8221; after the entrance of the
Techint Group in the controlling shareholder group, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect Usiminas to outperform peers and the broader
market in the next 12 months as in our view operating turnaround
will begin to materialize throughout the second half of 2012,&#8221;
the analysts said. &#8220;Risk/reward has become compelling for
Usiminas shares.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techint, through its Ternium SA (TX) and Tenaris SA (TEN) units, on
Nov. 27 agreed to pay 5.03 billion reais for a 27.7 percent
voting stake in Usiminas, teaming up with Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) to
control Usiminas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usiminas is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings
after the market closes today. The steelmaker is expected to
post a net loss of 221.3 million reais excluding some items, the
average of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
investor&#8217;s lawsuit seeking disgorgement of insider-trading
profit from former board member Rajat Gupta was dismissed by a
Manhattan federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said in an opinion filed
today that the investor, James Mercer, failed to adequately
allege that Gupta received quid-pro-quo payments for tips he
provided to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who was also a managing partner of McKinsey Co. and
a director at Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), was convicted in June of
securities fraud and conspiracy for tipping Rajaratnam, who is
serving an 11-year prison term for crimes related to insider
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercer&#8217;s assumption that Gupta received payments &#8220;is far
too speculative to survive dismissal,&#8221; Rakoff wrote in his
opinion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said crude production from its Lianzi field
off the coast of West Africa will begin a year later and will be
1,000 barrels a day less than estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion project in a zone between the Republic of
Congo and Republic of Angola will produce as much as 46,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day, San Ramon, California-based
Chevron said today in a statement announcing its intent to
proceed with production. The company had estimated 2014 for
first oil output and a maximum rate of 47,000 barrels a day in a
March 13 presentation to analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company got a clearer sense of the timing for first oil
as it moved closer to the decision to proceed with the project,
Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman, said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lianzi is 65 miles (105 kilometers) offshore in about 3,000
feet (900 meters) of water. Chevron owns a 31.25 percent stake
in the project and is the operator. Total SA (FP) owns 36.75 percent,
Eni SpA (ENI) and Sonangol EP each own 10 percent, Galp Energia SGPS
SA owns 4.5 percent and the Republic of Congo&#8217;s national oil
company owns 7.5 percent, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. energy company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s dollar may rise
further against its U.S. counterpart after breaking through a
key technical range, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Pacific currency, nicknamed the kiwi, may
strengthen to 82.40 U.S. cents, Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical
analyst at the firm, wrote in a note to clients today. That
level hasn&#8217;t been reached since April 30. The kiwi exceeded the
range of 80.55 to 80.90 cents on July 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What the market&#8217;s done over the last few days does
suggest there is still potential for the pro-risk rally to push
higher,&#8221; New York-based O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s currency rose as much as 0.2 percent to 81.13
U.S. cents today, the highest since May 2, before trading at
80.88 cents in New York, down 0.1 percent. It advanced 1.3
percent last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will announce its next policy
decision Aug. 2. ECB President Mario Draghi pledged last week to
do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, suggesting policy
makers may intervene in bond markets. The Federal Reserve starts
a two-day meeting tomorrow amid speculation it may signal
additional stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s clearly going to be a huge factor for whether
market can sustain this pro-risk rally,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;Even
if we get some disappointment, I would look for levels where
these high-beta currencies would try to hold.&#8221; High-beta
currencies tend to have the greatest volatility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Argentine peso will drop to 5
per dollar by the end of this year and to at least 6 per dollar
by the end of 2013, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramos ruled out a large, one-time devaluation and instead
said he expected the government to allow a faster monthly
depreciation of the currency, according to today&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has tightened
controls on the exchange rate and forbidden most purchases of
foreign currencies in a bid to stem capital outflows, which
reached a record $21.5 billion last year. Confidence in the
government fell 7 percent in July for a second straight month,
according to a poll released on July 27 by the Buenos Aires-
based Torcuato Di Tella University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The forceful nature of the FX measures adopted by the
government and the underperformance of the economy have eroded
consumer and business confidence, triggered a run on private
sector dollar deposits and added extra pressure on the peso to
depreciate,&#8221; Ramos said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South America&#8217;s second-biggest economy, which expanded an
annual average of 7.8 percent from 2003 to 2011, will probably
expand less than 3 percent this year, Ramos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso has weakened 6 percent this year to 4.5738 per
dollar, the biggest drop after the Brazilian real, which fell
8.3 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was cut to hold
by Deutsche Bank AG analysts who said regulators may not let the
company resume its stock-repurchase program this year after a
trading loss of at least $5.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings expectations may be too high and Federal Reserve
approval for meaningful buybacks through the first quarter of
2013 &#8220;is unlikely,&#8221; Matt O&#8217;Connor and David Ho wrote in a July
29 research note. The analysts said they met with Chief
Financial Officer Doug Braunstein on July 27 after the company
announced a shakeup in senior management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, also faces
&#8220;uncertain&#8221; legal ramifications stemming from its trading loss
as well as the global investigation into manipulation of
interest rates, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Connor and Ho cut their recommendation on the shares from
buy to hold and lowered the New York bank&#8217;s price target to $40
from $43 a share. JPMorgan has fallen 18 percent, to $36.21, in
New York trading since Bloomberg News reported on April 5 that a
London unit had amassed a large and illiquid portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 1.7 percent at 11:34 a.m. in New York, the
biggest decline on the 24-company KBW Bank Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fund managed by Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) agreed to buy a building near Berlin&#8217;s Brandenburg
Gate valued at about 150 million euros ($184 million) from
Commerzbank AG (CBK), two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of the Lindencorso building, which has apartments,
offices and a Volkswagen AG (VOW) showroom, will probably be completed
by the end of September, said the people, who asked not to be
identified before the deal is announced. The property, at the
corner of Unter den Linden and Friedrichstrasse in Berlin&#8217;s
Mitte district, was built in 1997 and has 47,270 square meters
(508,810 square feet) of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International firms have boosted their German commercial
property assets over the past two years as they seek a safe
European investment amid the sovereign debt crisis. Non-German
buyers spent 9.3 billion euros on German offices and malls last
year, the most since 2008, according to data compiled by
Chicago-based brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds, managed by Goldman, is
buying Lindencorso from a Commerz Real AG closed-end real estate
investment fund, the people said. Whitehall already owns the
leasehold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Monika Schaller and Commerzbank
spokesman Markus Esser declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru and Bolivia have become the
world&#8217;s largest cocaine producers after Colombian capacity to
produce the drug fell to its lowest since 1994, according to a
U.S. government estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s output capacity fell 25 percent last year to 195
metric tons, according a report released in Washington today by
Gil Kerlikowske, director of the U.S. Office of National Drug
Control Policy. That&#8217;s 72 percent less than a peak of 700 tons
in 2001, the report said. Peru produced 325 tons of cocaine in
2010, while Bolivia produced 265 tons in 2011, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. estimate follows a report published by United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime last week, which found that
land in Colombia dedicated to production of coca, the raw
material for making cocaine, climbed last year for the first
time since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twice in the past 100 days, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has turned to a
41-year-old former hedge-fund trader to tackle challenges facing
the largest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Zames, named chief investment officer in May to
contain trading losses that have cost at least $5.8 billion,
became the firm&#8217;s co-chief operating officer last week. Zames,
who began the year as co-head of the bank&#8217;s fixed-income
business, now oversees senior executives including Chief
Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein, 51, and regulatory affairs
head Barry Zubrow, 59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He had the guts and the brains,&#8221; Dimon said in an
interview after announcing the management shakeup on July 27.
&#8220;Matt is straight, direct, does his work. He&#8217;s got that kind of
confidence without arrogance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames&#8217; promotion comes as Wall Street&#8217;s five biggest banks
reported the worst start to a year since 2008, and as a growing
number of investors, analysts and industry veterans, including
Citigroup Inc. (C) creator Sanford &#8220;Sandy&#8221; Weill, call for the
breakup of U.S. financial conglomerates. Zames will help lead a
bank that faced two congressional hearings last month and is the
subject of at least four federal probes into the chief
investment office&#8217;s trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames shoots sporting clays, described by its national
association as &#8220;golf with a shotgun.&#8221; He studies military
history, reading books about World War II and more recent
conflicts. A husband and father of three, he leaves his bed in
New Jersey at 4:45 a.m., he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Better Place&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wake up every morning -- every morning -- excited to
actually make this place a better place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am truly
humbled and honored to have been given the opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames will continue to lead the chief investment office
while adding oversight of finance, strategy and regulatory
affairs, according to a memo sent to employees last week. The
additional duties place him among senior executives who might
one day succeed Dimon. Zames will serve as co-COO alongside
Frank Bisignano, 52, whose responsibilities include technology
and security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two JPMorgan executives who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak on
the matter said Zames is particularly interested in trying to
help shape regulatory policies so they&#8217;ll be better for the New
York-based bank and the broader economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and Dimon, 56, were both involved in an earlier
multibillion-dollar trading crisis. After graduating from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of
Management in 1993 and spending some months at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), Zames became a trader for Long-Term Capital
Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Encounter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund was bailed out in 1998 after Russia&#8217;s debt
default led to $4 billion of losses in what was then one of the
largest collapses in U.S. investment history. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York organized support from banks including
the firm Dimon was leading, Salomon Smith Barney. Zames said he
&#8220;definitely&#8221; remembers meeting Dimon then, though his boss
doesn&#8217;t. &#8220;No,&#8221; Dimon said when asked about the encounter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Long-Term Capital veterans recall Zames as one of
the firm&#8217;s most-trusted young traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You did not get hired at Long-Term unless you were the
best and brightest -- you just didn&#8217;t, it didn&#8217;t matter if you
were a secretary,&#8221; said James Rickards, once the fund&#8217;s general
counsel, who wrote the book &#8220;Currency Wars.&#8221; &#8220;Even in that
milieu, Matt stood out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames was trusted and mentored by senior colleagues,
according to Rickards and Long-Term partner Eric Rosenfeld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mathematician, Poet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s a mathematician and he&#8217;s a poet: He understands the
math, but he understands qualitatively what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; said
Rosenfeld, who now teaches fixed-income at Sloan. Zames is one
of the people on Wall Street who &#8220;live and breathe the trades
they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading that Zames has overseen at JPMorgan has made
the firm billions of dollars. Fixed-income trading revenue last
year was $14.8 billion excluding accounting adjustments, more
than any other global bank. JPMorgan posted the only increase in
debt trading among the largest firms that year, while Bank of
America Corp. and Goldman Sachs slid more than 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s 17 percent market share in fixed-income trading
among the top 10 global firms is probably a Wall Street record,
the investment bank unit&#8217;s then-CEO, James &#8220;Jes&#8221; Staley, said
in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Succession Talk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zames was elevated in last week&#8217;s shakeup, Staley,
55, relinquished daily operational duties, becoming chairman of
an expanded corporate and investment bank division. Once seen as
a potential Dimon successor, Staley was Zames&#8217; boss until this
year. The new division will be co-led by Mike Cavanagh, 46, and
Daniel Pinto, 49. Ina R. Drew, 55, once among Wall Street&#8217;s most
powerful women and a Dimon confidante, resigned as the CIO&#8217;s
chief in May, days after that unit&#8217;s losses were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Dimon said in last week&#8217;s interview that he hopes to
keep leading JPMorgan for &#8220;many, many more years,&#8221; Zames&#8217;
promotion fueled speculation that the former trader is now a
potential successor, along with Dimon&#8217;s long-time lieutenant,
Cavanagh. By working with the so-called corporate division, the
top of the bank that oversees administrative functions, Zames
will gain experience dealing with investors, regulators and the
company&#8217;s board, Dimon said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I love executives to spend some time in corporate,&#8221;
Dimon said. Cavanagh served as chief financial officer for about
six years and helped integrate JPMorgan with Bank One, where
both he and Dimon had worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s shares have slid 17 percent since Bloomberg News
first reported April 5 that the bank had built illiquid bets on
credit derivatives that were big enough to move markets. The
stock closed at $36.89 last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Zames&#8217; emergency appointment to the CIO in May, the
bank has said it reduced the unit&#8217;s positions, shored up risk
controls and will seek to claw back pay from three London-based
employees who oversaw the bets. Drew has also agreed to return
compensation. In a worst-case scenario, the trades may yet lose
an additional $1.7 billion, compared with $5.8 billion during
the year&#8217;s first half, the bank said July 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last week&#8217;s interview, Dimon praised Zames&#8217; handling of
the crisis and recounted their meeting in May to discuss the
situation. Dimon had called Zames into work on a Saturday, and
the two were standing in a hallway when the CEO asked him to
take over the money-losing unit. Zames&#8217; promotion came fewer
than three months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you have a talent like that, you got to give him a
challenge,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Jubail Petrochemical Co., known
as Kemya, expects to have an &#8220;immediate positive&#8221; impact on
the earnings of Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) and ExxonMobil
Corp. (XOM) when their venture starts production from a rubber plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect an immediate positive contribution to the
results of Kemya, Sabic and ExxonMobil from the moment of
startup,&#8221; Jacobus Van Haasteren, executive vice president of
performance chemicals at Sabic, told reporters in Riyadh today.
Production begins in the second half of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $3.4 billion specialty-elastomer plant on the kingdom&#8217;s
Persian Gulf coast will produce 400,000 tons of rubber product a
year that will be exported to Asia and the Middle East and sold
in Saudi Arabia. The venture between Sabic and ExxonMobil
Chemical Co. awarded engineering, procurement and construction
contracts to Daelim Industrial Co. in June. Technip SA (TEC) and
Tecnicas Reunidas SA (TRE) will build the factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies aren&#8217;t concerned about the project&#8217;s
financing, said Sabic Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Al-Mady. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are two strong companies, and we have many ways to
finance our project,&#8221; Al-Mady said at the press conference.

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Supreme Court ruled that the
ship that spilt millions of gallons of oil in waters off Alaska
in 1989 can be recycled in the nation&#8217;s biggest scrapyard in a
defeat for an environmentalist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-judge team headed by Altamas Kabir said the Oriental
Nicety, formerly known as the Exxon Valdez, may enter the yard
in Alang, on India&#8217;s western coast, following a May decision by
the Gujarat Pollution Control Board that denied the ship entry.
The judges said the ship&#8217;s owner or its agent will be
responsible for disposing any toxic material found in the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priya Blue Industries Pvt. a Gujarat-based company that
bought the ship for scrapping, plans to bring it into the yard
in two days from the anchorage off the state&#8217;s coast, company
founder Sanjay Mehta said in a telephone interview. The ship
will take five months to be broken down, Mehta said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict is &#8220;disappointing,&#8221; said Gopal Krishna, the
New Delhi-based activist with ToxicsWatch Alliance who
approached the court in April to bar the ship&#8217;s entry. Krishna
had said the ship poses an environmental threat because it had
asbestos and heavy metals aboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardik Shah, member secretary of the Gujarat Pollution
Control Board, didn&#8217;t answer two calls to his mobile phone
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alaska Oil Spill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez spilt 11 million gallons of oil into
Alaska&#8217;s Prince William Sound, devastating wildlife and local
businesses. Victims of the spill sued Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and won
a $5 billion punitive damage award in 1994 that was cut to
$507.5 million in 2008 by a divided U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the petition filed in India&#8217;s Supreme Court, Krishna had
said the 301 meter-long (988 feet) ship, built in 1986, was
purchased by Best Oasis Ltd., a unit of Priya Blue, for $16
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alang, which opened in 1982, has the capacity to break
ships of about 4 million metric tons a year, according to
Gujarat Maritime Board website. The yard directly employs about
25,000 workers, according to the Board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, unveiled mice and keyboards to work with its
Windows 8 software for tablets and personal computers as it
prepares its own device to compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wireless Wedge Mobile Keyboard, which costs $79.95,
features a protective cover that doubles as a stand for a
tablet, Microsoft said in a statement. The company will also
sell a pocket-size wireless Wedge Touch Mouse for $69.95. Both
use Bluetooth to connect to a computer or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is releasing Windows 8, the next update of its
flagship software, in October to run on PCs and tablets,
including its own machine, Surface. The latest software, mice
and keyboards are designed to combat Apple&#8217;s lead in the tablet
market and boost sales of Surface when it goes on sale later
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company also said it will
sell a Sculpt Touch Mouse for $49.95 and full-size Sculpt Mobile
Keyboard for the same price. Both products use a Bluetooth
connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the Windows division fell 13 percent to $4.15
billion in the three months ended June 30, falling short of the
$4.44 billion average analyst estimate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That was the fifth time in seven quarters
that the unit has fallen short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s iPad will to remain the global tablet leader
through at least 2016, even as it loses some market share,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. The iPad will account for
an estimated 46 percent of shipments in 2016, down from a
projected 61 percent this year, Gartner said. Tablets running
Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software may have 37 percent by 2016, a
gain from 32 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which had zero percent of the tablet market last
year, is expected to nab 12 percent by 2016. That number may
increase because the Gartner report was issued before Microsoft
unveiled its Windows-based tablet. &lt;/p&gt;

three people with knowledge of the matter. Adam Beshara, 38, who
worked with manufacturers such as ITT Corp., starts at
Centerview today, firm co-founder Blair Effron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evercore and Centerview, both based in New York and started
by veterans of some of Wall Street&#8217;s biggest banks, focus on
advising large corporate clients on mergers and capital
structure rather than trading or lending. They&#8217;ve been hiring
amid pay cuts and firings at the bigger firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you sell intellectual capital versus other kinds of
capital -- financial capital and the like -- it attracts a
certain type of individual,&#8221; Effron said in an interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pickett, at JPMorgan since 1998 and the firm&#8217;s former co-
head of consumer and retail investment banking, will start with
Evercore next month, said the three people, who asked not to be
identified because the changes haven&#8217;t been announced. He will
help run the consumer group at Evercore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strug, with JPMorgan since 2000, will join Pickett at
Evercore in September, the people said. Strug was a managing
director in mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan, focusing on
food and beverage companies and restaurant chains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pickett and Strug together in 2008 advised Wendy&#8217;s
International Inc. on its $2.4 billion sale to Nelson Peltz&#8217;s
Triarc Cos. They also advised 3G Capital Inc., the investment
firm backed by a group of Brazilian industrialists, on its
purchase of Burger King Holdings Inc. for $3.3 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beshara, who joins Centerview as a partner, was a managing
director in JPMorgan&#8217;s industrials investment-banking group. He
advised ITT on its 2011 breakup into three separate companies
and the same year helped Stanley Black  Decker Inc. prevail in
a bidding war for Swedish surveillance-systems maker Niscayah
AB. He joined JPMorgan in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evercore, founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Roger Altman, said July 26 that second-quarter profit rose 19
percent on higher investment-banking revenue. On a subsequent
conference call, Altman said Evercore plans to disclose three
new managing directors before next quarter&#8217;s results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pickett and Strug are two of those hires, said one of the
people familiar with the matter. Spokesmen for Evercore and
JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evercore&#8217;s Mark Vander Ploeg, hired in 2007 to focus on
advising retail and consumer companies, retired last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, will introduce a new, free Web-based e-mail
portal under its Outlook brand and phase out Hotmail over time
as it seeks to draw users from Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Gmail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preview of the new service went online today and Hotmail
probably will be phased out in the next year, said Brian Hall, a
general manager in Microsoft&#8217;s Windows group, in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going with Outlook, Microsoft is trying to capitalize on
the brand behind the most-used corporate e-mail service, sold as
part of its Office suite. While Hotmail is the world&#8217;s most
popular Web-based e-mail provider, it has lost ground in the
U.S. to Google and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) as well as other, newer methods
of communication, such as social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;E-mail is one of the only areas in technology that&#8217;s gone
eight years without a significant change -- the last big move
was the release of Gmail -- and for us it&#8217;s maybe been even
longer than that since our last big change,&#8221; Hall said. &#8220;None
of the social networks existed then, and the types of e-mail we
get have changed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotmail was the only one of the top three Web-mail services
to lose unique visitors globally in the year through June 2012,
falling 4 percent, according to ComScore Inc. (SCOR) Yahoo Mail gained
2 percent and Gmail increased 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), embroiled in patent
litigation with Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit, said it&#8217;s
open to reaching a comprehensive settlement of disputes that
have limited sales of Motorola Mobility products in the U.S. and
Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This particular litigation now stands at a crossroads,&#8221;
Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith and Horacio Gutierrez, head
of Microsoft&#8217;s intellectual property group, said in a joint blog
posting. &#8220;Google can take one of two paths: it can choose
either to engage in serious discussions to search for patent
peace or persevere in its diversionary tactics. We hope it will
choose the first course, and we stand ready to engage in good
faith if it does.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has won orders that banned U.S. imports of
Motorola Mobility phones that use a patented feature to
coordinate schedules between phones and personal computers. It&#8217;s
also won limits on sales of some Motorola Mobility products in
Germany based on other Microsoft patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which Mountain View, California-based
Google bought in May, said it too is willing to reach an
agreement. It said Microsoft is the one that&#8217;s causing
difficulties in ending the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft wants to undercut Motorola&#8217;s industry-leading
patent portfolio, licensed by more than 50 other companies on
fair and reasonable terms, while seeking inflated royalties tied
to standards that Microsoft alone controls,&#8221; Becki Leonard, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Motorola
is always open to negotiations that avoid wasteful and abusive
patent claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infringement Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility has lodged its own patent-infringement
claims against Microsoft, including cases in the U.S. and
Germany targeting the Xbox video-gaming system and Windows
operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility has submitted offers to license its
patents, some of which relate to standards established by
industry groups for video compression and Wi-Fi technology. It
also has offered to take a license to the coordination feature,
known as ActiveSync, that it has previously licensed from
Microsoft before 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft contends the offer doesn&#8217;t meet Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s obligation to license such patents on fair and
reasonable terms, and the licensing offer should be based on
&#8220;market rates.&#8221; It filed a breach of contract suit that&#8217;s
scheduled for trial in November in federal court in Seattle,
near Microsoft&#8217;s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing Agreements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith and Gutierrez said any agreement must cover all
Microsoft patents, including ones the company claims Google&#8217;s
Android operating system infringed. The software maker has
reached licensing agreements with other companies that
manufacture devices that run on Android, including Barnes 
Noble Inc. (BKS) and Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is investigating claims filed by
Microsoft and Apple Inc. (AAPL) that Motorola Mobility is misusing its
patents. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a July 11
hearing on whether there should be limits placed on the use of
standard-essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple contend that owners who help develop
standards shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to use essential patents to block
competitors. Google has told regulators it won&#8217;t seek any block
as long as companies are in licensing negotiations. It has
accused Microsoft and Apple of refusing to negotiate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission is considering
whether such patents should be the basis of an import ban, in a
case Motorola Mobility filed against Apple. A final decision in
that case is due Aug. 24. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="Jul 31, 2012  4:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-31/pfizer-schedules-animal-unit-ipo-as-profit-beats-estimates.html"><headline>Pfizer Plans August IPO Filing as Profits Top Estimates</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, said it will start a filing in mid-August to sell as
much as 20 percent of its animal-health unit in an initial
public offering. The company also reported profit that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates as a result of cost cutting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 25 percent to $3.25 billion, or 43 cents a
share, New York-based Pfizer said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding one-time items beat by 8 cents the average estimate of
54 cents of 15 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is reducing costs to counter eroding sales of its
top-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor, which lost market
exclusivity in November. The spin off of the animal-health unit
and spending cuts are part of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read&#8217;s
plan to refocus the company on producing new drugs to replace
Lipitor, once the world&#8217;s biggest-selling medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re before the middle innings, because it takes a
longer timeline,&#8221; to develop products than to reduce expenses,
Read said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a spending overhaul, Pfizer may cut as many as
10 more facilities in the next several years, Chief Financial
Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares gained 1.4 percent to $24.04 at the
close in New York, their highest price in more than four years.
The stock has gained 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Serious Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Read showed he is serious about cost cutting, and
investors already rewarded him with a nice run-up in the stock
price over the last 12 months,&#8221; Erik Gordon, a professor of
business at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;The new products have to pan out and Pfizer has to
grow its non-U.S. sales in the face of a global slowdown.  Both
are riskier propositions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has three experimental drugs in late-stage
testing that investors are focused on as the near-term
replacements for Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib, one of those drugs, is meant to treat
rheumatoid arthritis. U.S. regulatory approval might be delayed
beyond its current August deadline, the company said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also released a study today showing the drug was
more effective than methotrexate, an older treatment.
Tofacitinib was superior in easing pain and swelling of joints
caused by rheumatoid arthritis and no new side effects were
found, according to the study. Results were from the last of
three stages of human tests generally required for Food and Drug
Administration approval. The drug may compete with Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)&#8217; top-seller, Humira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Setbacks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other top prospects have had setbacks. Bapineuzumab, an
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease drug being developed with Johnson  Johnson
and Elan Corp., failed the first of four pivotal, final-stage
clinical trials, Pfizer said on July 24. Results from the next
trial will be released in August, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also seeking marketing clearance for
Eliquis, a blood thinner being developed with New York-based
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) The FDA rejected Eliquis in June,
asking the companies for more information from existing trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA could take as long as six months after the
companies give regulators the data to respond. The agency hasn&#8217;t
asked for a new clinical trial. The drug, aimed at patients with
heart arrhythmia, would have $2.5 billion a year in sales by
2015 if approved, according to Tim Anderson, a Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. analyst in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Results &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost cutting helped Pfizer make its numbers this
quarter. Revenue fell 9 percent to $15.1 billion in the quarter,
led by declining sales of Lipitor, which dropped 53 percent to
$1.22 billion. Adjusted expenses, including marketing,
administrative and research and development costs, dropped 16
percent to $8.27 billion. The company reiterated its 2012
adjusted earnings forecast of $2.14 to $2.24 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that cost cutting can&#8217;t continue in some
form or fashion, especially as Pfizer has entered a period of a
number of expiries,&#8221; Tony Butler, an analyst with Barclays Plc,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Margins and the ability to hold
back costs are much better than we as analysts predicted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to sell shares of the animal-health business
in the first half of next year, Read said. The company will file
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that will start the process of separating the
business in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zoetis Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the IPO, Pfizer plans to give current
shareholders stock in the animal-health business, to be named
Zoetis, he has said previously. The company hasn&#8217;t announced yet
where the company will have its headquarters, nor said who will
lead it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, Pfizer agreed to sell its infant nutrition
business to Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA for $11.9
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money from the unit divestitures may be to be used for
share buybacks, which Read calls &#8220;the case to beat,&#8221; compared
with acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has bid for other companies, including
drugmaker Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bloomberg has reported.
However, it hasn&#8217;t made a purchase worth more than $50 million
during Read&#8217;s tenure, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We invest internally in projects that we believe have a
return above our cost of capital,&#8221; Read said. &#8220;External
opportunities are subject to the same analysis. We are not going
to do projects that do not return our cost of capital because of
issues internally or non-issues internally. Our willingness to
do deal externally is driven by the value of the deals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quarter was the first in which Lipitor faced the
full might of competition from generic versions of the pill. Six
months ago, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. and Watson Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (WPI) were the only rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lyrica, used to treat pain, rose 14 percent to
$1.04 billion. Enbrel, an injection to treat rheumatoid
arthritis symptoms, generated $988 million in sales, an increase
of 8 percent. Revenue from Prevnar, Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine for
pneumococcal diseases, gained 12 percent to $916 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $101.6
million of structured notes tied to the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index (SPX), its largest offering this year, after increasing the size
three times to satisfy demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year securities, $70 million of which were issued
July 9, yield 1.5 times the gains of the index, with investors
risking principal if the SP 500 falls more than 50 percent,
according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The New York-based bank sold $16.2 million
more notes on July 12, $10.1 million additional ones on July 18,
and $5.31 million more on July 24, according to the SEC filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most recent issuance, the bank estimated the value
of the securities at $960 per $1,000, down from $976 on July 9.
Between July 9 and 24, the SP 500 fell 1 percent to 1,338.3.
The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
is known, climbed 14 percent to 20.47 during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such notes are &#8220;very sensitive&#8221; to changes in the
volatility of the linked index, said Guus Oonincx, founder of
G.O. Capital Markets Consulting Services LLC and a former
managing director at ING Financial Group. &#8220;That is often the
culprit for these pricing differences.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of credit default swaps on Goldman Sachs, which
can be used to hedge against losses on the company&#8217;s debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, also climbed by about 30 basis
points to 302.7 basis points during the two weeks, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Higher credit risk reduces the value
of structured notes, which are securities created by banks that
package debt with derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank distributed the latest securities for a 0.3
percent fee, compared with 0.35 percent for the other three
sales, according to the SEC filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s second-largest offering, on March 27, was
$100 million of one-year notes linked to the Dow Jones-UBS
Commodity Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said he expects China&#8217;s central bank to
continue cutting interest rates to shore up the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think they need more interest-rate cuts,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said
in an interview with Bloomberg Radio from London today.
&#8220;Inflation has come down sharply, probably more than they
expected, and the economy of course has weakened quite a bit,
too. It&#8217;s pretty obvious we&#8217;re going to get more rate cuts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s leaders pledged today to keep adjusting policies to
ensure stable economic growth this year, with the Politburo
reiterating the country will pursue a &#8220;prudent&#8221; monetary
policy and &#8220;proactive&#8221; fiscal policy. The central bank has cut
interest rates twice since early June, reduced banks&#8217; reserve
requirements three times since November and sped approvals for
investment projects as economic growth weakened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill also said that &#8220;it&#8217;s rather good&#8221; that emerging
economies &#8220;worry so much&#8221; about the euro area&#8217;s fiscal crisis
as it will encourage them to pay more attention to their own
imbalances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said its rheumatoid
arthritis treatment tofacitinib, one of the company&#8217;s leading
experimental drugs, was more effective than an older treatment
in a large-scale study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug met its primary end-point in the study and no new
side effects were found, Pfizer said today in a statement.
Pfizer said on a conference call with analysts today that the
Food and Drug Administration may need more time than expected to
make a decision on approval of the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, dubbed ORAL start, found that tofacitinib was
superior to methotrexate in easing pain and swelling of joints
caused by rheumatoid arthritis, according to the statement.
Results were from the last of three stages of human tests
generally required for FDA approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder
that affects about 1.3 million Americans and 23.7 million people
worldwide, the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total SA (FP), France&#8217;s largest oil
producer, followed Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) into the
Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total bought a 35 percent stake in the Harir and Safen
blocks from Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), the Paris-based company said in
today. The two blocks cover an area of 705 square kilometers
(270 square miles) and 424 square kilometers respectively. Total
will be the operator of the Safen block, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s Baghdad-based Oil Ministry has rebuked Exxon and
Chevron for signing contracts with the semi-autonomous Kurdish
region. The Kurds halted crude shipments on April 1 through a
pipeline controlled by the central government in a dispute over
tax revenue from oil, and they have announce plans to build
their own export link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Total confirms its commitment to contribute to the
development of the oil industry in Iraq and is looking for new
opportunities,&#8221; the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Marathon official declined to comment on the financial
details of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish region plans to increase output to 2 million
barrels a day by 2019, Michael Howard, an adviser to Kurdistan
Natural Resources Minister Ashti Hawrami, said in a June 10
phone interview. It has signed energy agreements with about 50
companies and plans to increase output to 1 million barrels a
day by 2015 from about 300,000 barrels a day now, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurdish authorities recognize production-sharing
agreements, which give investors a share of any oil they may
produce, whereas Iraq&#8217;s Oil Ministry offers only fee-based
service contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cargo was sold at a discount of about $25 a ton below
Singapore prices, according to two of the people, who asked not
to be identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. That
compares with a discount of $19 to $20 that Bakri International
Energy paid to Exxon for a similar cargo earlier this month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the transaction are as follow: &lt;/p&gt;

---------------------------------------------------------------
Quantity:       80,000 tons
Sulfur:         maximum 4%
Price:          About $25 a ton discount to Singapore prices
Centistoke:     650
Loading time:   around Aug. 10 to Aug. 15
Loading port:   Yanbu

&lt;p&gt;     The oil&#8217;s centistoke rating is a measure of its viscosity,
or flow rate, when heated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd., operator of the
European Union&#8217;s largest payment-card network, was sent an
antitrust complaint from EU regulators over the fees it charges
to process cross-border credit-card payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe&#8217;s so-called multilateral interchange fees
&#8220;harm competition between acquiring banks, inflate the cost of
payment card acceptance for merchants and ultimately increase
consumer prices,&#8221; the European Commission said in an e-mailed
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Card fees paid by retailers are &#8220;too high&#8221; and there
isn&#8217;t any sign that they&#8217;ve decreased since 2006, the EU&#8217;s
competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in May. Regulators
last year settled an earlier probe into Visa Europe&#8217;s fees for
debit-card payments made outside a user&#8217;s home country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe issues about 41 percent of all payment cards in
Europe, the Brussels-based antitrust agency said. More than 5
million businesses in Europe accept its payments, which valued
1.8 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) in 2010, the EU said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed that the commission has taken
such a confrontational approach and was not willing to find a
solution to support investment and innovation in European
payment,&#8221; Peter Ayliffe, chief executive officer of Visa
Europe, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe can defend itself in writing or seek an oral
hearing before EU regulators take a decision on fines that can
amount to 10 percent of yearly sales. Visa Europe split from
Visa Inc. (V) before the U.S. card company&#8217;s initial public offering
in early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cartels Outlawed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brussels-based antitrust agency said Visa Europe&#8217;s fees
restricted competition between banks and violated EU rules that
outlaw cartels and restrictive business practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the EU has previously said interchange fees aren&#8217;t
illegal, regulators said Visa Europe&#8217;s fees weren&#8217;t set in a way
that would benefit consumers. They also said they doubted the
company&#8217;s argument that the fees are necessary to create
efficiencies that benefited retailers and consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fee, based on Visa&#8217;s guidelines, is paid by the
retailer&#8217;s bank to the bank that issued the customer&#8217;s card. The
EU&#8217;s objections cover fees paid on cross-border transactions in
Europe as well as domestic fees in Belgium, Hungary, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MasterCard Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators&#8217; decision to curb MasterCard Inc. (MA)&#8217;s cross-border
card fees was backed by an EU court last month. The court
rejected MasterCard&#8217;s challenge to the EU decision that it
unfairly inflated the transaction fees paid by retailers for
processing payments. MasterCard will appeal the case to the EU&#8217;s
highest court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers have long complained about the cost they are
charged to accept card payments. Unlike for checks, banks charge
interchange fees to process debit- and credit-card payments.
Card operators set the amounts, own the payment networks and
pass the money to the lenders. The retailer&#8217;s bank pays the fees
to the customer&#8217;s card issuer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., MasterCard and some of the biggest U.S. banks
this month agreed to a U.S. settlement of at least $6.05 billion
in a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card
swipe fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, put in place the last piece of its plan to refocus
the company on developing new drugs, announcing it would start
the separation of its animal-health business this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the drugmaker spins off the unit and makes deep spending
cuts, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has set the stage for
Pfizer&#8217;s future without Lipitor, the drug that dominated the
company&#8217;s sales until this year after losing market exclusivity.
Top on the agenda is making New York-based Pfizer better at
turning out innovative new medicines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has three drugs with the potential to generate
over a $1 billion each in sales that could reach the market next
year, including treatments for heart disease, Alzheimer&#8217;s and
rheumatoid arthritis. Eliquis, a blood thinner, could be
approved in the first half of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the research side, we&#8217;re before the middle innings,
because it takes a longer timeline,&#8221; than cutting expenses,
Read said yesterday in an interview. &#8220;We need to make it easier
for people to make an impact and get things done inside a
company that has 100,000 colleagues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer yesterday said it would start an initial public
offering in mid-August to sell as much as 20 percent of its
animal-health unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also reported second-quarter net income that rose 25
percent to $3.25 billion, or 43 cents a share, and adjusted
earnings per share that topped analyst estimates by 8 cents,
largely due to aggressive cuts that knocked out $8.27 billion in
adjusted expenses. Revenue sank 9 percent to $15.1 billion in
the quarter led by declining sales of Lipitor, which dropped 53
percent to $1.22 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $23.94 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The company&#8217;s stock has gained 26 percent in the last
12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company continues to generate enough cash, and has fat
to trim, Read said. As part of its spending overhaul, Pfizer may
cut as many as 10 more facilities in the next several years,
Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Read showed he is serious about cost cutting, and
investors already rewarded him with a nice run-up in the stock
price over the last 12 months,&#8221; Erik Gordon, a professor of
business at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said
yesterday in an e-mail. &#8220;The new products have to pan out and
Pfizer has to grow its non-U.S. sales in the face of a global
slowdown.  Both are riskier propositions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read and D&#8217;Amelio also have been able to keep earnings per
share up through stock buybacks. The company bought back $9
billion in shares last year and will buy back $5 billion this
year, D&#8217;Amelio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RD Effort &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer can keep investors interested by dividends and
using cash to buy back stock,&#8221; said Tony Butler, an analyst
with Barclays Plc. As for the research and development effort,
it &#8220;takes some time for those changes to bear fruit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been setbacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the company said that U.S. regulators may delay
approval of tofacitinib, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis,
beyond its current August deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Pfizer released a study showing the drug
was more effective than methotrexate, an older treatment.
Tofacitinib was superior in easing pain and swelling of joints
caused by rheumatoid arthritis and no new side effects were
found, according to the study. Results were from the last of
three stages of human tests generally required for Food and Drug
Administration approval. The drug may compete with Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)&#8217; top-seller, Humira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experimental Drugs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bapineuzumab, an Alzheimer&#8217;s disease drug being developed
with Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Elan Corp., failed the first of four
pivotal, final-stage clinical trials, Pfizer said on July 24.
Results from the next trial will be released this month, Read
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also is seeking marketing clearance for
Eliquis, a blood thinner being developed with New York-based
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) The FDA rejected Eliquis in June,
asking the companies for more information from existing trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA could take as long as six months after the
companies give regulators the data to respond. The agency hasn&#8217;t
asked for a new clinical trial. The drug, aimed at patients with
heart arrhythmia, would have $2.5 billion a year in sales by
2015 if approved, according to Tim Anderson, a Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. analyst in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Innovation Engines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said he&#8217;s committed to sticking with his strategy of
getting Pfizer&#8217;s innovation engines working even if there are
near-term setbacks, and won&#8217;t turn to buying drugs or companies
just to fill the pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We invest internally in projects that we believe have a
return above our cost of capital,&#8221; Read said. &#8220;External
opportunities are subject to the same analysis. We are not going
to do projects that do not return our cost of capital because of
issues internally or non-issues internally. Our willingness to
do deals externally is driven by the value of the deals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has bid for other companies, including
drugmaker Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bloomberg has reported.
However, it hasn&#8217;t announced a purchase worth more than $50
million during Read&#8217;s tenure, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has cash coming that will give it more room to
breathe, from the divestiture of the two noncore units. April,
Pfizer agreed to sell its infant nutrition business to Vevey,
Switzerland-based Nestle SA for $11.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zoetis Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the IPO of the animal-health business, Pfizer
plans to give current shareholders stock in the company, to be
named Zoetis, Read has said previously. That will further reduce
Pfizer&#8217;s amount of outstanding stock and increase earnings per
share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker plans to sell shares of the animal-health
business in the first half of next year, Read said. The company
will file a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that will start the process of separating
the business this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer hasn&#8217;t announced yet where the animal health company
will have its headquarters, nor said who will lead it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money from the divestitures is likely be to be used for
share buybacks, which Read calls &#8220;the case to beat,&#8221; compared
with acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler, of Barclays, thinks Pfizer and the rest of the
pharmaceutical sector are entering a period with more research
and development promise than any time in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re managing these businesses much better than they
did at the turn of the decade and the mid-90s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They
are growth stocks. Not at the level they once were. But perhaps
at a more sustainable level than they had been.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas Kass, founder of Seabreeze
Partners Management Inc., said the business model for brokerage
firms no longer works and so he&#8217;s betting on Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)&#8217;s shares to decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The brokerage industry&#8217;s business model is broken,&#8221; Kass
said today in a radio interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt
on &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance.&#8221; &#8220;The group&#8217;s adverse secular
changes are going to translate into considerably lower industry
returns on invested capital and profits going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kass said he&#8217;s &#8220;short&#8221; shares of Goldman Sachs, meaning
he&#8217;s borrowed stock to sell and plans to buy it back at a lower
price. &#8220;On any strength I&#8217;d be short some other stocks in the
group,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry&#8217;s return on invested capital fell to 8 percent
last year from 25 percent or higher in 2007, Kass said. &#8220;In my
spreadsheets I have it improving to no better than to 11 percent
in the next three or four years,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, made
58 percent of its revenue in the first six months of the year
from trading stocks, bonds, currencies and other financial
assets. The New York-based company last month reported its
lowest first-half revenue since 2005 and said it plans to cut
$500 million of expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs gained 0.2 percent to $101.12 at 12:06 p.m.
in New York. The firm&#8217;s shares have advanced 12 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Indian stocks climbed for the
fourth day as investors awaited monetary policy decisions by the
U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX), or Sensex, rose 0.1 percent
to 17,257.38 at the close, as 16 stocks climbed and 14 fell on
the gauge. Drugmaker Cipla Ltd. (CIPLA) advanced the most in more than
eight months after its profit exceeded estimates. State Bank of
India Ltd. and Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) increased more
than 1 percent each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve will probably forgo announcing a
third round of large-scale asset purchases and is more likely to
wait until September to unveil plans to buy debt, economists
said before the two-day monetary policy meeting that concludes
today. The European Central Bank will announce a decision
tomorrow after ECB President Mario Draghi vowed last week to do
whatever it takes to preserve the euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ECB having raised the expectations got to come up
with something substantive this week and it would be enough to
encourage the risk-on trade for a while,&#8221; Geoff Lewis, head of
investment services at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong,
told Bloomberg UTV today. &#8220;The ECB will do its best to calm the
financial markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sensex has increased 12 percent this year, helped by
record purchases by overseas investors. India&#8217;s economy will
grow 5.7 percent in the year to March 31, less than a previous
forecast of 6.6 percent, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) wrote in a
report today, citing the outlook for weaker farm output from
deficient monsoon rains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Sticky Funds&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign funds bought a net $2 billion of stocks in July,
taking their investment this year in Indian equities to $11.3
billion, data from the regulator show. That&#8217;s a record for the
period and the most in Asia in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foreign institutional investors are sticking with India
as the long-term growth prospects are still very attractive,
especially when compared with developed markets,&#8221; Lewis said.
&#8220;A lot of bad news is being discounted. We will see a gradual
build up of flows back into India and this will actually take
some pressure off the rupee, and the current account deficit
will prove finance-able.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee strengthened, snapping a two-day decline, on
speculation global policy makers are preparing to take measures
aimed at arresting a global slowdown. Foreign investors raised
holdings of rupee-denominated debt by $610 million last month
through July 30, exchange data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Sentiment Hit&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left the
benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at 8 percent for a second
meeting yesterday. The RBI raised its inflation forecast to 7
percent as a drop in the rupee, infrastructure bottlenecks and
higher food costs stoke price pressures, a trend that may be
worsened by the impact of the monsoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The biggest surprise has been the weak monsoon,&#8221; Goldman
analysts led by Tushar Poddar wrote in the report. &#8220;This will
likely exacerbate the hit to business sentiment, which has
already worsened more and quicker than we expected largely due
to the lack of significant policy reforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh is grappling with a budget deficit and discord in the
ruling coalition that has set back efforts to turn around a
slowdown in investment. Two power-grid collapses in 36 hours
that affected a record 600 million have dented his credibility,
already strained as the economy grows at the slowest pace in a
decade and his government struggles through 18 months of policy
reversals and corruption allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investor Confidence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh vowed last month to revive investor confidence after
Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Fitch Ratings warned they may strip the
country of its investment-grade credit rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palaniappan Chidambaram was named finance minister for the
third time yesterday, taking over from Singh, who assumed the
post temporarily after Pranab Mukherjee resigned to run for the
country&#8217;s presidency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the SP CNX Nifty Index, surged 2.8 percent to 16.45.
The Nifty added 0.2 percent to 5,240.50. The BSE-200 Index rose
0.4 percent. Combined volume on India&#8217;s top two bourses was 809
million shares yesterday, 10 percent less than the 12-month
daily average of 899 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cipla soared 5 percent to 354 rupees, the most since Nov.
15. First-quarter profit rose 58 percent to 4.01 billion rupees
($72 million). The median of 23 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was a 3.1 billion-rupee profit. Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (SUNP), the most valuable drugmaker, added 1 percent to
659.85 rupees. Dr Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd. (DRRD) climbed 1.3 percent
to 1,635.95 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Bank added 1.4 percent to 2,033.4 rupees. Housing
Development gained 1.3 percent to 699.85 rupees. Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd. (BHEL), the biggest power-equipment maker, surged 2.2
percent to 220.4 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy Services, the largest software exporter,
fell 1.5 percent to 1,224.65 rupees. Infosys Ltd. (INFO) declined 0.4
percent to 2,218.55 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas investors bought a net 9.28 billion rupees ($166
million) of stocks yesterday, according to the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sports industry provides a
snapshot of forces propelling the global economy as emerging
markets increasingly play host to big events such as the
Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declaring sports &#8220;the world&#8217;s favorite growth industry,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Hugo Scott-Gall said athletics can
&#8220;mirror the global economy and the changing shape of it&#8221; as
developing economies such as China wield greater power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Beijing having hosted the 2008 Olympics, the torch
will pass to Rio de Janeiro in 2016 after the London Olympics
end this month. Russia and South Korea will be the locations for
the next two Winter Olympics. Russia will hold the World Cup in
2018 and Qatar in 2022, after South Africa did so in 2010. India
put on its first Formula 1 motor race in 2011 and more than a
third of Grand Prix events take place in emerging economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging nations stand to benefit more from stadium and
transport-infrastructure building, as well as foreign investment
and higher sponsorship, as international companies look to
increase their presence, Scott-Gall, a London-based equity
analyst, said in a July 26 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that may benefit include Hong Kong-based sports
retailer Belle International Holdings Inc. (1880) and Russian
construction company OAO Mostotrest, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, richer economies have less need to play
host because they already have such amenities as transport
systems. Given expenditure on such events tends to exceed
initial budgets, he noted that Rome has withdrawn its bid for
the 2020 Olympics. Cash-strapped Madrid remains a contender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots may be to blame for the weakness in the U.S. labor
market, according to hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLJ founders Stephen Jen and Fatih Yilmaz said in their
July 30 report that technological advances may be progressing at
a rate too fast for workers to adjust or to retrain, prompting
their replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The high spending on capital expenditures (i.e.,
technology) but low hiring in the U.S. in the past two years is
consistent with this view that companies are replacing certain
types of labor with technology,&#8221; London-based Jen and Yilmaz
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workers at most risk of this development are those in
mid-skilled jobs, given robots are unlikely to be designed for
working as restaurant staff or advanced enough to be doctors,
the report said, citing the research of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology economist David Autor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. and China suffer from the rise of the robot,
substituting technology for jobs may be good for societies with
aging labor forces such as Japan, SLJ said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economies of the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand
need to grow faster than in the past if they are to avoid being
stuck in an income trap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the conclusion of economists at HSBC Holdings Plc,
who studied what happens when growth rates slow so much as an
economy matures that the country&#8217;s per-capita income fails to
enjoy any meaningful rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippines, for example, is now in the lower-middle-
income bracket. To move to the higher-middle-income rank, its
income per capita would need to expand 4.5 percent through 2020
and 5.1 percent beyond, said economists Frederic Neumann and
Sanchita Mukherjee. Still, over the past decade it has only
gained 3.1 percent on average, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in Asia, China may fare better in its push to
rise beyond upper-middle-income status. To move to the high-
income tax bracket, average annual per capita income growth
would need to be 4.7 percent until 2020 and 5.3 percent in the
next decade. The past 10 years witnessed average income growth
of 9.9 percent, suggesting it may be possible, said HSBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas border towns such as El Paso are now reaping the
rewards of their close proximity to Mexico after years of pain
following 1994&#8217;s introduction of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;El Paso and other border cities are no longer at the edge
of the U.S., but at strategic locations in an emerging North
American market,&#8221; economists Robert Gilmer and Roberto Cornado
said in the study, which was published this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their research found that every year from 2001 to 2010, six
sectors contributed 6.5 percentage points to household earnings
growth, with the bulk of new jobs in finance, professional
services and management. The increase, mirrored by a convergence
in per-capita income toward the U.S. average, is supported by
continued integration of U.S. and Mexican industrial production
and by higher competitiveness south of the border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uplift marks a reversal from the loss of El Paso&#8217;s
apparel industry following NAFTA&#8217;s implementation, when it
became the biggest recipient of compensation and worker-
retraining funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bondholders of Edison International (EIX)&#8217;s
generation unit may recover 54 cents on the dollar in an
increasingly probable bankruptcy scenario for the unprofitable
power producer, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edison Mission Energy&#8217;s bonds are trading at about 54
cents, which JPMorgan high yield utilities analysts Dave Katz
and Bayina Bashtaeva estimate to be recovery. Edison Mission may
need to cut its $3.7 billion of debt by more than the $1 billion
the company has forecast, they wrote in a note today. Chief
Executive Officer Ted Craver said the company would have to
reduce a &#8220;sufficient&#8221; amount of debt to be able to achieve
credit metrics allowing it to refinance the remainder, according
to a July 31 earnings conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an indication Edison would like to pursue a
greater than $1 billion reduction,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edison International, owner of California&#8217;s second-largest
electric utility, said yesterday in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that its money-losing,
unregulated generation unit may have to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection. The net loss at Edison Mission Group
widened to $110 million from $30 million a year ago on lower
power prices and higher fuel costs, the Rosemead, California-
based company said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edison Mission spokesman Doug McFarlan couldn&#8217;t be
immediately reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds Plunge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edison Mission&#8217;s $500 million of 7.5 percent senior
unsecured notes due June 2013 dropped to 54.8 cents on the
dollar, from as high as 100.25 cents on Aug. 3, as of 1:26 p.m.
in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Its $500 million
of 7.75 percent notes due June 2016 fell to 53.8 cents today,
Trace data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edison Mission has been hurt by a slump in power prices and
rising environmental-compliance costs for its coal-fired power
plants, and is in talks with bondholders to restructure debt and
may have to reorganize its generation unit under new ownership
if talks are unsuccessful, Craver said on a conference call with
investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City will try to reduce the
recidivism of young male convicts housed on Rikers Island with a
four-year program run by nonprofits and financed by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will invest $9.6 million through a so-called
social-impact bond, meaning it will profit only if the plan
achieves its goals. New York officials said the program is the
first of its kind in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this new model, private investors fund the
intervention through a nonprofit contractor and the government
pays the contractor only if the program meets its goals,&#8221; Mayor
Michael Bloomberg&#8217;s office said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Goldman Sachs to earn a profit, the program will need
to reduce recidivism by at least 10 percent. City payments to
MDRC, a nonprofit social-policy group created by the Ford
Foundation that will monitor and run the program, also will be
based on its degree of success. The Vera Institute of Justice
will independently assess the program&#8217;s effectiveness, the
mayor&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will fully fund the four-year program, called
the Adolescent Behavioral Learning Experience, through a loan to
New York-based MDRC. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the mayor&#8217;s
private charity, will provide $7.2 million to MDRC to back a
portion of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s loan. There will be a cost to the
city only if the program succeeds, the mayor&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Instrument &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This investment paves the way for a new type of
instrument that enables the public sector to leverage upfront
funding from the private sector,&#8221; Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program&#8217;s targets are inmates age 16 to 18, whose
recidivism rate is now about 50 percent, the mayor&#8217;s office
said. Inmates will receive education, training and counseling to
improve personal-responsibility skills, including decision-
making and problem-solving, the mayor&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other New York-based nonprofits, the Osborne
Association and Friends of Island Academy, will also deliver
recreational activities &#8220;to reduce idleness, promote team
building and afford opportunities for adolescents to practice
what they are learning in a variety of settings and
circumstances,&#8221; the mayor&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program is part of the Bloomberg administration&#8217;s
privately supported $30 million Young Men&#8217;s Initiative, which
seeks ways to improve productivity and reduce risk of poverty
for young males. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s also part of a national search by Bloomberg&#8217;s
foundation to find innovative policies and practices to deal
with difficult urban problems, the mayor&#8217;s office said. To
further that effort, the mayor last month offered $9 million in
prizes to U.S. cities through the foundation in a competition
for ideas that local governments can use to solve problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lessons learned from the nation&#8217;s first social-impact
bond will be shared with other jurisdictions who are eager to
test the approach,&#8221; the mayor&#8217;s news release said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Michael Camacho as chief executive officer of its commodities activities

who will become chief marketing officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camacho will also retain his duties as global head of

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led foreign
banks in accelerating job cuts at their Japanese brokerages last
fiscal year as employees relocated to other Asian financial
centers and firms trimmed costs amid a global industry slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of staff at nine global securities firms in
Japan fell by 537, or 7.3 percent, to a combined 6,796 as of
March 31, more than double the previous year&#8217;s 3.2 percent
reduction, according to company regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street and European banks have been eliminating jobs
and transferring staff from Japan to Hong Kong and Singapore to
reduce expenses as the euro region&#8217;s debt woes dent global
investor confidence. The worst may be over as Japan recovers
from last year&#8217;s nuclear crisis and some U.S. firms start hiring
junior bankers for mergers advice and asset management, said
Katsunobu Komizo, a Tokyo-based recruiting consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overseas banks made deep cuts from October to March due
to the Fukushima and European shocks, especially in investment
banking such as equity underwriting,&#8221; said Komizo, president of
Executive Search Partners Co. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve past the peak.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock underwriting in Japan suffered last year as companies
shunned capital markets after the March 2011 earthquake and
tsunami that left 19,000 people dead or missing and caused a
meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant north of Tokyo.
Public offerings fell to 1.2 trillion yen ($15 billion) in the
year ended March from 4 trillion yen a year earlier, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most Expensive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo is the world&#8217;s most expensive city for expatriates,
according to ECA International&#8217;s Worldwide Cost of Living Survey
conducted in March. Singapore is 32nd and Hong Kong 36th. The
yen touched a postwar high of 75.35 against the dollar in
October, raising costs for overseas banks and their foreign
staff. Japan&#8217;s currency traded at 78.43 at 5:45 p.m. local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Japan Co. reduced headcount by 14 percent to
847, the biggest cut among the brokerages, according to the
firm&#8217;s filing e-mailed to Bloomberg News. The New York-based
company has other operations in Japan, including asset
management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment. Tokyo-based spokesmen for the eight other
brokerages also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Switzerland&#8217;s second-biggest
lender, pared the workforce at its Japanese brokerage by 8.6
percent to 540. Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) reduced 7.9 percent of staff at
its local securities unit to 834 and BNP Paribas SA (BNP), France&#8217;s
largest bank, cut 7.4 percent to 462. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barclays, Citigroup &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) also trimmed jobs at
their securities units in Japan, according to the filings to the
Financial Services Agency. Bank of America employed 1,028 staff
at its Japan brokerage as of March 31, the most of the nine
firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerages posted combined profits in Japan of 2.9
billion yen for the fiscal year, recovering from losses of 118.6
billion yen a year earlier, the filings showed. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
local joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. led
the gains with net income of 34.6 billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays (BARC), the U.K.&#8217;s second-largest bank, posted net income
of 5.5 billion yen in Japan, the second highest among the nine
brokerages and up from 56 million yen a year earlier. Profit at
Goldman Sachs Japan fell to 4.7 billion yen from 18.1 billion
yen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the consumer
products company targeted by activist investor Bill Ackman,
reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates,
helped by price increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income in the period ended June 30 advanced 45 percent
to $3.63 billion, or $1.24 a share, from $2.51 billion, or 84
cents, a year earlier, Cincinnati-based PG said today in a
statement. Profit excluding some items was 82 cents a share.
Analysts projected 77 cents, the average of 21 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Robert McDonald is working to prove
his pricing and plan to save $10 billion by 2016 through cutting
jobs and marketing will be enough to improve results. Last
month, Ackman&#8217;s Pershing Square took a $1.8 billion stake in
PG, and people familiar with the matter said he plans to push
for leadership changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to clamp down on spending for three to six
months, but he has to convince investors that he can permanently
reduce PG&#8217;s cost structure and, at the same time, grow sales,&#8221;
Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan,
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG, the maker of Tide laundry detergent and Duracell
batteries, rose 3.1 percent to $65.50 at the close in New York.
The shares have declined 1.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald said on a conference call today that the company
has had talks with Ackman, and declined to provide specific
details. The CEO also forecast job reductions of 10 percent at
PG by the end of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company reiterated its forecast for earnings per share
for fiscal 2013 will be $3.80 to $4. Analysts projected $3.90,
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an element of pulling out all the stops to look
better,&#8221; Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;And that&#8217;s fine if that&#8217;s
continuous. If Procter  Gamble needed an activist scare to do
better, that&#8217;s great.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG said it will repurchase $4 billion in stock this fiscal
year. In June, the company suspended stock repurchases to
protect itself from credit downgrades. Chief Financial Officer
Jon Moeller said on a conference call today that the company
reconsidered after having a &#8220;tremendous cash quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price increases across all product segments added 4 percent
or more to net sales growth in the quarter, PG said. While the
higher prices helped counter increased costs for raw materials,
volume was little changed from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price reductions in six areas including U.S. laundry
products are now helping PG boost market share, Moeller said.
PG will cut prices by $400 million, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity costs will increase modestly next year,
executives said on the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter sales fell 1.2 percent to $20.21 billion,
trailing the $20.25 billion average of analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives on the conference call said they expected the
company to return to long-term growth rates by fiscal year 2014,
helped by a strengthening U.S. business. Dibadj called the
projection &#8220;bullish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald said he was working to make the company&#8217;s culture
more productive and accountable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m very encouraged by the leadership team we have in
place now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just wish I had done it three years
ago. I think we&#8217;ve got the right team.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ackman, who said his PG stake is his largest initial
investment ever, this year won an effort to remove Canadian
Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) CEO Fred Green and replace him with Hunter Harrison. Ackman also pushed Fortune Brands Inc. to break up,
and the company last year split into spirits maker Beam Inc. (BEAM) and
a company that sells home products such as faucets and locks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) turned to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) on Aug. 1 to buy the firm out of
trading positions acquired by mistake when a computer program
malfunctioned, a person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight has until the close of business on Aug. 6 to
complete the transaction with Goldman Sachs, said the person,
who asked for anonymity because the deal hasn&#8217;t been made
public. David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said he couldn&#8217;t comment. Kara Fitzsimmons, a spokeswoman
for Knight, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight said yesterday it had &#8220;traded out of its entire
erroneous trade position, which has resulted in a realized pre-
tax loss of approximately $440 million&#8221; and severely hurt its
capital. The Jersey City, New Jersey-based firm has opened its
books to potential investors or buyers, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank, made the most
revenue from equities trading of any Wall Street bank in the
first half of 2012, according to company reports. Goldman Sachs
is also the biggest owner of Knight&#8217;s $375 million of 3.5
percent convertible bonds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Those notes are trading about 80 percent of face
value, according to prices reported by Trace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it&#8217;s
closing a bearish wager on wheat prices because of worsening
weather conditions for crops in the former Soviet Union,
Australia, India and Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been short wheat for delivery in May 2013
versus corn on the Chicago Board of Trade, New York-based
analyst Damien Courvalin said today in an e-mailed report. The
price difference closed at about 72 cents a bushel yesterday,
allowing for a gain of almost 50 cents a bushel after the bank
entered its bearish wager when the spread was at $1.21,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat production in the former Soviet Union, Australia,
India and Argentina may be 15 million metric tons below the U.S.
Department of Agriculture&#8217;s forecast in July because of dry
weather, creating &#8220;growing upside risks to wheat prices in
coming months,&#8221; Courvalin said. The USDA is slated to update
its global crop estimates Aug. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, global wheat inventories are likely to remain more
ample than corn, meaning wheat may underperform in the next 12
months, Courvalin said. Both grains are used in livestock feed.
Corn prices have surged 59 percent since mid-June as the worst
drought since 1956 damaged crops in the U.S., while wheat rose
41 percent and soybeans rallied 24 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said it&#8217;s bullish soybeans for November delivery
versus a bearish wager for December corn, as soybeans are likely
&#8220;to reverse part of their recent underperformance to corn,&#8221;
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about having back
surgery if you&#8217;re an Olympic athlete, says U.S. water polo
player Peter Hudnut, is it gives you time to be an intern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of 11 members of the American squad returning to the

graduate before the 2004 Games in Athens. While surgery and
months of rehabilitation hampered his athletic career, they gave
him time to get work experience, Hudnut said in an interview at
London&#8217;s Athletes Village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was somewhat lucky in that I had so many injuries and
every time I had a surgery it would put me out for a handful of
months,&#8221; the 6-foot-5 central defender said. &#8220;I was lucky
enough to get some internships -- some through friends, some on
my own -- and that helped guide me where I wanted to go.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positions at CIM Group, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and
Los Angeles developer Ratkovich Co., as well as his 2011
Stanford business degree, awakened an interest in finance, he
said. Twenty-eight interviews with Goldman left him feeling he&#8217;d
found a firm where he could both learn and use the skills
gleaned from years of strenuous training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Desire, Discipline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Desire, discipline and all the things I&#8217;ve used in water
polo are very applicable to finance,&#8221; Hudnut said. &#8220;The focus
and drive, the ability to communicate effectively with many
different personality types and many different situations, the
ability to adapt and be flexible; these are all traits that team
sport, especially at this level, demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. squad water polo team trained in Thousand Oaks,
California, for almost a year, giving up professional positions
on teams overseas, Hudnut said. The team spent between five and
seven hours in meetings, five days a week. They watched video,
lifted weights and practiced in the pool. The daily sessions
averaged seven to eight hour as the Olympics neared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Peter in Beijing was a really important part of the glue
that kept the team together,&#8221; coach Terry Schroeder said in an
interview after the U.S. beat Britain 13-7 on Aug. 2. &#8220;As he
plays a bit more and feels comfortable with his playing, he&#8217;s
taken on that role more and more again and it&#8217;s really important
to the team.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary round finishes today with the U.S. playing
Hungary, the 2008 champions. The Americans have won three of
their four early stage matches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Dreams &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudnut was introduced to water polo as a 10-year-old by
Richard Corso, the assistant coach of the 1984 U.S. team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was this huge uncoordinated kid and he came and handed
me this baby blue bag and on one side it had the Olympic rings
and on the other side it said USA,&#8221; Hudnut said, adding that he
could barely swim at the time. &#8220;Inside was a water polo ball, a
little suit and a water polo hat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 6 feet tall (1.82 meters) at 12, Hudnut began
playing against boys two and three years older than himself. In
1992, Corso became the head coach for the U.S. national team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He would drive me down with him to national team
practice, so I would watch the guys and talk to some of the
heroes of that time about what Olympics meant to them,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;That really lit that fire.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better Than Beijing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranked ninth in the run-up to the Beijing Games, the U.S.
beat Serbia in the semifinals before losing 14-10 in the gold
medal match against Hungary. It was America&#8217;s first medal in
water polo in 20 years. The 2012 squad is more tightly knit and
tactically and physically equal to the best teams, Hudnut said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I truly believe that this is the first time in a number
of Olympics that any of the top seven teams could potentially
win,&#8221; he said, adding that playing in professional leagues in
Europe has boosted the ability of both American and Australian
players. The U.S. last won a gold medal in water polo in 1904. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning silvers in men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s water polo in Beijing
was the first time a country walked away with two medals in the
event at a single Olympics, Bill Smith, USA Water Polo secretary
and finance committee chairman and the president of Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Renaissance Capital LLC, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether he wins a second medal, Hudnut is looking forward
to the next stage of his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know it&#8217;s going to be a tough year and that&#8217;s one of
the things that inspires me,&#8221; Hudnut said. &#8220;From a challenge
perspective, my desire to succeed and do well gets me up in the
morning. I hope that Goldman is a true career path for me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
