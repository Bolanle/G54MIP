<p>In the hands of England''s
government-run health system, Hinchingbrooke Hospital was called
a basket case in Parliament. Ali Parsa wants to show that
private enterprise can do a better job than the state in
providing medical care. </p>
<p>Parsa, an ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, wants to
change how U.K. hospitals are run, right down to the meals
served to patients. He''s chief executive officer of Circle
Holdings Plc (CIRC), which in February became the first for-profit firm
to take over a National Health Service hospital when it began
managing Hinchingbrooke in Huntingdon, England. Circle last
month raised 46 million pounds ($72.3 million) in part to help
the company pursue contracts to manage more NHS sites. </p>
<p>People told us you can never run a hospital a different
way; you can never change the way NHS staff work, Parsa, 47,
says in an interview at the company''s London headquarters. We
have fundamentally changed them. </p>
<p>As the U.S. debates what role government should have in
health care, the U.K. is slowly putting some pieces of its 64-
year-old state-run health system into private hands to try to
improve patient care and reduce costs. Prime Minister David
Cameron says more choice and competition are needed to improve
the NHS. Instilling a profit motive in a government-owned
hospital means patient needs won''t come first, said Allyson
Pollock, a researcher at Queen Mary, University of London who
opposes privatization. </p>
<p>It''s immoral, it''s obscene, she said in an interview.
It''s a system that''s going to be built on greed, not need.
It''s the antithesis of everything that we worked for for 64
years. </p>
<h2>Emergency-Room Waits </h2>
<p>From a medical point of view, Parsa appears to be doing
something right. Emergency-room waits at Hinchingbrooke, 70
miles north of London, have improved from the county''s worst to
its best and lengths of stay for people getting non-urgent
orthopedic care have dropped 38 percent, freeing up beds. The
company says serious incidents, such as medication errors or
patient falls, fell by 80 percent in May. Circle also will save
1.5 million pounds on purchasing this year. </p>
<p>Circle''s bid for the 10-year contract to run Hinchingbrooke
beat 18 others. The company gets the first 2 million pounds of
profit from any surplus, and a percentage above that amount,
which the union that represents hospital workers has said will
benefit the company and its shareholders at patients'' expense.
Circle must also fund the first 5 million pounds of any loss, a
risk at a hospital that already has 40 million pounds of debt. </p>
<h2>Patient Perks </h2>
<p>Circle isn''t new to the NHS. Its two-year-old private
hospital near Bath serves as many NHS patients as private
patients -- at NHS prices. Circle has run the U.K.''s largest
treatment center in Nottingham since 2008. The company plans to
open another private hospital in Reading in August or September
and has sites for more clinics. </p>
<p>Parsa says it''s possible not only to provide quality care
and a pleasant patient experience for rich and poor patients
alike, but to make money in the process. At the core of the
business strategy is increased efficiency, primarily through
shorter hospital stays. Patient perks, like inexpensive parking
and food prepared by a chef from a Michelin-starred eatery,
ensure that hospital beds stay full with more rapid turnover. </p>
<p>In Bath, Circle hired a hotel manager and chef from nearby
Lucknam Park Hotel  Spa, a five-star country house hotel.
People from the local village of Peasedown celebrate their
birthdays in the hospital cafe, says Shelagh Meldrum, the
hospital manager. No wonder: A recent lunch served to patients
consisted of scallops and crab salad over dill and cucumber,
followed by a gently grilled salmon main course and lemon posset
for dessert. </p>
<h2>Stock Performance </h2>
<p>Taxi driver Dave McGlennon had a cyst removed from a finger
last year at the hospital. A high point: the food. I had a ham
and cheese omelette with potato wedges after surgery,
McGlennon says. It was to die for. </p>
<p>Financially, Circle has yet to succeed. The company had
revenue of 75 million pounds last year and has lost money every
year since it was founded in 2004. Circle''s stock has plunged 51
percent to 75 pence since its June 2011 initial public offering,
giving the company a market value of 98 million pounds. </p>
<p>The publicly traded company owns 50.1 percent of a
partnership that operates the hospitals and clinics. Parsa and
institutional investors Lansdowne Partners, BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Odey
Asset Management and Invesco Perpetual are among the
shareholders. Employees, including doctors, own the other 49.9
percent. </p>
<h2>Taxpayer Funded </h2>
<p>Circle''s approach to running a hospital is a radical
departure for the NHS. The government created the agency in
1948, bringing hospitals, doctors and other health-care
providers into one taxpayer-funded medical system for all. The
network now includes 257 general acute-care hospitals like
Hinchingbrooke. About 1.7 million people work for the NHS, which
provides free care for the U.K.''s 62 million residents. </p>
<p>A network of three NHS hospitals in South London is holding
talks with the Department of Health about being put under the
control of administrators because it has racked up more debt
than it can pay. The department said June 25 that more than 60
other hospitals may be financially unsustainable and require
restructuring. </p>
<p>The NHS budget at its inception was 437 million pounds, or
9 billion pounds at today''s value, according to the department.
In the current fiscal year, the system will spend 106 billion
pounds. The government has approved an NHS overhaul with a goal
of saving 15 billion to 20 billion pounds on the annual budget
in the four years to 2014-15. </p>
<h2>Partial Strike </h2>
<p>The overhaul prompted the British Medical Association,
which represents two-thirds of practicing doctors, to declare a
partial strike for June 21, its first work stoppage since 1975. </p>
<p>I think the public looks at the U.S. health system and
doesn''t want to see big encroachment of the private sector in
the British health system, said Diane Abbott, a member of
Parliament who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on health
matters. </p>
<p>Defending the Circle deal for Hinchingbrooke in Parliament
last year, the Department of Health''s undersecretary of state,
Frederick Curzon, said: This is a hospital that in common
parlance could be described as a financial and clinical basket
case. </p>
<p>Circle''s bells-and-whistles approach may be a hit with
patients like McGlennon. Skeptics say the company won''t be
judged on its cuisine as much as on the quality of its care. </p>
<h2>Clinical Results'' </h2>
<p>I don''t personally go to a hospital based on Michelin-
starred food; I go to a hospital for clinical results, says
Andrew Hine, a partner at consulting firm KPMG in London and a
former NHS hospital executive. </p>
<p>At Circle''s Nottingham facility, Parsa says patients are
eight times less likely to have to return to the operating room
within four weeks. In 2010-11, the facility had no resistant
Staphylococcus aureus or health-care acquired Clostridium
difficile cases. On the financial side, Parsa said the center
has made an 18 percent annual compound productivity gain. </p>
<p>He says other U.K. hospitals can benefit from Circle''s
approach. If we can deliver what we deliver at NHS prices, why
can''t everybody else? </p>

<p>Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the private-
jet maker owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Onex Corp. (OCX),
filed a plan to reorganize that would give control of the
company to secured creditors. </p>
<p>Holders of secured debt valued at $921.6 million would get
81 percent of the new common stock in the reorganized company,
according to the plan filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan June 30. Estimated recoveries for unsecured creditors
and holders of subordinated notes weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Other interests in the company would be canceled, Hawker
said, leaving nothing for existing shareholders, including funds
affiliated with New York-based Goldman Sachs and Onex. Each
owned 49 percent of Hawker stock. Former managers and directors
held the remainder, according to court papers. </p>
<p>The company, based in Wichita, Kansas, indicated it would
borrow an unspecified amount to exit court protection and repay
a $400 million loan that financed operations while in
bankruptcy. </p>
<p>With a sustainable capital structure aligned with the
debtors'' revised business plan and adequate operating liquidity,
the reorganized debtors will be positioned to compete more
effectively, Hawker said in court papers. </p>
<h2>Debt Reduced </h2>
<p>From the outset of its Chapter 11 case on May 3, the
majority of Hawker''s noteholders had agreed to a rough plan that
would reduce its $2.6 billion in debt. The company''s initial
proposal drew support from more than two-thirds of its lenders
and senior bond debt holders. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank''s private-equity arm, and Toronto-based Onex bought Hawker
in 2007 for $3.3 billion. Hawker reported net losses totaling
more than $900 million in the past two years as U.S. military
contracts and plane sales declined. </p>
<p>Hawker''s aircraft include the Hawker 4000 business jet and
the Beechcraft King Air propjet. Sales last year fell
13 percent from a year earlier to $2.4 billion. </p>
<p>Affiliates of GS Capital Partners VI LP and Onex Partners
II LP own about $159.4 million of Hawker notes, according to an
April filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>The case is In re Hawker Beechcraft Inc., 12-11873, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s non-operating Quigley
Co. unit filed a new plan to exit bankruptcy that bars all
asbestos claims against the two companies, except some made
against Pfizer under Pennsylvania law. </p>
<p>Quigley, in bankruptcy since 2004, filed the sixth version
of its plan June 29. The new plan addresses an April appeals
court ruling on how Pfizer can use Quigley''s bankruptcy to
protect itself from asbestos claims. The court found that law
firm Peter G. Angelos PC can sue Pfizer based on manufacturer
liability under Pennsylvania law. </p>
<p>The new plan''s exception for claims under Pennsylvania law
would be null and void if the Second Circuit''s decision is
modified upon rehearing or on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court,
Quigley said in the plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. The company will seek plan approval from U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein at a hearing set for Aug. 15. </p>
<p>The plan builds on a fifth version, under which New York-
based Pfizer increased contributions to a proposed trust into
which all future asbestos lawsuits against the two companies
would be channeled. Such channeling injunctions allow
companies with ongoing liabilities to exit bankruptcy. </p>
<p>We are pleased that the Quigley bankruptcy proceeding is
moving forward, Pfizer spokesman Christopher Loder said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>Stopped Operations </h2>
<p>Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968. The unit stopped most operations
in 1992 and filed for bankruptcy in 2004. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, has said it never
made or sold any Quigley products. Some claimants haven''t
released Pfizer from alleged derivative liability, according
to the company. </p>
<p>Under the sixth amended plan, Pfizer will contribute $260
million in cash to a trust that will pay most future asbestos
claims brought against it and Quigley. Pfizer will also forgive
a secured claim of $95 million against Quigley, a loan of $19
million to Quigley, and an unsecured claim of $33 million. It
will also contribute insurance benefits that cover asbestos
personal injury claims. </p>
<p>Pfizer will also contribute a property leased to a
distributor of Anheuser-Busch in Orange County, California, to
pay future asbestos claims. The property has an estimated value
of $43.6 million and produced cash flow of $1.9 million in the
first 12 months since Pfizer acquired it, according to court
papers. </p>
<h2>Appealed Ruling </h2>
<p>The April ruling from an appeals court had come after
Pfizer had appealed a ruling that found the bankruptcy didn''t
bar certain lawsuits against the drug company. </p>
<p>Angelos began bringing lawsuits against Pfizer in 1999,
saying that because the drug company''s logo appeared on Quigley
products, it should have liability for the asbestos-containing
products. </p>
<p>During Quigley''s bankruptcy, Bernstein has said that Pfizer
manipulated the bankruptcy process, and refused to allow Quigley
to exit Chapter 11 court protection under a deal with Pfizer.
The company has also been at odds with a committee of creditors
known as the Ad Hoc Committee of Tort Victims, which asked
in October 2010 to have Quigley''s bankruptcy dismissed so it
could bring tort claims, which are otherwise blocked by
bankruptcy law. </p>
<h2>Can''t Sue </h2>
<p>The U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department, had
asked the bankruptcy court to end Quigley''s Chapter 11, citing
the fact that creditors alleging asbestos-related health issues
have been unable to sue New York-based Pfizer during the case,
and many of them have died. </p>
<p>Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. In November, Pfizer reported a $701
million third-quarter charge for asbestos litigation related to
Quigley. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan). </p>

<p>A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) exchange-
traded note tied to oil assets reached a record premium over its
underlying index after the bank limited shares of the security. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ), under the ticker AMJ,
closed 2.7 percent above its underlying index on June 29, the
highest level since its inception in April 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based bank''s ETN, the
largest in the U.S. at $5 billion in market capitalization,
traded at a 5.3 percent premium at 1:48 p.m. in New York, before
retreating to 2.5 percent at 3:50 p.m. </p>
<p>JPMorgan limited share creation to 129 million on June 14,
a threshold reached six days later, raising concern that the
note could become unhinged from its linked index, as occurred in
March with an ETN (TVIX) issued by Credit Suisse AG. The AMJ note,
which tracks partnerships that don''t pay federal income taxes
and rely on assets such as oil pipelines to generate cash flow,
has added 35 million shares this year, an increase of 37
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Everyone expected AMJ to trade at a premium once the cap
was announced because investors are scrambling for yield, said
Samuel Lee, an exchange-traded product analyst for Morningstar
Inc. in Chicago. I don''t expect to see crazy, TVIX-level
premiums in this product because that premium becomes too
attractive and people will start to short AMJ, he said,
referring to the ticker of Credit Suisse''s volatility note. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Alerian MLP-linked security was the fourth-most traded
U.S. ETN on June 29, at 2,717,800 shares, compared with less
than a third that volume on the day before the announcement that
its size would be restricted. </p>
<h2>TVIX Premium </h2>
<p>On Feb. 21, Zurich-based Credit Suisse stopped issuing
shares of an ETN tied to the VIX, as the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index is called. A month later, the TVIX
note began diverging from its underlying index to trade at a
premium of as much as 89 percent. Over two days in March, it
lost more than 50 percent of its value, and the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission is probing price gyrations in the
security, a person familiar with the matter said in March. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan ETN, which has a total return of 10 percent
for the last year, makes up more than a quarter of the ETN
market. It tracks a gauge of 50 publicly traded master limited
partnerships and matches dividends from the Alerian MLP Index
minus a 0.85 percent management fee, according to a prospectus
filed with the SEC. The partnerships typically invest in assets
ranging from pipelines to ships transporting commodities. </p>
<p>Investors who want to bet on master limited partnerships
can choose from at least nine other exchange-traded products.
UBS AG and Credit Suisse offer ETNs, and ALPS Advisors Inc.
sells the largest exchange-traded fund tied to an MLP index. </p>
<p>ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer''s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of ETNs based on the level of demand
for the securities. That demand typically doesn''t affect the
price since the ETNs track the performance of an index. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is tightening
its grip on the global corporate bond market while Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) sees its market share decline with issuance on
pace to exceed $3 trillion for a fourth straight year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the most profitable U.S. bank, underwrote 6.8
percent of sales, excluding self-led deals, in the first half of
2012, up from 6.4 percent in all of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America dropped to third, with 5.2 percent from 6.1 percent. </p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan''s chief executive officer, is
benefiting from debt underwriting as offerings approach $2
trillion, including a record $1.19 trillion in the first three
months of the year. The New York-based lender is the top choice
of companies even as it suffers more than $2 billion of losses
from derivatives tied to corporate credit markets. </p>
<p>They have an advantage in the marketplace and they''re
taking advantage of it, Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale
Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida, who recommends the firm''s
stock, said in a telephone interview. They have the ability,
given their incredible capital strength, to attract customers
presumably because their cost of capital is lower, which they
can pass on to clients, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has underwritten $110.9 billion of corporate bonds
this year, versus $94.5 billion at New York-based Citigroup
Inc. (C), which ranks second with a 5.8 percent share, the data
show. Citigroup came in fourth in 2011, with a 5.7 percent
share. </p>
<h2>Difficult Markets'' </h2>
<p>Issuance for the full year in the U.S. and Europe will
probably trail 2011, as Europe''s debt crisis threatens global
markets, according to Barclays Plc (BARC) strategists. </p>
<p>JPMorgan tends to do better in more difficult markets,
Jim Casey, co-head of global debt capital markets at the bank in
New York, said in a telephone interview. When the going gets
tough, some of the smaller players arguably will reduce their
capital allocation, whereas we tend not to do that. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate bonds from default in the U.S. declined for a second
day, with the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index,
which investors use to hedge against losses or to speculate on
creditworthiness, decreasing 1.7 basis points to a mid-price of
110.6 basis points as of 11:55 a.m. in New York, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>That''s the lowest level on an intra-day basis since May 14
for the index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. </p>
<h2>Citigroup Bonds </h2>
<p>The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
bond market stress, rose 1.66 basis points to 26.16 basis points
as of 11:58 a.m. in New York. The gauge widens when investors
seek the perceived safety of government securities and narrows
when they favor assets such as corporate bonds. </p>
<p>Bonds of Citigroup are the most actively traded dollar-
denominated corporate securities by dealers today, with 38
trades of $1 million or more as of 11:57 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Sales of corporate bonds worldwide declined 10.9 percent
last week to $60.1 billion from $67.4 billion in the period
ended June 22, Bloomberg data show. For the first half of the
year, issuance fell to $1.93 trillion from $1.99 trillion in the
corresponding period of 2011, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<h2>Market Share </h2>
<p>JPMorgan managed $42.4 billion of offerings last quarter,
excluding self-led transactions, a 38 percent decline from $68.5
billion in the three months ended March 31, Bloomberg data show.
That compares with a 47 percent drop at Bank of America, which
underwrote $29.3 billion in the April-through-June period. </p>
<p>One of the ways you can grow is by taking share from
others, and the investment bank is probably a place where
JPMorgan is doing this, Shannon Stemm, an analyst with Edward
Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said in a telephone interview. We''re
by no means in a strong capital markets environment, but to the
extent that the economy continues to recover, this segment is a
revenue generator, so I think there''s a lot of push to grow. </p>
<p>John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman at Bank of America, and
Mark Costiglio of Citigroup declined to comment on underwriting
market share. </p>
<p>Investors are pressing leaders in the 17-nation euro region
to contain a sovereign-debt crisis that''s threatening a
contagion across the financial system such as the one that
followed the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. </p>
<h2>Forecast Lowered </h2>
<p>Following a summit last week in Brussels, policy makers
dropped requirements that taxpayers get preferred-creditor
status on aid to Spain''s banks, opening the way to recapitalize
lenders directly. Euro chiefs said they''re determined to break
the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns that began in
Greece in 2009. </p>
<p>While sales of dollar-denominated company debt declined 42
percent in the second quarter from the three months ended in
March, euro issuance dropped 54 percent as the region''s
faltering economy dissuaded borrowers from tapping debt markets.
The European Central Bank has forecast a 0.1 percent contraction
in the euro-area economy for 2012. </p>
<p>Citigroup strategists led by Jason Shoup revised their
issuance estimate for investment-grade debt to $827 billion in
2012, including $462 billion from non-financial companies,
according to a June 29 report. That''s down from a January
estimate of $855 billion with $490 billion from non-financials. </p>
<h2>London Whale </h2>
<p>For some credits, it''s currently easier to do a deal in
the U.S. than in Europe, said Chris Whitman, head of global
risk syndicate at Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), which ranks fourth in global
underwriting with a 5.2 percent share, down from 5.9 percent in
2011 and coming in third. The U.S. benefits from a bigger and
deeper credit market. </p>
<p>Investors added $57 billion to U.S. fixed-income mutual
funds in the second quarter, compared with $2.3 billion of
outflows from European funds, according EPFR Global data. </p>
<p>The U.S. market has been the most consistently liquid
market, Huw Richards, co-head of investment-grade finance at
JPMorgan in New York, said in a telephone interview. There''s
no doubt that having insight on those investor flows, we''re
definitely able to translate that into international borrowers
coming to market to issue dollar-denominated debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s share has increased even as it faces
Congressional scrutiny after its London chief investment office
built a portfolio of credit derivatives so large it distorted
prices and earned trader Bruno Iksil a nickname: the London
Whale. </p>
<h2>Short-Term Blow'' </h2>
<p>At the start of the year, the group was ordered to reduce
its positions and instead executed a series of trades that left
the bank with even bigger and harder-to-manage exposures, Dimon
told the Senate Banking Committee in Washington last month. </p>
<p>While the losses amount to a short-term blow to their
reputation, it probably won''t be a meaningful problem in the
long run, Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic
Equities LLP who recommends JPMorgan stock, said in a telephone
interview. Looking across the investment banking landscape,
JPMorgan is one of the best placed to pick up market share as
European competitors cut employees, he said. </p>
<p>Rounding out the top 10 underwriters, excluding self-led
deals, are Barclays at No. 5; HSBC Holdings Plc. at No. 6;
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) at No. 7; Morgan Stanley (MS) at No. 8; UBS
AG (UBSN) at No. 9; and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) at No. 10 with a 3.3
percent share. </p>

<p>Jumptap Inc., a mobile advertising
network that competes with Google and Millennial Media, said
today it raised $27.5 million, which will be used to improve its
products and technology ahead of an initial public offering. </p>
<p>It''s the seventh round of funding for the 7-year-old
company, which has raised a total of $121.5 million, according
to Jumptap. The latest round included previous investors General
Catalyst Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Summerhill Venture
Partners, Valhalla Partners and WPP, as well as new investor
Keating Capital, as reported on Bloomberg.com''s Tech Deals blog. </p>
<p>It''s been nearly two years since Chief Executive Officer
George Bell joined Jumptap and started refocusing the company on
targeted mobile advertising, instead of mobile search products.
Out of a staff of about 80, he cut half and then aggressively
hired. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company now has about
150 employees. Revenues last year grew 60 percent, according to

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
expand its new private real estate investment trust to as much
as 300 billion yen ($3.7 billion) to buy Japanese properties as
the Wall Street bank foresees a turnaround in prices. </p>
<p>The bank''s asset management unit will begin the REIT in
August with as much as 30 billion yen including equity and plans
to increase the size to about 300 billion yen in five years,
said Taro Squires, head of real estate investment management at
Goldman Sachs Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs joins Mitsubishi Estate Co., Mitsui Fudosan
Co. and Nomura Real Estate Holdings Inc. (3231) that have set up
private REITs in the past 12 months as four years of price
declines, amid more than a decade of deflation, seem to be
slowing. Office property prices in Tokyo, down about 40 percent
from a 2007 peak, are little changed this year, according to Los
Angeles-based property broker CBRE Group Inc. </p>
<p>We are close to the bottom of the real estate cycle,
said Squires in an interview. I expect the market to bottom
out within the next six to 12 months. </p>
<p>The REIT, which targets a 4 percent to 5 percent dividend
yield, will have a leverage of 50 percent, enabling it to buy as
much as 30 billion yen of real estate at the start, Squires said.
The company has a target to expand the REIT initially to 100
billion yen in two years, he said. </p>
<p>Office buildings will account for more than 60 percent of
the trust, while residential and retail will represent the rest,
he said, adding that a majority of assets will be in Tokyo. </p>
<h2>Different Cycle </h2>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index rose the most in more
than two months, gaining 1.4 percent. That compares to the 0.1
percent drop in the benchmark Topix index. </p>
<p>Japan is in a different cycle compared with other markets
in Asia-Pacific, said Christopher Lee, Hong Kong-based
managing director of corporate ratings for the region at
Standard  Poor''s. The other markets are coming off from a
cyclical top so they are well under way for correction. Japan
has been in correction for some time now, so it''s on its way for
a recovery. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the first non-Japanese company to start a
private REIT, is looking to raise money from financial
institutions and corporate pensions in Japan, Squires said. </p>
<h2>Stable Returns </h2>
<p>Two decades of slumping stocks, one of the world''s lowest
bond yields and an aging population are prompting the nation''s
pensions to expand investments into alternative assets,
including real estate and hedge funds. The 10-year Japanese
government bond yield is 0.8 percent, the second lowest after
Switzerland. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average is less than a quarter
of its 1989 peak. </p>
<p>Private REITs (TSEREIT) own buildings and pay investors dividends
from rental income. They are not traded on exchanges so don''t
have daily price fluctuations that listed REITs have. That
matches the need of pension funds seeking stable income. </p>
<p>What we are trying to target is to provide investors that
were in publicly listed REITs with more stability, to give
investors that were originally in private real estate funds with
more clarity, said Squires. For JGB investors, it still
provides them with yen-denominated return albeit at a higher
level. </p>
<h2>Investment Yield </h2>
<p>The capitalization rate for office buildings that cost more
than $10 million in Japan has declined to 5.57 percent in the
first three months of this year after an average of 5.74 percent
in the past 12 months, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc.,
a New York-based research and consulting company. A drop in the
rate, a measure of investment yield for properties, signals an
increase in prices. </p>
<p>Japan''s $3.36 trillion in pension money is the world''s
second-largest retirement pool after the U.S., according to
Towers Watson  Co. Japan was the only market among 12 that had
a drop in pension assets because of the poor returns on local
stocks and bonds, according to the report. </p>
<p>Japanese pensions have 31 percent of investments in
equities and 59 percent in bonds, with only 6 percent in
alternative assets, according to Towers Watson. That compares
with 25 percent in such assets in the U.S. and 23 percent in
Australia, it said. </p>
<p>J-REITs account for 8.3 trillion yen of Japan''s 23.2
trillion real estate investment market, while private equity
real estate funds represent the rest, according to STB Research
Institute Co. The size of Japan''s private REIT market is less
than $2 billion, said Squires. </p>
<p>Private REIT is really the one product that has been
missing in the market, he said. It''s still a very young
industry. We expect the market to grow. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s refusal to
turn over e-mails in a federal probe of potential energy-market
manipulation is the latest challenge for Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon as the bank faces multiple investigations. </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sued JPMorgan
July 2 to release 25 e-mails in an investigation of possible
manipulation of power markets in California and the Midwest by
J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., according to court filings by
the Washington-based agency. FERC opened the probe in August
after complaints from California and Midwest grid operators that
JPMorgan''s bidding practices were abusive, the documents show. </p>
<p>He''s got a PR nightmare in front of him, said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. It''s another headline risk, which means more
regulators, which means over-regulation, which will eventually
hit their bottom line. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. bank is struggling to maintain its image
as risk-averse and well-managed after reporting a $2 billion
loss in a London unit that Dimon said violated common sense.
Dimon, 56, has said that the loss may grow to $3 billion or
more. Analysts including Charles Peabody at Portales Partners
LLC in New York estimate it at about $5 billion. </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Justice
Department are among agencies investigating the cause of the
loss as well as the company''s public disclosures. </p>
<h2>Libor Probe </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. may get
stung also by an international investigation into an attempt by
banks in the U.K. and U.S. to rig the London interbank offered
rate, called Libor. London-based Barclays (BARC) Plc was fined 290
million pounds ($455 million) and its top three executives,
including CEO Robert Diamond, said they would step down. </p>
<p>There is a heightened possibility of scrutiny after
recent events at Barclays, Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd.
in New York, wrote in a July 2 research note. The banks face
risks of fines, lawsuits, negative news and new regulations,
according to Mayo''s note. </p>
<p>JPMorgan keeps having these little blowups, said Paul
Miller. It just sounds like a culture that''s supposed to be
very tight and risk-managed is not being well run. </p>
<p>FERC, which has pledged to combat manipulation of prices,
said JPMorgan''s bidding techniques in California and the Midwest
resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments. It
accused the bank of improperly using attorney-client privilege
to withhold or redact 53 e-mails subpoenaed in April. </p>
<h2>E-Mails Released </h2>
<p>The company has since released 28 of the e-mails, including
a March 14, 2011, exchange between commodities head Blythe Masters and her chief of principal investments, Francis Dunleavy, regarding an update on the California Independent
System Operator Inc., one of the complainants in the case. </p>
<p>So in your opinion we are better off with me trying to
decide this without your help? Masters asked. </p>
<p>After Dunleavy asked to speak directly to Masters, who
wasn''t available, he said, I will handle it but it may not be
pretty. </p>
<p>FERC said in its complaint there is no conceivable
argument that any of this is privileged. </p>
<p>FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in March that the agency
will be vigorous in seeking to stop companies from manipulating
electricity markets, after the agency reached a record $245
million settlement with Constellation Energy Group Inc. for
trading practices in New York and New England. </p>
<h2>Alleged Violations </h2>
<p>FERC has issued 15 notices of alleged violations since
January 2011 for companies including Barclays, BP Plc (BP/), Deutsche
Bank AG and Constellation, according to information posted on
the agency''s website. Seven of the cases have been settled, FERC
said. </p>
<p>We have been responding to a FERC investigation into
certain activities in our federally approved power business,
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
We believe we have complied in all respects with the law, as
well as FERC rules and applicable tariffs. She declined to
discuss the bank''s image. </p>
<p>The regulator is examining efforts by Houston-based J.P.
Morgan Ventures to extract excessive payments or above-market
prices from California ISO and Midwest Independent Transmission
System Operator Inc., Thomas Olson, a lawyer in the FERC
investigating division, said in a court document. The probe
focuses on winning inflated make-whole payments, he said. </p>
<h2>Improper Payments </h2>
<p>Any such improper payments to generators are ultimately
borne by the households, businesses and government entities that
are the end-consumers of electricity, Olson said. </p>
<p>The California and Midwest grid operators solicit bids from
electricity suppliers each day to meet expected demand.
Typically, 90 percent or more power consumed is secured in what
is known as the day-ahead market. Any supply shortfalls because
of weather or unexpected plant shutdowns are met through bids
placed in real-time. </p>
<p>Anytime you have allegations like this, it''s
noteworthy, said Paul Patterson, a New York-based analyst at
Glenrock Associates LLC. Given the vital nature of
electricity, its inability to be stored and limitations for
transmission, the ability for players to influence prices is a
substantial concern to regulators. </p>
<p>JPMorgan fell 1.1 percent to $35.88 yesterday in New York,
the fifth-worst performing stock among 30 companies in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. </p>
<p>The Financial Times reported the FERC investigation earlier
on its website. </p>
<p>The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12mc352, U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) cut its forecasts for
the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars, citing what it
called an increasingly challenging global economic environment
for the commodity-exporting countries. </p>
<p>The Aussie will depreciate to 95 U.S. cents by year-end,
compared with the previous projection of 99 cents, New York-
based Morgan Stanley said in a note today. New Zealand''s dollar
will finish the year at 75 U.S. cents, compared with the earlier
forecast of 80 cents. The Canadian dollar will weaken to C$1.06
against its U.S. counterpart, versus the previous forecast of
C$1.03, the firm said. </p>
<p>Weakening global growth indicators are affecting commodity
currencies, according to the note from Ian Stannard, head of
European currency strategy at the firm in London. Purchasing-
manager indexes for manufacturing in many Group of 10 nations
have dropped below their lows of late last year, he wrote, and
central banks are being more cautious. </p>
<p>Declining growth indicators and a muted policy response
are likely to leave the high-beta currencies in a vulnerable
position, the Morgan Stanley strategist wrote. Beta measures
risk relative to a market. </p>
<p>The Australian currency traded today at $1.0286 in New
York, while New Zealand''s dollar was at 80.48 U.S. cents and the
Canadian dollar at C$1.0131 to the greenback. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank will cut its benchmark interest
rate a quarter-percentage point to 0.75 percent at its meeting
on July 5, according to economists in a Bloomberg News survey. </p>
<p>The central-bank meeting isn''t going to be enough to lift
global risk appetite, Stannard said in a telephone interview.
We''re going to get monetary easing that is aimed more at
responding to a more traditional growth slowdown rather than
trying to boost risk appetite. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered by a
federal judge to explain why it shouldn''t be compelled to turn
over e-mails sought by U.S. regulators in a probe of potential
energy-market manipulation. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington
today gave JPMorgan until the end of the day on July 13 to
respond. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sued
JPMorgan on July 2 to release 25 e-mails in an investigation of
possible manipulation of power markets in California and the
Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. </p>
<p>JPMorgan shall address why it should not be required to
produce the 25 at-issue e-mails in unredacted form or to submit
them to the court for in camera review, Kollar-Kotelly said in
the three-page order. JPMorgan must present declarations or
other competent evidence to support each of the essential
elements of any claimed privilege. </p>
<p>FERC opened the probe in August after complaints from
California and Midwest grid operators that JPMorgan''s bidding
practices were abusive, according to the agency''s initial court
filing. </p>
<p>We believe we have complied in all respects with the law,
as well as FERC rules and applicable tariffs, governing this
market, Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail. We stress that this investigation is ongoing and
that no conclusions have been reached or findings adjudicated. </p>
<h2>Court''s Assistance'' </h2>
<p>She said we welcome the court''s assistance in resolving
this dispute over documents. </p>
<p>FERC, which has pledged to combat manipulation of prices,

resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments. It

<p>In today''s order, the judge said the parties should meet
and file a brief on July 10 advising whether they would consent
to having the case handled by a magistrate judge with any
appeals taken directly to the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington. She said such an arrangement might result in a

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has begun
disclosing its own valuations for structured notes in offering
prospectuses, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
recommended that banks include such an estimate. </p>
<p>The U.S. regulator advised banks to add fair value
disclosures in a letter to lenders it didn''t identify that was
posted on its website April 13. </p>
<p>We believe issuers should consider prominently disclosing
the difference between the public offering price of the note
and the fair value estimated by the issuer or its affiliate, the
SEC said in its April letter. </p>
<p>In a May 15 offering from Goldman Sachs of Absolute
Return Knock-Out Notes, the bank wrote that the securities are
equal to approximately $960 per $1,000 note issued. A
similar May 4 deal lacked such details, instead using language
that the price received for the notes may be significantly
less than the original issue price, according to prospectuses
filed with the SEC. </p>
<p>The bank''s earliest use of valuation estimates was in mid-
May, according to a search of SEC records online. </p>
<p>Tiffany Galvin, a New York-based spokeswoman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The U.S. structured-note industry has come under scrutiny
from regulators for the securities'' complexity and lack of
transparency. Banks sold $45.9 billion of SEC-registered
securities in 2011, down from a record $49.5 billion a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The SEC, which requested a written reply to its letter
within 10 days, also asked the issuers to explain how they set
up a secondary market for the notes, how they use the proceeds
raised from sales and how important the business is to their
funding needs. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. (BLK) closed European money market funds
to new investments after the European Central Bank lowered
deposit rates to zero. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the world''s biggest provider of money-market
funds, won''t accept new cash in five euro-denominated money-
market and liquidity funds because the rate cut may result in
losses for investors, the company said in a notice to
shareholders. Goldman Sachs won''t accept new money in its GS
Euro Government Liquid Reserves Fund, and BlackRock, the world''s
largest asset manager, is restricting deposits in two European
funds. </p>
<p>The European market environment is in unchartered
territory with such historically low -- or even negative --
yields for high-quality issuance, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a memo
to fund shareholders, citing the ECB''s rate cut. It is not
currently feasible for our portfolio managers to deploy capital
without substantially diluting the yield for the existing base
of shareholders. </p>
<p>The ECB yesterday reduced its benchmark rate to a record
low of 0.75 percent and took its deposit rate to zero. Money
funds have been struggling to invest client assets at a profit
as interest rates globally are near record lows and Europe''s
sovereign debt crisis has reduced the supply of available debt.
Managers have been forced to cut fees to keep customer returns
above zero, and some have abandoned the business. </p>
<p>All three firms said the restrictions are temporary and
they will monitor market conditions. Investor redemptions from
the funds are not being limited. </p>
<h2>Negative Territory'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s five closed funds had 23.7 billion euros ($29.2
billion) in assets as of July 5, the bank said in an e-mail,
about 22 percent of all euro-denominated money funds. The funds
are JPMorgan''s Euro Liquidity Fund (JPMEULC), Euro Government Liquidity
Fund, Euro Money Market Fund, Euro Liquid Market Fund and
JPMorgan Series II Funds -- EUR. </p>
<p>The deposit rate cut will almost certainly move cash bids
in short-dated instruments into negative territory, and so we
have taken the step to restrict subscriptions and switches into
the funds in order to protect existing shareholders from yield
dilution, JPMorgan said on its website. </p>
<p>The company had $417 billion in money fund assets as of May
31, making it the world leader, according to Crane Data LLC, a
research firm based in Westborough, Massachusetts. The entire
euro-denominated money fund industry has about 108 billion
euros, Crane Data''s statistics show. </p>
<h2>BlackRock''s Funds </h2>
<p>No other global liquidity funds are at risk of being
closed, but we will not hesitate to restrict investments if we
feel the market environment warrants such action in order to
protect the interests of existing shareholders, JPMorgan said
on its website. </p>
<p>BlackRock is restricting subscriptions into two funds in
its Institutional Cash Series, the Institutional Euro Liquidity
Fund and the Institutional Euro Government Liquidity Fund,
Jessica Greaney, a spokeswoman for the firm, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>We''re continuing to monitor the situation and evaluate
options that are consistent with the best interest of fund
shareholders, Greaney said. </p>
<h2>$2.5 Trillion </h2>
<p>Vanguard Group Inc., the world''s largest mutual-fund firm,
closed two money funds in 2009 and the funds have remained
closed, spokesman John Woerth said in an e-mail. The two funds,
Vanguard Admiral Treasury Money Market Fund and the Vanguard
Federal Money Market Fund, have about $18 billion in assets,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based firm said at the time
of the closing that the action was taken to protect existing
shareholders. Vanguard has $1.8 trillion in U.S. mutual fund
assets. </p>
<p>Fidelity Investments, based in Boston, restricted
investments in four of its money market funds in December 2008.
The funds were reopened in July 2010, spokesman Adam Banker said
in an e-mail. </p>
<p>We took those measures because we believed they were in
the interests of the funds'' shareholders at the time, Banker
wrote. Boston-based Fidelity had $403 billion in money fund
assets of May 31, according to Crane Data. </p>
<p>The $2.5 trillion U.S. money fund industry has been
wrestling with the impact of low interest rates since the
Federal Reserve cut rates to near zero in December 2008. </p>
<p>Industrywide revenue fell from about $12.5 billion in 2008
to $4.7 billion in 2012, according to Crane Data. Yields that
reached 5 percent in 2007 today average about 0.06 percent,
President Peter Crane, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Investors have lost hundreds of billions of dollars of
interest income, Crane said. While industry profits have been
squeezed, very few major players have left the business, Crane
said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley bought one cargo of
North Sea Forties after the blend rose to a three-month high
amid a drop in August shipments. Exports of the crude for next
month will be at the lowest level in at least five years, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed. </p>
<p>BP Plc failed to sell Russian Urals crude in northwest
Europe at a higher price. </p>
<h2>North Sea </h2>
<p>Trafigura Beheer BV sold Forties lot F0717 for July 26 to
July 28 loading at 45 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window. </p>
<p>Hess Energy Trading Co. didn''t manage to sell a consignment
for July 28 to July 30 at 70 cents more than the cash cost of
North Sea crudes for September, compared with a premium of 60
cents for a cargo it sold yesterday, the survey shows. </p>
<p>Total failed to buy a shipment for July 26 to July 30
loading at the 40 cents more than Dated Brent, 5 cents less than
its bid yesterday, according to the survey. </p>
<p>Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 53 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent, the highest since March 16, compared with a premium
of 31 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Brent for August settlement traded at $98.14 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $101.23 yesterday. The September contract was
at $97.80, a discount of 34 cents to August. </p>
<p>The August Forties program comprises 15 cargoes, totaling 9
million barrels, or 290,323 barrels a day, according to the
plan, the least since at least August 2007 when Bloomberg
started compiling such data. This compares with 19 cargoes this
month, or 367,742 barrels a day. </p>
<p>Loadings of Ekofisk for August will be unchanged from July
at 13 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, a plan showed. </p>
<p>Exports of Brent will drop to six 600,000-barrel lots in
August, one less than July, while loadings of Aasgard will be
unchanged from this month at eight cargoes of 855,000 barrels
each, loading programs showed. </p>
<h2>Mediterranean/Urals </h2>
<p>BP failed to sell 100,000 metric tons of Urals for loading
on July 27 to July 31 at 10 cents a barrel to Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey shows. This compares
with a discount of 75 cents for the last trade on June 27. </p>
<p>Urals was at 25 cents more than Dated Brent in northwest
Europe, the highest since Dec. 21, compared with a premium of 10
cents a barrel yesterday, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>No bids or offers were made for the grade in the
Mediterranean. Eni SpA yesterday failed to buy 80,000 tons of
the blend for loading on July 23 to July 27 at 20 cents more
than Dated Brent. </p>
<h2>West Africa </h2>
<p>Qua Iboe fell 2 cents to a premium of $1.23, the lowest
since June 1, 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>

<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a
fan of Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s Minnie Mouse and Beauty and the
Beast. The feeling isn''t mutual. </p>
<p>Kim and a crew of clapping generals watched a performance
on July 6 by a band whose members dressed as Winnie the Pooh,
Tigger, Minnie Mouse and other characters, according to footage
shown on KRT, the country''s state-run television. Women in
strapless gowns and black dresses performed while clips of
movies such as Beauty and the Beast and Dumbo played on
a paneled backdrop for the show in the capital of Pyongyang. </p>
<p>Disney didn''t authorize or license the totalitarian state''s
use of company characters for the concert, Michelle Bergman, a
spokeswoman for the Burbank, California-based company said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Since succeeding his late father Kim Jong Il in December,
Kim further isolated his impoverished country by launching a
long-range rocket in April that squelched a deal for U.S. food
aid. Thought to be under 30, the new leader has worked to
bolster his image through visits to military units and by
rebuking officials over their management of an amusement park. </p>
<p>Kim has ignored U.S. and South Korean appeals to abandon
his country''s nuclear program. His regime is building a new
launchpad in the northwest to fire larger long-range rockets and
has resumed construction of a light-water atomic reactor,
according to the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins
School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. </p>
<h2>Grandiose Plan'' </h2>
<p>The state-run Korean Central News Agency made no mention of
the Disney films or characters, saying only that the concert by
the band, called Moranbong, included the traditional folk tune
Arirang and upbeat foreign songs. </p>
<p>Kim organized the Moranbong band as required by the new
century, prompted by a grandiose plan to bring about a dramatic
turn in the field of literature and arts this year, KCNA said
in its account of the concert. The performers showed well the
indomitable spirit and mental power of the servicepersons and
people of the DPRK dashing ahead for the final victory in the
drive to build a thriving nation under the guidance of Kim Jong
Un. </p>
<p>DPRK refers to the country''s official name, the Democratic
People''s Republic of Korea. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) are marketing about $1.2 billion of bonds tied to
commercial property loans, according to people familiar with the
offering. </p>
<p>The deal is linked to 72 loans on 98 properties across the
U.S., said the person, who asked not to be identified because
terms aren''t set. Several classes of the transaction have been
placed in advance with investors, the people said. The total
mortgage balance is $1.35 billion. </p>
<p>Wall Street banks have arranged about $12 billion of
securities tied to skyscrapers, shopping malls and hotels this
year, compared with $28 billion in all of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. The largest loan in the pool from Morgan Stanley and Bank
of America is a $180 million mortgage on an office tower in
Baltimore, the people said. </p>
<p>Forecasts for 2012 issuance range from Wells Fargo''s $25
billion to Credit Suisse Group AG''s projection of as much as $45
billion. Sales are down from a record $232 billion in 2007. </p>
<p>Dealers have had to offer more generous terms to buyers on
recent offerings. UBS AG and Barclays Plc sold top-ranked
securities maturing in 10 years to yield 160 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate on June 28, compared with 115 basis
points more than swaps on similar newly issued debt sold in
April, Bloomberg data show. Wider spreads can translate to
higher borrowing costs for landlords. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s

<p>The cuts will come primarily from the trading business in
Europe and Asia, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the plans aren''t public. Other units within the firm''s
institutional securities group may be affected, and some
reductions may be made in the U.S., one of the people said. </p>
<p>Deal volume dropped and equity and credit markets fell in
the second quarter on concern that Greece would abandon the euro
and the debt crisis would spread to nations including Spain.
Average daily volume on the London Stock Exchange fell 20
percent from the first quarter, and European merger activity in
the period dropped 29 percent from a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley may earn 5 cents a share this quarter,
excluding accounting adjustments tied to its debt, as it faces
weaker trading volumes and significant client risk aversion,
Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy  Investment
Group Inc., said in a June 26 note. That''s down from 71 cents in
the first quarter. </p>

<p>The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission''s probe of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) demonstrates a
renewed focus on market manipulation as the agency beefs up its
oversight of the multibillion dollar energy-trading business. </p>
<p>The FERC on July 2 sued New York-based JPMorgan to release
e-mails, revealing an investigation of possible gaming of power
markets in California and the Midwest. Since January 2011 the
agency has announced 11 probes of alleged manipulation in
electricity and natural gas markets and a record $245 million
settlement with Constellation Energy Group Inc. </p>
<p>The agency issued in December a preliminary determination
that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) manipulated the California power market.
In April, the FERC issued a notice of alleged violations to
Barclays Plc. (BARC) Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Amanda Williams and
Barclays spokesman Michael O''Looney declined to comment. </p>
<p>I see a fairly steady activity in the enforcement area,
Susan Court, a former director of the FERC''s Office of
Enforcement, said in a telephone interview. There is a theme
here. </p>
<p>In February, the FERC created a division within its
enforcement office to police the markets, where electricity is
bought and sold by power generators and utilities. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it will buy
Perceptive Pixel Inc., a maker of large touch-screen display
monitors that can be used by multiple people at the same time. </p>
<p>Microsoft plans to sell Perceptive Pixel''s large screens,
which can run its latest operating system, Windows 8, the
Redmond, Washington-based software company said at a conference
in Toronto today. Terms of the deal weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Microsoft has a lot riding on the success of Windows 8, due
to be released later this year. Perceptive Pixel''s 82-inch
multi-touch screen, used by customers including news broadcaster
CNN and oil-services provider Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), can respond to
finger movements and a stylus at the same time, helping users
mimic real-world work environments, according to the company''s
website. It will be another vehicle for Windows 8 sales to big
customers such as corporations and schools. </p>
<p>It''s just a very big Windows 8 tablet, but people Ooh
and ah'' at it, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer
said at the conference. Our challenge is to make that
technology more affordable. </p>
<p>The displays currently sell for about $80,000, he said. The
screens can connect to standard corporate computers and already
work with Windows 8; Microsoft demonstrated one running the
program at a conference in February. </p>
<p>Windows 8 will be shipped to manufacturers the first week
in August and go on sale by the end of October, Microsoft said
today. In the coming year, Microsoft expects to sell a few
million units of its Surface tablet, Ballmer said. </p>
<h2>Election Use </h2>
<p>Perceptive Pixel Founder Jeff Han, who demonstrated multi-
touch technology at the TED conference in 2006, will join
Microsoft, with his team becoming part of the company''s Office
division. </p>
<p>The New York-based company gained prominence in 2008 when
cable-news network CNN used one of its displays as a large
interactive U.S. map for presidential election coverage. </p>
<p>Now Han, who says many of his company''s biggest customers
are top-secret defense and government projects, wants to take
the products more mainstream. To do that, he needs Microsoft''s
muscle and better integration with Office programs like the
OneNote note-taking application and Lync conferencing software,
he said in an interview. </p>
<p>Microsoft expects the acquisition to close this summer, and
it will work hard to lower the price of Perceptive Pixel
products, Giovanni Mezgec, a Microsoft general manager, said in
an interview. He declined to give a specific month or say how
much lower the prices may fall. </p>
<p>We want to make this mainstream, he said. We will do
anything possible to get the cost down and to get new forms of
this out in the market places in any way possible. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. say a weaker-than-forecast June jobs gain in the
U.S. will lead the Federal Reserve to keep its benchmark
interest rate at almost zero until the middle of 2015. </p>
<p>The Fed, which has pledged to hold the rate low through at
least late 2014, will amend its so-called forward guidance
before deciding on a new round of bond purchases, according to
the companies. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are two of the
21 primary dealers that trade directly with the central bank. </p>
<p>The late 2014'' formulation has now aged'' by six months
since it was first adopted, but the economy still looks no
better, Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs in
New York, wrote in a report yesterday. The central bank may
announce the change as soon as its next policy meeting July 31
to Aug. 1, Hatzius wrote. </p>
<p>Chairman Ben S. Bernanke faces jobs growth that slowed in
the second quarter to one-third the pace of the prior three
months. The gain in June was 80,000, the Labor Department
reported July 6, versus 100,000 projected by a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. Bernanke hasn''t ruled out more bond
purchases, and he said June 20 that more easing probably will be
needed unless there is sustained improvement in the labor
market. </p>
<h2>Asset Purchases </h2>
<p>The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing, known as QE1 and QE2, from 2008
to 2011 to support the economy. In September it embarked on a
plan to replace $400 billion of short-maturity Treasuries in its
portfolio with longer-term debt to cap long-term borrowing
costs. It expanded the effort, known as Operation Twist, on June
20 by $267 billion and extended it until year-end. </p>
<p>The policy setting Federal Open Market Committee will
probably implement a new round of asset purchases when Operation
Twist ends, according to Hatzius. </p>
<p>Data on retail sales, industrial production and orders for
durable goods will determine when the Fed acts, Michelle Meyer
and Joshua Dennerlein, economists at Bank of America in New
York, wrote in their report July 6. </p>
<p>In our view, the next step is to push out the forward
guidance from late-2014 to mid-2015, followed by further asset
purchases of $500 billion, the economists said. </p>
<h2>Yields Drop </h2>
<p>Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields declined one basis point
today to 1.54 percent as of 7:20 a.m. in London, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They are approaching the all-time
low of 1.44 percent set June 1. The price of the 1.75 percent
security due in May 2022 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 30/32. </p>
<p>The difference between the Fed''s target for overnight bank
lending, known as the funds rate, and five-year yields is
shrinking. The spread has narrowed to 38 basis points from this
year''s high of 94 basis points in March. The gap was 37 basis
points on June 1, the least since 2008. </p>
<p>The difference between the Fed rate and 10-year yields
narrowed to 1.29 percentage points from 2.13 in March. Money
managers usually demand higher rates to invest for longer terms. </p>
<p>Forward guidance brings down bond yields not only via a
lower expected funds rate, but also via a smaller term
premium, Goldman''s Hatzius wrote. </p>
<p>Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies  Co.
in New York, predicts the Fed will announce QE3 at its December
meeting, unless the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe or political
wrangling over the budget deficit in the U.S. curtails growth
and prompts action sooner. Jefferies is another primary dealer. </p>
<p>They''re not even forecasting sustained improvement in the
labor market, so my interpretation of that is that they expect
to do more, McCarthy said. There''s no reason to do it now
that they''ve already put something else in place. </p>

<p>As with shoppers, so with nations:
What they buy reveals what they need and desire. </p>
<p>China''s acquisitions in recent years have included tons of
copper inside a Peruvian mountain, 20 years'' worth of Russian
crude, and vast tracts of fertile land across Africa and South
America. </p>
<p>The pattern of conquest couldn''t be clearer. The Chinese
have embarked on a commodity crusade, becoming the
preeminent buyer of resources ranging from metals to foodstuffs,
as Dambisa Moyo writes in Winner Take All, a book that
investor Jim Rogers calls a must read. </p>
<p>The astonishing thing, judging from this jeremiad, isn''t
that China is locking in supplies. The real curiosity is that
other nations aren''t doing more to stave off potential shortages
of food, energy and water as surging populations and wealth put
unprecedented pressure on Earth''s resources. </p>
<p>With precision, execution and foresight, China is doing
everything to be prepared for that fateful moment, the former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) banker writes. But for the rest,
without focus and concerted efforts many hundreds of millions of
people will face famine, conflict and worse. </p>
<h2>Malthusian Cataclysm </h2>
<p>Moyo, a Zambian-born economist with a doctorate from Oxford
and a master''s from Harvard, is a contrarian by nature. In
Dead Aid, she argued that foreign aid has immiserated
millions of Africans instead of helping them. In How the West
Was Lost, she urged advanced economies to stop squandering
their lead. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s multibillion-
dollar trading loss exposed an industry practice that U.S.
regulators are now likely to clamp down on: Banks keep investors
in the dark about how they calculate trading risks. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing
JPMorgan''s belated May 10 disclosure that a change to its
mathematical model for gauging trading risk helped fuel the loss
in its chief investment office. While the SEC would have to
prove that the biggest U.S. bank improperly kept important
information from investors, regulators probably will press Wall
Street firms to tell more about the risks they''re taking, three
former SEC lawyers said. </p>
<p>The SEC and investors are learning that apparently the
compliance folks and financial folks at very senior levels at
JPMorgan do not think it''s important to share really significant
modeling changes, said Elizabeth Nowicki, a former attorney in
the SEC general counsel''s office who''s now an associate law
professor at Tulane University in New Orleans. </p>
<p>So far, New York-based JPMorgan has added a warning in its
most recent quarterly report that risk models are continually
tweaked to account for improvements in modeling techniques,
and the head of the SEC has publicly asserted that banks should
disclose significant changes and the reasons. </p>

<p>In a one-sentence joint filing yesterday in federal court

<h2>EU to Propose Single Supervisor for All Banks, Barnier Says </h2>
<p>A single supervisor for banks called for by euro-area
leaders last month should oversee all lenders in the bloc, not
only those deemed to be systemically important, Michel Barnier
said. </p>
<p>The new supervisory mechanism should be in place by the end
of the year as part of plans for a banking union to help tame
the euro debt crisis, Barnier, the EU''s internal market
commissioner, said at a hearing in Brussels yesterday. The body
should, at a minimum, supervise banks in all 17 countries that
use the single currency, he said. </p>
<p>I think it will need to cover all banks, of course,
Barnier told lawmakers in the European Parliament''s economic and
monetary affairs committee. Responsibilities could be delegated
to national regulators through decentralization, he said. </p>
<p>Euro leaders said on June 29 that it''s imperative to
break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. To this
end, they said that once a single supervisor, involving the
European Central Bank, is established, the euro area''s permanent
bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, could
recapitalize banks directly. </p>
<p>Leaders called on the European Commission to present
proposals for a single bank supervisor shortly. Barnier said
the commission will unveil its plan in September. </p>
<h2>European Banks Able to Meet Capital Targets, Bank Watchdog Says </h2>
<p>European banks reached a target of raising 114.7 billion
euros ($141 billion) in fresh capital by the end of June,
according to a European Union document. </p>
<p>The capital shortfall has been largely raised from
private sources and where necessary public backstops were
activated, according to a memorandum prepared for EU finance
ministers for a Brussels meeting today that was obtained by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The European Banking Authority told lenders to meet a core
Tier-1 capital ratio of 9 percent by the end of June, and hold
additional reserves, called a sovereign buffer, against the debt
of weaker euro-area countries, based upon the market price of
the bonds. The measures were part of a response to the sharp
fall in the value of securities issued by euro-area governments. </p>
<p>The EBA exercise was a necessary step on the road to
repair banks'' balance sheets and strengthen their capital
base, the document said. The recommendation will remain in
force until the normalization of risks. </p>
<p>A preliminary report will be released tomorrow, according
to the document, with more detailed results to be published in
September. </p>
<p>Franca Rosa Congiu, a spokeswoman for the EBA in London,
didn''t immediately return a telephone voice-mail message seeking
comment. </p>
<h2>Tucker Says No Public Official Told Him to Lean on Barclays </h2>
<p>Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker said no
government minister or official pressured him to instruct
Barclays Plc (BARC) or any other U.K. commercial bank to lowball its
Libor submissions during the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Absolutely not, Tucker told lawmakers in London
yesterday, when asked if anybody from the civil service or the
then Labour government leaned on him to ask banks to lower their
Libor submissions. He also said some of a memo written by former
Barclays Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond after an October
2008 phone call between the two gave the wrong impression. </p>
<p>Tucker''s two-hour testimony followed the record 290
million-pound ($449 million) fine imposed on Barclays last month
for manipulation of the London interbank offered rate. The
scandal, which Tucker described as a cesspit, has
jeopardized his position as the front-runner to replace Mervyn
King as governor of the Bank of England. </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Vivendi Reviews Due as Agency Toughens Policing of Mergers </h2>
<p>France''s Antitrust Authority will decide by July 24 whether
to approve the revised union of Vivendi SA (VIV)''s Canal Plus pay-
television unit with Television Par Satellite, its chief said
yesterday. </p>
<p>The regulator in September canceled the 2006 deal after
finding that Canal Plus hadn''t met all the conditions imposed to
ensure the merger didn''t harm competition. </p>
<p>Regulators in the deal are seeking diversity in the pay-TV
industry, a greater range of packages for consumers, and steps
that don''t destabilize the film industry, Bruno Lasserre,
the agency''s chief, said yesterday in Paris. The regulator won''t
require the company to sell off its CanalSat distribution arm,
he said. </p>
<p>The Authority has taken a tough stand on merger approval
since 2009, when it took responsibility for authorizing deals
from the finance ministry. So far this year, it has imposed
conditions on seven deals, the same number as in 2011 and 2010
combined. The regulator has also fined companies for not living
up to the conditions of merger authorizations. </p>
<p>Its cancellation of the Vivendi merger was the first time
the Authority has done so for failure to comply with terms. The
authority also imposed a 30 million-euro ($37 million) fine on
Canal Plus. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Vivendi, Canal Plus and Bigard didn''t
immediately return calls seeking comment on the regulator''s
actions. </p>
<h2>Japan Checking Possible Insider Trading of ANA, Official Says </h2>
<p>Japan''s securities watchdog is examining possible insider
trading of All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) shares before last week''s
announcement of a public offering, a government official with
direct knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission is
studying share movements before the July 3 announcement and will
conduct hearings to determine whether underwriters leaked
information, said the official, who requested anonymity as the
investigation is private. </p>
<p>Japanese regulators are cracking down on insider trading
after finding that employees of firms including Nomura Holdings
Inc. (8604) tipped off clients about share sales they managed in 2010.
Moody''s Investors Service said such leaks may be more than a
rare occurrence and the loss of confidence from the scandal
will damage local securities firms. </p>
<p>Trading volume of All Nippon Airways shares reached a
three-month high the day before news of the 211 billion yen
($2.6 billion) issuance became public, led by short-selling,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The moves were
unnatural, ANA spokesman Ryosei Nomura said on July 6. </p>
<p>ANA''s Nomura said the airline currently has no plan to take
action after receiving assurances from the four underwriters --
Nomura Holdings, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) -- that they didn''t leak information. </p>
<p>Spokesmen at the four banks declined to comment. An SESC
spokesman who asked not to be named also declined to comment,
saying he wasn''t authorized to discuss individual companies with
the media. ANA spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka said the carrier is
unaware of the regulator''s examination. </p>
<p>ANA, Japan''s biggest carrier, announced its share sale at 4
p.m. on July 3. Investors traded 24 million ANA shares on the
previous day, the most since March 27, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The stock declined as much as 2.7 percent
on July 2 before closing 0.9 percent lower, while the benchmark
Topix Index dropped 0.1 percent. </p>

<h2>Lawsuits </h2>
<h2>Dendreon, Prostate Drug Maker, Sued Over 2011 Stock Drop </h2>
<p>Dendreon Corp. (DNDN), the maker of the prostate-cancer medicine
Provenge, was sued by an investor claiming the company withheld
information about sales that led to a 2011 share price drop. </p>
<p>Company officers and directors misused proprietary
information about Provenge, which costs $93,000 per therapy
cycle, by not revealing that doctors were reluctant to prescribe
it because they had to pay up front and may have trouble getting
reimbursed from Medicaid or private insurers, Investor Herbert
Silverberg claims. </p>
<p>The reimbursement issue was a consistent topic of concern
internally, while officials touted lofty goals for the
drug, according to the Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed
yesterday in Wilmington. </p>
<p>Provenge was approved in the U.S. in 2010 as the first
therapy designed to train the body''s immune system to attack
cancer cells as if they were a virus. </p>
<p>The following year, the company acknowledged that
acceptance of Provenge would be a much more gradual process,
than first thought, according to the complaint. Dendreon shares
fell 67 percent, from $35.84 on Aug. 3 to $11.69 the next day,
plaintiff''s lawyers contend. </p>
<p>In the so-called derivative lawsuit, Silverberg asks a
judge to award damages from officials to the company,
disgorgement of all profits from wrongdoing and positive
corporate governance provisions to protect shareholders in the
future. </p>
<p>While it is our practice not to comment on litigation, we
believe this suit is baseless and without merit, Lindsay
Rocco, a spokeswoman for Dendreon, said in an e-mailed message. </p>
<p>The case is Silverberg v. Gold, CA7646, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL), Latin America''s
largest bottler of the soft drink, plunged the most in three
years after executives at companies the soda maker bought out
last year sold a portion of their stakes. </p>
<p>The shares fell 8.2 percent to 163.32 pesos at the close of
trading, the biggest decline since February 2009. </p>
<p>The surge in selling volume reflects moves by some former
owners of bottlers acquired by the company in 2011 to trim their
stakes, said Jose Castro, head of investor relations at Coca-
Cola Femsa. Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to acquire three Mexican Coke
bottlers in 2011, paying for them with shares. </p>
<p>What we are seeing today is certain family members
monetizing the shares, Castro said in a telephone interview
from Mexico City. </p>
<p>During the first minute of trading, Morgan Stanley executed
a trade for 2.25 million shares at 166.93 pesos, 6.2 percent
below yesterday''s close. Daily trading volume increased to 5.4
million shares, almost seven times the three-month average. </p>
<p>Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Investors selling multi-million share blocks of thinly-
traded stocks should expect to receive a below-market rate, said
Carlos Ponce, an analyst with Grupo Financiero Ve Por Mas SA.
Coca-Cola Femsa''s volume yesterday was less than 1 percent of
America Movil SAB, Mexico''s most-traded stock. </p>
<h2>Share Rally </h2>
<p>The bottler''s stock rallied 34 percent this year through
yesterday, probably making the sellers more willing to accept a
lower price, according to Ponce. </p>
<p>With the accumulated profit, they probably decided they
were willing to do it with this discount, Ponce said. It''s a
company that was looking a bit pricey. </p>
<p>The shares climbed on July 4 to a five-year high of 13.7
times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) eliminated several
hundred jobs, mostly in advertising sales and marketing, as part
of a review of staff tied to the start of a new fiscal year, a
person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>The company confirmed there were job cuts in a statement
yesterday without specifying the magnitude. In addition to
reductions in the advertising unit, a small number of jobs were
trimmed in several other businesses, said the person, who asked
not to be named because the details haven''t been disclosed. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, has been
working to control expenses as personal-computer sales have
stagnated and its Internet-advertising business hasn''t generated
as much revenue as the company once expected. The lackluster
online performance prompted the company to record a $6.2 billion
writedown for the quarter that ended June 30. </p>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based company is also facing higher
costs in areas such as marketing for its Windows 8 operating
system, due in October, and selling more software as an
Internet-based cloud service. </p>
<p>Like any company, Microsoft continually evaluates its

according to the e-mailed statement. The company is thinking

<p>A trio of banks led by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) are planning about $1 billion of bonds tied to
Blackstone Group LP (BX)''s acquisition of the Motel 6 lodging chain,
according to three people familiar with the offering. </p>
<p>The transaction, which may be offered in October, will be
composed of debt taken on by the New York-based private-equity
firm to acquire the motels, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are preliminary. JPMorgan is
working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Citigroup Inc. (C) to arrange the
offering, the people said. </p>
<p>Wall Street banks are funneling cash to the most
creditworthy property owners, aiding borrowers and boosting
values even as Europe''s debt crisis and slowing economic growth
in the U.S. fuel volatility in the $550 billion commercial-
mortgage bond market. Blackstone, with $48 billion in real-
estate assets, agreed to pay about $1.9 billion for Motel 6 in
May in the largest deal in the U.S. lodging industry since the
$3.93 billion acquisition of Extended Stay America Inc. in 2010. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, Amanda Williams of Deutsche Bank, Scott Helfman of Citigroup and Peter Rose of Blackstone, all based in New York, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Seeking Yield </h2>
<p>Hotel investments are attracting yield-starved investors as
the Federal Reserve''s unprecedented efforts to revive the
economy keeps interest rates near record lows for a fourth year.
The three banks have already sold $450 million in lower-ranking
mezzanine debt linked to the Motel 6 deal with yields ranging
from 7.5 percent to 10 percent, the people said. </p>
<p>Blackstone, which is preparing to unload office buildings
acquired during the past six years, is adding to its holdings of
hospitality properties. The world''s largest private-equity firm
was part of the group that bought Extended Stay out of
bankruptcy, and it announced a $950 million deal to purchase
U.K.-based Mint Hotel in September. </p>
<p>Blackstone is buying Motel 6 and an extended-stay chain
called Studio 6 from Paris-based Accor SA, Europe''s largest
hotel operator. The acquisition includes 1,102 hotels in North
America with more than 107,000 rooms, Accor said in a May 22
statement. </p>
<p>The Motel 6 chain, known for the advertising slogan We''ll
leave the light on for you, was founded in 1962 in Santa
Barbara, California, taking its name from the original cost of a
night''s lodging, according to its website. The chain was bought
in the 1980s by New York-based private-equity firm KKR  Co.,
which sold it to Accor in 1990. </p>
<h2>Stunted Recovery </h2>
<p>Lenders have arranged about $15.8 billion of securities
tied to skyscrapers, shopping malls and hotel loans this year,
compared with $28 billion in all of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Forecasts for 2012 issuance range from
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)''s $25 billion to Credit Suisse Group AG''s
projection of as much as $45 billion. </p>
<p>Price swings on the debt, which can eat into banks'' profit
margins on new deals, have stunted the market''s recovery after
being shut down during the credit crisis in 2008. Sales have
fallen from a record $232 billion in 2007. </p>

<p>It was January 2011, and markets
were rallying around the globe, driven by optimism that the U.S.
and European economies were on the rebound. One rising stock was
Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS), the Denver-based asset management
firm. </p>
<p>Investors were betting that Janus, with its lineup of
growth-oriented mutual funds, would benefit from the surge.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) analyst Kenneth Worthington disagreed. </p>
<p>Sifting through Janus''s funds, he saw that returns had
begun to taper off about six months earlier, Bloomberg Markets
magazine reports in its August issue. Worse, the firm had
recently instituted so-called performance fees on a half dozen
of its funds, meaning that the funds pay fees to Janus Capital,
their adviser, based on performance against their benchmarks.
When fund performance lags, those fees decline, hitting profits. </p>
<p>Performance collapses, earnings collapse, the stock
collapses was the scenario that Worthington says he saw. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan analyst put a sell recommendation on Janus on
Jan. 7, 2011, when shares were trading at $13.45. The stock rose
as high as $14.54 in February before nose-diving, finishing the
year at $6.31. </p>
<p>It was one of the worst-performing stocks in the SP 500
last year, and we caught it all, Worthington says. </p>
<p>Janus shares, since upgraded to a hold by Worthington,
 closed at $7.20 on July 11. </p>
<h2>Important Sources </h2>
<p>Worthington''s sell call on Janus helped make him the top
U.S. stock picker of brokerage and asset management firms,
according to a ranking of U.S. stock analysts by consulting firm
Greenwich Associates in association with Bloomberg Markets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, under Americas equity research head Noelle Grainger, scored the largest number of highly ranked analysts,
making it the No. 1 firm in U.S.equities research. Bank of
America was No. 2, followed by Morgan Stanley. (MS) </p>
<p>To compile the ranking, Stamford, Connecticut-based
Greenwich Associates surveyed 980 buy-side analysts at 216
investment management firms, mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions
and insurers. The analysts were asked to name the Wall Street
research teams they considered their most important sources of
advice on investments in 58 industries. Those were winnowed to
35to ensure a statistically significant number of responses. </p>
<p>The answers were then weighted by the amount of trading
commissions each buy-side firm paid out to banks and brokerages
-- $30 million on average, or a total of $5.6 billion. A vote
for an analyst by a firm that paid $20 million in commissions
was thus given twice the weight of a firm that paid $10 million. </p>
<h2>Secular Trends'' </h2>
<p>Wall Street research directors say it''s harder than ever to
earn money from the kinds of calls that Worthington made. Ever
since the credit crisis began to unfold in 2007, markets have
been driven by macroeconomic events that have little to do with
single-stock fundamental research. </p>
<p>Nearly 70 percent of a typical stock''s performance is
determined by forces linked to macroeconomic shifts rather than
issues specific to a company, such as earnings or management
changes, according to Morgan Stanley research completed in early
May. That compares with just 33percent in 2005. </p>
<p>It''s a heck of a lot harder to make money on a stock-
specific basis in the short term, says Stephen Penwell,
director of North American equity research at Morgan Stanley.
You''ve got to identify secular trends. </p>
<p>Bank and brokerage research directors say they''re confident
they can cut through the macro forces that are driving markets
to come up with useful investment advice. </p>
<h2>Connecting Dots'' </h2>
<p>The decline of Wall Street research is vastly overblown,
JPMorgan''s Grainger says. There continues to be a demand for
high-quality talent. Investors still want to know what is going
on in an industry. </p>
<p>So analysts today are more focused on churning out
exhaustive studies of trends and industries, with colleagues on
several continents providing insights. </p>
<p>We''re in the business of connecting the dots, says David Bleustein, Zurich-based UBS AG (UBSN)''s head of U.S. equities research.
We can tell you how a longshoremen''s strike in Australia is
likely to affect a U.S. coal company. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, Zurich-based Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN), which is tied at No. 4 among the top-ranked firms,
issued its Emerging Consumer Survey Databook 2012, a 179-page
tome compiled with pollster Nielsen Holdings NV. (NLSN) It surveyed
nearly 14,500 people in Brazil, Russia and six other emerging
markets on everything from their credit card debt to their
perfume expenditures. </p>
<h2>54 Percent Return </h2>
<p>You''ve got to be an investigator now, says Stefano Natella, Credit Suisse''s co-head of securities research and
analytics. </p>
<p>The databook shows that 24 percent of Brazilians surveyed
who had after-tax monthly income of 8,151 to 11,410 reais
($4,002 to $5,602) and who had purchased jewelry in the past
three to 12 months had bought foreign brands. Portfolio manager
Catherine Wood at AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB), which managed
$400 billion as of May 31, says such surveys help her refine her
investment themes. In this case, it reinforced her thesis that
expanding wealth in emerging markets was benefiting luxury goods
purveyors Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, L''Oreal SA (OR) and LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA. (MC) </p>
<p>When we move into a macro-driven environment, thematic
long-term investing outperforms, she says. We''re looking for
global themes that are disruptive and cut across economic
sectors. </p>
<h2>Deep-Dive Research </h2>
<p>Bank of America application and systems software analyst
Kash Rangan, who tied for No. 3 in that category of the ranking,
is using deep-dive research to pick out groups of companies that
are profiting from global technology trends. He co-authored a
four-part series of reports totaling 586 pages that mapped out
the dynamics of cloud computing and the companies likely to
benefit from it. </p>
<p>In May 2010, Rangan''s team used the research to make a
dozen stock recommendations -- including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and
Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) -- that generated a 54 percent return over
12months. The Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) rose 33 percent during the
same period. </p>
<p>You want to identify the theme that can make money for
clients and then you want to identify the companies that are
most leveraged to that theme, Rangan says. </p>
<p>John Pitzer, the Credit Suisse semiconductor analyst who is
tied for No. 1 in that category, harnessed the firm''s
proprietary database of 3,200 suppliers and customers to assess
the likely impact of Japan''s March 2011 earthquake and Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear-power-plant disaster. </p>
<h2>Fukushima Bet </h2>
<p>One Credit Suisse report, by London-based Richard Kersley,
head of global equity research product, focused on Shin-Etsu
Chemical Co., whose sidelined plant in the Fukushima prefecture
made 22 percent of the global supply of 300-millimeter silicon
wafers used by companies such as Intel Corp. (INTC) and Micron
Technology Inc. (MU) </p>
<p>Pitzer maintained his buy recommendations on the two chip
companies after concluding that any supply disruptions wouldn''t
be sufficient to impact their earnings. From March 17, 2011, the
date of Kersley''s report, to July 11, Intel stock returned
32.9percent while Micron lost 39.2 percent. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, it''s buy-side portfolio managers who
pick stocks. </p>
<p>Our clients think for themselves, says Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)''s
Rod Lache, the top-ranked auto analyst. </p>
<h2>Making Money </h2>
<p>Lache has a track record of prescient against-the-grain
calls. In April 2010, investors were driving down the price of
auto parts maker Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) on the theory that the
worsening euro-zone economic outlook would hit its earnings; the
Milwaukee-based company derived a third of its revenue from
Europe. </p>
<p>Lache saw it differently. He judged that JCI''s battery unit
would profit from the signing of a new contract with Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. He also saw signs of a rebound in Johnson Controls''
auto interior and building controls divisions. He upgraded the
$31.20 stock to a buy on May 6, 2010, with a $36 price target.
Shares bottomed at $25.90 in early June before rebounding to $39
on Dec. 7, when Lache downgraded it to a hold. </p>
<p>We''re trying to be contrarian, he says. That''s how you
make money in this part of the market. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse''s Thomas Gallagher, who tied for the No. 1
spot in Greenwich Associates'' life and health insurance
category, made a nuanced call when, on July 14, 2010, he
upgraded Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG),
an insurance and asset management firm, to a buy from hold. </p>
<h2>Proprietary Data </h2>
<p>His rationale: In a declining stock market, the company,
which has a big 401(k) retirement plan business, should hold up
better than its peers because those saving for retirement tend
to do so regardless of market gyrations. </p>
<p>Principal was also cheap. Using a common valuation metric,
Gallagher calculated that it could be liquidated at 1.6 times
the price at which it was trading, half the multiple of rival
Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) Investors
agreed: Shares returned more than 30 percent during the next six
months, to $33.07 on Jan.5, 2011, before Gallagher downgraded
them again to hold. </p>
<p>Proprietary data can help an analyst make those kinds of
calls. In January 2011, Morgan Stanley restaurant analyst John Glass commissioned a survey of 1,500 coffee buyers, personally
writing the questions. Seattle-based Starbucks (SBUX) Corp. had
recently disclosed that it was interested in the single-serving,
packaged-coffee market. </p>
<p>The key question was, Does single-serve coffee
cannibalize your visits to Starbucks coffee shops?'' Glass says. </p>
<p>Few respondents said it did. </p>
<h2>Shrinking Commissions </h2>
<p>Based on that and other responses, Glass concluded that
Starbucks would quickly garner 30 percent of the fast-growing,
$3 billion single-serve market and that the new product could
help push up earnings growth to as much as 20 percent. He put a
buy on the stock at $33.12 with a $40 target price. </p>
<p>Three days later, after Starbucks announced plans to
partner with Waterbury, Vermont-based Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters Inc. (GMCR) in the single-serve market, shares jumped to
$37.97. The stock traded at $52.16 on July 11. </p>
<p>Even as analysts work to make themselves indispensable to
investors, their world is shrinking. Investors are trading less
these days, which reduces commissions. Average daily trading
volume peaked at more than 12.3 billion shares in March 2009 and
fell to 6.6 billion by March 2012, according to New York-based
Rosenblatt Securities Inc. Asset managers, including hedge
funds, will pay an estimated $13.3 billion in U.S. equity
commissions in 2012, down from $17.5 billion in 2009, according
to Tabb Group LLC, a New York-based capital markets consultancy. </p>
<h2>Falling Pay </h2>
<p>The rise of exchange-traded funds has further reduced the
need for researchers. ETFs comprised 14.9 percent of stock
market volume in 2011, up from 4.6 percent in 2005, according to
Rosenblatt. Big ETFs, like index funds, have little use for
research and generate much lower trading commissions, often
using electronic networks. </p>
<p>That''s going to be a challenge for our business, says
Jonathan Rosenzweig, Citigroup Inc. (C)''s Americas equity research
director. The fact is that passive investing continues to
grow. </p>
<p>As the prominence of researchers has diminished, so has
their pay. It''s off 20 percent since 2007 to an average of
$500,000 for midlevel analysts, according to Alan Johnson,
managing director of compensation consulting firm Johnson
Associates Inc. </p>
<h2>Unheralded Role </h2>
<p>The superstar analyst of the 1990s bringing home millions
of dollars a year is gone, partly as a result of 2003
settlements with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
and other regulators that walled off analysts from their firms''
investment-banking divisions. Senior-level researchers today get
two-thirds of their pay in deferred stock awards. Before 2007,
just a third of their pay was deferred. </p>
<p>One growing and unheralded role analysts play is in
connecting their buy-side clients to managers of the companies
they cover through meetings, conferences and field trips. In one
recent high-end excursion, an analyst signed up 15 top clients,
chartered a plane and took off to meet with executives at half a
dozen companies in the course of a few days. One buy-side firm
paid the analyst more than $100,000 in trading commissions for
the trip. </p>
<p>The face-to-face meetings are the latest offering by an
industry hurt by a poorly kept Wall Street secret: Its
traditional buy-sell-hold recommendations get scant heed from
investors. </p>
<p>The upgrades and downgrades are secondary, Credit Suisse
life insurance analyst Gallagher says. It''s much more about
finding relevant information, being helpful in explaining issues
that are important over a multiyear period. </p>
<p>In short, the analysts who do find favor with investors are
those who manage to grind out good investment ideas even in
equity markets that are governed by fear, correlation and
aversion to risk. </p>

Moore" date="Jul 13, 2012  7:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-13/jpmorgan-s-botched-trades-may-generate-7-5-billion-loss.html"><headline>JPMorgan''s Botched Trades May Generate $7.5 Billion Loss</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Botched trades by a JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) unit that Jamie Dimon had pushed to boost profit were masked
by weak internal controls and may ultimately saddle the bank
with a $7.5 billion loss. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s chief investment office has lost $5.8 billion on
the trades so far, and that figure may climb by $1.7 billion in
a worst-case scenario, Dimon, the bank''s chairman and chief
executive officer, said yesterday. Net income fell 9 percent to
$4.96 billion in the second quarter, the bank said. It restated
first-quarter results to reduce profit by $459 million after a
review of the unit found employees may have hid souring bets. </p>
<p>Dimon, 56, had brushed off concerns raised by some of his
most senior advisers, including heads of JPMorgan''s investment
bank, about the lack of transparency and the quality of internal
controls in the CIO in past years, Bloomberg News reported last
month, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Capping the potential loss''s size and revamping management of
the unit responsible may help him restore investor confidence. </p>
<p>The stock jumped 6 percent yesterday as shareholders
expressed relief that it wasn''t worse, Gary Townsend, head
of Hill-Townsend Capital LLC, said of the loss. The loss is
substantially better than many of the estimates that I was
hearing. </p>
<p>Still, the shares are down 19 percent since April 5, when
Bloomberg News reported that the CIO had amassed an illiquid
book of credit derivatives. The slump equates to a $32 billion
drop in the firm''s market value. </p>
<h2>London Whale </h2>
<p>The mounting losses have focused regulators'' and investors''
attention on the CIO. Dimon transformed the once-conservative
unit in recent years to boost profit by buying higher-yielding
assets such as structured credit, equities and derivatives,
Bloomberg News reported on April 13, citing former employees. </p>
<p>One trader, Bruno Iksil, amassed positions in credit
derivatives so big and market-moving he became known as the
London Whale. Bets on credit-default swaps known as the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Series 9 backfired this year. </p>
<p>Dimon dismissed reports about the London operation as a
tempest in a teapot when the bank reported first-quarter
earnings April 13. He reversed course less than four weeks
later, disclosing a $2 billion loss that he said could grow to
$3 billion or more during the quarter. </p>
<h2>Managers Ousted </h2>
<p>The bank said yesterday it ousted managers responsible for
the transactions and will claw back their pay after an internal
inquiry found traders may have intentionally tried to hide
souring bets during the first quarter. The company didn''t name
the managers. Iksil''s boss Javier Martin-Artajo and former
Europe CIO head Achilles Macris were among executives who also
oversaw the trades. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said e-mails
sought by U.S. regulators in a probe of potential energy-market
manipulation are communications involving the advice of its
attorneys and shouldn''t be turned over. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, in a filing today in federal court in Washington,
said the 25 e-mails were sent after the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission opened its investigation and after the
bank hired outside counsel to respond to the probe. </p>
<p>Each of the e-mails relates to the advice of counsel with
respect to the investigation -- not the adoption of the bidding
practices under investigation, Michele Roberts, a lawyer for
JPMorgan, wrote in the filing. The only possible use the
commission could make of the e-mails would be to peer into the
details of respondent''s legal strategy. </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sued JPMorgan
on July 2 to release the e-mails in an investigation of possible
manipulation of power markets in California and the Midwest by
J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly gave JPMorgan until today to explain why the
e-mails shouldn''t be turned over to investigators. </p>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan submitted copies of the e-mails to
the court today so they can be examined by a judge, according to
the filing. </p>
<p>FERC opened the probe in August after complaints from
California and Midwest grid operators that JPMorgan''s bidding
practices were abusive, according to the agency''s initial court
filing. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, and Mary O''Driscoll, a FERC spokeswoman, declined to comment on today''s
filing. </p>
<p>The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>A gauge of risk for investors in
JPMorgan Chase  Co. debt fell to the lowest in two months as
the biggest U.S. bank said it shut down a credit-derivatives
group that caused $5.8 billion in trading losses. </p>
<p>Five-year credit-default swaps on JPMorgan fell 6.4 basis
points to a mid-price of 122.4 basis points as of 4:54 p.m. in
New York, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. That''s about the lowest since May
10, the day JPMorgan first disclosed a loss from credit
derivatives traded in its chief investment office in London. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said today it shifted almost all of its credit
derivatives trades in the CIO unit to its investment bank after
a botched hedging strategy. The bank also shut down the trading
group, which had amassed positions that had a pretax loss of
$4.4 billion in the second quarter, according to a statement.
Second-quarter profit dropped 9 percent to $4.96 billion as the
loss spoiled what Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called
really good underlying performance in other businesses. </p>
<p>Credit investors are taking comfort that the trade issues
are moving to the rear-view mirror, Joel Levington, managing
director of corporate credit at Brookfield Investment Management
Inc. in New York, wrote in an e-mail. Core earnings were
solid. What''s left is a well-capitalized bank that can earn $20
billion annually. </p>
<h2>Reasonable'' Outcome </h2>
<p>The credit-derivatives losses offset gains in mortgage fees
and retail banking revenue. Earnings for the quarter ended June
30 were also boosted by $1 billion in securities gains, $2.1
billion in reserve releases and an $800 million accounting gain
on the cost of the bank''s debt. </p>
<p>The loss is within the market''s scope of reasonable
outcomes, Adrian Miller, director of global markets strategy
at GMP Securities LLC in New York, wrote in an e-mail. Jamie
has seemingly succeeded at mostly righting the ship after an
initial black eye. </p>
<p>Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., said the trading loss was not that
significant and hadn''t swayed his opinion of JPMorgan''s
reputation. </p>
<p>I''ve had enough mistakes of my own that I''m very
forgiving when something like that happens, Buffett said today
on Bloomberg Television''s In the Loop With Betty Liu in an
interview from the Allen  Co. media conference in Sun Valley,
Idaho. </p>
<h2>CDX Index </h2>
<p>A benchmark credit-default swaps gauge in the U.S.
declined, with the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index falling 1.4 basis points to a mid-price of 111.9 basis
points at 5 p.m. in New York, Bloomberg prices show. </p>
<p>The measure decreased even as a report showed U.S. consumer
confidence unexpectedly dropped in July to the lowest level this
year. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of
consumer sentiment fell to 72 from a reading of 73.2 in June.
The decline missed estimates that had called for a rise to 73.5,
according to the median forecast of 69 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The credit-swaps index, used to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, typically
falls as investor confidence improves and rises as it
deteriorates. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) reduced relative yields on part of a $1.2 billion
commercial-mortgage bond offering, a boon for banks stockpiling
loans for future sales. </p>
<p>The lenders are issuing top-ranked debt maturing in about
10 years to pay a spread of 135 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, according to a person familiar with the
offering who asked not to be identified because terms aren''t
set. The banks initially marketed the securities to yield as
much as 150 basis points more than the benchmark. UBS AG and
Barclays Plc sold such debt paying a spread of 160 basis points
on June 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The transaction may signal a turnaround in investor
appetite as Wall Street dealers had been struggling to find
enough buyers for securities linked to shopping malls, hotels
and skyscrapers with longer durations. Lower spreads allow
lenders to offer borrowers better terms, potentially boosting
issuance. Wells Fargo  Co. raised its 2012 forecast to $35
billion from $25 billion yesterday. </p>
<p>We anticipate issuance to be robust in the third
quarter, Wells Fargo analysts led by Marielle Jan de Beur in New
York said in a report yesterday. Pipelines appear to be
active. </p>
<p>Relative yields on commercial-mortgage bonds have been
whipsawed by the European debt crisis. The spread on newly
issued 10-year bonds carrying top grades was as narrow as 105
basis points more than swaps in March. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. </p>
<p>The deal from Morgan Stanley and Bank of America is linked
to 72 loans on 98 properties across the U.S., said the person.
The largest loan in the pool is a $180 million mortgage on an
office tower in Baltimore. </p>
<p>Dealers have arranged about $15.8 billion of the debt this
year, compared with $28 billion in all of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. Forecasts for 2012 issuance range from Wells Fargo''s $35
billion to Credit Suisse Group AG''s projection of as much as $45
billion. Sales are down from a record $232 billion in 2007. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s investment
bank cut the amount earmarked for compensation by 22 percent to
$2.01 billion in the second quarter as the division generated 7
percent less revenue. </p>
<p>The unit set aside $4.91 billion for pay in the first six
months of the year, enough to compensate each of the 26,553
employees an average of $184,989 for the period, according to a
figures posted today on the New York-based company''s website.
That''s down from the first half of 2011, when the firm set aside
$211,358 for each of the unit''s 27,716 employees. </p>
<p>Pay at the world''s biggest lenders has drawn extra scrutiny
since the 2008 credit crisis, with regulators and lawmakers
saying compensation plans encouraged bankers to take too much
risk. JPMorgan said today it intends to claw back two years of
compensation from three employees in the firm''s chief investment
office after a $5.8 billion trading loss. The lender accepted an
offer from Ina Drew, 55, the former head of the CIO, to forfeit
her pay for the same period. </p>
<p>The investment bank''s compensation costs equaled 33 percent
of revenue excluding accounting gains for the second quarter,
down from 36 percent a year earlier. The unit allocated $2.6
billion to pay traders, dealmakers and other personnel in the
same period of 2011. </p>
<p>Net income for the investment bank, run by Jes Staley, 55,
fell to $1.91 billion in the quarter from $2.06 billion the
previous year. The unit generated 39 percent of JPMorgan''s $4.96
billion in profit, up from 38 percent in the same period last
year. </p>
<p>The unit had 846 more people than at the end of the first
quarter and 1,163 fewer than a year earlier, according to
today''s disclosure. Companywide, the staff expanded to 262,882
as of June 30 from 261,453 at the end of the first quarter and
250,095 at the middle of 2011. </p>

<p>Credit derivatives trades in
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s chief investment office that triggered
$5.8 billion in losses have been significantly reduced, with
the remainder moved to its investment bank, the lender said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, shut down synthetic
trading in its CIO unit with the exception of an $11 billion
short position in basically liquid indexes to hedge other
credit assets, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a
meeting in analysts today. Positions in Series 9 of the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a credit-swaps
benchmark known as IG9 that''s at the heart of much of the loss,
were cut by 70 percent, Dimon said. </p>
<p>The residual portfolio, largely trades in so-called
tranches of indexes that wager on the degree to which companies
will default together, was transferred to the investment bank,
where they have the expertise to manage it, Dimon said. The
bank transferred about $30 billion of risk-weighted assets to
the investment bank, an amount that is down substantially
from the peak and back to levels at the end of 2011, he said. </p>
<p>The bank shifted the positions as it seeks to stem losses
from a group in London that included Bruno Iksil, the trader who
became known as the London Whale because the size of his bets
grew so large they drove price disparities in the market. Total
losses from those trades this year reached $5.8 billion, Chief
Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said today in a meeting with
analysts. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, reported a $4.4 billion trading loss in its chief
investment office, bigger than analysts estimated, that helped
drive second-quarter profit down 9 percent. </p>
<p>Net income fell to $4.96 billion, or $1.21 a share, from
$5.43 billion, or $1.27, in the same period a year earlier, the
New York-based company said today in a statement. Six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimated the CIO trading loss at $4
billion. The company also restated first-quarter earnings,
reducing net income by $459 million, and used securities gains
and an $800 million accounting benefit to help boost profit. </p>
<p>The trading loss may complicate efforts by Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, to restore investor confidence after
losing $39.7 billion in market value since April 5, when
Bloomberg News first reported that the company had amassed an
illiquid book of credit derivatives at the London unit. The firm
also is being probed over the possible gaming of U.S. energy
markets and was subpoenaed in global investigations of interest-
rate fixing in London. </p>
<p>The restatement is not good, and at first glance, the
numbers are so-so, said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank and analyst at FBR Capital
Markets Corp. in Arlington, Virginia. </p>
<p>JPMorgan rose to $34.79 in New York trading at 7:36 a.m.
from $34.04 yesterday. The shares were down 2.4 percent this
year through yesterday. </p>
<h2>Analysts'' Estimates </h2>
<p>Second-quarter net income excluding the effect of
accounting adjustments known as DVA was $1.09 a share. Excluding
DVA, loan-loss reserve reductions and a Bear Stearns-related
recovery, profit was 67 cents. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
had estimated adjusted earnings per share of 76 cents. </p>
<p>In a departure from his customary earnings-day conference
call, Dimon is meeting analysts in person for two hours starting
at 7:30 a.m. today at the bank''s New York headquarters to field
questions about the loss and what he''s doing to contain the
damage. </p>
<p>Dimon dismissed reports about the London operation as a
tempest in a teapot when the bank reported first-quarter
earnings on April 13. He reversed course less than four weeks
later, disclosing a $2 billion loss that he said could grow to
$3 billion or more during the quarter. </p>
<h2>Securities Sales </h2>
<p>JPMorgan said May 10 that it had taken $1 billion in
profits from securities sales in the CIO to mitigate the trading
loss and planned more asset sales if needed to offset the
damages, which was caused by a wrong-way bet on credit
derivatives by London trader Bruno Iksil. Dimon hired Iksil''s
boss, London CIO chief Achilles Macris, in 2006 with a mandate
to generate profits. Macris and Iksil eventually built up a
position in credit derivatives that was so large it couldn''t be
unwound without roiling markets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said today that it recently discovered information
that suggests some individuals at the company may have been
trying to avoid showing the full amount of the losses. All
employees working on synthetic credit derivatives in the CIO
have left the bank, the company said today. </p>
<p>We have already completely overhauled CIO management and
enhanced the governance standards within CIO, Dimon said in the
statement. We believe these events to be isolated to CIO, but
have taken the opportunity to apply lessons learned across the
firm. </p>
<p>The company said the CIO loss may increase by $800 million
to as much as $1.6 billion in an extreme scenario. </p>
<h2>Ina Drew </h2>
<p>Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 55, retired four days
after the loss was disclosed with about $57.5 million in stock,
pension and other pay, according to regulatory filings and
estimates from consulting firm Meridian Compensation Partners
LLC. About $21.5 million of that money, based on the May 14
closing price, would have been automatically forfeited if she
had been fired for cause. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said today it will claw back compensation from
individuals responsible for the losses on a case-by-case basis. </p>
<p>Dimon is also grappling with historically low interest
rates that have compressed profit margins on lending as well as
yields on investments. Moshe Orenbuch, of Credit Suisse Group
AG, was among analysts who lowered earnings projections for
banks amid weak trading revenue and market turmoil caused by
Europe''s sovereign debt crisis. </p>
<p>Corporate bond issuance dropped almost 19 percent in the
second quarter from $927 billion a year earlier as companies
backed away from plans to raise capital. </p>
<h2>Europe Damper </h2>
<p>Europe continues to put a damper on just about
everything, said Nancy Bush, an analyst and contributing
editor at SNL Financial LC, a research firm based in
Charlottesville, Virginia. </p>
<p>Consumer credit is one bright spot for the industry as
delinquency rates decline. Fewer borrowers fell behind on their
credit-card payments in May, 2.35 percent, from 3.09 percent a
year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Government programs and mortgage rates near record lows have
also helped fuel higher volume and bigger profits on home loans. </p>
<p>JPMorgan set aside $335 million more toward its litigation
costs during the second quarter. Dimon previously told
shareholders that the company would be making as much as $24
billion in annual profit if it weren''t for all of its mortgage
losses. </p>
<p>Revenue fell 16 percent to $22.9 billion from $27.4 billion
during the second quarter of last year. Revenue at the
investment-banking unit fell 7 percent to $6.77 billion from
$7.31 billion last year. </p>
<h2>Fixed Income </h2>
<p>Fixed-income and equity-markets revenue excluding
accounting adjustments dropped to $4.54 billion from $5.36
billion a year earlier, the company said. </p>
<p>U.S. banks are in the middle of the industry''s worst two
years of revenue growth since the Great Depression, according to
Mike Mayo, an analyst with independent research firm CLSA Ltd.
in New York. </p>
<p>Retail banking, which includes home loans and checking
accounts, earned $2.27 billion, up from $383 million a year
earlier. The bank''s net interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, declined to 2.47 percent from 2.72 percent a year
earlier. </p>
<p>JPMorgan benefited from gains in mortgage lending as low
interest rates and federal incentive programs encouraged
homeowners to refinance. Mortgage fees and related revenue
totaled $2.27 billion, up from $1.1 billion a year earlier. </p>
<h2>Unemployment Rate </h2>
<p>Demand for loans rose as the unemployment rate fell to 8.2
percent from 9.1 percent in the same period of 2011. Mortgage
originations industrywide probably climbed 28 percent to $372
billion in the second quarter from the same period last year,
driven by refinancings spurred by federal programs, according to
the Mortgage Bankers Association. </p>
<p>Fewer consumers fell behind on their credit-card payments
in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2011.
Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal of future write-offs,
fell to 2.14 percent from 2.98 percent in 2011. Write-offs
dropped to 4.35 percent from 5.82 percent the prior year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, restated first-quarter results to reduce
net income by $459 million after a review of the firm''s chief
investment office found that employees may have hid losses. </p>
<p>Net income was $4.92 billion, rather than the $5.38 billion
previously reported, the New York-based bank said today in a
regulatory filing. The CIO was responsible for trading losses
that the bank estimated at $2 billion in May. </p>
<p>Recently discovered information raises questions about
the integrity of the trader marks, and suggests that certain
individuals may have been seeking to avoid showing the full
amount of the losses being incurred in the portfolio during the
first quarter, the bank said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is seeking to restore
confidence in the bank after initially calling reports on the
CIO''s trades a complete tempest in a teapot as the bank
released first-quarter earnings in April. The bank today said it
found a material weakness in internal controls for that period. </p>

<p>The Army is weighing changes in
General Dynamics (GD) Corp.''s contract to maintain Stryker armored
combat vehicles after the Pentagon''s inspector general found the
terms led to excess spending of as much as $336 million, or 23
percent. </p>
<p>The no-bid contract resulted in little, if any, cost risk
for the contractor or incentive to control costs, the
inspector general said in an audit. The Army responded by
starting a business case analysis of potential changes,
according to Ashley Givens, spokeswoman for the service''s Ground
Combat Systems. </p>
<p>Under contracts that began in 2002 and were awarded without
competition, General Dynamics is paid to perform maintenance and
to buy, store and issue spare parts for the Army''s 2,576 Stryker
vehicles, which were built by the company. </p>
<p>The 19-ton, eight-wheeled vehicles have driven an estimated
40 million miles (64 million kilometers) during the Iraq and
Afghan wars. Seventy-seven Strykers have been destroyed in
battle since 2002, and 435 were damaged. </p>
<p>Since the first contract in May 2002, Army officials have
made no progress in converting the high-risk cost-reimbursable
contract or portions to a preferred lower risk, firm-fixed
contract, the audit, dated June 18, found. As a result, the
Stryker contract was at a higher risk of misuse, waste and
inadequate accountability. </p>
<h2>Least Incentive'' </h2>
<p>Contracts promising to reimburse costs plus a fixed fee
provide the least incentive for the contractor to control cost
and perform in an efficient manner, according to the inspector
general, echoing past criticism of such deals by Congress,
President Barack Obama and the Army''s own auditors. </p>
<p>The Army has issued three such contracts to Falls Church,
Virginia-based General Dynamics, including the current six-year
award in 2006 that is set to expire in February. </p>
<p>General Dynamics spokesman Kendall Pease referred a request
for comment to the Army, saying in an e-mail that the audit
reflects a contracting philosophy debate between the Army
and the Defense Department. </p>
<p>Givens, the Army spokeswoman, said in an e-mail that the
inspector general''s recommendations represent acquisition and
contracting practices that will improve logistics support
strategy, plans and execution moving forward. </p>
<p>Army officials said in comments in the inspector general''s
report that the type of contract used was necessary to keep
Strykers in Iraq and Afghanistan at high readiness levels. </p>
<h2>Sole Goal </h2>
<p>General Dynamics'' fee was tied directly to that sole goal
of readiness, encouraging the company to spend freely on spare
parts even if they exceeded demand, the inspector general''s
report found. The company purchased some of the excess parts
from itself and others from suppliers, according to the audit. </p>
<p>The Army contracted with General Dynamics to spend through
February about $1.453 billion but we calculated the
operational support costs at about $1.117 billion for the first
five years, resulting in about $335.9 million of excess
spending that could have been put to better use, the audit
found. </p>
<p>General Dynamics has been paid $1.1 billion so far for the
first four years of the current contract, including all of its
potential fee of $99.9 million. </p>
<p>The inspector general questioned whether General Dynamics
should have received the entire fee because the contract''s
metrics were vague and it had no means to measure the
efficiency of the contractor''s cost performance or actual
overruns or under-runs in relation to the fixed fee. </p>
<p>The fifth year''s $317 million payment hasn''t been made. The
Army has yet to obligate funds for the sixth year valued at
$341.2 million, including the fee. </p>
<h2>Congress, Obama </h2>
<p>The Army''s use of the cost-plus contracts for Stryker
maintenance has been criticized by the service''s Audit Agency,
which warned in December 2005 that the approach provided
minimal incentive for the contractor to control costs and
recommended fixed-price deals instead. </p>
<p>Such contracts have also been criticized more broadly.
Congress urged the Pentagon in 2006 to use more fixed-price
clauses in development, production and service work. </p>
<p>Obama issued a government-wide memo in March 2009 urging
limits on the use of cost-plus contracts that are wasteful,
inefficient, subject to misuse or otherwise not well-designed to
serve the interests of the American taxpayer. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) named Brian Wynne and
Charlie Visconsi to replace Stratford Shields when he steps down
Sept. 1 as head of public-finance, according to Michael Heaney,
global head of credit. </p>
<p>Wynne, the unit''s second-in-command, and Visconsi will take
over as co-heads, Heaney said yesterday in a memo. With the New
York-based company for 23 years, Wynne has been Shields''s deputy
since 2008 while Visconsi, a 14-year employee, has been co-head
of the bank''s Infrastructure East Group since 2007. </p>
<p>Shields, who has run the department for five years, will
remain with the firm working with municipal issuers as a senior
banker in the Chicago office, Heaney said. Shields has split his
time between that city and New York. While putting Morgan
Stanley in the top four rankings of muni underwriters for
several years, Shields also helped the bank land as much as 10
percent of the negotiated new-issue market, Heaney said. </p>
<p>These rankings and market share are a testament to both
his leadership as well as the tremendous talent within the
public-finance department, Heaney said in the memo. Brian
and Charlie have complementary skills and together will lead the
business to continued success. </p>
<p>Shields sought a change that would let him reside full-time
in Chicago, Heaney said. The department at the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets provides financial services for municipal-
debt issuers. The company also controls Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney, the world''s largest brokerage. </p>

Freedman and Hugh Son" date="Jul 16, 2012 10:32 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-16/visa-among-u-s-firms-seen-helped-by-wto-ruling-on-china.html"><headline>Visa Among U.S. Firms Seen Helped by WTO Ruling on China</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard Inc. (MA) and
American Express Co. (AXP) were among companies to win partial support
from World Trade Organization judges in a U.S. claim that China
unfairly restrains the payment processors. </p>
<p>WTO judges in Geneva yesterday agreed with the U.S. that
China unfairly discriminates against foreign suppliers of
electronic-payment services by imposing requirements on them
that aren''t applied to domestic companies. They rejected the
U.S. argument that China UnionPay Data Co., the world''s fastest-
growing bank-card network, monopolizes the handling of domestic-
currency payment-card transactions. </p>
<p>It is definitely a mixed bag for both parties, Scott
Lincicome, an attorney at White  Case LLP, said in a phone
interview. The one thing we can safely say for sure is that
both sides are going to appeal. </p>
<p>China has reservations about some parts of the ruling, Shen Danyang, a spokesman for the Commerce Ministry, said in a
statement on the ministry''s website yesterday, without giving
details. </p>
<p>The U.S. protested to the WTO about the limits on payment
processing, saying China favors Shanghai-based UnionPay and
forbids foreign companies from issuing their own bank cards
denominated in its currency, building networks to support such
cards or handling interbank point-of-sale transactions. </p>
<h2>Pave Way </h2>
<p>We are hopeful that this ruling will pave the way for
international payment companies to participate in the domestic
payments marketplace in China, said Will Valentine, a
spokesman for San Francisco-based Visa, the world''s biggest
bank-card network. In the meantime, our existing business in
China is healthy. </p>
<p>MasterCard, the No. 2 network, forecast in September 2010
that China will overtake the U.S. as the largest market for
credit cards by 2020, with about 900 million cards in
circulation. Total cards probably will increase 11 percent a
year as transaction value climbs 14 percent annually until 2025,
the Purchase, New York-based company said at the time. </p>
<p>MasterCard has long been of the view that open payment
systems promote growth by reducing the need for cash payments,
fostering innovation and reducing system risk, Jim Issokson, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Leslie Sutton, a spokeswoman for Riverwoods, Illinois-based
Discover Financial Services (DFS), which has an agreement with
UnionPay to process the Chinese firm''s card transactions in the
U.S., declined to comment. Molly Faust, a spokeswoman for New
York-based American Express, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Shares Increase </h2>
<p>Visa and MasterCard advanced in New York yesterday after
announcing on July 13 that they had agreed along with card-
issuing banks to pay $6.6 billion in settling a U.S. antitrust
lawsuit brought by merchants. Visa climbed 2.5 percent to
$127.15, while MasterCard rose 1.7 percent, AmEx added 1.2
percent and Discover gained 0.5 percent. </p>
<p>Tim Reif, general counsel at the U.S. Trade
Representative''s office, called yesterday''s ruling a decisive
victory that may produce 6,000 new jobs. </p>
<p>We have achieved a landmark finding by the WTO against
every aspect of China''s regulatory regime, Reif told
journalists on a conference call in Washington. </p>
<p>A UnionPay employee at the firm''s U.S. office in Jersey
City, New Jersey said she couldn''t comment and directed
inquiries to the company''s headquarters in Shanghai. Wang
Kongping, a spokesman based in the Chinese city, wasn''t
immediately available to comment by phone. </p>
<h2>China''s Promise </h2>
<p>While the WTO judges found that China imposes four
different requirements that violate the organization''s rules,
the U.S. failed to establish that China UnionPay is the sole
supplier of electronic-payments services, Lincicome said. The
extent to which American service providers see this CUP issue as
a very big deal, they will stand to be disappointed, he said. </p>
<p>Foreign banks must co-brand with Chinese operators to
execute payments through UnionPay. The U.S. says the rules clash
with the promise China made when it joined the WTO to open up
its credit- and debit-card markets to foreign processing
companies by the end of 2006. WTO judges agreed with the U.S.
that China had made pledges on market access when it became a
member of the trade arbiter in 2001. </p>
<p>UnionPay, which supplanted American Express as the world''s
third-biggest payments network in 2010, processed $2.36 trillion
in credit- and debit-card purchases last year, a 46 percent
increase from 2011, according to the Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. Visa handled
purchases totaling $5.38 trillion, a 12 percent gain, while
MasterCard spending climbed about 15 percent to $2.43 trillion. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s assertion
that traders at its London chief investment office may have
intentionally mismarked trades, masking losses that total at
least $5.8 billion, makes little sense, according to former
executives with direct knowledge of the unit''s operation. </p>
<p>The bank restated first-quarter results, paring profit by
$459 million, in part because an internal review revealed that
U.K. traders had priced their books aggressively, Mike Cavanagh, head of Treasury  Securities Services, said in a July
13 meeting with analysts. The mispricing made losses on a
portfolio of credit derivatives look smaller than they were, and
executives concluded that traders may have sought to hide the
full amount of losses, JPMorgan said in a presentation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan requires traders to mark their positions daily so
the firm can track their profits, losses and risk. An internal
control group double-checks the marks against market prices
monthly and at the end of each quarter, said three former
executives from the CIO and a senior executive in market risk.
The firm uses the control group''s prices, not what individual
traders submit, to calculate earnings, making it difficult for
one trader or trading desk to rig prices, the people said. </p>
<p>We just have questions about whether the traders were
doing what they need to do for accounting, which is put a mark
on their positions where they think they can exit, Cavanagh,
who led the internal review, said on a conference call with
reporters. Instead, it felt more like they were pricing their
marks a little bit more aggressively, but generally inside the
bid-ask spread. </p>
<h2>London Whale </h2>
<p>The spread is the difference between what an investor would
pay to buy a security and the price at which someone is willing
to sell the same asset. </p>
<p>Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his
positions became so large, ran the credit derivatives book that
generated the losses. He personally apologized in recent weeks
to almost everyone in the London unit for causing turbulence
within the group, according to one of the former CIO executives
who had been told about it by two people in the unit. </p>
<p>Iksil and Raymond Silverstein, his attorney, didn''t return
phone and e-mail messages seeking comment. The New York Times
quoted Silverstein saying that Iksil is innocent of wrongdoing. </p>
<h2>Deciding to Restate </h2>
<p>The decision to restate results for the first three months
of 2012 was made one day before New York-based JPMorgan reported
second-quarter net income of $4.96 billion, and after executives
and lawyers interviewed employees, and reviewed thousands of
hours of calls and about 1 million e-mails, said Cavanagh, 46. </p>
<p>The firm didn''t elaborate on the content of those e-mails
and Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on the doubts expressed by the former executives. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s shares fell 2.7 percent to $35.09 in New York.
The KBW Bank Index of 24 U.S. lenders dropped 0.1 percent. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, has
seen its market value plunge $36 billion since April 5, when
Bloomberg News first reported the London unit''s illiquid bets on
credit derivatives were big enough to move markets. The trade, a
wrong-way bet on credit derivatives, cost the bank $5.8 billion
in the first six months of this year and the tab could climb by
$1.7 billion, the bank said. </p>
<h2>Price Verification </h2>
<p>Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 55, who retired four
days after the initial losses were disclosed on May 10,
voluntarily forfeited as much as two years of compensation.
JPMorgan said it ousted the three London executives responsible
for the loss and that it will claw back as much as two years of
their bonuses, without naming the individuals. </p>
<p>Iksil''s boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, and former Europe CIO
head Achilles Macris were among executives who also oversaw the
trades. </p>
<p>Some securities, such as interest-rate derivatives or
foreign-exchange contracts, are easier to price because they''re
generally traded on exchanges, making them more transparent to
investors. Credit derivatives and other securities traded by
Iksil were more difficult to price because they traded less
frequently, and not on open exchanges. </p>
<p>Even then, traders have to submit documentation verifying
their pricing and the internal control group generally would
solicit prices from about two dozen outside firms to verify the
marks, the people said. Executives including Dimon had said
previously that Iksil''s positions were marked-to-market,
indicating that they were available market prices that confirmed
his valuations. </p>
<p>The CIO also valued some trades at prices that differed
from those of JPMorgan''s investment bank, people familiar with
the matter said in May. </p>
<h2>Short Position </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, shut down all
synthetic trading at the chief investment office and transferred
the rest of the position to the investment bank. The CIO has
retained an $11 billion short position in basically liquid
indexes to hedge other credit assets, Dimon, 56, said during
the meeting with analysts. Positions in Series 9 of the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a credit-swaps
benchmark known as IG9 that''s at the heart of much of the loss,
were cut by 70 percent, he said. </p>
<p>The investment bank has the expertise to manage it, Dimon
said. The bank transferred about $30 billion of risk-weighted
assets to the investment bank, an amount that is down
substantially from an earlier peak and back to levels at the
end of 2011, he said. </p>
<h2>Federal Investigations </h2>
<p>The stock jumped 6 percent on July 13 as investors
expressed relief that it wasn''t worse, said Gary Townsend,
head of Hill-Townsend Capital LLC, said of the trading loss. It
was substantially better than many of the estimates that I was
hearing, he said. </p>
<p>Agencies scrutinizing the bank''s handling of the loss
include the Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Justice
Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation. </p>
<p>Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said July 14 that he is
seeking to lead a proposed class-action lawsuit against JPMorgan
after state pension funds lost more than $27.5 million due to
the alleged fraud. Two funds for state employees held about
10.2 million JPMorgan shares as of March 31, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Pension-fund managers acting on behalf of Ohio retirees
were givenfalse and misleading information by JPMorgan Chase
that hid the true nature of the bank''s risky trades, causing
Ohio teachers, school employees and public employees to lose
tens of millions of hard-earned retirement dollars, DeWine
said in a statement. </p>
<p>Dimon transformed the unit in recent years to boost profit
by buying higher-yielding assets such as structured credit,
equities and derivatives, Bloomberg News reported on April 13,
citing former employees. </p>
<p>Dimon dismissed initial news reports about the London
operation as a tempest in a teapot when the bank reported
first-quarter earnings April 13. He reversed course less than
four weeks later, disclosing a $2 billion loss that he said
could grow to $3 billion or more during the quarter. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software maker, unveiled the next version of its Office software
with social and cloud features that will work with touch-screen
devices powered by its Windows 8 operating system. </p>
<p>We are taking bold steps at Microsoft, Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said at an event today in San Francisco.
The new, modern Office will deliver unparalleled productivity
and flexibility for both consumers and business customers. It is
a cloud service and will fully light-up when paired with Windows
8. </p>
<p>Revenue in Microsoft''s business division, the company''s
largest, increased 6.4 percent to $17.7 billion in the nine
months ended March 31, the company said. Microsoft is trying to
sell customers Web-based versions of its Word, Excel and e-mail
programs and add social features to its marquee software suite
to stave off competition from Google Inc. (GOOG) and Jive Software Inc. (JIVE) </p>
<p>The updated Office will save documents to Microsoft''s
Internet-based cloud storage service SkyDrive, enabling access
to files via tablets, computers and phones. Customers will also
be able to buy the software as a subscription, which will let
them use the cloud to stream applications to any Windows-based
PC. Subscribers also get future upgrades automatically. </p>
<h2>Huge Bet'' </h2>
<p>We are seeing Microsoft update almost its entire product
line this year with laser alignment around touch interfaces
built into Windows 8, said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC, in an
e-mail. This is clearly a process that is several years in the
making and should be seen as a huge bet the company is making to
usurp the disruptive innovation brought about by touch screens
and cloud services. </p>
<p>Besides touch controls, the program will also allow users
control programs and take notes with a stylus. </p>
<p>Social features will include tools Microsoft is gaining
from its $1.2 billion purchase of corporate social-network
operator Yammer Inc. last month. Yammer offers a Facebook-like
experience that enables employees to collaborate in the
workplace. </p>
<p>Another tool, called People Card, lets users see their
contacts anywhere in Office, including photos, status updates

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won dismissal of
Novell Inc.''s antitrust lawsuit over the WordPerfect computer
program. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz granted Microsoft''s
request to close the case in an order issued today. A mistrial
was declared in December after jurors in Salt Lake City said
they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. </p>
<p>Novell did not present evidence sufficient for a jury to
find that Microsoft committed any acts that violated federal
antitrust laws in maintaining its monopoly in the operating
systems market, Motz wrote in his ruling. </p>
<p>Novell sought as much as $1.3 billion in damages over
allegations that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, while
developing the Windows 95 operating system in 1994, blocked an
element of the software to thwart Novell''s WordPerfect and
Quattro Pro programs. </p>
<p>Novell is disappointed in the ruling, still believes in
the strength of its claim and we do intend to pursue an
appeal, Jim Lundberg, vice president of the company''s legal
department, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Novell, which was bought by Seattle-based Attachmate Corp.,
claimed WordPerfect''s share of the word-processing market fell
to less than 10 percent in 1996 from almost 50 percent in 1990. </p>
<p>WordPerfect''s value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994
to $170 million in 1996, when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel
Corp., Novell said. Novell settled separate antitrust claims
against Microsoft for $536 million in 2004. </p>
<p>We''ve maintained throughout this case that Novell''s
arguments lack merit, and we''re gratified with today''s ruling
dismissing the last of Novell''s claims and putting this matter
to rest, David Howard, Microsoft deputy general counsel, said
in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The case is Novell Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City). </p>

<p>Employees of Goldman Sachs Group (GS)
Inc., the biggest source of donations directly to Mitt Romney''s
presidential campaign, are also the top givers to the joint
fundraising committee he has set up with the Republican Party. </p>
<p>Goldman employees contributed $902,310 to Romney Victory,
according to a computer-assisted analysis of Federal Election
Commission reports. Overall, Romney Victory has raised more than
$140 million since being established on April 5. Employees of
Boston-based Bain Capital LLC, the private-equity firm co-
founded by Romney, were its second biggest contributors, giving
$820,400. </p>
<p>Employees of Elliott Management Corp., a New York-based
hedge fund, were third with $808,150 in donations to Romney
Victory, which raises money for the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee and state and local party committees. Paul Singer, the president and founder of Elliott Management, has
also given $1 million to the pro-Romney super political action
committee Restore Our Future. </p>
<p>The super-PAC, which operates independently of Romney''s
presidential campaign, raised a record $20 million in June,
spokeswoman Brittany Gross confirmed today. </p>
<h2>Adelson Check </h2>
<p>The super-PAC''s haul, which exceeds by double any previous
month, includes a $10 million check from Las Vegas casino
billionaire Sheldon Adelson. Other donors will be included in a
report to the FEC due July 20. </p>
<p>Employees of New York-based Goldman and their families also
have contributed $593,080 to Romney''s own campaign, more than
those of any other company, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group that
tracks campaign contributions. </p>
<p>Goldman employees and their families gave $1 million to
President Barack Obama for his 2008 campaign, more than those at
any other company. They''ve given $100,424 to him for his re-
election, according to the center. </p>
<p>Romney is the candidate of Wall Street now, of course,
said Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York
University''s Wagner School. Obama was seen as the logical
candidate for economic stimulus in 2008, but has now launched a
campaign based on inequality and taxation of the 1 percent. </p>
<p>Romney Victory reported raising $140.3 million through June
30 and had $57.7 million in the bank after transferring $68.8
million to the Romney campaign, the Republican National
Committee, and state parties in Idaho, Massachusetts, Oklahoma
and Vermont. </p>
<h2>Other Contributors </h2>
<p>Also supporting Romney Victory are several corporate PACs,
including Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), which gave $40,000, and
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI), which contributed $15,000. A lobbyist
for Anheuser-Busch, Michael Roche, brought in $25,000. </p>
<p>Former Kansas Governor Bill Graves, president and chief
executive officer of the Arlington, Virginia-based American
Trucking Associations, raised $587,500 for the joint fundraising
committee. Patrick Durkin, a lobbyist for London-based Barclays
Plc (BARC), brought in $184,630. </p>
<p>Barclays'' chief executive officer, Robert Diamond, resigned
his position earlier this month after the bank said it rigged
global interest rates. Diamond won''t co-host a forthcoming
London fundraiser for Romney, as originally planned. </p>
<p>Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC supporting Obama, took
in $6 million last month, co-founder Bill Burton told Bloomberg
Television on July 13. </p>
<p>Both super-PACs are using most of their cash to air attack
ads in battleground states. </p>
<p>Super-PACs can accept donations in any amount, while limits
are imposed on how much can be given to joint fundraising
committees such as Romney Victory and directly to the
candidates. </p>

<p>Intel Corp. (INTC) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT),
whose products run at least 80 percent of the world''s personal
computers, are set to report lackluster sales growth as China''s
slowing economy exacerbates stalling demand for PCs. </p>
<p>Intel, the largest maker of microprocessors, and Microsoft,
the No. 1 software company, will report quarterly earnings this
week. Analysts project both will say sales rose 5 percent or
less from a year earlier, as consumers choose tablet computers
and smartphones over PCs or hold off on purchases altogether. </p>
<p>Growth is slackening in China, the world''s largest PC
market since last year. That''s fueling concern that electronics
makers can''t count on Asia to counterbalance diminished demand
in recession-ravaged Europe or in the U.S., where a recovery is
taking hold at a slower-than-predicted pace. With Intel and
Microsoft yet to gain market share in tablets against Apple
Inc., the PC industry may struggle to grow at all this year,
according to research by Robert W. Baird  Co. </p>
<p>The current picture is lousy, said Pat Becker Jr., a
fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management
Inc., which owns Intel and Microsoft shares. It''s Europe, it''s
the chain reaction into the emerging markets. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) was among
three Italian insurers downgraded by Moody''s Investors Service,
which cited the nation''s weakening creditworthiness. </p>
<p>Generali, the country''s largest insurer, had its senior
debt cut to Baa2 from A2, Moody''s said yesterday in a statement
on the Trieste-based company. </p>
<p>Generali''s ability to share further asset losses with
policyholders diminishes with increasing investment losses
across the portfolio, and the insurer''s domestic-life business
may be hurt by Italy''s weakening economy, Moody''s said. </p>
<p>Moody''s has lowered bank ratings this week, saying the
Italian state faces increased risk of being unable to
support firms in distress. The company cut Italy last week to
Baa2 from A3, and said further downgrades are possible as weak
growth and elevated unemployment threaten the government''s plan
to cut the budget deficit and rein in bond yields. The new grade
is two levels above junk. </p>
<p>Allianz SpA, a subsidiary of Munich-based Allianz SE (ALV), was
downgraded to A3 from A1, Moody''s said yesterday. Unipol
Assicurazioni SpA was cut to Baa2 from A3 and remains on review
for possible downgrades amid its proposed acquisition of insurer
Fondiaria-SAI, which could weaken its capital strength, Moody''s
said. </p>
<p>The outlook on the insurers is negative, in line with the
government''s, Moody''s said, and all three companies may be cut
further if Italy''s sovereign rating is downgraded again. </p>
<p>Lucia Sciacca, a Generali spokeswoman, Allianz''s Patrizia
Guglielmetti and Stefano Genovese of Unipol didn''t respond to
e-mails requesting comment outside regular business hours. </p>
<p>The French subsidiaries of Generali had their insurance
financial-strength grade lowered to Baa1 from A1. The company''s
German subsidiaries'' grade was cut to A3. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts'' estimates, helped by pricing increases in North
America late last year. </p>
<p>Net income was little changed at $2.79 billion, or $1.21 a
share, compared with $2.8 billion, or $1.20, a year earlier,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Excluding
some items, profit totaled $1.22 a share. Analysts projected
$1.19, the average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent raised pricing last
year to help recoup higher costs for ingredients such as
sweeteners and plastic for bottles. Pricing rose 3 percent in
the second quarter, helped by a 5 percent jump in soft drink
pricing in North America. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola delivered another solid and better-than-
expected quarter in an increasingly challenging macro
environment, Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Wells Fargo  Co.,
said today in a research note. The results are confirmation of
KO''s durability. She rates the shares outperform, the
equivalent of a buy. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola rose 1.6 percent to $77.69 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 11 percent this year. </p>
<p>Commodity costs this year may increase about $300 million
from 2011, less than the $350 million to $450 million Coca-Cola
had forecast in February. The recent jump in corn futures has
been factored into the company''s full-year commodity guidance,
Kent said today in an interview. </p>
<p>Corn is not our only commodity, it''s a combination of
coffee and PET and metals and oils and everything else, Kent
said, refering to polyethylene terephthalate, the plastic used
in bottles. </p>
<h2>Gross Margin </h2>
<p>Revenue in the quarter advanced 2.7 percent to $13.1
billion, according to the statement. The volume of drinks sold
globally increased 4 percent, including a 1 percent gain in
North America. Volume sales in China rose 7 percent while Europe
declined 4 percent. </p>
<p>In Europe, the consumer is pretty confused, Kent said.
Less people traveling overall, less people eating out, less
people driving, less people spending and that''s Europe. </p>
<p>Gross margin softened in May and June and the trend will
continue through the year, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard
said today during a conference call. The U.S. dollar''s strength
against other currencies reduced the value of some sales and
shifts in consumer spending to lower-margin products are also to
blame, he said. </p>
<p>Overall, in Europe, USA, and Western economies
particularly, we''re going to see a protracted recovery, Kent
said in the interview. The U.S. will come out of this first
and better. </p>

Mover</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) rose to an all-time
closing high after Bank of America Corp. recommended buying the
stock because fiscal 2013 profit estimates may be too low. </p>
<p>Disney added 3.1 percent to $49.35 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain in four months. The shares have advanced
32 percent this year, re-establishing the record high most
recently on July 2. </p>
<p>Bank of America''s earnings estimate of $3.62 a share for
the year that starts in October is 15 cents higher than the
average on Wall Street, analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said in a
research note. Profit may be driven higher by the company''s
theme parks, improving film studio and interactive unit, and
cable networks, she said. </p>
<p>In June, the company opened Cars Land at California
Adventure in Anaheim, California, after raising theme-park
ticket prices. Cars Land, along with lower launch costs at the
parks unit, may add 10 cents in fiscal 2013, Cohen said. </p>
<p>Marvel''s the Avengers, the movie based on comic-book
heroes such as The Hulk, Iron Man and Thor, has generated $613.7
million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales for Disney since May 4
and $1.46 billion worldwide, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. The film, third in revenue all-time to James Cameron''s
Avatar and Titanic, countered John Carter, which
lost $200 million for Disney this year. </p>
<p>Avengers may add 11 cents a share to Disney''s profit
this year, Cohen said. She told clients to buy the stock,

Moore" date="Jul 17, 2012  4:17 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-17/goldman-sachs-profit-falls-11-beating-estimates.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs to Cut $500 Million in Costs on Profit Drop</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
cut $500 million of expenses this year, mostly from
compensation, after reporting the lowest first-half revenue and
earnings in seven years. </p>
<p>We''re controlling the levers that we can, which are
expenses and capital, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar,
56, said today on a conference call with analysts. We
obviously don''t want to go too far on either one because we
think that the world will get better. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, who has run
the company for six years, cut 3,200 jobs in the past 12 months
to contend with a slowdown that he said was a temporary reaction
to the 2008 financial crisis. After revenue in all of the firm''s
businesses fell in the first half of 2012, the company is adding
new cost cuts to the $1.4 billion achieved since last year,
Viniar said. </p>
<p>Second-quarter net income slid to $962 million, or $1.78 a
share, in the three months through June 30, from $1.09 billion,
or $1.85, a year earlier, New York-based Goldman Sachs said
today in a statement. </p>
<p>Earnings beat the highest estimate among 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, boosted by a gain in asset-management
revenue. Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
climbed 0.3 percent to $97.98 in New York trading at 4:15 p.m.,
below the company''s $126.12 in tangible book value per share at
the end of June. The company bought back $1.5 billion of shares
during the quarter, it said today. </p>
<h2>Managing Well'' </h2>
<p>They are managing well in a difficult environment,
Thomas Brown, CEO of Second Curve Capital LLC, said in an
interview with Betty Liu on Bloomberg Television''s In the
Loop. It''s still low profitability. </p>
<p>Return on equity, or ROE, a measure of how well the firm
reinvests shareholders'' money, fell to 5.4 percent in the second
quarter from 6.1 percent a year earlier and 12.2 percent in the
first three months of 2012. </p>
<p>I would not expect that we''re going to have appropriate
ROEs in a macro environment like this, Viniar said, adding
that markets were slower on concern about European government
finances and economic growth in the U.S. and China. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
week said second-quarter profit at its investment bank fell 7
percent from a year earlier even as it reduced costs 12 percent.
Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, reported a 12
percent drop in second-quarter earnings yesterday and said it
lowered total operating expenses 6 percent. </p>
<h2>Asset Management </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s second-quarter revenue from asset
management rose 5 percent to $1.33 billion, exceeding the $1.18
billion average estimate of seven analysts. The figure was
boosted by $217 million in so-called incentive fees, which the
funds collect from clients based on their performance. </p>
<p>Viniar said incentive fees were helped this quarter by an
April sale by Goldman Sachs''s private-equity funds of $2.5
billion in shares of Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,
known as ICBC. Without that transaction, the fees would have
been less than $100 million, he said in response to an analyst''s
question. </p>
<p>Investing  Lending, the segment that includes Goldman
Sachs''s profits and losses from stakes in private-equity and
hedge funds as well as from companies such as ICBC and Facebook
Inc. (FB), produced a $203 million gain in the second quarter, down
from a $1.04 billion gain a year earlier. The estimates of seven
analysts polled by Bloomberg ranged from a $700 million loss to
a $200 million gain. </p>
<h2>Volatile Business'' </h2>
<p>Investing  Lending is a volatile business -- you do ask
questions as to whether investors want to be in this business,
said Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Mediobanca SpA in
London, who rates Goldman Sachs shares neutral. </p>
<p>In Facebook''s initial public offering in May, Goldman Sachs
sold 6.18 million of the 14.2 million shares in its own account
as well as 22.5 million of the 51.7 million shares held in funds
managed for clients, according to the Facebook prospectus. After
being sold at $38 apiece in the IPO, which Goldman Sachs helped
to manage, Facebook shares have dropped, closing yesterday at
$28.25. </p>
<p>Major global stock market indexes including the Standard 
Poor''s 500 (SPX) and Hang Seng Index (HSI) dropped in the second quarter
amid signs of slowing economic growth in China and the
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe. </p>
<p>Market conditions deteriorated and activity levels for
both corporate and investing clients were lower given continued
instability in Europe and concerns about global growth,
Blankfein said in the statement. </p>
<h2>Banking Unit </h2>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that Goldman
Sachs is targeting $100 billion in loans from its banking
subsidiary, up from $12 billion at the end of March, as it
places more emphasis on a deposit-taking and lending unit run by
Esta E. Stecher. Blankfein was quoted in the article saying it
is a no-brainer that we''ll build our banking business. </p>
<p>Asked about the plans on today''s conference call, Viniar
downplayed them, calling the account an overstatement of the
company''s strategy of offering loans to wealthy individuals and
corporate clients from its banking unit. </p>
<p>We''re raising deposits and we''ll use some of those
deposits for private individual loans, some of it for corporate
loans, but we''re not a retail bank, Viniar said. We don''t
have branches, we''re not going to bring in $1 trillion of
deposits, and so there is no change in the strategy of Goldman
Sachs. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had $50.9 billion in deposits at the end of
March, a fraction of the $1.13 trillion held by JPMorgan,
according to company filings. </p>
<h2>Revenue Decline </h2>
<p>Second-quarter revenue at Goldman Sachs fell 9 percent from
a year earlier to $6.63 billion and was down 33 percent from the
first quarter. The average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for $6.25 billion. </p>
<p>For the first six months of the year, Goldman Sachs
produced $16.6 billion of revenue, down 14 percent from a year
earlier and the lowest since $11.2 billion in 2005. Net income
of $3.07 billion in the first six months was the lowest since
the company made $2.38 billion in the first half of fiscal 2008. </p>
<p>The firm, which began counting consultants and temporary
workers in its staff numbers in 2009, said today it employed
32,300 people on June 29, down from 32,400 at the end of March.
At the end of the first half of 2008, the company had 21,800
full-time employees. </p>
<p>Second-quarter expenses of $5.21 billion were down 8
percent from a year earlier. Compensation, the biggest portion
of the firm''s expenses, fell 9 percent to $2.92 billion. </p>
<h2>Compensation Costs </h2>
<p>For the first six months of the year, the compensation
cost, which includes salaries, bonuses, benefits and the expense
for awards granted in previous years, totaled $7.29 billion, or
44 percent of revenue. That''s an average of $225,789 per
employee, down from $237,662 a year earlier. </p>
<p>Viniar said he expects most of the extra $500 million in
cost savings to be people related, even though he said the
number of employees at the firm will probably increase when the
firm brings in junior recruits this summer. Compensation will
decline because we''ll have a more junior and less senior
weighted headcount, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) can''t show that
25 e-mails sought in an investigation of possible energy-market
manipulation contain advice from lawyers and should remain out
of reach of regulators, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission told a federal magistrate. </p>
<p>The agency, in a filing today in U.S. District Court in
Washington, said that JPMorgan made identical attorney-client
privilege claims for 28 other e-mails that were later turned
over to regulators. Some of the earlier e-mails that JPMorgan
claimed contained legal advice were messages that said Great
job compliance, Are you being sarcastic? and Plse call
ASAP, according to the filing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s current privilege claims are the same as those
it improperly made about unprivileged documents, Thomas Olson
and Vivian Chum, lawyers for the agency, wrote in the filing. </p>
<p>FERC sued JPMorgan on July 2 to release the e-mails in an
investigation of possible manipulation of power markets in
California and the Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp.
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly directed JPMorgan to
explain why the e-mails shouldn''t be turned over to
investigators. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, submitted copies of the e-
mails to the court on July 13 so they can be examined by U.S.
Magistrate Deborah Robinson, who is handling the dispute. </p>
<h2>Advice of Counsel'' </h2>
<p>Each of the e-mails relates to the advice of counsel with
respect to the investigation -- not the adoption of the bidding
practices under investigation, Michele Roberts, a lawyer for
JPMorgan, wrote in the bank''s filing. The only possible use
the commission could make of the e-mails would be to peer into
the details of respondent''s legal strategy. </p>
<p>FERC opened the probe in August after complaints from
California and Midwest grid operators that JPMorgan''s bidding
practices were abusive, according to the agency''s initial court
filing. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn''t
immediately comment on today''s filing because she hadn''t seen it
yet. Mary O''Driscoll, a FERC spokeswoman, didn''t immediately
respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the filing. </p>
<p>The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut jobs
and money to pay employees and will seek $500 million in
additional cost reductions this year after first-half revenue
fell to the lowest since 2005. </p>
<p>Compensation, which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses
and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, dropped
14 percent to $7.29 billion in the first six months, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. Revenue in the same
period dropped 14 percent to $16.6 billion. </p>
<p>Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, has cut 1,000 jobs this year to
counter the slowest first-half since before he became chairman
and chief executive officer in mid-2006. Trading, which
contributed about 60 percent of the bank''s revenue in 2011,
dropped 6 percent in the first half from a year earlier.
Blankfein said last month he thinks the slowdown is a temporary
reaction to the financial crisis. </p>
<p>We''re very cognizant of the returns our shareholders get
versus what our employees get, Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar said on a conference call with analysts. Compensation
will probably be the primary target for additional cost
reductions, he said. The bank will add junior employees and will
try to strike a balance to avoid losing talent, he said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) risks European Union
penalties for failing to comply with a settlement to give users
a choice of web browsers, more than two years after it tried to
end a decade-long clash with antitrust regulators. </p>
<p>EU Competition Commission Joaquin Almunia said Microsoft
may have misled regulators by failing to display a browser
choice screen to users of the Windows operating system since
February 2011. The world''s largest software company blamed a
technical error for not showing the screen to some users and
offered to extend its commitment until March 2016. </p>
<p>Microsoft has already been fined 1.68 billion euros ($2.06
billion) in EU antitrust probes, including an 899 million-euro
penalty for failing to obey an order to share data with
competitors. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed to
offer access to rival browsers as a part of a 2009 settlement to
repair its relationship with the bloc''s regulators. It told
regulators last December that it was complying with its
commitments. </p>
<p>I trusted that the company''s reports were accurate, EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in an e-mailed
statement. If, following our investigation, the infringement
was confirmed, Microsoft should expect sanctions. </p>
<p>Microsoft said it only learned this month that it didn''t
offer its browser choice software to some 28 million computers
running Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the computers
that should have received it. It blamed a technical error and
said it has already started distributing a fix. </p>
<h2>Deep Regret'' </h2>
<p>We deeply regret that this error occurred and we
apologize for it, Microsoft said in a statement. We
understand that the commission may decide to impose other
sanctions. </p>
<p>Almunia said he may have to step up how regulators
supervise companies'' commitments to end antitrust probes. </p>
<p>Recent binding pledges by Standard  Poor''s (MHP) and Electricite
de France SA (EDF) are particularly complex and require
strengthening of our monitoring, Almunia told reporters in
Brussels. </p>
<p>Michael Privitera, a spokesman for Standard  Poor''s in New
York, declined to immediately comment. EDF in Paris declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Regulators only became aware that Microsoft''s browser
choice screens weren''t working when they received complaints, he
said, without identifying who had alerted the EU. </p>
<p>The EU''s new probe is a real surprise, given Microsoft''s
long and painful past with regulators and earlier fines
imposed for not complying with the earlier investigation, said
Mark Tricker, a lawyer with Norton Rose LLP in Brussels. </p>
<h2>Repeat Offenses </h2>
<p>Any fines for Microsoft may take into account repeat
offenses, Almunia said in a reference to the EU''s 2008 penalty
for the company''s failure to obey an earlier EU decision. That
ruling ordered it to provide information to software developers
to make compatible products. EU antitrust fines are usually
capped at 10 percent of yearly revenue. </p>
<p>Under the terms of Microsoft''s 2009 pledge, consumers who
buy personal computers were given a choice of the 12 most widely
used browsers to install in addition to, or instead of,
Microsoft''s Internet Explorer. Microsoft said today that it
would extend this browser choice for an extra 15 months, or
until March 2016. </p>
<p>After settling with the EU, Microsoft moved to the other
side of the fence, filing complaints against Google Inc. (GOOG) and
what is now its Motorola Mobility unit for alleged antitrust
violations. </p>
<p>Microsoft declined 0.7 percent to $29.25 at 11:21 a.m. in
New York. </p>

<p>The White House opened the doors to
Wall Street today with a visit from Lloyd Blankfein, the chief
executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), who was in the
capital to speak at the Economic Club of Washington. </p>
<p>Blankfein was to meet with Jack Lew, President Barack Obama''s chief of staff, according to an administration official.
Obama isn''t scheduled to see the Goldman chief. </p>
<p>The president has had an icy relationship with Wall Street
during his time in office as he''s pushed for greater regulation
of the financial industry. He''s recently been criticized in the
financial community for what some see as a vilification of the
industry as he campaigns against Republican presidential
candidate Mitt Romney, the co-founder of Boston-based private
equity firm Bain Capital LLC. </p>
<p>Employees of Goldman Sachs are the biggest single source of
donations directly to the Romney presidential campaign and are
the top givers to the joint fundraising committee he has set up
with the Republican Party. </p>
<p>Blankfein, 57, hasn''t donated to either Romney or Obama,
according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics
in Washington. </p>
<p>The last time Blankfein visited the White House was on Oct.
12 for a meeting with Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama
who is also an administration liaison to the business community.
Before today, visitor logs show he had been to 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave. 15 times, six of those times to meet with the president. </p>

<p>Allegations of interest-rate rigging
by global banks are hurting the financial system by undermining
trust, said Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>The biggest impact is once more undermining the integrity
of the system that has already been undermined so
substantially, Blankfein, 57, said today at a lunch held by
the Economic Club of Washington, where he was interviewed by
Carlyle Group LP (CG) co-CEO David Rubenstein. There was this huge
hole to dig out of in terms of getting trust back and now it''s
just that much deeper. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, isn''t
among the banks serving on panels that set the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor. Barclays Plc''s chairman, CEO and chief
operating officer all said they would step down after that bank
agreed to pay 290 million pounds ($454 million) for manipulating
Libor. Other banks remain under investigation. </p>
<p>Blankfein, whose firm reaped 58 percent of first-half
revenue from trading, said financial markets are damaged by a
lack of trust. </p>
<p>Uncertainty is something that puts a burden on things --
it makes spreads wider, harder to transact, Blankfein said.
But also a lack of trust is certainly at least a cousin of
that. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said yesterday it plans to cut $500 million
of expenses this year, mostly from compensation, after reporting
the lowest first-half revenue and earnings since 2005.
Blankfein, who has run the company for six years, said last
month that business is suffering a temporary slump in reaction
to the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<h2>Natural Optimist </h2>
<p>Sentiment is very bad, and for real reasons, Blankfein
said today. But by and large the world advances and gets
better most of the time, he said, adding that he is optimistic
partly because it''s his personality and partly because history
shows things eventually improve. </p>
<p>His own firm''s business units are affected by global growth
and market sentiment, he said, adding that you could not find
a part of the cycle where all those activities would be at a
lower ebb than today. </p>
<p>There are certain things that are cyclical which we don''t
want to overreact to, he said. Still, cycles can be severe,
and last a long time. </p>
<p>Blankfein, in an opinion piece published today on
Politico.com, called on U.S. politicians to agree on a long-term
deficit-reduction plan modeled on recommendations by former
Republican Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, chief of
staff under former President Bill Clinton. </p>
<h2>Folly March </h2>
<p>I wrote a note earlier today arguing militantly for
moderation and compromise because this is really a march of
folly to have things go to extremes, Blankfein said at the
lunch. I would capitulate on either side rather than have
these things go on. </p>
<p>Blankfein was set to visit the White House today to meet
with Jack Lew, President Barack Obama''s chief of staff,
according to an administration official. Obama isn''t scheduled
to meet with him. </p>
<p>While Blankfein said he''s worried about Europe and sees
a not insignificant possibility that there could be an
unraveling of the euro currency bloc, he doesn''t expect that
to happen. He said he finds it easier to forecast emerging
markets 10 years into the future than 10 months, as short-term
setbacks could interrupt what he perceives to be a positive
trend for those faster-growing countries. </p>
<h2>Job Applications </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs had 12 percent more applicants for jobs this
year than a year earlier and more than 80 percent accepted
offers. He said that even Harvard University, where Blankfein
attended college and law school, would be pleased to have a
yield above 80 percent. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has learned it has to make more of an effort
to help the public understand its business, Blankfein said. When
Rubenstein asked if he has any aspiration to go into government
like many of his predecessors, Blankfein quipped: I have
aspirations to be desired. </p>
<p>He said he wants his legacy at Goldman Sachs to be about
leading the firm through strong years as well as in the
aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>Blankfein wants to make sure that we prove ourselves
resilient and come out as a firm stronger on the other side
financially and in terms of the contributions we make and
frankly with an enhanced reputation with the general public,
he said. </p>
<p>About 460 people attended the lunch at the 25-year-old
Economic Club of Washington, which has about 600 members.
Blankfein''s discussion today follows appearances at the St.
Petersburg International Economic Forum, the Chicago Club and on
MSNBC last month. His public appearances have increased since
the firm hired Richard L. Jake Siewert Jr., a former aide to
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, as global head of
communications in March. </p>
<p>In the past we were a little mysterious and that was a
big problem, Blankfein said. </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC), which
operates the Royalton and Mondrian boutique brands, put its 195-
room Delano South Beach property in Miami Beach, Florida, on the
market, according to the broker with the listing. </p>
<p>The New York-based hotelier hired Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels
to market the property, Jeffrey Davis, a managing director at
the brokerage, said in an e-mail today. Morgans in March
completed a $10.8 million renovation of the property, including
work on public areas and the makeover of its Bianca restaurant. </p>
<p>Our focus is on building out our management business, and
part of this strategy is to monetize our investments in real
estate, Morgans Chief Executive Officer Michael Gross said in
an e-mail today. He declined to comment on the listing of Delano
South Beach. </p>
<p>Morgans has been selling some properties and using the
proceeds to expand its management operations. The company last
year sold the Mondrian Los Angeles to Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB)
for $137 million. The hotel was developed by Ian Schrager, the
Morgans founder who left the company in 2005. </p>
<p>The Delano South Beach listing was reported earlier today
by Real Estate Alert. The property has an estimated value of
$200 million, or about $1 million a room, the newsletter said,
without citing a source for the figure. </p>
<p>Another luxury hotel in the city, the 1,504-room
Fontainebleau Miami Beach, was appraised at $1.1 billion, or
about $731,000 a room, as part of an April refinancing,
according to data from New York-based research company Real
Capital Analytics Inc. </p>
<p>Occupancies at hotels in Florida were the third-highest in
the U.S., at 71 percent this year through April, behind only
Hawaii and Washington, D.C., according to Smith Travel Research
Inc. Luxury hotels, a category that includes Delano South Beach,
had the highest occupancies, at 72 percent, among the seven
segments tracked by the Hendersonville, Tennessee-based data
company. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Douglas Niemann to be a managing
director as it builds a group to oversee about $39.5 billion in
general account assets for insurance clients. </p>
<p>Niemann, who previously worked at American International
Group Inc. (AIG), joined JPMorgan this month to lead the unit''s
strategy and analytics, according to Matt Malloy, head of global
insurance solutions at the New York-based bank''s asset-
management arm. Malloy has made at least four other senior hires
since the beginning of the year, bringing his team to more than
30 people globally. </p>
<p>We continue to see a lot of opportunity to partner with
insurance companies, Malloy said in a phone interview
yesterday. We''ve invested in people, and a lot of that has
culminated over the last several months. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and BlackRock Inc. (BLK) are
among firms vying to manage money for insurers facing pressure
from low interest rates and new regulations. General-account
assets overseen by the largest fund managers surged by about 20
percent annually from 2001 to 2009, to more than $1 trillion,
according to a report by Swiss Re Ltd. </p>
<p>That trend will probably continue, said Malloy. Mandates
from insurers in the U.S. and developed parts of Asia have been
driving growth while outsourcing from European insurers will
increase, he said. JPMorgan has boosted its number of insurance
asset-management clients by about 40 percent since the end of
2010. </p>
<h2>Investment Income </h2>
<p>Plunging bond yields have put pressure on insurers'' income
as they''re forced to reinvest proceeds from maturing securities
at lower rates. That''s made it more difficult for life insurers
to meet returns they''ve guaranteed customers on retirement
products and for property-casualty insurers to post a profit
when they lose money on underwriting. </p>
<p>Part of Niemann''s job will be to advise insurance clients
on investments, said Malloy. Niemann has worked at Zurich
Insurance Group AG, where he managed the market risk for
investment portfolios worldwide. He holds an MBA from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Business and a
bachelor''s degree from Northwestern University. </p>
<p>Other recent hires in the group include managing directors
Greg Tell, who joined this month from MetLife Inc. (MET) to oversee
fixed-income investments in New York, and Pat Tuttle in Chicago.
Neil Moge was hired as an executive director in London in
January, while Jeffrey Xia joined the group as a vice president
in the first quarter. JPMorgan has also been investing in its
technology to support its insurance clients, Malloy said. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and BlackRock had the most insurer general
account assets under management at the end of last year, with
more than $200 billion apiece, according to a preliminary survey
by Insurance Asset Manager, a trade publication. Conning was the
third-largest with $86 billion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, with $59.5 billion in general account assets
under management, has boosted investment in its business that
oversees insurer funds, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
and President Gary Cohn wrote in the bank''s most recent annual
report. Outsourcing has been accelerated by new capital
regimes, greater demand as a result of the financial crisis and
a sustained low interest rate environment, they wrote. </p>

<p>Visa Europe Ltd. should match
MasterCard Inc.''s lower fees for credit cards to settle a
European Union antitrust investigation, the EU''s antitrust chief
said. </p>
<p>EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said he hoped
that Visa Europe, operator of the largest payment-card network
in the 27-nation EU, would reduce the fees it charges for cross-
border credit-card transactions to the level we have agreed in
the past with MasterCard to end a five-year probe. </p>
<p>I think the best way to advance is, as a first step, to
agree on this 0.3 percent to be on equal terms with its main
competitor MasterCard, Almunia told Bloomberg News in an
interview on July 16. In this area it''s better to reach
agreements. </p>
<p>Almunia said in May that total costs retailers face to
handle payments haven''t decreased since 2006. Regulators settled
earlier probes into Visa Europe and MasterCard concerning the
fees they charge on debit card transactions outside a user''s
home country. Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard and some of the biggest U.S.
banks this month agreed to a U.S. settlement of at least $6.05
billion in a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-
card swipe fees. </p>
<p>Visa Europe is committed to continuing dialog to reach a
commercially acceptable agreement setting credit and deferred-
debit interchange fees, said Amanda Kamin, a spokeswoman for
the company in London. </p>
<h2>Debit Cards </h2>
<p>Visa Europe reduced similar fees for debit cards last year
to settle a 2009 EU complaint. The company split from Visa Inc.
before the U.S. card company''s initial public offering in early
2008. </p>
<p>Almunia will meet with Visa Europe''s Chief Executive
Officer Peter Ayliffe next week, he said. The EU is continuing
its investigation into the card fees and is still waiting for
proposals from the company on any possible settlement. He didn''t
rule out sending an antitrust complaint to Visa Europe. </p>
<p>It''s a possibility during the next steps of investigation
additional objections can appear, Almunia said. </p>
<p>The EU commissioner said a May court decision backing
regulators'' curb on MasterCard (MA)''s cross-border card fees should
encourage Visa to follow the route of an agreement and not to
continue the confrontational approach. </p>
<p>The EU''s General Court rejected MasterCard''s challenge to
the EU decision that it unfairly inflated the transaction fees
paid by retailers for processing payments. MasterCard will
appeal the case to the EU''s highest court. </p>
<p>Retailers have long complained about the cost they are
charged to accept card payments. Unlike for checks, banks charge
interchange fees to process debit- and credit-card payments.
Card operators set the amounts, own the payment networks and
pass the money to the lenders. The retailer''s bank pays the fees
to the customer''s card issuer. </p>

<p>(Corrects spelling of BGC Partners in final paragraph.) </p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) reported fourth-
quarter unearned revenue, a yardstick of future sales, that
topped analysts'' estimates, a sign that the largest software
maker will benefit from corporate demand for its programs. </p>
<p>Unearned revenue was $20.1 billion in the three months that
ended June 30, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today in
a statement. Analysts on average expected $19.4 billion,
according to Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. Bellini''s own estimate was for $18.9 billion. Profit --
excluding a writedown that gave Microsoft its first loss as a
publicly traded company -- also topped estimates after Microsoft
reined in expenses. </p>
<p>Unearned sales got a boost as companies placed multiyear
orders for such products as Office and database software, even
as they delayed other technology purchases amid weakness in the
economy. Business buying helped compensate for diminished demand
from consumers awaiting the Oct. 26 release of Windows 8, the
next version of Microsoft''s main operating system, or opting for
machines made by Apple Inc. and other competitors. </p>
<p>The deferred revenue number was pretty good, which gives
you an indication of future growth, so that''s encouraging,
said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities
who rates the shares sector perform. Given all we know
about weakness in PCs, it''s not surprising that sales numbers
came in a little light particularly on the Windows side. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C)
are among Wall Street firms preparing to eliminate jobs as
first-half revenue dropped for a third straight year. </p>
<p>Headcount at Morgan Stanley will decline by about 700 in
the second half, bringing total 2012 staff reductions to 4,000,
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, said yesterday in an
interview. Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Europe''s biggest lender by assets, 
is considering about 1,000 job cuts at its investment bank, 
while Citigroup plans to chop about 350, people with knowledge 
of the decisions said this week. </p>
<p>Trading and investment-banking revenue at the five largest
Wall Street firms fell 18 percent in the second quarter as deal
and trading volume dropped amid concern that Greece would leave
the euro and the region''s sovereign-debt crisis would spread to
other nations including Spain. The decline led to questions
about whether banks could cut costs to improve returns. </p>
<p>All of these earnings that came out, none of them changed
the fundamental problem, which is Europe is in disarray and
nobody is taking risk, Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. analyst, said on Bloomberg Television. You have an
environment where the Street can only tighten its belt. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, plans to trim $3 billion in annual expenses from its
investment-banking, trading and wealth-management units. The
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender didn''t say how many jobs
it would be eliminating. </p>
<h2>Junior Employees </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to cut $500 million of
expenses this year, mostly from compensation, after reporting
the lowest first-half revenue and earnings in seven years. Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar said the firm''s headcount
would feature a greater proportion of junior employees by the
end of the year. </p>
<p>We''re controlling the levers that we can, which are
expenses and capital, Viniar, 57, said this week on a
conference call with analysts. </p>
<p>The cuts announced over the past week may be a precursor to
more staff reductions by banks, said analysts including Charles Peabody of Portales Partners LLC in New York. </p>
<p>It''s tough to make money in this environment, and so I
think there''s going to be a further round of cuts, Peabody
said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank, is planning the
cuts in its securities division, which includes investment
banking and trading, according to a person with knowledge of the
matter. The firm previously disclosed plans to eliminate 1,200
jobs from the unit. </p>
<p>We are not oblivious to the fact that our cost structure
cannot be justified by our current revenue, Chief Financial
Officer John Gerspach said in January. While much of the
current difficulty reflects market conditions, we equally have
some management and execution challenges. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) fell in New York
trading after reporting a 50 percent drop in earnings on the
biggest decline in trading revenue among Wall Street firms. The
company said it will cut headcount by 4,000 this year. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley slid 5.3 percent to $13.25, the biggest
decline since March 6, after second-quarter net income decreased
to $591 million from $1.19 billion a year earlier. The stock''s
12 percent fall this year is the largest among the 10 biggest
U.S. banks. </p>
<p>The 48 percent drop in trading revenue, which plunged to
the lowest level since Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54,
took over in January 2010, compares with an increase of more
than 11 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Clients shied away
from doing business with the firm while Moody''s Investors
Service weighed a credit-rating downgrade, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>The fixed-income results were very weak, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New York who
rates the stock sector perform. Strength tends to beget
strength and weakness weakness, so I think on the fixed-income
side they''re going to end up being a loser. </p>
<p>Excluding accounting adjustments, profit was 16 cents a
share, below the 29-cent average estimate of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. On that basis, the firm''s return on
equity was about 2 percent, below Gorman''s goal of 15 percent. </p>
<h2>Mayo''s Upgrade </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley shares pared their decline after Mike Mayo,
an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities (USA), raised his
rating to outperform from underperform. Mayo''s price target is
$16. The stock is 55 percent below where it traded when Gorman
took over, and is trading at about half the firm''s liquidation
value. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has already cut 3,272 jobs since the start
of 2012 and expects that number to climb to 4,000 by year''s end,
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview.
Reductions will be gradual and some may come from attrition, she
said. About 350 jobs were eliminated with the sale of U.K.
wealth manager Quilter Holdings Ltd. in April. </p>
<p>Revenue dropped to $6.95 billion from $9.21 billion a year
earlier. Book value per share rose to $31.02 from $30.74 at the
end of March. </p>
<p>Second-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading,
which is run by Ken deRegt, along with commodity trading co-
heads Colin Bryce, and Simon Greenshields, all 56 years old, was
$770 million, excluding the accounting gain. That missed
estimates of $1.1 billion from Citigroup Inc.''s Keith Horowitz,
and $1.39 billion from Barclays Plc''s Roger Freeman. </p>
<h2>Shrinking Unit </h2>
<p>Gorman vowed to shrink the fixed-income division in order
to free up capital and improve returns. Risk-weighted assets in
the unit have already been cut 15 percent in the past nine
months, he said. The reduction will reach 25 percent by the end
of 2013, Gorman said on a conference call with analysts,
declining to provide the firm''s total risk-weighted assets,
known as RWAs. </p>
<p>The accounting gain is known as a debt-valuation
adjustment, or DVA. It stems from a decline in the price of the
company''s bonds, under the theory it would be cheaper to buy
back the debt. Morgan Stanley booked $2 billion of losses in the
first quarter as cost of repurchasing the debt rose. </p>
<p>Fixed-income revenue was down 70 percent from $2.59 billion
in the first quarter and 60 percent from $1.9 billion in the
second quarter of 2011. Goldman Sachs (GS)''s fixed-income revenue,
excluding DVA, climbed more than 40 percent from a year earlier
to $2.19 billion. Citigroup''s fell 4 percent to $2.82 billion,
while JPMorgan Chase  Co. posted a 17 percent decline to $3.49
billion. </p>
<h2>Rating Cut </h2>
<p>Porat said the results included a $225 million charge
related to $2.9 billion of collateral it had to post after
Moody''s cut the firm''s credit rating by two levels last month.
The ratings review also hurt client activity with the firm,
Porat said. </p>
<p>As the speculation on the ratings outcome lingered,
clients did seem to take a wait-and-see approach, she said.
Having that ratings action addressed, now having clarity on it
and having that uncertainty gone, we''re seeing real relief among
clients. Clients have re-engaged, and it''s good to have it
behind us. </p>
<p>In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, 43, Morgan
Stanley''s revenue fell 36 percent from the year-earlier period
to $1.14 billion, excluding DVA. That was a 38 percent decline
from the first quarter''s $1.83 billion, and compared with $1.7
billion at Goldman Sachs, $1.04 billion at JPMorgan and $550
million at Citigroup. Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, had estimated revenue of $1.45 billion, while
Barclays''s Freeman estimated $1.38 billion. </p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs </h2>
<p>Citigroup on July 16 beat analysts'' estimates on revenue
from advising on mergers, corporate lending and underwriting
stocks and bonds. Goldman Sachs said the next day it plans to
cut $500 million in expenses after reporting the lowest first-
half revenue and earnings in seven years. Both companies are
based in New York. </p>
<p>The two companies cited a decline in trading and merger
volume amid concern that Greece would leave the euro and the
region''s debt crisis would spread to nations including Spain and
Italy. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s credit-default swaps have fallen since
June 21, when Moody''s cut the firm''s credit rating two grades
instead of the threatened three levels. Morgan Stanley avoided
the biggest potential downgrade among U.S. firms because of
support from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., its largest
shareholder, Moody''s said. </p>
<h2>Collateral Call </h2>
<p>The firm had to post collateral of $2.9 billion as a result
of the downgrade, the company said today. Counterparties have
called another $800 million so far in July, and the pace of
demands has been measured, Porat said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $884 million in second-quarter
revenue from investment banking, which is overseen by Paul J. Taubman, 51. That figure, down 40 percent from a year earlier,
included $263 million from financial advisory, $283 million from
equity underwriting and $338 million from debt underwriting. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was the second-ranked equity underwriter in
the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the
lead underwriter on Facebook Inc.''s initial public offering,
which set a record for technology companies by raising more than
$16 billion. The stock has dropped 23 percent since the IPO,
leading to shareholder lawsuits claiming the company and its
underwriters overpriced Facebook at $38 a share. </p>
<h2>Same Process </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley said it adhered to the same procedures it
follows for all IPOs and complied with all applicable
regulations. </p>
<p>Global wealth management, overseen by Greg Fleming, 49,
posted pretax income of $393 million, up from $317 million a
year earlier, as revenue fell 4 percent to $3.31 billion. The
division''s pretax profit margin rose to 12 percent from 9
percent in the second quarter of 2011. </p>
<p>Gorman said the bank finished the technology integration of
the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney brokerage this month. He has
previously said his target is a 20 percent pretax margin. The
figure was 11 percent in the first quarter, and Fleming has
vowed to raise the margin to mid-teens by the middle of next
year. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said in May it would exercise the option to
buy a 14 percent stake in the venture from Citigroup, increasing
its ownership to 65 percent. The two companies'' valuations of
the unit''s value were more than 10 percent apart, requiring a
third-party appraiser to complete the deal, Porat said in the
interview. </p>
<p>Asset management reported a pretax gain of $43 million,
down from $168 million in the previous year''s period. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits decreased 21 percent from the
year-earlier quarter to $3.63 billion, or 52 percent of the
firm''s overall revenue. The ratio was higher than in the second
quarter of 2011, when the bank set aside 50 percent of revenue. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) is loading a
liquefied natural gas carrier in Spain for export to Japan, two
people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The LNG Swift tanker is headed for Tokyo Gas Co.''s import
terminal at Sodegaura in Chiba prefecture, the country''s largest,
one of the people said, who declined to be identified because
the information isn''t public. The other person said the buyer
was a Japanese utility. </p>
<p>A tanker is due to load 125,000 cubic meters of LNG at
Cartagena in southeast Spain from today through July 22,
according to the website of Enagas SA (ENG), Spain''s gas-network
operator. The company didn''t provide the vessel''s name. The LNG
Swift, with a capacity of 127,580 cubic meters, arrived at
Cartagena today, IHS Inc. (IHS) data on Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>LNG fell for a seventh week to $14 a million British
thermal units, according to World Gas Intelligence''s latest
assessment published yesterday. Prices for delivery to
Northeast Asia in four to eight weeks reached a three-year high
of $18.40 a million Btu on May 28, according to WGI. That was
the highest in more than three years. </p>
<p>Japan, the world''s biggest market for LNG, purchased a
record 83.18 million metric tons from overseas in the fiscal
year ended March, up 18 percent from the previous 12 months, the
finance ministry said in April. That followed the closure of its
nuclear power stations in the wake of meltdowns at the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant in March 2011. </p>
<h2>$41 Million </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s cargo is worth more than $41 million at
current Asian spot prices, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Hugh Fraser, a spokesman for the bank in London, declined to
comment when reached by phone today. </p>
<p>Spain is prioritizing its domestic coal industry over gas
for power generation. Combined with weaker fuel demand because
of the economic crisis, the country is oversupplied with gas,
stimulating re-exports of previously-imported gas from storage
tanks at terminals. </p>
<p>Sixteen LNG cargoes were re-exported from Spanish terminals
last year, according to data from Paris-based lobby group
International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers, known as
GIIGNL. </p>

<p>Second-quarter net income was $591 million, or 29 cents a

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Jul 19, 2012  8:50 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-19/morgan-stanley-cuts-pay-pool-for-investment-bank-by-15-.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Cuts Pay Pool for Investment Bank by 15%</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, set aside $3.53 billion in the first six
months to pay investment bank employee salaries, bonuses and
benefits, down 15 percent from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Pay at the institutional-securities unit, which employs
traders and bankers, was 57 percent of revenue, compared with 47
percent in the first half of 2011, according to the New York-
based company''s website. The unit''s revenue fell 28 percent to
$6.26 billion during the period. Compensation and benefits for
the whole company totaled $8.06 billion, down 9.5 percent. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms are looking to cut expenses as revenue
from investment banking and trading fell for the seventh time in
eight quarters. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will seek $500 million
in additional cost reductions this year after first-half revenue
fell to the lowest since 2005. Bank of America Corp. plans to
trim $3 billion in annual expenses from investment banking,
trading and wealth-management units. </p>
<p>Adjusted for accounting gains and losses related to the
firm''s credit spreads, known as debt-valuation adjustments or
DVA, first-half revenue at the institutional-securities unit
fell 9.1 percent to $7.89 billion. The ratio of compensation to
revenue on that basis fell to 45 percent in the first half of
2012 from 48 percent in the same period last year. </p>
<h2>Companywide Compensation </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s companywide compensation, the firm''s
largest expense, was enough to pay each of its 58,627 employees
$137,548 for the six months, down from $142,337 for each of the
62,577 employees at the end of the second quarter of 2011,
according to figures released today. The bank, which said today
it plans to reduce headcount by more than 700 over the rest of
the year, doesn''t report how many people work in institutional
securities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage division, which employed 16,934
financial advisers at the end of June compared with 17,987 a
year earlier, set aside $4.1 billion for pay in the first half,
down 3.3 percent from a year earlier. The unit''s compensation
cost, which is set by a fixed grid for many employees, was 61
percent of the division''s revenue, down from 62 percent last
year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs cut 1,000 jobs in the first six months and
slashed pay costs 14 percent to $7.29 billion. The expense, at
44 percent of revenue, is enough to pay each of Goldman Sachs''s
32,300 employees $225,789 for the first half of the year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. lender, cut first-
half compensation expenses at its investment bank 16 percent to
$4.91 billion, or 35 percent of revenue. That would be enough to
pay each of the 26,553 workers in the unit an average of
$184,989 for the period. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees, awarding much of the money as
year-end bonuses. Average pay per worker doesn''t reflect the
amount of money employees actually receive. Top executives and
revenue producers sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards,
while clerical workers get smaller salaries. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered to
identify the person with the most knowledge of possible
regulatory probes of its J.P. Morgan Investment Management and
Chase units related to the labeling of residential real estate-
backed securities as part of a lawsuit by billionaire Len Blavatnik, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>Blavatnik, 55, sued New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, in 2009, claiming it put twice as much
money into risky mortgages as his investment guidelines allowed
while Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was unloading such
securities from the bank''s books. Blavatnik says the bank lost
$98 million of his funds. </p>
<p>New York state Supreme Court Justice Melvin L. Schweitzer
yesterday ordered JPMorgan to identify the person or provide a
sworn affidavit that there is no such investigation after a
thorough and appropriate inquiry within 30 days. </p>
<p>Blavatnik''s lawyers had served JPMorgan with a notice to
name witnesses on a variety of topics, including one related to
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and regulatory probes of
the units, under an agreement to identify witnesses for the
purpose of taking depositions in the case, according to
Schweitzer''s order. </p>
<h2>Discovery Disputes'' </h2>
<p>There have been a number of discovery disputes in this
case and we''re gratified that the court sees this our way,
David Elsberg, a lawyer for Blavatnik at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart
 Sullivan in New York, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The case is scheduled to go to trial in December, according
to court records. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment on the ruling in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>JPMorgan objected to the request and refused to identify
the person, saying Blavatnik''s lawyers hadn''t shown that any
such investigation exists or is likely to exist and that it
would be overly burdensome to determine, and that any such
probe would be irrelevant, according to Schweitzer''s ruling. </p>
<p>The court finds none of these arguments to be
persuasive, Schweitzer wrote. It is not up to the
plaintiff to first show the likelihood of an SEC investigation
before it can ask JPMorgan to identify any person most
knowledgeable about it, according to the judge. </p>
<h2>Industry Practice </h2>
<p>JPMorgan had also said that any such probe would be
irrelevant because it has shown that the way it classified the
investments followed industry practice, an argument that
Schweitzer also rejected. </p>
<p>Industry practice'' in worldwide banking is not always
necessarily synonymous with acceptable or sometimes even lawful
banking practice, Schweitzer said. So even if J.P. Morgan
Investment Management''s practice of classifying securities
collateralized by subprime mortgages as asset-backed securities
complied with industry practice, any SEC investigation relating
to that practice would be relevant, he said. </p>
<p>The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management
Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) had a bigger gain in
multiyear software deals than analysts predicted last quarter, a
sign that businesses are flocking to the company''s programs as
consumers delay purchases or opt for competitors. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter unearned revenue, a yardstick of future
sales, was $20.1 billion in the three months that ended June 30,
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said yesterday in a
statement. Analysts on average expected $19.4 billion, according
to Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Bellini''s own estimate was for $18.9 billion. </p>
<p>Unearned sales got a boost as companies placed long-term
orders for such products as Office and database software.
Business buying helped compensate for diminished demand from
consumers awaiting the Oct. 26 release of Windows 8, the next
version of Microsoft''s main operating system, or opting for
tablets made by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other computer manufacturers. </p>
<p>Microsoft is a very strong enterprise player, Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis Sayles  Co., said in an interview
yesterday. There was lots evidence in tonight''s report that
they are a force to be reckoned with in the enterprise.'''' </p>
<p>Profit -- excluding a writedown that gave Microsoft its
first loss as a publicly traded company -- also topped estimates
after Microsoft reined in expenses. Excluding the writedown,
related to the purchase of AQuantive Inc., profit was 67 cents a
share. That exceeded the 62-cent average estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 4 percent to $18.1 billion, compared with
the $18.2 billion average projection. </p>
<h2>Expense Reduction </h2>
<p>Sales and marketing costs dropped 3.5 percent to $3.78
billion. Those savings, as well as a tax rate that was lower
than analysts had predicted, contributed to profit, Microsoft
Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. </p>
<p>Microsoft shares fell 1.8 percent to $30.12 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 16 percent this year. It fell 5.2
percent in the three months through the end of June, compared
with a 3.3 percent drop for the Standard and Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>During the quarter, Microsoft wrote down $6.2 billion for
the impairment of goodwill related to its $6.3 billion purchase
of Internet-advertising company AQuantive, an indication the
company''s online business won''t grow as quickly as Microsoft
once projected. That non-cash charge is not factored into
analysts'' quarterly profit estimates. </p>
<p>Microsoft said operating expenses for the year that began
July 1 will be $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion, reiterating a
projection made in April. </p>
<h2>PC Weakness </h2>
<p>Revenue in the Windows division fell 13 percent to $4.15
billion, below the $4.44 billion average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. That was the fifth time in seven quarters
that the unit has fallen short. </p>
<p>Consumer PC demand was weaker than corporate demand in the
period, as was the case in other recent quarters, Klein said.
The trend will probably start reversing with the release of
Windows 8, he said. He declined to give a projection. Windows
sales have suffered as some consumers opt for tablets instead of
cheaper laptops running Windows. </p>
<p>Windows 8 has to work for them, Ursillo said. Tablets
are a big phenomenon on the consumer side, and it''s a big pool
of revenue that Microsoft needs to participate in. </p>
<p>Global PC shipments stalled in the quarter, marking a
seventh-straight quarter of tepid growth, amid weakness in
Europe and the growing popularity of tablets, research released
this month by Gartner Inc. showed. </p>
<p>Top chipmaker Intel Corp. (INTC) this week scaled back its annual
sales forecast as personal computer-demand fails to rebound
among consumers in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<h2>Low Expectations </h2>
<p>Tablets with Windows 8, including Microsoft''s first-ever
foray into the computer hardware market with its own Surface
tablet, are set to go on sale Oct. 26. Until then, Microsoft
won''t be able to materially reverse the trend of customers
defecting to rivals'' tablets, Klein has said. </p>
<p>Sales in the Business Division, largely made up of Office
software, rose 7.1 percent to $6.29 billion. That compares with
the $6.35 billion average analyst estimate. </p>
<p>The company is also in the final stages of development on a
new version of Office, code-named Office 15, which was unveiled
and released in a public test version this month. </p>
<p>Server and Tools revenue rose 13 percent to $5.09 billion.
Analysts had estimated $5.18 billion, on average. </p>
<p>Revenue in Entertainment and Devices, the unit that
includes the Xbox gaming console, rose 20 percent to $1.78
billion. That compares with a $1.66 billion average estimate. </p>
<p>It was a great fourth-quarter for them in terms of

Partners LP. Let''s be honest, it wasn''t the highest bar for
them this quarter because of the poor macroeconomic environment
and the PC market. People weren''t expecting that much. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) won a ruling that blocks
generic versions of its drug Lyrica until 2018. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Gregory M. Sleet ruled yesterday that
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and other generic-drug
makers infringed some claims of patents covering Lyrica. He
issued an order barring the generics manufacturers from making
and selling products that infringe until after the patents''
expiration. </p>
<p>He also ordered the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from
approving the generic forms of the drug until the patents''
expiration. </p>
<p>The suit was filed in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware, in April 2009, with Pfizer alleging that patents
6,197,819 and 6,001,876 were infringed. </p>
<p>One of the patents was issued to Northwestern University,
which licensed it exclusively to Pfizer''s Warner-Lambert unit.
The university is a co-plaintiff in the case. </p>
<p>Lyrica is used to control seizures and to treat nerve pain,
including fibromyalgia. </p>

<h2>Samsung Asks to Restrict Apple References to Steve Jobs at Trial </h2>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) asked a federal judge to restrict
references by Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s lawyers to the company''s late founder
Steve Jobs at a jury trial scheduled for July 30 over mobile-
device patents. </p>
<p>Harold McElhinny, a lawyer for Apple, told U.S. District
Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, yesterday that he plans
to show jurors two slides of Jobs during opening statements in
the case. The slides include one when Jobs announced the release
of the iPhone in 2007 -- an announcement that went around the
world, the lawyer said. </p>
<p>I don''t want to see an opening statement where jurors see
15 images of Steve Jobs, Charles K. Verhoeven, a Samsung
attorney, told Koh. </p>
<p>Whether Mr. Jobs made a presentation is not relevant to
their case and excessive use of his image is prejudicial to
the jury, Verhoeven said. It shouldn''t be a popularity
contest. </p>
<p>The dispute over the use Apple plans to make of its iconic
founder came at the conclusion of arguments and rulings over
pretrial issues. In the lawsuit, Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung and Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world''s two
biggest makers of high-end phones, have accused each other of
copying designs and technology for mobile devices. The companies
are fighting patent battles on four continents to retain their
dominance in the $219 billion global smartphone market. </p>
<p>I''m not doing a complete prohibition of Steve Jobs, but
it needs to be relevant, Koh said, adding that she wants to
see the images Apple intends to display before she issues a
final ruling. </p>
<p>The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 12-
cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). </p>

<h2>Trademark </h2>
<h2>Twinings Sued Over Bedtime Blend'' by Oregon Tea Company </h2>
<p>An Oregon tea company founded by members of a Sikh sect
sued Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)''s Twinings North America unit
for trademark infringement. </p>
<p>The defendant is one of the U.K.''s oldest continually
operating businesses, having been active in the tea trade since
1706, according to the company website. </p>
<p>East West Tea Co. of Springfield, Oregon, is suing
Twinings, claiming its Bedtime trademark is infringed. East
West was previously known as Golden Temple of Oregon LLC. </p>
<p>A Sikh leader, Yogi Bhajan, served his students a spiced
tea blend that became known as Yogi Tea, and the students
formed a company to sell and market the tea. He licensed his
name and likeness to the company, and, after his death in 2004,
that license was disputed by his widow. The tea label no longer
bears his likeness. </p>
<p>Golden Temple of Oregon changed its name to East West Tea
Co. in March, as part of bankruptcy proceedings, according to
the SikhDharmaWorldwide website. </p>
<p>In the trademark-infringement suit, East West said it''s
harmed by Twinings''s sale of a Bedtime Blend tea. The Oregon
company claims the public is confused by the name similarity,
and is likely to assume falsely that an affiliation exists
between the two companies. </p>
<p>East West asked the federal court in Eugene, Oregon, to bar
Twinings''s use of Bedtime and Bedtime Blend, and for a
recall and destruction of all products and promotional material
bearing the allegedly infringing marks. </p>
<p>Additionally, East West seeks money damages, Twinings''s
profits derived from the alleged infringement, and awards of
litigation costs and attorney fees. </p>
<p>Twinings didn''t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment. </p>
<p>The case is East West Tea Co. LLC v. R. Twining  Co Ltd.,
12-cv-01298, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon (Eugene). </p>

<h2>WIPO Responds to U.S. Concerns About IT for Iraq, North Korea </h2>
<p>The World Intellectual Property Organization, a United
Nations agency, is taking another look at its technical
assistance programs because of concerns raised about equipment
provided to nations that are subject to UN sanctions. </p>
<p>In the future, any WIPO activity in a country subject to UN
sanctions will be referred to the agency''s legal counsel for
guidance and clearance, WIPO said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The provision of what WIPO calls standard IT equipment
to intellectual-property offices in North Korea and Iran that
has already occurred under the organization''s business-
modernization program is being referred to the appropriate UN
sanctions committee, WIPO said in its statement. </p>
<p>WIPO promotes the use and classification of intellectual
property and is mandated by its 185 member nations to provide
materials to help developing countries modernize their patent
offices. </p>
<p>The U.S. was pressuring WIPO to allow an external probe of
shipments it made to Iran and North Korea because the computer
technology could have been used for military applications. </p>
<p>On July 17, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Howard Berman, members
of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to
WIPO Director General Francis Gurry asking for unfettered
access to all documents and witnesses relating to these
transfers to Iran and North Korea. </p>
<p>The committee has also asked the U.S. government to freeze
all WIPO contributions, according to a separate July 12 letter
from Ros-Lehtinen to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>The U.S. plans to use all elements of American power to
prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, Clinton told
reporters in Jerusalem. Iran has been the subject of four rounds
of UN sanctions, including the supply or sale of equipment and
technology, aimed at curbing the development of such weapons.
The WIPO shipments may violate UN and U.S. sanctions, said Ros-
Lehtinen and Berman. </p>
<p>Iran and North Korea were beneficiaries of standard
information-technology equipment after meeting WIPO''s needs-
assessment and validation procedures, Edward Kwakwa, legal
counsel at the Geneva-based organization, said July 4. </p>

<p>Pfizer (PFE) Inc. must pay $10.4 million
in damages to a woman who blamed the company''s Prempro menopause
drug for her breast cancer, an appeals court said. </p>
<p>Jurors properly awarded Audrey Singleton, who sued Pfizer''s
Wyeth unit over Prempro, compensatory and punitive damages for
the company''s marketing of the drug, the Pennsylvania Superior
Court ruled yesterday. Singleton''s lawyers alleged that Wyeth
hid the drug''s health risks and a jury awarded her damages on
those claims in 2010. </p>
<p>Wyeth''s concerted effort to misdirect physicians from the
dangers of Prempro illustrates the consciousness that its
conduct was not at all reasonable, the three-judge panel said
in upholding the jury''s findings. </p>
<p>The ruling comes as Pfizer officials are working to settle
lawsuits over the menopause drugs. The drugmaker has settled
about 60 percent of cases over the medicines and paid out $896
million, executives said in a May filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has set aside an
additional $330 million to resolve the remaining cases. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. At
one point, Pfizer and its units faced more than 10,000 lawsuits
over the medications. </p>
<h2>Many Patients </h2>
<p>Until 1995, many patients combined Premarin, Wyeth''s
estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made by
Pfizer''s Pharmacia  Upjohn unit. Wyeth combined the two
hormones in Prempro. The drugs are still on the market. </p>
<p>Chris Loder, a spokesman for the company, said the
evidence in this case does not support the plaintiff''s claims,
and that the company is evaluating its next steps. </p>
<p>Esther Berezofsky, one of Singleton''s lawyers, said she was
pleased the intermediate appellate court backed the jury''s
finding that Wyeth officials misled patients and doctors about
Prempro''s risks. </p>
<p>The court affirmed that the evidence established Wyeth''s
conscious and deliberate disregard for the cancer risk
associated with Prempro, Berezofsky said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>Singleton, a mother of three from Alabama, began taking
Prempro in August 1997, according to court filings. The results
of a mammogram at that time were normal, her lawyers said during
the trial. She stopped taking the drug in January 2004 after her
breast cancer diagnosis. </p>
<h2>2010 Verdict </h2>
<p>She sued Wyeth, later acquired by Pfizer, in state court in
Pennsylvania where the company has extensive operations. A
Philadelphia jury awarded her $3.4 million in compensatory
damages and $6 million in punitive damages in February 2010. The
judge in the case later added almost $1 million in interest to
the verdict. </p>
<p>The appellate panel found Singleton''s lawyers presented
enough evidence that Wyeth officials downplayed or hid Prempro''s
health risks to justify the compensatory award. </p>
<p>Jurors also properly weighed whether Wyeth should be held
liable for punitive damages and reasonably concluded Wyeth''s
actions were not justifiable, the judges said in a 30-page
decision. </p>
<p>There is nothing in the record that illustrates the $6
million punitive damages award was grossly excessively as to
shock our sense of justice, the panel wrote. </p>
<p>The case is Singleton v. Wyeth Inc., 050102885, Court of
Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). </p>

<p>U.S. homebuilders are an attractive
investment as the housing market starts a strong recovery
that may drive a surge in new-home sales, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) said in a report today. </p>
<p>Housing has a long list of positives, including rising
prices, job growth, supportive government policies and a decline
in the so-called shadow inventory of homes, Goldman Sachs
analysts Joshua Pollard and Anto Savarirajan wrote in a note to
clients. They raised their rating on the homebuilding industry
to attractive from neutral. </p>
<p>Public homebuilders, which have been taking market share
from closely held companies, reported increasing orders this
year as mortgage rates fell to record lows and the supply of
existing homes for sale shrank. Construction of single-family
houses rose 4.7 percent in June to a 539,000 annual rate, the
fastest in two years, the Commerce Department said last week. </p>
<p>The super cyclical housing market has turned and a strong
recovery in new-home sales is ahead, the Goldman Sachs
analysts wrote. Over the last year a number of risks to the
housing market have abated, giving us confidence that rising
home prices will drive a 3-7 year up-cycle in the U.S. market. </p>
<p>Pollard and Savarirajan added MDC Holdings Inc. (MDC) to its
conviction buy list, raised KB Home (KBH) to buy from neutral,
increased Ryland Group Inc. (RYL) to neutral from sell and lowered NVR
Inc. (NVR) to sell from neutral. They maintained buy ratings on Toll
Brothers Inc. (TOL) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) </p>
<h2>Stocks Gain </h2>
<p>MDC Holdings jumped 5.7 percent, the most since February,
to $33.18 in New York trading. KB Home climbed 3.6 percent to
$10.16, while Ryland added 3.5 percent to $26.64. </p>
<p>The 13-member Bloomberg Industries homebuilder index
reversed earlier losses and increased 1.1 percent. The measure
has rallied 55 percent this year, compared with a 7.4 percent
gain in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy has created enough jobs since the end of
the recession in 2009 to fuel new-home sales at an annual rate
of 550,000 to 600,000, the analysts said. New houses sold at a
pace of 369,000 in May, the highest rate since 2010, the
Commerce Department reported last month. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs analysts estimated new-home sales would
reach 700,000 in 2014. </p>
<h2>U.S. Policies </h2>
<p>Government policies have improved in the past year by
addressing supply instead of demand, the analysts wrote. Recent
programs include the bulk sale of foreclosed single-family homes
to investors who are converting them to rentals, and the
expanded Home Affordable Refinance Program, which allows
refinancing of properties worth less than their mortgages. </p>
<p>Investors have yet to grasp the significant decline in
shadow inventory, as the supply of homes for sale has fallen
to six months from 10 months  in the past two years, Pollard and
Savarirajan wrote. Shadow inventory, or the homes projected to
hit the market through foreclosures and short sales, is down 15
percent in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada and Texas, while
growth in building permits indicates a 34 percent increase in
demand in those states, they said. </p>
<p>Investors are quickly swallowing new foreclosure supply,
limiting shadow inventory and creating a floor for home
prices, Pollard and Savarirajan wrote. We expect any further
decline in inventory to serve as a platform for price
appreciation, further aiding sales. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. and Statoil ASA failed
to sell North Sea Forties crude even after they lowered their
offers from the end of last week. No bids or offers were made
for Russian Urals in Europe. </p>
<p>Nigeria, Africa''s largest oil producer, plans to reduce
exports of benchmark Qua Iboe crude to 10 cargoes of 950,000
barrels each in September, two less than August, a loading plan
obtained by Bloomberg News shows. </p>
<p>Crude exports scheduled for July and August from Total SA''s
Girassol field in Angola are being delayed after an incident. </p>
<h2>North Sea </h2>
<p>Chevron offered a Forties cargo for Aug. 5 to Aug. 7
loading at parity to Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 25
cents on July 20, while Statoil failed to sell at 5 cents more
than the benchmark for Aug. 10 to Aug. 12, down 15 cents from
the previous session, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window. </p>
<p>BP Plc didn''t manage to sell Forties for Aug. 13 to Aug. 15
at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc was unable to sell at a premium of 10 cents for Aug. 7
to Aug. 9, the survey showed. </p>
<p>Vitol Group failed to buy Forties for Aug. 14 to Aug. 18 at
5 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, while Phibro, a unit of
Occidental Petroleum Corp., didn''t find sellers for the blend
for Aug. 13 to Aug. 18 at a discount of 15 cents, according to
the survey. </p>
<p>Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was at 3 cents a barrel less
than Dated Brent, the lowest since July 3, compared with a
premium of 4 cents on July 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Brent for September settlement traded at $103.62 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $106.50 on July 20. The October contract was
at $102.86, a discount of 76 cents to September. </p>
<p>Cnooc Ltd.  agreed to pay $15.1 billion in cash to acquire
Canada''s Nexen Inc. in the biggest overseas takeover by a
Chinese company. Nexen operates the Buzzard field, the biggest

$27.50 for each common share, a premium of 61 percent to
Calgary-based Nexen''s closing price on July 20, according to its
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. Nexen''s board
recommended the deal to its shareholders. </p>
<h2>Mediterranean/Urals </h2>
<p>Urals was 55 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, the lowest since July 2, compared with a
discount of 25 cents on July 20, according to data compiled by

<h2>West Africa </h2>
<p>Nigeria plans to reduce exports of benchmark Bonny Light
crude to five cargoes of 950,000 barrels each in September,
according to a loading plan. </p>
<p>The nation will also export six shipments of Forcados, four
Brass River, four Usan, three Antan, two Abo, one lot each of
EA, Okwori and Pennington, separate plans showed. Cargo sizes
range from 300,000 barrels to 950,000 barrels. </p>
<p>Total, which operates the Girassol field, declared force
majeure from July 17 to July 19 after a a minor technical

liability when it can''t fulfill a contract for reasons beyond
its control. </p>
<p>Girassol cargoes for loading in the second half of July
were deferred by six to seven days and those for August were
delayed by three to four days, according to the loading program. </p>
<p>CPC Corp., a Taiwan state-owned oil company, issued a

<p>Corporate donors kept a tighter hold
on cash in 2011 even while increasing their total gifts of money
and products to $17.1 billion, according to the Chronicle of
Philanthropy''s annual report. </p>
<p>Donations by 166 U.S. companies surveyed by the Chronicle
gained 15 percent from 2010, according to data released
simultaneously today by the newspaper and Bloomberg Rankings.
The cash portion grew more slowly, rising 4.4 percent in 2011
after a 13 percent jump a year earlier, as companies showed more
caution amid waning consumer confidence and a debt crisis in
Europe, Chronicle editor Stacy Palmer said in an interview. </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest drugmaker, was corporate
America''s largest donor for a third straight year, granting $3.1
billion in gifts in 2011. The New York-based company''s total was
little changed in 2011 and cash donations dropped 18.5 percent
as grant partnerships ended. </p>
<p>Every company is stepping back and making sure that its
philanthropy is as efficient and effective as it can be,
Caroline Roan, president of the drugmaker''s Pfizer Foundation,
said in a telephone interview. We are not looking to make huge
new investments, but are assessing opportunities as they come
and making sure that people have access to the health care they
need. </p>
<p>Some companies did manage to increase their cash
contributions. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the world''s largest
retailer, led the list of cash donors with $342.4 million, a 7.2
percent increase, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy''s
data. Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) almost tripled its cash giving to $30.5
million last year, the Seattle-based coffee-shop operator said. </p>
<h2>Demand Increases </h2>
<p>Demand for aid from nonprofits has increased at a faster
pace than philanthropic giving by companies, Palmer said. </p>
<p>Because of the small growth, many nonprofits aren''t
getting the money they need to do their jobs, Palmer said.
They are having to look to other sources like individuals
since they can no longer depend as heavily on these large
companies. </p>
<p>The companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Stock Index hold
about $1.45 trillion in cash on their books, up from about $1.36
trillion a year earlier, according to their latest quarterly
filings compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Jul 24, 2012  3:56 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-24/goldman-sachs-may-not-issue-bonds-to-match-maturities.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs May Not Issue Bonds to Match Maturities</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may not issue long-term debt to
match the $11.8 billion it has in second-half maturities, said
Treasurer Elizabeth Liz Beshel Robinson. </p>
<p>Obviously, the market is a little bit more challenging
today that it''s been in the past, Robinson said on a
conference call today for fixed-income investors, the first of
its kind hosted by the New York-based company. She said the firm
has a number of levers to replace the funding, including
raising deposits or shrinking the firm''s balance sheet. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which was Wall Street''s most profitable
securities firm before converting to a bank in 2008, last week
reported its lowest first-half profit in seven years. The report
showed net interest income fell 25 percent in the six-month
period from a year earlier as a 5 percent decline in interest
expense failed to match the 13 percent drop in interest income. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs issued $13.7 billion of unsecured long-term
debt in the first half of the year, $12 billion of which was in
U.S. dollars and the rest in Japanese yen, Robinson said. That
compared with $15.1 billion of maturities. While the bank will
certainly issue some long-term debt in the second half, how
much will depend on the environment, she said. </p>
<p>Our view on funding has always been to raise debt
opportunistically when we see attractive opportunities in the
market, Robinson said. Attractive for us around funding
means term and diversity. </p>
<h2>Raising Deposits'' </h2>
<p>The company plans to expand its regulated-bank unit to
obtain more federally insured deposits, a lower-cost form of
borrowing than the firm''s other sources of funding. Goldman
Sachs held $57.3 billion in deposits at the end of June,
compared with $1.12 trillion held by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
largest U.S. bank. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has increased deposits by $11.2 billion this
year. Much of the growth has come from brokered certificates of
deposit and relationships with broker-dealer aggregators that
sweep client cash to Goldman Sach''s bank subsidiary, Robinson
said. Those categories account for more than half the firm''s
deposits. </p>
<p>The CDs have a weighted-average maturity of three years,
and are 2 percentage points cheaper than funding through three-
year debt at the parent-company level, Robinson said. </p>
<p>We''re raising deposits, and we''ll use some of those
deposits for private individual loans, some of it for corporate
loans, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a July 17
conference call after the firm released earnings. We''ll use
those deposits that we have and grow them and use them wisely
for profitable opportunities. </p>
<h2>No Impact'' </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the regulated bank unit overseen by
Esta E. Stecher, has higher credit ratings for both long-term
deposits and short-term debt than the parent company. Last month
Moody''s Investors Service cut the credit ratings on Goldman
Sachs Group''s long-term debt two levels to A3 and on its short-
term debt to P-2. Goldman Sachs Bank USA had its long-term
deposit rating cut to A2 and its short-term rating affirmed at
P-1. </p>
<p>The Moody''s downgrade had no impact on the firm''s
funding, and collateral outflows related to its derivative
portfolio were less than $100 million, Robinson said. </p>
<p>The cost of buying protection against a default on $10
million of Goldman Sachs debt for five years was $287,845 as of
July 23, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. While that''s
below the $376,642 cost for Morgan Stanley debt, it''s higher
than the rate charged on so-called credit default swaps for Bank
of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. or JPMorgan, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Viniar, 57, has been the Goldman Sachs executive who has
addressed investors, analysts and the media about quarterly
earnings since the company went public in 1999. As treasurer
since 2005, the 43-year-old Robinson has the job Viniar held
before he became CFO and has been trained by him to handle the
firm''s financing and liquidity needs. </p>
<p>Robinson is viewed by some analysts as a candidate to
succeed Viniar if he decides to leave. Another contender is
Sarah E. Smith, the bank''s controller and chief accounting
officer. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) must consider
letting disabled patrons use Segways at its theme parks, a U.S.
appeals court said. </p>
<p>The court today overturned a judge''s decision throwing out
a lawsuit by a woman with muscular dystrophy who claimed
Burbank, California-based Disney violated the Americans with
Disabilities Act by not allowing her to use a Segway. In earlier
lawsuits, she said she had to use a wheelchair. </p>
<p>The San Francisco-based appeals court ruled that Disney
must take into account evolving technologies that make it
cheaper and easier for the disabled to have the same experience
at its theme parks as non-disabled people. It sent the case back
to the trial court in Santa Ana, California. </p>
<p>We have every confidence that the organization that, half
a century ago, brought us the Carousel of Progress and Great
Moments with Mr. Lincoln can lead the way in using new
technology to make its parks more welcoming to disabled
guests, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote on behalf of the
three-judge appeals panel. </p>
<p>Disney may be able to bar Segways if it can prove that the
two-wheeled electric vehicles can''t be operated safely in the
parks, the appeals panel said. Any safety requirements Disney
imposes must be based on actual risks, not on mere
speculation, generalizations or stereotypes about individuals
with disabilities, Kozinski said. </p>
<h2>Imagination Left'' </h2>
<p>Quoting Walt Disney himself, the judge wrote: As the man
who started it all said, Disneyland will never be completed as
long as there is imagination left in the world.'' </p>
<p>Angela Bliss, a Disney spokeswoman, said the company hasn''t
allowed visitors to use two-wheeled vehicles like Segways due
to the safety risks they present in our unique theme park
environments. </p>
<p>All this decision does is return to the trial court the
issue of whether Segways are permissible despite their safety
risks, Bliss said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is Baughman v. Disney, 10-5592, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco. </p>

<p>The trustee for what is now TMST Inc. accused the banks
last year of extracting more than $700 million of margin and

unjustified margin calls. The banks, including Credit Suisse

affiliates, said three of the 31 counts involved allegations of
breach of contract and fraudulent conveyance, which a bankruptcy
judge can''t rule on. </p>

the facts and send his findings to a district judge, even if the

<p>     July 25 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp. obtained a record-low 1.875 percent coupon on $1 billion
of 10-year bonds, the least for dollar-denominated debt of that
maturity. </p>
<p>The world''s largest computer-services provider sold the
debt at 98.398 cents on the dollar to yield 2.053 percent, or a
relative yield of 65 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The coupon beat the previous 2 percent record held by 3M
Co.''s 10-year notes sold on June 21, Bloomberg data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The yield is reflective of the overall bond market
environment, with Treasuries sitting at an all-time record-low
yield, said Anthony Valeri, a market strategist in San Diego
at LPL Financial, in a telephone interview. IBM picked the
perfect time to come to market. </p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury note''s yield dropped as low
as 1.38 percent today. </p>
<p>IBM also shares the record low with Sysco Corp. for three-
year debt with its 0.55 percent bonds due February 2015. </p>
<p>The new debt may be rated Aa3, the fourth-highest level of
investment grade, by Moody''s Investors Service. Proceeds will go
toward general corporate purposes, said Doug Shelton, an IBM
spokesman, who declined to comment further. </p>
<h2>Fresh Name'' </h2>
<p>BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG
managed the sale, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>IBM last sold 10-year bonds in October 2011, issuing $500
million of 2.9 percent debt to yield 62.5 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The Armonk, New York-based
company''s securities traded at 108.34 cents on the dollar to
yield 1.91 percent on July 19, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. </p>
<p>IBM is a fresh name in the 10-year space, Valeri said.
You give the market a liquid 10-year issue, and it kind of
sells itself when you have a solid name like IBM. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD) and Northrop
Grumman Corp. (NOC) said their information technology units suffered
weak sales during the second quarter as government contract
awards slowed. </p>
<p>General Dynamics cited the slowdown today in reducing its
full-year profit forecast to $7 to $7.10 a share, down from
$7.10 to $7.20 a share projected in April. Contract delays
affected the information systems and technology unit, which
provides cybersecurity services to the Pentagon and intelligence
agencies, communication equipment to the military and computer
services to federal defense and civilian agencies. </p>
<p>The Falls Church, Virginia-based company also said that
Phebe Novakovic, its president, will assume Jay Johnson''s role
as chairman and chief executive officer in January. </p>
<p>General Dynamics has previously warned that the prospect of
almost $1 trillion in reductions from planned defense spending
over a decade already is slowing contract awards at some of the
company''s units. Johnson has said contracts at the company''s
information-technology unit slowed because of reticence by
government agencies to use up funds. </p>
<p>The Pentagon plans to cut about $490 billion from planned
spending over a decade, and an additional $500 billion in
automatic defense cuts known as sequestration will go into
effect starting in January unless lawmakers and the White House
agree on an alternative deficit-reduction plan. </p>
<h2>Budget Uncertainty </h2>
<p>CEOs of defense contractors that have announced quarterly
results this week have said uncertainty about how Congress and
the White House will resolve the budget standoff may affect
their performance and lead some to warn employees they may be
fired. </p>
<p>While we''ve not received planning guidance from the
government on how sequestration would be implemented, we are
developing contingency plans, Northrop''s Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Wes Bush said today on a conference call with
analysts. Sequestration would result in lower revenues,
profits and cash flows for our company. </p>
<p>Sequestration continues to be of great concern, Bob Stevens, Chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) said
yesterday on his company''s call. Without sufficient planning
information, we''ve been unable to more precisely estimate the
adverse impacts. Stevens has said that Lockheed may have to
fire as many as 10,000 employees if the automatic budget cuts go
into effect. </p>
<p>The fourth quarter of the year should be a tough revenue
quarter for defense contractors, with the Defense Department
reluctant to release funds, and new starts will probably be
scarce in the third quarter as well, Robert Spingarn, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in New York, said today in a note to
clients. </p>
<h2>General Dynamics </h2>
<p>General Dynamics fell 2.2 percent to $62 in New York
trading and has declined 6.6 percent this year. Northrop fell
less than 1 percent to $63.91 and has gained 9.3 percent this
year. </p>
<p>General Dynamics'' revised full-year profit forecast of $7
to $7.10 a share compares with an estimate of $7.17 a share
estimated by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The company said its second-quarter profit fell 4.8 percent
on the lower information-systems and technology sales. </p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations was $634 million, or
$1.77 a share, compared with $666 million, or $1.79 a share, a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement. Analysts
forecast $1.74 a share, the average of 22 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose less than 1 percent to $7.92 billion. </p>
<p>Sales at General Dynamics'' Information Systems and
Technology unit fell 9.9 percent and profit declined 24 percent
compared with a year earlier. </p>
<h2>Government In-Sourcing'' </h2>
<p>The government is in-sourcing'' a fair amount of
computer-services work as it looks to control the budget,
Joel Levington, a bond analyst at Brookfield Investment
Management Inc. in New York said in an e-mail. As a result
contractors such as General Dynamics'' information technology
unit are experiencing weakness, he said. </p>
<p>Performance at General Dynamics'' aerospace unit, maker of
Gulfstream business jets, has been compensating for weaker
defense sales. Revenue at the unit rose 16 percent during the
quarter, and profit climbed 23 percent. </p>
<h2>Northrop Grumman </h2>
<p>Northrop Grumman''s information systems unit had the
company''s weakest sales performance during the second quarter
with revenue declining 8.6 percent. Unit profit rose 6.9 percent
because of improved performance on non-defense computer work,
the Falls Church, Virginia-based company said in a statement
today. </p>
<p>The question is whether Northrop can continue to deliver
such strong operational performance in the face of the
budget headwinds ahead, Levington said. </p>
<p>Northrop today raised its full year forecast to $7.05 to
$7.25 a share, up from the $6.70 to $6.95 a share it projected
in April. It didn''t increase its forecast for sales, which
remained at $24.7 billion to $25.4 billion. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast a profit of $6.90 a share on sales of $25.1
billion. </p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations was $480 million, or
$1.88 a share, compared with $520 million, or $1.81 a share, a
year earlier, the Falls Church, Virginia-based company said in a
statement. Analysts forecast $1.61 a share, the average of 21
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 4.4 percent to $6.27
billion. </p>
<p>Northrop has reduced its workforce by about 11 percent in
the past four years as the company has focused on reducing
overhead costs to improve profit margins, Bush said in May. </p>

Moore" date="Jul 25, 2012  5:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-25/morgan-stanley-stock-could-be-worth-32-in-breakup-mayo-says.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Stock May Be Worth $32 in Breakup, Mayo Says</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), trading at less than
half of its liquidation value, could be worth as much as $32 a
share in a breakup, said Michael Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd. </p>
<p>Short-sellers betting against Morgan Stanley would be
blown to Neptune if the New York-based investment bank heeds
calls for the biggest U.S. financial firms to be split into
pieces, Mayo, 49, said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television''s Street Smart. The stock gained 2.7 percent to
close at $12.96 in New York. </p>
<p>James Gorman, Morgan Stanley''s chief executive officer,
said last week that the firm will continue to shrink its fixed-
income trading unit, cutting so-called risk-weighted assets 30
percent from the third quarter of 2011 by the end of 2014. Mayo
said that reduction should be closer to two-thirds. </p>
<p>This is not a tough call, Mayo said. If you break up
the big banks, at least in the case of Morgan Stanley, I think
investors would be huge winners. I hope they can achieve this
value on their own without a breakup, but they don''t have
forever. </p>
<p>Other large U.S. banks including Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) should consider breaking up, Mayo said. Citigroup,
based in New York, has demonstrated over a decade of
underperformance that it''s unqualified to play in the major
leagues and should go back to the minor leagues, Mayo
said. </p>
<h2>Disagree Vehemently'' </h2>
<p>Stockbrokers in Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America''s Merrill Lynch unit would cheer if the division were
sold to a private-equity firm, he said. The question about
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), based in New York, is whether the bank
will be too big to manage once CEO Jamie Dimon leaves, Mayo
said. </p>
<p>Jeanmarie McFadden, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, declined
to comment on Mayo''s remarks, as did Citigroup''s Jon Diat and
Bank of America''s Jerry Dubrowski. </p>
<p>Mayo said he disagreed with former Citigroup CEO Sanford Sandy Weill that the U.S. financial system had changed in
the decade since Weill ran the bank. </p>
<p>Weill, who helped engineer the 1998 merger of Travelers
Group Inc. and Citicorp Inc. to create the largest U.S. bank,
told CNBC earlier today that it''s time to dismantle the nation''s
biggest lenders. He said he altered his views on the merits of
large banks because the world changes. </p>
<p>I agree 100 percent with the conclusion that Citigroup
should be broken up, but I disagree vehemently that the world
has changed from the time Sandy Weill was CEO, Mayo said in a
telephone interview. The same ill-conceived incentives that
caused the financial crisis are still in place today. </p>
<p>Weill, 79, stepped down as CEO of New York-based Citigroup
in 2003 and as chairman in 2006. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL), Latin America''s
biggest Coke bottler, fell the most in two weeks after posting a
second-quarter profit that trailed analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>The shares slid 7.2 percent to 152.96 pesos in Mexico City,
the largest drop since July 11. Net income declined to 2.71
billion pesos ($198 million), the company said late yesterday.
Analysts expected a 2.96 billion-peso profit, based on the
average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa absorbed blows from a weaker Mexican peso,
rising labor costs and more expensive high-fructose corn syrup.
The peso slid 12 percent against the dollar during the year
ended June 30, and Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said
the weakening currency magnified the Mexico City-based company''s
dollar-based materials costs. </p>
<p>The first read-through is pretty weak across the board,
said Alan Alanis, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in New York
who has a neutral rating on Coca-Cola Femsa. Flat volumes,
contracting margins and shrinking earnings per share: Those are
the highlights of the quarter. </p>
<p>While three acquisitions in Mexico over the past year
boosted sales 28 percent to 36.3 billion pesos, beverage volume
excluding the new units was little changed, Coca-Cola Femsa
said. The company''s operating income as a percentage of sales
fell to 13 percent from more than 15 percent a year earlier. </p>
<h2>Net Income </h2>
<p>Net income amounted to 1.35 pesos per share, down 9 percent
from a year earlier, Coca-Cola Femsa said in a statement to the
Mexican stock exchange. </p>
<p>Higher labor costs in Venezuela and Argentina and steeper
freight costs in Argentina and Brazil helped push operating
expenses up 38 percent from a year earlier. Trevino said the
company would benefit from steadier costs in the second half of
the year, especially if the peso stabilizes. </p>
<p>Should currency volatility recede, we look forward to a
more stable cost environment for the second half of 2012, he
said on a conference call with analysts and investors. All in
all, I do see a second half of the year that will be better on
the margins than what we are presenting in this quarter. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa closed transactions in 2011 to buy Grupo
Tampico for 9.3 billion pesos and Grupo Cimsa for 11 billion
pesos, including debt. It completed the purchase of Grupo
Fomento Queretano for 6.6 billion pesos in May. </p>
<h2>On Track'' </h2>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said in a statement
that the company is fully on track to meet our previously
announced net synergy targets. </p>
<p>Teams of Coca-Cola Femsa employees are studying the
operations and finances of Coca-Cola Co. (KO)''s Philippines unit, as
the Mexican company evaluates whether to make its first foray
outside Latin America, Trevino said. </p>
<p>In February, Coca-Cola Femsa entered a 12-month exclusive
agreement with Atlanta-based Coca-Cola to discuss buying a
controlling stake in the Filipino unit. The U.S. company owns
about 30 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa, which is majority-owned by
Monterrey, Mexico-based Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB. </p>
<p>While Trevino said in April that a decision could come by
the end of September, he said yesterday that it might take until
the end of the year. </p>
<p>We feel enthusiastic about this idea, he said on the
conference call. During the second half of the year, we should
be able to reach a decision. </p>

<p>Visa Europe Ltd. may receive an
antitrust complaint from European Union regulators over credit
card fees, the EU''s competition commissioner said. </p>
<p>We are preparing a supplementary statement of
objections, Joaquin Almunia told reporters today. </p>
<p>Visa Europe reduced similar fees for debit cards last year
to settle a 2009 EU complaint. Almunia said earlier this month
that he hoped the operator of the largest payment-card network
in the 27-nation EU would reduce cross-border fees for credit
cards and deferred-debit transactions to the same level as
MasterCard Inc. (MA) He said in May that total costs retailers face
to handle payments haven''t decreased since 2006. </p>
<p>Visa Europe is committed to continuing dialogue to reach
a commercially acceptable agreement for setting credit and
deferred debit interchange, said Amanda Kamin, a spokeswoman
for the company in London. We believe this can be done
amicably and relatively speedily. </p>
<p>Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard and some of the biggest U.S. banks
this month agreed to a U.S. settlement of at least $6.05 billion
in a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card
swipe fees. </p>
<p>Visa Europe split from Visa Inc. before the U.S. card
company''s initial public offering in early 2008. </p>
<p>Retailers have long complained about the cost they are
charged to accept card payments. Unlike for checks, banks charge
interchange fees to process debit- and credit-card payments.
Card operators set the amounts, own the payment networks and
pass the money to the lenders. The retailer''s bank pays the fees
to the customer''s card issuer. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
biggest oil company by market value, earned less than expected
as oil demand stalled in the world''s largest economies and U.S.
natural-gas prices dropped. </p>
<p>Second-quarter net income was $15.9 billion, or $3.41 a
share, compared with $10.7 billion, or $2.18, a year earlier,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today. Excluding
one-time gains that accounted for almost half of the quarter''s
profit, per-share income was $1.80, or 15 cents lower than the
average of 15 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon fell short of estimates for the second straight
quarter amid a widening production decline that Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is attempting to reverse
with $37 billion in capital spending this year. The company
pumped the equivalent of 4.15 million barrels of crude a day
during the April-to-June period, the lowest in two years. </p>
<p>It was another sub-par quarter for Exxon, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, who has a
hold rating on Exxon''s shares. They are struggling to grow
production and commodity prices are working against them. </p>
<p>Sales rose 1.5 percent to $127.4 billion. Exxon rose 1.5
percent to $86.52 at the close in New York amid a broader market
rally. </p>
<h2>Items Guidance </h2>
<p>Exxon initially announced during a conference call with
news organizations that its per-share profit of $3.41 didn''t
include any special or one-time gains. An e-mailed statement
released within minutes of the call showed the $7.5 billion in
gains that accounted for 47 percent of the per-share figure. </p>
<p>Asset divestment and acquisitions have become a normal
part of our ongoing operations, David Rosenthal, an Exxon
spokesman, said during a later conference call with analysts
today. This is an ongoing piece of the business for us. The
U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission''s criteria for what
qualifies as a special item has evolved in recent years, he
said. </p>
<p>Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world''s oil, averaged $108.76 a barrel during the quarter, a 7
percent decline from a year earlier. Oil demand in the U.S. and
China, which together consume almost one-third of the world''s
crude, stagnated at 28.2 million barrels a day, little changed
from a year earlier, according the International Energy Agency. </p>
<p>Gas futures traded in New York fell 46 percent compared to
a year earlier to average $2.354 per million British thermal
units, the lowest quarterly average since 1999, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Tillerson warned last month that
Exxon and other gas producers have been losing our shirts
amid a glut of North American supply. </p>
<h2>Losing Bet </h2>
<p>Gas, the most-widely used U.S. furnace fuel and the
nation''s second-largest source of electricity, has been a losing
bet for the biggest energy explorers. Innovations in drilling
and cracking subterranean rock formations allowed explorers to
flood the U.S. and Canada with supply, pushing prices to the
lowest in a decade earlier this year. </p>
<p>Exxon spent $35 billion on the 2010 acquisition of XTO
Energy that enabled it to surpass Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) as the
largest U.S. gas producer. Since that deal closed, gas has
fallen 33 percent to about $3.08 per million Btus. </p>
<p>Paul Cheng, an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. in New
York, told clients in a July 9 note that other major oil
companies are more compelling investment opportunities because
of concern that the XTO operation will remain a drag on the
company''s performance. </p>
<h2>Gas Glut </h2>
<p>Exxon boosted U.S. gas production by 1.4 percent to 3.9
billion cubic feet a day even as a glut of North American supply
depressed prices for the fuel, according to a filing made after
its earnings release today. U.S. wells accounted for one-third
of the company''s global gas output. </p>
<p>Profit from U.S. oil and gas wells plunged 53 percent to
$678 million, according to the filing. Outside the U.S., oil and
gas production income rose 8.3 percent to $7.68 billion. </p>
<p>Refining profit quadrupled to $6.65 billion after the
company sold part of its Japanese business to TonenGeneral
Sekiyu KK. (5012) Chemical profit jumped 9.7 percent to $1.45 billion.
The Japanese sale contributed $5.3 billion to second-quarter
results. On a per-share basis, the entire $7.5 billion in one-
time gains accounted for $1.61 of net income. </p>
<p>Those one-time gains were the swing factor, Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Phoenix Group Partners LP
in New York, said today in a telephone interview. Liquids
production was down and they were impacted like everybody else
by lower global liquids prices. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) earlier today said second-quarter
profit fell 13 percent, excluding one-time items and inventory
changes, to $5.7 billion, missing the $6.3 billion average of 10
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chevron Corp. (CVX),
Exxon''s largest U.S.-based rival, is scheduled to report results
tomorrow. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), grappling with
a $5.8 billion trading loss and a securities-industry slump,
promoted Matt Zames to co-chief operating officer in a
management shuffle that replaced the head of its investment
bank. </p>
<p>Zames, 41, who was enlisted this year to staunch the loss
in the firm''s chief investment office, will take the co-COO role
alongside Frank Bisignano, the bank said yesterday in a
statement. The overhaul catapults Zames, a former fixed-income
trader, into the pool of potential successors to Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon. James Jes Staley, 55, who ran the
investment bank, will relinquish daily operational duties as
Mike Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto oversee an expanded version of
the division. </p>
<p>Staley, once seen as a possible CEO candidate, was moved to
a new post as chairman of a unit that combines the investment
bank, treasury and securities services and the global corporate
bank. Dimon, 56, said in an interview yesterday he hopes to
continue leading the firm for many, many more years, and
that the shuffle doesn''t indicate any immediate succession
plans. </p>
<p>Staley''s basically becoming a diplomat, said David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in New York. He''s
working on the big picture issues, but the day-to-day activities
seems to be gravitating to Cavanagh and Pinto. </p>
<p>The overhaul combines several of JPMorgan''s units into two
new divisions. In addition to the corporate and investment bank
overseen by Cavanagh and Pinto, a combined consumer and
community banking business will be led by Gordon Smith and Todd
Maclin. </p>
<h2>Normal Progression'' </h2>
<p>I see this as a continued response to the embarrassment
and the gaffe that was the last quarter, said Michael Holland,
chairman of New York-based Holland  Co., referring to the CIO
losses. Holland, whose firm oversees more than $4 billion
including shares of JPMorgan, said it was typical for Dimon to
remake the management team, which after all is the key to all
of these successes and failures. </p>
<p>Dimon said in the interview that the changes were part of
a normal progression, and had nothing to do with anything
else, including the CIO''s loss. </p>
<p>JPMorgan rose 3 percent to $36.89 yesterday in New York.
The firm''s shares have climbed 11 percent this year, compared
with a 17 percent gain for the 24-company KBW Bank Index. </p>
<p>The move comes as some finance leaders including former
Citigroup Inc. CEO Sanford Sandy Weill call for the breakup
of the biggest U.S. banks, which grew larger after the repeal of
the Depression-era law that required companies backed by
government insurance to be separate from investment banks. </p>
<h2>New Leaders'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan and some other large institutions were ports of
safety in the storm, Dimon said, referring to the financial
crisis. Breaking them up would make have made them riskier
because they''d be less diversified, he said. </p>
<p>Staley will hand off his current responsibilities to new
leaders in the business, JPMorgan said in the statement.
Within the corporate and investment bank, Cavanagh, 46, will
head the banking business, which includes investment banking,
the global corporate bank and treasury services. Pinto, 49, will
be the main contact for markets and investor services, which
will include fixed income, equities, commodities, prime services
and securities clearing. </p>
<p>Dimon said Staley played a role in the decision to change
his responsibilities. Jes himself would always say When the
time comes that it''s time to promote some great new talent, then
I should move up,'' Dimon said in the interview. </p>
<h2>Reporting Lines </h2>
<p>Zames will still be in charge of the CIO, the firm said.
Bisignano, 52, who was appointed to run mortgage banking last
year, will hand off that responsibility to Smith, who will
become sole CEO of consumer and community banking by the end of
next year as Maclin assumes the role of the unit''s chairman. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 51, who previously
reported to Dimon, will report to Zames, Dimon said yesterday in
a memo to employees, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. Barry Zubrow, 59, who runs corporate and regulatory
affairs, will also report to Zames instead of Dimon, according
to the memo. </p>
<p>It''s a promotion for Matt Zames, Dimon said in the
interview. </p>
<p>Dimon said the heads of businesses such as the corporate
and investment bank will report directly to him, rather than to
Zames and Bisignano. </p>
<p>Asset management and commercial banking will remain
separate from the other units. Mary Erdoes, 44, will continue to
run asset management, and Douglas Petno will remain as head the
commercial bank. </p>
<h2>Botched Trades </h2>
<p>JPMorgan is grappling with a trading loss spurred by bets
on synthetic credit. The loss, which was disclosed May 10 after
it surpassed $2 billion, had grown to $5.8 billion by the end of
the second quarter. The botched trades led to the retirement of
former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 55, and the shutdown
of the London-based team that built the position. </p>
<p>Regulators, investors, analysts and lawmakers have called
for the break-up of too-big-to-fail banks to unlock shareholder
value and prevent another financial crisis. JPMorgan''s trading
loss gave ammunition to those who favor stricter bank
regulation, including supporters of the Volcker rule, which
would bar most proprietary trading by deposit-taking
institutions. </p>
<p>JPMorgan needs to ensure that we comply with all new
regulatory requirements, which will have a significant impact on
global markets, products and services, Dimon, who has fought
the Volcker rule, said in the memo. </p>
<h2>Ridiculous Concept'' </h2>
<p>Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, also reorganized earlier this year, dividing the firm
into consumer and institutional businesses and naming a pair of
co-COOs to manage them. David Darnell heads the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank''s consumer and business banking division,
and Thomas K. Montag, 55, runs trading and investment banking. </p>
<p>We believe this could help fuel the speculation that some
of the larger banks may look to more formally separate their
consumer and investment banking operations, Jason Goldberg, an
analyst at Barclays Plc who has an overweight rating on the
shares, said yesterday in a note. </p>
<p>If a bank breakup occurs, it will result from shareholder
pressure and will happen slowly over time, said Paul Miller, an
analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in Arlington, Virginia, who
has a market perform rating on JPMorgan shares. </p>
<p>My guess is the mindset of Jamie and the rest of the
senior management team of JPMorgan is, that''s a ridiculous
concept, Miller said. I think it''s going to eventually
happen, I think it''s going to happen against a lot of these
wills, and Jamie might not be there when it happens. </p>
<h2>Hedging Risks </h2>
<p>Zames shook up the CIO''s leadership after taking over the
unit and announced a renewed focus on hedging risks.
JPMorgan hired Zames from Credit Suisse First Boston in 2004 to
run trading in Treasuries, agencies and interest-rate swaps and
options. </p>
<p>In 2009, Zames and Pinto were picked to run fixed income
after Staley took over the firm''s investment bank from William
Winters and Steven Black. Under Zames and Pinto, JPMorgan has
become the top bank globally in fixed-income trading. The firm''s
17 percent market share in 2011 was a record for Wall Street,
Staley told shareholders earlier this year. </p>
<p>Matt has done an exceptional job overseeing our global
fixed-income business, and more recently, jumping in to
skillfully help us deal with the difficult CIO issue, Dimon
said in the memo. We are fortunate to be able to leverage his
skills and counsel across the entire firm. </p>
<h2>Led Investigation </h2>
<p>Bisignano has been JPMorgan''s chief administrative officer
since 2005, when he left Citigroup, where he ran global
transaction services, to rejoin Dimon. Bisignano worked at Smith
Barney in the late 1990s. At JPMorgan, Bisignano took on the
additional role in February 2011 as head of Chase Home Lending.
JPMorgan praised his work there, saying he led the highly
successful transformation of mortgage banking. </p>
<p>Cavanagh, who will run the corporate and investment bank
with Pinto, led JPMorgan''s internal investigation into the
trading loss and previously ran treasury and securities
services. A longtime Dimon loyalist, Cavanagh was hired by the
firm''s chief at Salomon Smith Barney in 1993 and then again in
2000 at Bank One Corp., which merged with JPMorgan in 2004. </p>
<p>The same clients that I''ve been calling on in my old job
will be the same clients I''m calling on in the new job,
Cavanagh said yesterday in an interview, referring to the
customers of the units he oversaw. </p>
<h2>Go-To Guy'' </h2>
<p>Holland of Holland  Co. said Cavanagh is the one name
consistently that keeps coming up as a go-to guy. </p>
<p>The change, particularly bringing on the younger people,
is an important part of continuing to strengthen the management
team, Holland said. As a shareholder, I''m pleased with the
continuation here. </p>
<p>Staley has worked at JPMorgan since 1979, including an
eight-year stint as head of the bank''s money-management
division. He became head of the investment bank in September
2009 when Dimon announced that Winters and Black, the division''s
co-heads, would step aside after leading the bank through the
2008 financial crisis. Winters departed immediately, surprising
analysts who had viewed him as a potential successor to Dimon.
Black, 60, was named executive chairman and left the firm in
early 2011. </p>
<h2>Risk Controls </h2>
<p>In the late 2000s, Staley was among executives -- along
with Winters and Black -- who questioned Dimon on why risk
controls inside the CIO weren''t as extensive or robust as in
other departments, according to people who participated in or
witnessed the conversations. Staley told Fortune magazine in
April 2010 that he considered himself a contender to succeed
Dimon. </p>
<p>If Jamie doesn''t leave, then I probably need to leave
myself in a few years, Staley added. </p>
<p>JPMorgan hired Smith to run its Chase card services group
in 2007. He was previously president of the global commercial
card unit at American Express Co. (AXP), where he had worked for more
than 25 years. </p>

<p>(Corrects oil-production mix percentages in last paragraph
in story published July 27.) </p>
<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company by market value, topped the highest profit
estimate from analysts after an 80 percent increase in refining
returns helped make up for falling oil prices. </p>
<p>Second-quarter net income fell to $7.21 billion, or $3.66 a
share, from $7.73 billion, or $3.85, a year earlier, the San
Ramon, California-based company said in a statement today. The
result was 35 cents more than the average of four analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, which ranged from $3.10 to
$3.47. </p>
<p>Chevron''s oil refineries and filling stations earned $1.88
billion as U.S. refining margins climbed to a second-quarter
record average of $28.98 a barrel when crude costs fell faster
than gasoline prices. Brent crude, the benchmark for two-thirds
of the world''s oil, fell 7 percent from a year earlier to
average $108.76 a barrel amid concern that slowing growth in
China and Europe''s sovereign debt crises will stifle energy
demand. </p>
<p>Strong refining margins helped them a lot, Allen Good,
an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview today. In contrast to some of their
competitors, Chevron''s heavier exposure to oil and minimal
exposure to low natural-gas prices helped keep the upstream
afloat. </p>
<h2>Core'' Holding </h2>
<p>Sales fell 9.2 percent to $62.6 billion. Chevron rose 0.9
percent to $109.26 at the close in New York. </p>
<p>Chevron''s refining profit included about $200 million in
proceeds from the sale of a power business in South Korea and
other assets, according to the statement. Income from oil and
gas wells fell 18 percent to $5.62 billion. </p>
<p>I view them as the core energy holding investors should
have, Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St.
Louis, said in an interview after the results were announced.
They''re more profitable per barrel, they have way more cash
than debt and they pay a good dividend. </p>
<p>Production declined 2.6 percent to the equivalent of 2.62
million barrels a day. The company won''t meet its full-year goal
of producing the daily average equivalent of 2.68 million
barrels of crude, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President
George Kirkland said during a conference call with analysts
today. </p>
<h2>Maintenance Disruption </h2>
<p>Contributing factors to the shortfall include the temporary
shutdown of the Frade field in Brazil after oil seeps on the sea
floor angered government regulators, as well as maintenance work
at the company''s Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, he said. Chevron
shares dropped more than 1 percent in the first two minutes
after Kirkland''s comments, before rebounding. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson expanded
the capital-projects budget 12 percent this year to $32.7
billion as part of a long-term plan to boost daily production by
one-fifth to the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels by the end of
2017. </p>
<p>The company''s exploration plans include a pair of wells
scheduled for next year in Iraq''s Kurdistan region. Chevron
agreed in a deal announced last week to buy Reliance Industries
Inc.''s stakes in two Kurdistan blocks. </p>
<h2>Gas Effects </h2>
<p>U.S. energy explorers were hurt by a 46 percent slide in
gas prices during the second quarter compared to a year earlier,
to an average of $2.354 per million British thermal units, the
lowest since 1999. </p>
<p>Chevron is the least-exposed of the major U.S. energy
producers to tumbling gas prices because its output is more
heavily weighted to crude than its largest domestic rivals. </p>
<p>Chevron''s production slate was 69 percent crude oil in
2011, with the rest comprised of gas, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. For Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S. energy
company by market value, the oil portion of total output was 51
percent. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, is following Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in
hosting its first-ever conference call for fixed-income
investors. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, will host the call
at 8 a.m. New York time on Aug. 3 with Treasurer David Russo and
Tom Wipf, head of resource management, the New York-based firm
said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Porat has spoken in recent presentations about changes in
the firm''s funding profile and liquidity reserve as the company
seeks to reassure debtholders of Morgan Stanley, which has the
highest priced credit-default swaps among the nation''s biggest
banks. The firm cut its outstanding debt by $21 billion in the
past 12 months and doubled common equity since 2007, according
to Porat. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs held its call, hosted by Treasurer Elizabeth Liz Beshel Robinson and CFO David A. Viniar, on July 24.
Robinson told investors that the firm may not issue long-term
debt to match the $11.8 billion it has in second-half maturities
and detailed efforts to boost deposits. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc., the third-largest U.S. bank, holds a
conference call for fixed-income investors every quarter a few
days after reporting earnings. </p>

<p>Abby Joseph Cohen, the senior U.S.
investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said equities
will generate better returns than bonds for investors in the
medium-to-long term. </p>
<p>If we were to look just at fair-value estimates over the
next year to three, we think that returns that are roughly 8 to
10 percent on the stock market are sensible, she said in an
interview on Bloomberg Surveillance today with Tom Keene. It
is sensible as well for a long-term outlook, even though we
assume that economic growth will not be as robust as it was in
the years immediately prior to the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) has surged 25 percent from
its 2011 low in October as economic data beat forecasts and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said policy makers
stand ready to act if more stimulus measures for the U.S.
economy are needed. </p>
<p>Since the financial crisis, many companies have repaired
their balance sheets, boosting returns for shareholders, said
Cohen, who is based in New York. </p>
<p>The focus has been on margins, ROEs and returning capital
to shareholders, she said, referring to so-called return on
equity. We''ve seen dividends increase, we''ve also seen share
repurchases increase. </p>

<p>India''s Supreme Court ruled that the
ship that spilt millions of gallons of oil in waters off Alaska
in 1989 can be recycled in the nation''s biggest scrapyard in a
defeat for an environmentalist. </p>
<p>A two-judge team headed by Altamas Kabir said the Oriental
Nicety, formerly known as the Exxon Valdez, may enter the yard
in Alang, on India''s western coast, following a May decision by
the Gujarat Pollution Control Board that denied the ship entry.
The judges said the ship''s owner or its agent will be
responsible for disposing any toxic material found in the ship. </p>
<p>Priya Blue Industries Pvt. a Gujarat-based company that
bought the ship for scrapping, plans to bring it into the yard
in two days from the anchorage off the state''s coast, company
founder Sanjay Mehta said in a telephone interview. The ship
will take five months to be broken down, Mehta said. </p>
<p>The verdict is disappointing, said Gopal Krishna, the
New Delhi-based activist with ToxicsWatch Alliance who
approached the court in April to bar the ship''s entry. Krishna
had said the ship poses an environmental threat because it had
asbestos and heavy metals aboard. </p>
<p>Hardik Shah, member secretary of the Gujarat Pollution
Control Board, didn''t answer two calls to his mobile phone
today. </p>
<h2>Alaska Oil Spill </h2>
<p>The Exxon Valdez spilt 11 million gallons of oil into
Alaska''s Prince William Sound, devastating wildlife and local
businesses. Victims of the spill sued Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and won
a $5 billion punitive damage award in 1994 that was cut to
$507.5 million in 2008 by a divided U.S. Supreme Court. </p>
<p>In the petition filed in India''s Supreme Court, Krishna had
said the 301 meter-long (988 feet) ship, built in 1986, was
purchased by Best Oasis Ltd., a unit of Priya Blue, for $16
million. </p>
<p>Alang, which opened in 1982, has the capacity to break
ships of about 4 million metric tons a year, according to
Gujarat Maritime Board website. The yard directly employs about
25,000 workers, according to the Board. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software maker, unveiled mice and keyboards to work with its
Windows 8 software for tablets and personal computers as it
prepares its own device to compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. </p>
<p>The wireless Wedge Mobile Keyboard, which costs $79.95,
features a protective cover that doubles as a stand for a
tablet, Microsoft said in a statement. The company will also
sell a pocket-size wireless Wedge Touch Mouse for $69.95. Both
use Bluetooth to connect to a computer or tablet. </p>
<p>Microsoft is releasing Windows 8, the next update of its
flagship software, in October to run on PCs and tablets,
including its own machine, Surface. The latest software, mice
and keyboards are designed to combat Apple''s lead in the tablet
market and boost sales of Surface when it goes on sale later
this year. </p>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based company also said it will
sell a Sculpt Touch Mouse for $49.95 and full-size Sculpt Mobile
Keyboard for the same price. Both products use a Bluetooth
connection. </p>
<p>Revenue in the Windows division fell 13 percent to $4.15
billion in the three months ended June 30, falling short of the
$4.44 billion average analyst estimate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That was the fifth time in seven quarters
that the unit has fallen short. </p>
<p>Apple''s iPad will to remain the global tablet leader
through at least 2016, even as it loses some market share,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. The iPad will account for
an estimated 46 percent of shipments in 2016, down from a
projected 61 percent this year, Gartner said. Tablets running
Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android software may have 37 percent by 2016, a
gain from 32 percent. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which had zero percent of the tablet market last
year, is expected to nab 12 percent by 2016. That number may
increase because the Gartner report was issued before Microsoft
unveiled its Windows-based tablet. </p>

<p>Three JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
investment bankers are leaving for Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) and
Centerview Partners LP, the latest dealmakers to depart a global
lender for a merger advisory boutique. </p>
<p>Barrett Brett Pickett and Lowell Strug, who advised
restaurant and other consumer companies at New York-based
JPMorgan, are joining Evercore in the coming weeks, according to
three people with knowledge of the matter. Adam Beshara, 38, who
worked with manufacturers such as ITT Corp., starts at
Centerview today, firm co-founder Blair Effron said. </p>
<p>Evercore and Centerview, both based in New York and started
by veterans of some of Wall Street''s biggest banks, focus on
advising large corporate clients on mergers and capital
structure rather than trading or lending. They''ve been hiring
amid pay cuts and firings at the bigger firms. </p>
<p>When you sell intellectual capital versus other kinds of
capital -- financial capital and the like -- it attracts a
certain type of individual, Effron said in an interview
yesterday. </p>
<p>Pickett, at JPMorgan since 1998 and the firm''s former co-
head of consumer and retail investment banking, will start with
Evercore next month, said the three people, who asked not to be
identified because the changes haven''t been announced. He will
help run the consumer group at Evercore. </p>
<p>Strug, with JPMorgan since 2000, will join Pickett at
Evercore in September, the people said. Strug was a managing
director in mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan, focusing on
food and beverage companies and restaurant chains. </p>
<h2>Previous Deals </h2>
<p>Pickett and Strug together in 2008 advised Wendy''s
International Inc. on its $2.4 billion sale to Nelson Peltz''s
Triarc Cos. They also advised 3G Capital Inc., the investment
firm backed by a group of Brazilian industrialists, on its
purchase of Burger King Holdings Inc. for $3.3 billion in 2010. </p>
<p>Beshara, who joins Centerview as a partner, was a managing
director in JPMorgan''s industrials investment-banking group. He
advised ITT on its 2011 breakup into three separate companies
and the same year helped Stanley Black  Decker Inc. prevail in
a bidding war for Swedish surveillance-systems maker Niscayah
AB. He joined JPMorgan in 1998. </p>
<p>Evercore, founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Roger Altman, said July 26 that second-quarter profit rose 19
percent on higher investment-banking revenue. On a subsequent
conference call, Altman said Evercore plans to disclose three
new managing directors before next quarter''s results. </p>
<p>Pickett and Strug are two of those hires, said one of the
people familiar with the matter. Spokesmen for Evercore and
JPMorgan declined to comment. </p>
<p>Evercore''s Mark Vander Ploeg, hired in 2007 to focus on
advising retail and consumer companies, retired last year. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software maker, will introduce a new, free Web-based e-mail
portal under its Outlook brand and phase out Hotmail over time
as it seeks to draw users from Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Gmail. </p>
<p>A preview of the new service went online today and Hotmail
probably will be phased out in the next year, said Brian Hall, a
general manager in Microsoft''s Windows group, in an interview. </p>
<p>By going with Outlook, Microsoft is trying to capitalize on
the brand behind the most-used corporate e-mail service, sold as
part of its Office suite. While Hotmail is the world''s most
popular Web-based e-mail provider, it has lost ground in the
U.S. to Google and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) as well as other, newer methods
of communication, such as social media. </p>
<p>E-mail is one of the only areas in technology that''s gone
eight years without a significant change -- the last big move
was the release of Gmail -- and for us it''s maybe been even
longer than that since our last big change, Hall said. None
of the social networks existed then, and the types of e-mail we
get have changed. </p>
<p>Hotmail was the only one of the top three Web-mail services
to lose unique visitors globally in the year through June 2012,
falling 4 percent, according to ComScore Inc. (SCOR) Yahoo Mail gained
2 percent and Gmail increased 17 percent. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), embroiled in patent
litigation with Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Motorola Mobility unit, said it''s
open to reaching a comprehensive settlement of disputes that
have limited sales of Motorola Mobility products in the U.S. and
Germany. </p>
<p>This particular litigation now stands at a crossroads,
Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith and Horacio Gutierrez, head
of Microsoft''s intellectual property group, said in a joint blog
posting. Google can take one of two paths: it can choose
either to engage in serious discussions to search for patent
peace or persevere in its diversionary tactics. We hope it will
choose the first course, and we stand ready to engage in good
faith if it does. </p>
<p>Microsoft has won orders that banned U.S. imports of
Motorola Mobility phones that use a patented feature to
coordinate schedules between phones and personal computers. It''s
also won limits on sales of some Motorola Mobility products in
Germany based on other Microsoft patents. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, which Mountain View, California-based
Google bought in May, said it too is willing to reach an
agreement. It said Microsoft is the one that''s causing
difficulties in ending the litigation. </p>
<p>Microsoft wants to undercut Motorola''s industry-leading
patent portfolio, licensed by more than 50 other companies on
fair and reasonable terms, while seeking inflated royalties tied
to standards that Microsoft alone controls, Becki Leonard, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. Motorola
is always open to negotiations that avoid wasteful and abusive
patent claims. </p>
<h2>Infringement Claims </h2>
<p>Motorola Mobility has lodged its own patent-infringement
claims against Microsoft, including cases in the U.S. and
Germany targeting the Xbox video-gaming system and Windows
operating system. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility has submitted offers to license its
patents, some of which relate to standards established by
industry groups for video compression and Wi-Fi technology. It
also has offered to take a license to the coordination feature,
known as ActiveSync, that it has previously licensed from
Microsoft before 2007. </p>
<p>Microsoft contends the offer doesn''t meet Motorola
Mobility''s obligation to license such patents on fair and
reasonable terms, and the licensing offer should be based on
market rates. It filed a breach of contract suit that''s
scheduled for trial in November in federal court in Seattle,
near Microsoft''s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. </p>
<h2>Licensing Agreements </h2>
<p>Smith and Gutierrez said any agreement must cover all
Microsoft patents, including ones the company claims Google''s
Android operating system infringed. The software maker has
reached licensing agreements with other companies that
manufacture devices that run on Android, including Barnes 
Noble Inc. (BKS) and Samsung Electronics Co. </p>
<p>The European Union is investigating claims filed by
Microsoft and Apple Inc. (AAPL) that Motorola Mobility is misusing its
patents. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a July 11
hearing on whether there should be limits placed on the use of
standard-essential patents. </p>
<p>Microsoft and Apple contend that owners who help develop
standards shouldn''t be allowed to use essential patents to block
competitors. Google has told regulators it won''t seek any block
as long as companies are in licensing negotiations. It has
accused Microsoft and Apple of refusing to negotiate. </p>
<p>The U.S. International Trade Commission is considering
whether such patents should be the basis of an import ban, in a
case Motorola Mobility filed against Apple. A final decision in
that case is due Aug. 24. </p>

top-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor, which lost market
exclusivity in November. The spin off of the animal-health unit
and spending cuts are part of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read''s
plan to refocus the company on producing new drugs to replace
Lipitor, once the world''s biggest-selling medicine. </p>
<p>We''re before the middle innings, because it takes a
longer timeline, to develop products than to reduce expenses,
Read said today in an interview. </p>
<p>As part of a spending overhaul, Pfizer may cut as many as
10 more facilities in the next several years, Chief Financial
Officer Frank D''Amelio said. </p>
<p>The company''s shares gained 1.4 percent to $24.04 at the
close in New York, their highest price in more than four years.
The stock has gained 11 percent this year. </p>
<h2>Serious Cuts </h2>
<p>Read showed he is serious about cost cutting, and
investors already rewarded him with a nice run-up in the stock
price over the last 12 months, Erik Gordon, a professor of
business at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in an
e-mail. The new products have to pan out and Pfizer has to
grow its non-U.S. sales in the face of a global slowdown.  Both
are riskier propositions. </p>
<p>The company has three experimental drugs in late-stage
testing that investors are focused on as the near-term
replacements for Lipitor. </p>
<p>Tofacitinib, one of those drugs, is meant to treat
rheumatoid arthritis. U.S. regulatory approval might be delayed
beyond its current August deadline, the company said today. </p>
<p>Pfizer also released a study today showing the drug was
more effective than methotrexate, an older treatment.
Tofacitinib was superior in easing pain and swelling of joints
caused by rheumatoid arthritis and no new side effects were
found, according to the study. Results were from the last of
three stages of human tests generally required for Food and Drug
Administration approval. The drug may compete with Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)'' top-seller, Humira. </p>
<h2>Other Setbacks </h2>
<p>Other top prospects have had setbacks. Bapineuzumab, an
Alzheimer''s disease drug being developed with Johnson  Johnson
and Elan Corp., failed the first of four pivotal, final-stage
clinical trials, Pfizer said on July 24. Results from the next
trial will be released in August, Read said. </p>
<p>The company is also seeking marketing clearance for
Eliquis, a blood thinner being developed with New York-based
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) The FDA rejected Eliquis in June,
asking the companies for more information from existing trials. </p>
<p>The FDA could take as long as six months after the
companies give regulators the data to respond. The agency hasn''t
asked for a new clinical trial. The drug, aimed at patients with
heart arrhythmia, would have $2.5 billion a year in sales by
2015 if approved, according to Tim Anderson, a Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. analyst in New York. </p>
<h2>Financial Results </h2>
<p>The cost cutting helped Pfizer make its numbers this
quarter. Revenue fell 9 percent to $15.1 billion in the quarter,
led by declining sales of Lipitor, which dropped 53 percent to
$1.22 billion. Adjusted expenses, including marketing,
administrative and research and development costs, dropped 16
percent to $8.27 billion. The company reiterated its 2012
adjusted earnings forecast of $2.14 to $2.24 a share. </p>
<p>I''m not sure that cost cutting can''t continue in some
form or fashion, especially as Pfizer has entered a period of a
number of expiries, Tony Butler, an analyst with Barclays Plc,
said in a telephone interview. Margins and the ability to hold
back costs are much better than we as analysts predicted. </p>
<p>Pfizer plans to sell shares of the animal-health business
in the first half of next year, Read said. The company will file
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that will start the process of separating the
business in August. </p>
<h2>Zoetis Business </h2>
<p>Along with the IPO, Pfizer plans to give current
shareholders stock in the animal-health business, to be named
Zoetis, he has said previously. The company hasn''t announced yet
where the company will have its headquarters, nor said who will
lead it. </p>
<p>In April, Pfizer agreed to sell its infant nutrition
business to Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA for $11.9
billion. </p>
<p>Money from the unit divestitures may be to be used for
share buybacks, which Read calls the case to beat, compared
with acquisitions. </p>
<p>The company has bid for other companies, including
drugmaker Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bloomberg has reported.
However, it hasn''t made a purchase worth more than $50 million
during Read''s tenure, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>We invest internally in projects that we believe have a
return above our cost of capital, Read said. External
opportunities are subject to the same analysis. We are not going
to do projects that do not return our cost of capital because of
issues internally or non-issues internally. Our willingness to
do deal externally is driven by the value of the deals. </p>
<p>The second quarter was the first in which Lipitor faced the
full might of competition from generic versions of the pill. Six
months ago, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. and Watson Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (WPI) were the only rivals. </p>
<p>Sales of Lyrica, used to treat pain, rose 14 percent to
$1.04 billion. Enbrel, an injection to treat rheumatoid
arthritis symptoms, generated $988 million in sales, an increase
of 8 percent. Revenue from Prevnar, Pfizer''s vaccine for
pneumococcal diseases, gained 12 percent to $916 million. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $101.6
million of structured notes tied to the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index (SPX), its largest offering this year, after increasing the size
three times to satisfy demand. </p>
<p>The five-year securities, $70 million of which were issued
July 9, yield 1.5 times the gains of the index, with investors
risking principal if the SP 500 falls more than 50 percent,
according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The New York-based bank sold $16.2 million
more notes on July 12, $10.1 million additional ones on July 18,
and $5.31 million more on July 24, according to the SEC filings. </p>
<p>For the most recent issuance, the bank estimated the value
of the securities at $960 per $1,000, down from $976 on July 9.
Between July 9 and 24, the SP 500 fell 1 percent to 1,338.3.
The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
is known, climbed 14 percent to 20.47 during the same period. </p>
<p>Such notes are very sensitive to changes in the
volatility of the linked index, said Guus Oonincx, founder of
G.O. Capital Markets Consulting Services LLC and a former
managing director at ING Financial Group. That is often the
culprit for these pricing differences. </p>
<p>The price of credit default swaps on Goldman Sachs, which
can be used to hedge against losses on the company''s debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, also climbed by about 30 basis
points to 302.7 basis points during the two weeks, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Higher credit risk reduces the value
of structured notes, which are securities created by banks that
package debt with derivatives. </p>
<p>Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the note. </p>
<p>The bank distributed the latest securities for a 0.3
percent fee, compared with 0.35 percent for the other three
sales, according to the SEC filings. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s second-largest offering, on March 27, was
$100 million of one-year notes linked to the Dow Jones-UBS
Commodity Index. </p>

<p>Jim O''Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said he expects China''s central bank to
continue cutting interest rates to shore up the economy. </p>
<p>I think they need more interest-rate cuts, O''Neill said
in an interview with Bloomberg Radio from London today.
Inflation has come down sharply, probably more than they
expected, and the economy of course has weakened quite a bit,
too. It''s pretty obvious we''re going to get more rate cuts. </p>
<p>China''s leaders pledged today to keep adjusting policies to
ensure stable economic growth this year, with the Politburo
reiterating the country will pursue a prudent monetary
policy and proactive fiscal policy. The central bank has cut
interest rates twice since early June, reduced banks'' reserve
requirements three times since November and sped approvals for
investment projects as economic growth weakened. </p>
<p>O''Neill also said that it''s rather good that emerging
economies worry so much about the euro area''s fiscal crisis
as it will encourage them to pay more attention to their own
imbalances. </p>

<p>Visa Europe Ltd., operator of the
European Union''s largest payment-card network, was sent an
antitrust complaint from EU regulators over the fees it charges
to process cross-border credit-card payments. </p>
<p>Visa Europe''s so-called multilateral interchange fees
harm competition between acquiring banks, inflate the cost of
payment card acceptance for merchants and ultimately increase
consumer prices, the European Commission said in an e-mailed
statement today. </p>
<p>Card fees paid by retailers are too high and there
isn''t any sign that they''ve decreased since 2006, the EU''s
competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in May. Regulators
last year settled an earlier probe into Visa Europe''s fees for
debit-card payments made outside a user''s home country. </p>
<p>Visa Europe issues about 41 percent of all payment cards in
Europe, the Brussels-based antitrust agency said. More than 5
million businesses in Europe accept its payments, which valued
1.8 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) in 2010, the EU said. </p>
<p>We are very disappointed that the commission has taken
such a confrontational approach and was not willing to find a
solution to support investment and innovation in European
payment, Peter Ayliffe, chief executive officer of Visa
Europe, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Visa Europe can defend itself in writing or seek an oral
hearing before EU regulators take a decision on fines that can
amount to 10 percent of yearly sales. Visa Europe split from
Visa Inc. (V) before the U.S. card company''s initial public offering
in early 2008. </p>
<h2>Cartels Outlawed </h2>
<p>The Brussels-based antitrust agency said Visa Europe''s fees
restricted competition between banks and violated EU rules that
outlaw cartels and restrictive business practices. </p>
<p>While the EU has previously said interchange fees aren''t
illegal, regulators said Visa Europe''s fees weren''t set in a way
that would benefit consumers. They also said they doubted the
company''s argument that the fees are necessary to create
efficiencies that benefited retailers and consumers. </p>
<p>The fee, based on Visa''s guidelines, is paid by the
retailer''s bank to the bank that issued the customer''s card. The
EU''s objections cover fees paid on cross-border transactions in
Europe as well as domestic fees in Belgium, Hungary, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Sweden. </p>
<h2>MasterCard Challenge </h2>
<p>Regulators'' decision to curb MasterCard Inc. (MA)''s cross-border
card fees was backed by an EU court last month. The court
rejected MasterCard''s challenge to the EU decision that it
unfairly inflated the transaction fees paid by retailers for
processing payments. MasterCard will appeal the case to the EU''s
highest court. </p>
<p>Retailers have long complained about the cost they are
charged to accept card payments. Unlike for checks, banks charge
interchange fees to process debit- and credit-card payments.
Card operators set the amounts, own the payment networks and
pass the money to the lenders. The retailer''s bank pays the fees
to the customer''s card issuer. </p>
<p>Visa Inc., MasterCard and some of the biggest U.S. banks
this month agreed to a U.S. settlement of at least $6.05 billion
in a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card
swipe fees. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Italy''s
biggest insurer, may say second-quarter profit rose as year-
earlier writedowns on securities including Greek bonds weren''t
repeated. </p>
<p>Net income probably increased to 254 million euros ($311
million) from 190 million a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates ranged from 115 million euros to 481 million euros. </p>
<p>We expect mixed results, Gianantonio Villani, an
analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, who has a buy
recommendation on the stock, wrote in a July 26 report. Net
profit may increase on an annual basis because of weak earnings
a year ago, though profit could fall by half on a like-for-like
basis because of claims related to earthquakes in northern Italy
during this year''s quarter, he said. </p>
<p>Generali is grappling with rising losses from its non-life
segment linked to the two quakes in the Emilia Romagna region
May 20 and May 29 and lower investment income in the life
business, which was hurt by the negative trend on equity markets
and Italy''s sovereign debt exposure. </p>
<p>Operating profit is expected to decline 13 percent to 1
billion euros in the quarter, according to the analysts.
Operating profit may decline 26 percent to 302 million euros in
the non-life business, and may drop 6 percent to 737 million
euros in the life segment. </p>
<p>Generali''s main investors ousted Chief Executive Officer
Giovanni Perissinotto in June after the insurer''s profit fell
for four consecutive quarters, replacing him with Mario Greco.
Greco, 53, will formally join the insurer at a board meeting
Aug. 1, facing the task of reviving profit and strengthening
capital. </p>
<p>We have positive expectations from the management
reshuffle, Alberto Villa, an analyst at Intermonte SIM SpA,
wrote in a note July 18. The new CEO will kick off a process
of rationalizing the group''s activities, which will include
asset disposals, cost-cutting and optimization of investments. </p>
<p>The insurer is due to report earnings on Aug. 2 before the
market opens and will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. the same
day. Following is a table of the analysts'' estimates and the

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, put in place the last piece of its plan to refocus
the company on developing new drugs, announcing it would start
the separation of its animal-health business this month. </p>
<p>As the drugmaker spins off the unit and makes deep spending
cuts, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has set the stage for
Pfizer''s future without Lipitor, the drug that dominated the
company''s sales until this year after losing market exclusivity.
Top on the agenda is making New York-based Pfizer better at
turning out innovative new medicines, he said. </p>
<p>The company has three drugs with the potential to generate
over a $1 billion each in sales that could reach the market next
year, including treatments for heart disease, Alzheimer''s and
rheumatoid arthritis. Eliquis, a blood thinner, could be
approved in the first half of 2013. </p>
<p>On the research side, we''re before the middle innings,
because it takes a longer timeline, than cutting expenses,
Read said yesterday in an interview. We need to make it easier
for people to make an impact and get things done inside a
company that has 100,000 colleagues. </p>
<p>Pfizer yesterday said it would start an initial public
offering in mid-August to sell as much as 20 percent of its
animal-health unit. </p>
<p>It also reported second-quarter net income that rose 25
percent to $3.25 billion, or 43 cents a share, and adjusted
earnings per share that topped analyst estimates by 8 cents,
largely due to aggressive cuts that knocked out $8.27 billion in
adjusted expenses. Revenue sank 9 percent to $15.1 billion in
the quarter led by declining sales of Lipitor, which dropped 53
percent to $1.22 billion. </p>
<h2>Shares Increase </h2>
<p>Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $23.94 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The company''s stock has gained 26 percent in the last
12 months. </p>
<p>The company continues to generate enough cash, and has fat
to trim, Read said. As part of its spending overhaul, Pfizer may
cut as many as 10 more facilities in the next several years,
Chief Financial Officer Frank D''Amelio said. </p>
<p>Read showed he is serious about cost cutting, and
investors already rewarded him with a nice run-up in the stock
price over the last 12 months, Erik Gordon, a professor of
business at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said
yesterday in an e-mail. The new products have to pan out and
Pfizer has to grow its non-U.S. sales in the face of a global
slowdown.  Both are riskier propositions. </p>
<p>Read and D''Amelio also have been able to keep earnings per
share up through stock buybacks. The company bought back $9
billion in shares last year and will buy back $5 billion this
year, D''Amelio said. </p>
<h2>RD Effort </h2>
<p>Pfizer can keep investors interested by dividends and
using cash to buy back stock, said Tony Butler, an analyst
with Barclays Plc. As for the research and development effort,
it takes some time for those changes to bear fruit. </p>
<p>There have been setbacks. </p>
<p>Yesterday, the company said that U.S. regulators may delay
approval of tofacitinib, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis,
beyond its current August deadline. </p>
<p>At the same time, Pfizer released a study showing the drug
was more effective than methotrexate, an older treatment.
Tofacitinib was superior in easing pain and swelling of joints
caused by rheumatoid arthritis and no new side effects were
found, according to the study. Results were from the last of
three stages of human tests generally required for Food and Drug
Administration approval. The drug may compete with Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)'' top-seller, Humira. </p>
<h2>Experimental Drugs </h2>
<p>Bapineuzumab, an Alzheimer''s disease drug being developed
with Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Elan Corp., failed the first of four
pivotal, final-stage clinical trials, Pfizer said on July 24.
Results from the next trial will be released this month, Read
said. </p>
<p>The company also is seeking marketing clearance for
Eliquis, a blood thinner being developed with New York-based
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) The FDA rejected Eliquis in June,
asking the companies for more information from existing trials. </p>
<p>The FDA could take as long as six months after the
companies give regulators the data to respond. The agency hasn''t
asked for a new clinical trial. The drug, aimed at patients with
heart arrhythmia, would have $2.5 billion a year in sales by
2015 if approved, according to Tim Anderson, a Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. analyst in New York. </p>
<h2>Innovation Engines </h2>
<p>Read said he''s committed to sticking with his strategy of
getting Pfizer''s innovation engines working even if there are
near-term setbacks, and won''t turn to buying drugs or companies
just to fill the pipeline. </p>
<p>We invest internally in projects that we believe have a
return above our cost of capital, Read said. External
opportunities are subject to the same analysis. We are not going
to do projects that do not return our cost of capital because of
issues internally or non-issues internally. Our willingness to
do deals externally is driven by the value of the deals. </p>
<p>The company has bid for other companies, including
drugmaker Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bloomberg has reported.
However, it hasn''t announced a purchase worth more than $50
million during Read''s tenure, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The company has cash coming that will give it more room to
breathe, from the divestiture of the two noncore units. April,
Pfizer agreed to sell its infant nutrition business to Vevey,
Switzerland-based Nestle SA for $11.9 billion. </p>
<h2>Zoetis Business </h2>
<p>Along with the IPO of the animal-health business, Pfizer
plans to give current shareholders stock in the company, to be
named Zoetis, Read has said previously. That will further reduce
Pfizer''s amount of outstanding stock and increase earnings per
share. </p>
<p>The drugmaker plans to sell shares of the animal-health
business in the first half of next year, Read said. The company
will file a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that will start the process of separating
the business this month. </p>
<p>Pfizer hasn''t announced yet where the animal health company
will have its headquarters, nor said who will lead it. </p>
<p>Money from the divestitures is likely be to be used for
share buybacks, which Read calls the case to beat, compared
with acquisitions. </p>
<p>Butler, of Barclays, thinks Pfizer and the rest of the
pharmaceutical sector are entering a period with more research
and development promise than any time in a decade. </p>
<p>They''re managing these businesses much better than they
did at the turn of the decade and the mid-90s, he said. They
are growth stocks. Not at the level they once were. But perhaps
at a more sustainable level than they had been. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley changed its forecast
for Bank of England stimulus and now sees policy makers
expanding their bond-purchase plan and cutting their benchmark
interest rate, citing a deteriorating economic outlook. </p>
<p>The central bank will increase so-called quantitative
easing by 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) in both November and
February and lower its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 0.25
percent in November, London-based economists Melanie Baker and
Jonathan Ashworth said in an e-mailed note to clients today.
They had previously predicted no more purchases or a rate cut. </p>
<p>Data last week showed the U.K. economy shrank the most in
more than three years in the second quarter, deepening its first
double-dip recession since 1975. The weakening outlook prompted
Barclays Plc yesterday to change its forecast for U.K. stimulus,
with economist Simon Hayes now expecting an increase in QE of 50
billion pounds in November and a reduction in borrowing costs. </p>
<p>We have become much more pessimistic on the outlook for
investment in particular, Baker and Ashworth said in their
note. There''s only so much policy makers can do given the poor
economic backdrop and huge uncertainty about future events in
the euro area. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also reduced its gross domestic product
forecasts and sees the economy shrinking 0.5 percent this year
before growing 1 percent in 2013, compared with previous
estimates of 0.5 percent and 1.8 percent expansion respectively. </p>
<h2>Manufacturing Slump </h2>
<p>Data today showed U.K. manufacturing shrank the most in
more than three years in July as new orders slumped. A gauge of
factory output, based on a survey by Markit Economics and the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, fell to 45.4 from
a revised 48.4 in June, Markit said on its website today. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction. </p>
<p>The Bank of England''s Monetary Policy Committee, which
begins its monthly two-day meeting today, will maintain its
target for bond purchases at 375 billion pounds tomorrow,
according to all but one of 40 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Scotiabank changed its forecast in a note dated July 29
and now sees an expansion of the asset-purchase target by 25
billion pounds this week. </p>
<p>All 53 economists in a separate poll say the bank will keep
its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent. The central bank
announces its decision at noon in London tomorrow. </p>

<p>New York City will try to reduce the
recidivism of young male convicts housed on Rikers Island with a
four-year program run by nonprofits and financed by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>The bank will invest $9.6 million through a so-called
social-impact bond, meaning it will profit only if the plan
achieves its goals. New York officials said the program is the
first of its kind in the U.S. </p>
<p>In this new model, private investors fund the
intervention through a nonprofit contractor and the government
pays the contractor only if the program meets its goals, Mayor
Michael Bloomberg''s office said in a news release. </p>
<p>For Goldman Sachs to earn a profit, the program will need
to reduce recidivism by at least 10 percent. City payments to
MDRC, a nonprofit social-policy group created by the Ford
Foundation that will monitor and run the program, also will be
based on its degree of success. The Vera Institute of Justice
will independently assess the program''s effectiveness, the
mayor''s office said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will fully fund the four-year program, called
the Adolescent Behavioral Learning Experience, through a loan to
New York-based MDRC. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the mayor''s
private charity, will provide $7.2 million to MDRC to back a
portion of Goldman Sachs''s loan. There will be a cost to the
city only if the program succeeds, the mayor''s office said. </p>
<h2>New Instrument </h2>
<p>This investment paves the way for a new type of
instrument that enables the public sector to leverage upfront
funding from the private sector, Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman
Sachs''s chief executive officer, said in a statement. </p>
<p>The program''s targets are inmates age 16 to 18, whose
recidivism rate is now about 50 percent, the mayor''s office
said. Inmates will receive education, training and counseling to
improve personal-responsibility skills, including decision-
making and problem-solving, the mayor''s office said. </p>
<p>Two other New York-based nonprofits, the Osborne
Association and Friends of Island Academy, will also deliver
recreational activities to reduce idleness, promote team
building and afford opportunities for adolescents to practice
what they are learning in a variety of settings and
circumstances, the mayor''s office said. </p>
<p>The program is part of the Bloomberg administration''s
privately supported $30 million Young Men''s Initiative, which
seeks ways to improve productivity and reduce risk of poverty
for young males. </p>
<p>It''s also part of a national search by Bloomberg''s
foundation to find innovative policies and practices to deal
with difficult urban problems, the mayor''s office said. To
further that effort, the mayor last month offered $9 million in
prizes to U.S. cities through the foundation in a competition
for ideas that local governments can use to solve problems. </p>
<p>Lessons learned from the nation''s first social-impact
bond will be shared with other jurisdictions who are eager to
test the approach, the mayor''s news release said. </p>
<p>The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led foreign
banks in accelerating job cuts at their Japanese brokerages last
fiscal year as employees relocated to other Asian financial
centers and firms trimmed costs amid a global industry slump. </p>
<p>The number of staff at nine global securities firms in
Japan fell by 537, or 7.3 percent, to a combined 6,796 as of
March 31, more than double the previous year''s 3.2 percent
reduction, according to company regulatory filings. </p>
<p>Wall Street and European banks have been eliminating jobs
and transferring staff from Japan to Hong Kong and Singapore to
reduce expenses as the euro region''s debt woes dent global
investor confidence. The worst may be over as Japan recovers
from last year''s nuclear crisis and some U.S. firms start hiring
junior bankers for mergers advice and asset management, said
Katsunobu Komizo, a Tokyo-based recruiting consultant. </p>
<p>Overseas banks made deep cuts from October to March due
to the Fukushima and European shocks, especially in investment
banking such as equity underwriting, said Komizo, president of
Executive Search Partners Co. But we''ve past the peak. </p>
<p>Stock underwriting in Japan suffered last year as companies
shunned capital markets after the March 2011 earthquake and
tsunami that left 19,000 people dead or missing and caused a
meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant north of Tokyo.
Public offerings fell to 1.2 trillion yen ($15 billion) in the
year ended March from 4 trillion yen a year earlier, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Most Expensive </h2>
<p>Tokyo is the world''s most expensive city for expatriates,
according to ECA International''s Worldwide Cost of Living Survey
conducted in March. Singapore is 32nd and Hong Kong 36th. The
yen touched a postwar high of 75.35 against the dollar in
October, raising costs for overseas banks and their foreign
staff. Japan''s currency traded at 78.43 at 5:45 p.m. local time. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Japan Co. reduced headcount by 14 percent to
847, the biggest cut among the brokerages, according to the
firm''s filing e-mailed to Bloomberg News. The New York-based
company has other operations in Japan, including asset
management. </p>
<p>Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment. Tokyo-based spokesmen for the eight other
brokerages also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Switzerland''s second-biggest
lender, pared the workforce at its Japanese brokerage by 8.6
percent to 540. Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) reduced 7.9 percent of staff at
its local securities unit to 834 and BNP Paribas SA (BNP), France''s
largest bank, cut 7.4 percent to 462. </p>
<h2>Barclays, Citigroup </h2>
<p>Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) also trimmed jobs at
their securities units in Japan, according to the filings to the
Financial Services Agency. Bank of America employed 1,028 staff
at its Japan brokerage as of March 31, the most of the nine
firms. </p>
<p>The brokerages posted combined profits in Japan of 2.9
billion yen for the fiscal year, recovering from losses of 118.6
billion yen a year earlier, the filings showed. Morgan Stanley''s
local joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. led
the gains with net income of 34.6 billion yen. </p>
<p>Barclays (BARC), the U.K.''s second-largest bank, posted net income
of 5.5 billion yen in Japan, the second highest among the nine
brokerages and up from 56 million yen a year earlier. Profit at
Goldman Sachs Japan fell to 4.7 billion yen from 18.1 billion
yen. </p>

<p>Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the consumer
products company targeted by activist investor Bill Ackman,
reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts'' estimates,
helped by price increases. </p>
<p>Net income in the period ended June 30 advanced 45 percent
to $3.63 billion, or $1.24 a share, from $2.51 billion, or 84
cents, a year earlier, Cincinnati-based PG said today in a
statement. Profit excluding some items was 82 cents a share.
Analysts projected 77 cents, the average of 21 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Robert McDonald is working to prove
his pricing and plan to save $10 billion by 2016 through cutting
jobs and marketing will be enough to improve results. Last
month, Ackman''s Pershing Square took a $1.8 billion stake in
PG, and people familiar with the matter said he plans to push
for leadership changes. </p>
<p>It''s easy to clamp down on spending for three to six
months, but he has to convince investors that he can permanently
reduce PG''s cost structure and, at the same time, grow sales,
Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan,
said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>PG, the maker of Tide laundry detergent and Duracell
batteries, rose 3.1 percent to $65.50 at the close in New York.
The shares have declined 1.8 percent this year. </p>
<p>McDonald said on a conference call today that the company
has had talks with Ackman, and declined to provide specific
details. The CEO also forecast job reductions of 10 percent at
PG by the end of 2012. </p>
<h2>Profit Forecast </h2>
<p>The company reiterated its forecast for earnings per share
for fiscal 2013 will be $3.80 to $4. Analysts projected $3.90,
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>There''s an element of pulling out all the stops to look
better, Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.,
said in a telephone interview. And that''s fine if that''s
continuous. If Procter  Gamble needed an activist scare to do
better, that''s great. </p>
<p>PG said it will repurchase $4 billion in stock this fiscal
year. In June, the company suspended stock repurchases to
protect itself from credit downgrades. Chief Financial Officer
Jon Moeller said on a conference call today that the company
reconsidered after having a tremendous cash quarter. </p>
<p>Price increases across all product segments added 4 percent
or more to net sales growth in the quarter, PG said. While the
higher prices helped counter increased costs for raw materials,
volume was little changed from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Price reductions in six areas including U.S. laundry
products are now helping PG boost market share, Moeller said.
PG will cut prices by $400 million, he said. </p>
<h2>Sales Decline </h2>
<p>Commodity costs will increase modestly next year,
executives said on the conference call. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter sales fell 1.2 percent to $20.21 billion,
trailing the $20.25 billion average of analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Executives on the conference call said they expected the
company to return to long-term growth rates by fiscal year 2014,
helped by a strengthening U.S. business. Dibadj called the
projection bullish. </p>
<p>McDonald said he was working to make the company''s culture
more productive and accountable. </p>
<p>I''m very encouraged by the leadership team we have in
place now, he said. I just wish I had done it three years
ago. I think we''ve got the right team. </p>
<p>Ackman, who said his PG stake is his largest initial
investment ever, this year won an effort to remove Canadian
Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) CEO Fred Green and replace him with Hunter Harrison. Ackman also pushed Fortune Brands Inc. to break up,
and the company last year split into spirits maker Beam Inc. (BEAM) and
a company that sells home products such as faucets and locks. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it''s
closing a bearish wager on wheat prices because of worsening
weather conditions for crops in the former Soviet Union,
Australia, India and Argentina. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had been short wheat for delivery in May 2013
versus corn on the Chicago Board of Trade, New York-based
analyst Damien Courvalin said today in an e-mailed report. The
price difference closed at about 72 cents a bushel yesterday,
allowing for a gain of almost 50 cents a bushel after the bank
entered its bearish wager when the spread was at $1.21,
according to the report. </p>
<p>Wheat production in the former Soviet Union, Australia,
India and Argentina may be 15 million metric tons below the U.S.
Department of Agriculture''s forecast in July because of dry
weather, creating growing upside risks to wheat prices in
coming months, Courvalin said. The USDA is slated to update
its global crop estimates Aug. 10. </p>
<p>Still, global wheat inventories are likely to remain more
ample than corn, meaning wheat may underperform in the next 12
months, Courvalin said. Both grains are used in livestock feed.
Corn prices have surged 59 percent since mid-June as the worst
drought since 1956 damaged crops in the U.S., while wheat rose
41 percent and soybeans rallied 24 percent in the same period. </p>
<p>The bank said it''s bullish soybeans for November delivery
versus a bearish wager for December corn, as soybeans are likely
to reverse part of their recent underperformance to corn,
according to the report. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) should cut its fixed-
income trading business in half and use the freed-up capital to
buy back a quarter of its shares, said Ed Najarian, an analyst
at International Strategy  Investment Group Inc. </p>
<p>The firm should cut its so-called risk-weighted assets by
$150 billion under Basel III rules, about twice the reduction it
currently plans, Najarian estimated yesterday in a research
note. The larger reduction and buybacks could double Morgan
Stanley''s stock price to about $27, he wrote. </p>
<p>The bank will continue shrinking its fixed-income trading
unit, cutting risk-weighted assets 30 percent from the third
quarter of 2011 through the end of 2014, Chief Executive Officer
James Gorman said last month. Najarian joined CLSA Ltd.''s
Michael Mayo in saying that reduction isn''t enough. </p>
<p>With Morgan Stanley stock languishing at about 50 percent
of tangible book value, and down more than 50 percent over the
past three years, we think management needs to potentially
embark upon a more aggressive strategic plan in an effort to
create value for shareholders, Najarian wrote. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 percent yesterday to $13.03 and has
declined 14 percent this year. The stock has dropped 56 percent
since Gorman took over at the beginning of 2010. Najarian, who
has a hold rating on the shares, said the current price could
prove an attractive entry point for speculative investors. </p>
<h2>Forced Selling </h2>
<p>Najarian estimated that Morgan Stanley had about $500
billion of risk-weighted assets at the end of the second
quarter, with the fixed-income trading business accounting for
$305 billion. Morgan Stanley hasn''t provided its risk-weighted
assets under Basel III rules, saying only that its Tier 1 common
ratio was just below 8.5 percent. </p>
<p>The firm probably would incur about $3 billion of pretax
losses from reducing assets at a quicker pace, as it would be
forced to sell some positions at below-market prices, Najarian
said. The cuts would allow the bank to repurchase $12 billion in
stock from 2013 through 2015, enough to reduce outstanding
shares by at least 25 percent, he wrote. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley could buy back about 13 percent of the
shares by the end of 2015 under its current plan, Najarian
estimated. </p>
<p>He didn''t specify in the research note which fixed-income
businesses would incur the additional cuts. Chief Financial
Officer Ruth Porat said last month that Morgan Stanley would
target structured credit and sub-investment-grade securitization
products in its reductions. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley management must decide to further shrink the
fixed-income business, as it would be hard for an activist
investor to force the company to do so, Najarian said. About
half of the firm''s shares are held by employees, index funds,
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and China Investment Corp.,
he wrote. </p>

<p>The good thing about having back
surgery if you''re an Olympic athlete, says U.S. water polo
player Peter Hudnut, is it gives you time to be an intern. </p>
<p>One of 11 members of the American squad returning to the
Olympics after winning a silver medal in Beijing, Hudnut will
join Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s private wealth management
division following the London Games, which end Aug. 12. </p>
<p>The job at Goldman may never have happened if a back
injury, multiple fractures in two vertebrae and shoulder
problems hadn''t sidelined the 32-year-old Stanford University
graduate before the 2004 Games in Athens. While surgery and
months of rehabilitation hampered his athletic career, they gave
him time to get work experience, Hudnut said in an interview at
London''s Athletes Village. </p>
<p>I was somewhat lucky in that I had so many injuries and
every time I had a surgery it would put me out for a handful of
months, the 6-foot-5 central defender said. I was lucky
enough to get some internships -- some through friends, some on
my own -- and that helped guide me where I wanted to go. </p>
<p>Positions at CIM Group, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and
Los Angeles developer Ratkovich Co., as well as his 2011
Stanford business degree, awakened an interest in finance, he
said. Twenty-eight interviews with Goldman left him feeling he''d
found a firm where he could both learn and use the skills
gleaned from years of strenuous training. </p>
<h2>Desire, Discipline </h2>
<p>Desire, discipline and all the things I''ve used in water
polo are very applicable to finance, Hudnut said. The focus
and drive, the ability to communicate effectively with many
different personality types and many different situations, the
ability to adapt and be flexible; these are all traits that team
sport, especially at this level, demand. </p>
<p>The U.S. squad water polo team trained in Thousand Oaks,
California, for almost a year, giving up professional positions
on teams overseas, Hudnut said. The team spent between five and
seven hours in meetings, five days a week. They watched video,
lifted weights and practiced in the pool. The daily sessions
averaged seven to eight hour as the Olympics neared. </p>
<p>Peter in Beijing was a really important part of the glue
that kept the team together, coach Terry Schroeder said in an
interview after the U.S. beat Britain 13-7 on Aug. 2. As he
plays a bit more and feels comfortable with his playing, he''s
taken on that role more and more again and it''s really important
to the team. </p>
<p>The preliminary round finishes today with the U.S. playing
Hungary, the 2008 champions. The Americans have won three of
their four early stage matches. </p>
<h2>Early Dreams </h2>
<p>Hudnut was introduced to water polo as a 10-year-old by
Richard Corso, the assistant coach of the 1984 U.S. team. </p>
<p>I was this huge uncoordinated kid and he came and handed
me this baby blue bag and on one side it had the Olympic rings
and on the other side it said USA, Hudnut said, adding that he
could barely swim at the time. Inside was a water polo ball, a
little suit and a water polo hat. </p>
<p>Almost 6 feet tall (1.82 meters) at 12, Hudnut began
playing against boys two and three years older than himself. In
1992, Corso became the head coach for the U.S. national team. </p>
<p>He would drive me down with him to national team
practice, so I would watch the guys and talk to some of the
heroes of that time about what Olympics meant to them, he
said. That really lit that fire. </p>
<h2>Better Than Beijing </h2>
<p>Ranked ninth in the run-up to the Beijing Games, the U.S.
beat Serbia in the semifinals before losing 14-10 in the gold
medal match against Hungary. It was America''s first medal in
water polo in 20 years. The 2012 squad is more tightly knit and
tactically and physically equal to the best teams, Hudnut said. </p>
<p>I truly believe that this is the first time in a number
of Olympics that any of the top seven teams could potentially
win, he said, adding that playing in professional leagues in
Europe has boosted the ability of both American and Australian
players. The U.S. last won a gold medal in water polo in 1904. </p>
<p>Winning silvers in men''s and women''s water polo in Beijing
was the first time a country walked away with two medals in the
event at a single Olympics, Bill Smith, USA Water Polo secretary
and finance committee chairman and the president of Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Renaissance Capital LLC, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>Whether he wins a second medal, Hudnut is looking forward
to the next stage of his life. </p>
<p>I know it''s going to be a tough year and that''s one of
the things that inspires me, Hudnut said. From a challenge
perspective, my desire to succeed and do well gets me up in the
morning. I hope that Goldman is a true career path for me. </p>
