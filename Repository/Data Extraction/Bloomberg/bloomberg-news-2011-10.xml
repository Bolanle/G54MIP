&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) may almost
eliminate bonuses as it girds for a third-quarter loss, the
Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got the
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank committed to spend no more than 35
to 45 percent of its revenue on staff pay, the least of Wall
Street firms, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL) introduced two new
computer systems, one with faster data access and another for
organizing information from the Web, as it aims to win market
share from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and SAP AG. (SAP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison unveiled one system
yesterday, called the Exalytics Intelligence Machine, that
analyzes information within its dynamic random access memory.
The approach makes the product many times faster than machines
that store data on disk drives, Ellison said in a speech at the
company&#8217;s OpenWorld conference in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kurian, an executive vice president, said today that
Oracle will release another system, dubbed the Big Data
Appliance, to sort information collected by the open-source
software Hadoop -- used for unstructured data such as e-mails
and social media postings -- and load it into Oracle&#8217;s database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle -- the world&#8217;s largest maker of database software
and the second-biggest maker of business applications, behind
SAP -- is seeking to keep its database relevant for computing
jobs that involve increasing amounts of information. Embracing
open-source software tools like Hadoop may help the company hold
its lead in the market as customers seek ways to sift through
information from new sources, such as Facebook and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;New Stuff&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you talk about big data, this is new stuff,&#8221; said
Peter Goldmacher, an analyst at Cowen  Co. in San Francisco.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not cost savings -- it&#8217;s an opportunity for IT to drive
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, companies could meld information from Twitter
with customer data stored in Oracle&#8217;s database to decide which
customers&#8217; posts are most important, Goldmacher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Data Appliance system also includes a so-called
NoSQL database that can store large quantities of information
from Web applications and social-media sites, Kurian said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to Ellison&#8217;s introduction of the DRAM-based
Exalytics system, Sanjay Poonen, president for global solutions
at SAP, said Oracle&#8217;s approach to in-memory computing requires
customers to buy and maintain more hardware than a competitive
SAP system, called Hana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken old technology and thrown more hardware at
it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s another machine you have to buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hana will soon let users analyze data from the Web gathered
with Hadoop, Poonen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparc Chips &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellison also said that Redwood City, California-based
Oracle plans another update to its Sparc microprocessor next
year that&#8217;s twice as fast as its recently released T4 chip. The
idea is to challenge IBM for more hardware sales through
Oracle&#8217;s Sun Microsystems unit, gained in a $7.4 billion
acquisition last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to take IBM on in their strongest suit, which is
the microprocessor,&#8221; Ellison said. Oracle&#8217;s T4 chip runs
software written in the Java programming language faster in a
benchmark test than a competitive IBM system, he said. The
company introduced a new Sparc SuperCluster system on Sept. 26
using the Sparc T4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Mills, an IBM senior vice president, said Ellison may
struggle to make inroads with the Sparc chip. Oracle would have
to make billions of dollars in investments to keep Sparc
competitive with IBM and Intel Corp. in the future, he said last
week in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sparc&#8217;s out of gas,&#8221; Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle&#8217;s Sun hardware sales declined 1.4 percent to $1.67
billion in the three months ended in August as it emphasized
more-profitable systems over lower-priced ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-End Hardware &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle has been pushing high-end computer hardware,
including its Exadata system loaded with database software, and
Exalogic, a system that runs business applications. Ellison
reiterated that Oracle has sold 1,000 of the Exadata machines to
companies, including Procter  Gamble Co. (PG) and BNP Paribas SA,
and could sell 3,000 more this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle is integrating its hardware and software lines to
deliver better performance for various computing tasks, co-
President Mark Hurd said during the conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate interview with &#8220;Bloomberg West,&#8221; Hurd said
Oracle would focus on internal growth for the time being after
making about 70 acquisitions in recent years. The company also
may increase research-and-development spending this year from
the $4.5 billion it spent in the fiscal year ended May 31, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurd said he&#8217;s spending 80 percent of his time at OpenWorld
meeting with customers, who are spending on areas such as mobile
computing and making data available faster to their users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very focused this second on organic growth,&#8221; Hurd
said. &#8220;We feel great about our portfolio.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, began extracting crude from a southern
California field using steam produced by a 29-megawatt solar-
thermal power plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BrightSource Energy Inc.&#8217;s system uses mirrors to focus
sunlight on a boiler at Chevron&#8217;s Coalinga, California, enhanced
oil recovery project, the solar company said in a statement
after extraction began today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar-thermal technology companies such as BrightSource are
targeting industrial users in the oil-recovery and food-
processing industries as customers as well as power generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining and metals processing are also very promising,
especially in remote areas where power can also be generated
along with heat, Charlie Ricker, BrightSource senior vice
president of business development, said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is exploring the possibility of more plants
with Chevron and others, Ricker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This technology has the potential to augment gas-powered
steam generation and may provide an additional resource in areas
of the world where natural gas is expensive or not readily
available,&#8221; Chevron Technology Ventures President Desmond King
said today in a company statement. The project produces about
the same amount of steam as one gas-fired steam generator,
Chevron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7,644 Mirrors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coalinga plant consists of 3,822 mirror systems, or
heliostats, each with two 10-foot (3-meter) by 7-foot mirrors
mounted on a 6-foot steel pole focusing light on a 327-foot
solar tower. Steam created by the heat is fed into the oil
reservoir, making it easier to bring to the surface. The system
began generating steam in August, Kristin Hunter, a spokeswoman
for Oakland, California-based BrightSource, said today in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areva SA&#8217;s Areva Solar, Seville, Spain-based Abengoa SA,
Erlangen, Germany-based Solar Millennium AG (S2M) and Burbank,
California-based eSolar Inc. are competing with BrightSource
with their own solar-thermal technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glasspoint Solar Inc., based in Fremont, California, makes
solar steam generators for the oil and gas industry using
mirrored troughs inside of glasshouse enclosures to protect the
mirrors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$16.3 Billion Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, fits very well with solar
temperatures, Glasspoint Vice President John O&#8217;Donnell, said
today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 32 percent of California&#8217;s industrial and commercial
gas use is for EOR as its use grows in the U.S. and all over the
world, O&#8217;Donnell said. The state produces about 40% of its oil
using EOR and in a few years that will grow to 60%, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company can produce heat for EOR for about $3 per
million British thermal units, compared with about $4 for a
comparable natural-gas plant in the U.S. and between $10 to $12
for other conventional solar thermal technologies, O&#8217;Donnell
said. &#8220;We are the only ones below natural gas right now in the
U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to BCC Research, the global market for enhanced-
oil-recovery technologies was $4.7 billion in 2009 and is
expected to grow at a 5-year compound annual rate of 28 percent,
reaching $16.3 billion in 2014, BrightSource said in its
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. oil company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) are among mortgage servicers that
may face $13.5 billion in costs if the Federal Housing
Administration rejects insurance claims on soured loans,
according to FBR Capital Markets Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denials from the FHA, which insures loans made by banks and
private lenders for home purchases, could be the latest expense
from U.S. housing programs, Paul Miller, an FBR analyst, said
today in a note to clients. The government said in May that it
could pursue other lenders after suing Deutsche Bank AG for more
than $1 billion, accusing the firm of lying to the FHA while
arranging mortgage insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The servicing of FHA loans comes with highly technical
regulatory mandated procedures,&#8221; Miller said in the note. &#8220;The
agency&#8217;s narrowly proscribed requirements make it more likely
for the servicers, not the originators, to be tripped up. If the
agency is looking for a way to deny a claim, the servicing
process is an easy target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders and servicers have faced surging costs as U.S.-
owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac demanded that banks repurchase
defective loans and the U.S. sued 17 firms to recoup losses on
mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America has plunged 59
percent in New York this year, falling below $6 today for the
first time since 2009. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have dropped 32
percent and 25 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHA also could target lenders, which may result in
$11.5 billion in additional costs, Miller wrote. The agency has
been focusing on &#8220;procedural issues,&#8221; rather than the quality
of collateral behind mortgages, making it more likely that
servicers will face scrutiny, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delinquent Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers have turned more to FHA-backed loans after the
collapse of subprime lenders, according to Miller. The FHA
covers about 10 percent of all mortgage debt outstanding, up
from 4 percent in 2006. The insurance program has $4.7 billion
in capital against a $1 trillion portfolio, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If housing prices decline further, more loans could
become delinquent and the agency&#8217;s capital buffer could creep
toward zero,&#8221; Miller wrote. &#8220;The agency could turn to
widespread claim denials in order to reduce losses to its
insurance fund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan
was asked during a June conference whether he was concerned that
the FHA would reject the lender&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d say it is a risk,&#8221; said Moynihan, 51. &#8220;All of us,
as we think about the mortgage business, continue to think about
how you do business with various counterparties if their
behavior can change on you during stress times.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Dubrowksi, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America and Tom Kelly of New York-based JPMorgan
declined to comment. Vickee Adams of Wells Fargo, based in San
Francisco, and the FHA&#8217;s Tiffany Thomas Smith didn&#8217;t immediately
return phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jody Shenn" date="Oct 03, 2011  2:57 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-03/strategic-mortgage-delinquencies-as-high-as-27-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Strategic Mortgage Delinquencies as High as 27%</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The number of borrowers choosing to
fall behind on payments on U.S. home loans packaged into bonds
without government backing has held steady over the past year,
meaning the &#8220;strategic delinquencies&#8221; account for a larger
share of new late payments, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategic delinquencies, or mortgages that turn 60 days
late after home-price drops wipe out the equity of homeowners
who are remaining current on other debt, totaled between about
12,000 and 14,000 a month over the past year among the loans,
JPMorgan analysts led by John Sim wrote in a Sept. 30 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more sophisticated prime and Alt-A borrowers are
significantly more likely to choose to go delinquent, even when
they appear to have the means to continue paying,&#8221; the New
York-based analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of strategic delinquencies among the total has
risen to about 26 percent to 27 percent from 20 percent a year
ago, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amherst Securities Group LP analyst Laurie Goodman said
lenders need to reduce principal for homeowners to stem the
foreclosure crisis, which otherwise may engulf more than 10
million additional properties, she estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A record of almost 33 percent of the $1.2 trillion of so-
called securitized non-agency loans are at least 30 days
delinquent, in foreclosure or have been turned into seized
property, according to Bloomberg data based on August bond
reports. That also reflects a slowdown in liquidations of bad
loans amid probes into servicers&#8217; use of flawed paperwork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Rejection &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Attorney General Kamala Harris said on Sept. 30
that she is rejecting a proposed nationwide settlement with U.S.
banks over their foreclosure practices, after reports that the
deal might have included money to fund principal forgiveness and
other loan modifications. She said the proposed agreement is
&#8220;inadequate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10.88 million homes, or 22.5 percent of those with a
mortgage, were &#8220;underwater&#8221; as of June 30, according to
CoreLogic Inc., a Santa Ana, California-based real-estate data
provider. Home prices around 20 of the U.S. largest cities have
tumbled almost 31 percent from their July 2006 peak, according
to an SP/Case-Shiller index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values will probably fall an additional 7 percent until
bottoming next year, according to the JPMorgan analysts, who
were the top-ranked for non-agency mortgage securities in
Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s 2011 poll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumbo Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of strategic delinquencies among prime non-agency
mortgages, which were typically jumbo loans larger than
government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could finance,
is now almost 40 percent, up from about 30 percent a year,
according to their report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Alt-A loans, considered between prime and subprime in
terms of expected defaults, the share is about 35 percent, up
from about 30 percent. For subprime loans, the amount is about
25 percent, up from less than 20 percent, their report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratio is about 15 percent for loans less than $100,000,
compared with almost 35 percent for mortgage larger than
$400,000, according to the analysts. The share among borrowers
with the highest credit scores was more than 40 percent,
compared with about 20 percent for those with the lowest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10,000 homes a month are being liquidated following
strategic defaults on securitized non-agency mortgages, a figure
that has also held steady, they said. The loans represent about
12 percent of total U.S. home-mortgage debt, according to
Federal Reserve data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hermitage Capital Management Ltd.
founder William Browder is lobbying Germany and France after the
U.K. reportedly followed a U.S. ban on Russian officials over
the death of anti-corruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browder, whose London-based fund was once the largest
foreign portfolio investor in Russia, said he believes the U.K.
has barred 60 Russian officials linked to Magnitsky&#8217;s death in a
Moscow prison in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British weekly, the Observer, reported yesterday that
the U.K. had secretly imposed the visa ban, citing former Europe
Minister Christopher Bryant as saying he was informed of the
measure by Immigration Minister Damian Green. The Home Office
declined to comment on individual cases, adding in an e-mailed
statement: &#8220;We can refuse a visa when the individual&#8217;s
character, conduct or associations makes entry to the U.K.
undesirable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government hasn&#8217;t changed its policy and makes
visa decisions on a case-by-case basis, a spokesman for the
British Embassy in Moscow said today by phone, declining to be
identified in line with Foreign Office rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browder accuses the Russian authorities of a whitewash over
Magnitsky&#8217;s death, and has been pressing Western governments to
sanction officials who played a role in it. President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration in July implemented a visa ban on a
number of Russian officials after U.S. senators proposed
legislation to punish Russian human-rights abusers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Frightening Punishment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browder is now seeking to persuade 10 governments in the
European Union, including Germany, France, Poland, the
Netherlands and the Czech Republic, to follow suit. &#8220;I am
confident that these 10 countries will do what&#8217;s required in the
end,&#8221; he today said in a phone interview from The Hague, where
he was meeting with government officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa bans are the best way to put pressure on officials
guilty of human-rights abuses, said former Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov, one of the leaders of the opposition
Parnas party. &#8220;It&#8217;s a frightening punishment for corrupt
bureaucrats who send their children to study abroad and have
property and bank accounts there,&#8221; he said by phone in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Boldyrev said
the authorities were seeking clarification from the U.K. Russia,
which threatened to retaliate against the U.S. visa ban, has had
strained ties with the U.K. since the 2006 murder of dissident
ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London. U.K. Prime Minister
David Cameron made the first visit to Russia by a British leader
in five years last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rights Council &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dmitry Medvedev&#8217;s human rights council in July
said Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage who was 37 when he died
of heart failure, was probably beaten to death in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnitsky, who suffered from gallstone disease, was
transferred from one Moscow prison to another that lacked the
facilities to conduct the medical tests he required, according
to the council. The lawyer said he was abused and denied medical
care to force him to drop allegations of a $230 million tax
fraud by Interior Ministry officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British embassy in Moscow denied
that the U.K. imposed a ban on Russian officials over the death
of anti-corruption lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. has made no changes in its government policies and
didn&#8217;t bar 60 officials linked to Magnitsky&#8217;s death in a Moscow
prison in 2009, an embassy spokesman said by phone from Moscow
today, declining to be identified in line with Foreign Office

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), which generated more
than $79 million in U.S. theaters after converting &#8220;The Lion
King&#8221; to 3-D, will re-release four other animated features in
the format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; will be reissued on Jan. 13 next
year, followed by &#8220;Finding Nemo&#8221; on Sept. 14, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in an e-mail. &#8220;Monsters
Inc.&#8221; will be reissued in January 2013, and &#8220;The Little
Mermaid&#8221; will follow in September of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is just pure gravy for Disney,&#8221; said Wade Holden,
an analyst with the consulting firm SNL Kagan in Monterey,
California. &#8220;Disney puts their films back in their vault, and
then re-issues them a few years later for the next generation
anyway.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-D conversions also help DVD sales by elevating the
profile of the films, Holden added. Disney released &#8220;The Lion
King&#8221; on DVD and Blu-Ray today. The three-dimensional version
of the film opened in theaters on Sept. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 86 cents to $29.86 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 20
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) cut its forecast
for Brazil&#8217;s economic growth and said it expects the central
bank to cut interest rates more than it previously expected as
global financial turmoil weighs on confidence in Latin America&#8217;s
biggest economy, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, in an e-mailed report, said it expects policy
makers to reduce the benchmark interest rate to 10.5 percent by
January from its current 12 percent. Previously the bank
expected the so-called Selic rate to fall to 11 percent in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latin America&#8217;s biggest economy should grow 2.3 percent in
the second half of the year, less than a 3.1 percent forecast
made Aug. 8, JPMorgan analysts wrote in the report. The economy
next year should expand 3.4 percent instead of a previous 3.8
percent forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Domestic growth prospects for next year still seems
cushioned by a more preemptive monetary policy response and the
buffers from fiscal and quasi fiscal policies,&#8221; JPMorgan
analysts including Fabio Akira wrote in today&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency will end the year at 1.80 per U.S. dollar,
compared with the previous forecast of 1.70, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is planning more acquisitions to fuel growth in its $22.5
billion software business, Senior Vice President Steve Mills
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which last week surpassed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become
the world&#8217;s second-most valuable technology company, after Apple
Inc. (AAPL), may spend $100 million to $300 million on targets, the
Armonk, New York-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano has said he&#8217;s seeking
$20 billion in additional annual revenue by 2015. The company
aims to double or triple the pace of sales growth at companies
it acquires and looks for deals that will add to earnings within
two or three years, Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything&#8217;s got to fit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No spurious, off-
to-the-side, unrelated things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM generated $99.9 billion in sales last year. Software,
which had gross margins of 86.9 percent last year, is key to
IBM&#8217;s growth plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has made almost 50 software acquisitions since
2006 in such areas as data analysis, e-commerce, supply-chain
management and computer security, Mills said. More than half of
those have been in business-data analysis, where IBM says it has
spent $14 billion. The company expects those business-analytics
products to yield $16 billion in sales by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hell of a Job&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve done a hell of a job,&#8221; said Joel Achramowicz, an
analyst at Blaylock Robert Van LLC, an investment bank in
Oakland, California. IBM is &#8220;making the right acquisitions at
the right time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company today said it agreed to buy closely held Q1
Labs, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based provider of security
intelligence software, for undisclosed terms. It also created a
new security systems division, to target the $94 billion market
for security software and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell $1.30 to $171.99 at 9:38 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had gained 18 percent
this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is unlikely to make large acquisitions, worth
$10 billion or more, Achramowicz said. He said he dropped
coverage of IBM in April partly because of the company&#8217;s
unwillingness to take on a very large deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the reasons we got kind of bored with the
stock,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are some big software companies out
there, which could augment IBM&#8217;s position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the existing business, &#8220;IBM&#8217;s done about
everything it can to maximize their operating model,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPSS, Cognos &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mills said the company looks for deals that can augment
products it already owns. For example, the statistical-analysis
software company SPSS Inc., which IBM bought in 2009 for about
$1.2 billion, complements the company&#8217;s 2007 acquisition of
Cognos Inc., whose software creates executive &#8220;dashboards&#8221; for
quickly perusing business data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPSS lends Cognos more robust statistics capabilities, and
Cognos helps SPSS users visually depict their data, he said.
That&#8217;s accelerated SPPS&#8217;s growth since IBM bought it, Mills
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you do that, you know you&#8217;re going to get a lift,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) signed an agreement to
open a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia, the
official Saudi Press Agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant will begin production in 2015 and will employ 200
people in King Abdullah Economic City in Rabigh on the Red Sea
coast, the Riyadh-based news service reported, without saying
where it got the information. New York-based Pfizer signed the
agreement with the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority,
the news service said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cocoa supplies will match demand in
the current 2011-12 season as production drops in West Africa,
the top global growing region, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output exceeded demand by 325,000 metric tons in the 2010-
11 season that ended last month on record-high production in
Ivory Coast and Ghana, data from the London-based International
Cocoa Organization show. The countries are the world&#8217;s two
biggest producers of the chocolate ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A return to neutral weather conditions in West Africa
suggests that 2011-12 production will not be as large as the
current crop,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin wrote in
a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocoa prices will be at $2,700 a ton in 3, 6 and 12 months,
the bank said, adding that a possible revival of La Nina weather
conditions may benefit crops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The potential return of the La Nina weather pattern would
be beneficial to West Africa production and present downside
risk to our forecast,&#8221; Courvalin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Nina conditions, a cooling of the Pacific Ocean that can
cause severe climate fluctuations and affect rain patterns, will
strengthen and persist into the Northern Hemisphere&#8217;s 2011-12
winter, the U.S. National Weather Service said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocoa for December delivery slid 6 pounds, or 0.4 percent,
to 1,681 pounds ($2,587) a ton by 9:31 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
London. Cocoa for December delivery fell $29, or 1.1 percent, to
$2,546 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices may advance 20
percent over the next year as growth in emerging markets offsets
the impact of the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and a slowdown
in developed economies, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reiterated an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on
commodities over the next 12 months, while remaining &#8220;neutral&#8221;
in the near term, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a
report today. Oil and copper forecasts for 2012 were reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities in the three months to Sept. 30 had the worst
quarter since 2008 on concern that there may be another global
recession as the European debt crisis escalated. The world
economy will probably expand 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with
an earlier prediction of 4.2 percent, Goldman&#8217;s economists Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson wrote in an Oct. 3 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With recent GDP revisions by our economists falling
hardest on Europe but emerging market growth expectations still
relatively solid, we continue to believe that demand growth in
2012 will be sufficient to tighten major commodity markets,&#8221;
Currie wrote. &#8220;We now see a flatter upward trajectory for
commodity prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil traded in London may average $120 per barrel next
year, down from an earlier call of $130, Goldman said. The
bank&#8217;s 2012 estimate for three-month copper on the London Metal
Exchange was lowered to $9,200 per metric ton from $10,790. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting Calls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman joins BNP Paribas SA and Commerzbank AG in cutting
calls for the metal that some investors see as a barometer for
economic activity. The bank also trimmed the 12-month target for
copper to $9,500 per ton from $11,000, while zinc&#8217;s target was
reduced to $2,400 per ton from $2,700. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sentiment regarding the economic outlook and the European
sovereign-debt problems are likely to remain poor in the near
term, presenting further downside risk to prices as well as our
forecasts,&#8221; Currie wrote. Still, the lower prices should lure
buyers from China, the world&#8217;s largest copper consumer, back
into the market, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for three-month delivery declined for a fifth day in
London, falling as much as 4 percent to $6,712 per ton, before
trading at $6,935 at 2:58 p.m. in Singapore. Brent crude, which
sank 11 percent last month, traded at $101.36 per barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Recession &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital also said the world economy may avoid a
recession as emerging markets expand, which should limit further
losses for commodities, according to a report today from
analysts including Kevin Norrish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A steep rise in production costs over the past few years,
plus a much greater degree of supply risk due to geopolitical
and weather shocks, all suggest there should be a much greater
degree of fundamentals-driven price resilience in many commodity
markets,&#8221; Norrish wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather disappointments should keep risks for soybeans
&#8220;skewed to the upside,&#8221; according to the Goldman report, which
expects them to trade at $13 per bushel in 12 months. The
November-delivery contract last traded at $11.70 per bushel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soybean demand has become more sensitive to consumption
in China, the commodity should be more resilient to a slowdown
in developed markets as long as Chinese income growth remains
robust, Currie wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
global growth forecast for this year and next, predicting
recessions in Germany and France as the European economy stalls
and the risk of a contraction in the U.S. grows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world economy will probably expand 3.8 percent this
year and 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with earlier predictions
of 3.9 percent for 2011 and 4.2 percent for next year, Goldman
Sachs economists Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson wrote in an Oct.
3 report. The company lowered its forecast for earnings growth
in Asia excluding Japan in a separate report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s worsening sovereign debt woes and the threat of a
U.S. recession have roiled global stock markets, erasing about
$13 trillion from equities since May. The debt crisis has
infected the European banking system, making financial
institutions wary of lending to each other and pushing overnight
deposits with the European Central Bank last week to the highest
in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The further deterioration in the economic and financial
situation in the Euro area has led us to downgrade our global
GDP forecast significantly,&#8221; the economists said. &#8220;Over the
next few quarters, we now expect a mild recession in Germany and
France, and a deeper downturn in the Euro periphery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro Region &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs predicts the Euro region will expand 0.1
percent in 2012, down from an earlier forecast of 1.3 percent.
It expects growth of 1.6 percent for this year. Goldman also
lowered its end-2011 forecast for the euro to $1.38 per dollar
from an earlier projection for it to trade at $1.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB has been forced to purchase sovereign bonds to
prevent the crisis from spreading to larger euro nations, and is
providing banks with unlimited liquidity for up to six months
against eligible collateral as governments struggle to restore
investor confidence in the 17-member region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to ease its
liquidity policies further this month as a result of an increase
in financial risk, Hatzius and Wilson said. The ECB will also
probably cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1
percent by December, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The increase in spillovers from the Euro area, primarily
via tighter financial conditions, is the primary reason why we
have also downgraded our forecasts for the U.S. further,&#8221; the
economists said. &#8220;We now see the risk of a renewed U.S.
recession at around 40 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flagging U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will expand 1.7 percent this year and 1.4
percent in 2012, Goldman Sachs predicts. It had earlier
estimated a 2 percent growth rate for the world&#8217;s largest
economy next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve announced last month that it would
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries, a so-called Operation Twist, in an
effort to further reduce borrowing costs and strengthen the
flagging U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect additional easing of monetary policy beyond the
&#8216;Operation Twist&#8217; announced recently, although this may not come
until sometime in the first half of 2012,&#8221; Hatzius and Wilson
said. &#8220;In addition, the market&#8217;s focus on changes in the Fed&#8217;s
guidance on future policies -- including a greater emphasis on
the employment part of the &#8216;dual mandate&#8217; and/or a temporarily
higher inflation target -- is likely to intensify.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Downside Risk&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia excluding Japan stocks faces a &#8220;downside risk&#8221; of 10
percent to 15 percent, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Timothy Moe
wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings per share may grow 10 percent this year and
increase 7 percent next year, lower than an earlier prediction
of 11 percent growth for both years, according to the analysts.
They also cut their 12-month forecast for the MSCI Asia Pacific
excluding Japan Index to 480 from 530. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts also lowered their forecasts for 2011
and 2012 oil prices. Crude prices will end this year at $112.50
a barrel, compared with a previous estimate of $119.50. It will
be $122.50 a barrel at the end of 2012, compared with an earlier
forecast of $138.50, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The oil market continues to destock as prices anticipate
a potential crisis,&#8221; the economists said. &#8220;If the crisis does
not occur, the oil market risks running into pressing supply
constraints, requiring sharply higher prices than we currently
forecast to force demand in line with supplies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will offer television
service to Xbox Live users through a partnership with Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), a bid to use TV
programming to attract more customers to its game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox service will offer content from almost 40
television and entertainment companies, Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft said today in a statement. In addition to
Verizon and Comcast, the partners include ATT Inc., Time Warner
Inc.&#8217;s HBO, Sony Corp.&#8217;s Crackle and the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer wants to lure more
families and casual gamers to the Xbox by making it an
entertainment center, challenging TV services from Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and Google Inc. (GOOG) Today&#8217;s announcement furthers a move started in
2008, when Microsoft added Netflix Inc.&#8217;s video streaming and
the music service Last.fm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The vision of the Xbox back in 2001 was that it would be
an entertainment hub,&#8221; said Michael Pachter, an analyst at
Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. &#8220;Until they launched Netflix
on Xbox Live, it really wasn&#8217;t that. Today we go from Netflix
and Last.fm to 40 vendors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 55 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $25.89 today on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 7.2 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network Stations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox, first released a decade ago, accounted for 48
percent of all current-generation consoles in the U.S. between
2005 and June of this year, according to Microsoft data. Xbox
Live, an Internet service with free and paid versions, already
has more than 35 million members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft didn&#8217;t announce any deals with U.S. network TV
stations, though Comcast and other partners are &#8220;quite likely&#8221;
to add that kind of content in the future, said Ross Honey,
general manager of content acquisition for Microsoft&#8217;s
Interactive Entertainment business. Some network TV content can
already be viewed on Xbox using the Hulu LLC service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other partners announced today include Lovefilm in the
U.K., a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc.; Spain&#8217;s Telefonica SA (TEF);
and Mexico&#8217;s Grupo Televisa SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also plans an application for its Windows Phone
mobile software that will turn phones into an enhanced remote
control for the Xbox service. Users will be able to search for
programs and then set them to play on the Xbox, as well as view
additional information about the program, Honey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, Google &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company intends to offer apps that work with the Xbox
TV service for Apple&#8217;s iOS software as well, Pachter said,
citing a Microsoft analyst briefing yesterday. Honey declined to
comment on those plans, except to say that Microsoft has been
expanding some products to both iOS and Google&#8217;s Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some programming will require customers to be subscribers
to Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live pay service. Other content, such as the
BBC and other public television, will work with the free version
of Xbox Live, Honey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers won&#8217;t have to know which channel or provider
offers the show or movie they want. Instead they can say or type
the name of the program and Xbox&#8217;s Bing search service will
return all options for viewing it, including ones the customer
doesn&#8217;t currently subscribe to, Honey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV service efforts by companies such as Apple and Google
have gotten little traction with customers. Apple Chief
Executive Officer Tim Cook has said that his company&#8217;s Apple TV
product remains &#8220;a hobby business.&#8221; In April, Logitech
International SA cut the price of its Google TV device, citing
slow initial sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has some advantages over those companies, Pachter
said. It already has a big presence in customers&#8217; living rooms:
A total of 55 million Xbox 360 machines have been sold
worldwide. The company also can draw on its search engine, its
Kinect motion-and-voice sensor technology and the new content
agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each of those guys has a strength, but nobody has
hardware already in the living room, with voice command that
works,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;Microsoft has a big advantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) isn&#8217;t anywhere close
to making an offer for Yahoo! Inc. and senior executives of the
software maker aren&#8217;t involved in discussions, two people
familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does plan to review Yahoo&#8217;s financial
information, due to be circulated as soon as this week, said one
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
deliberations are private. Yahoo doesn&#8217;t regard Microsoft as a
serious bidder, said a person familiar with Yahoo&#8217;s thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares surged 10 percent today after Reuters reported
that Microsoft may make an offer. Yahoo is fielding inquiries
from potential buyers after ousting Chief Executive Office Carol Bartz and starting a review of its strategic options last month.
Yahoo rose $1.46 to $15.92 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading, the biggest gain since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo turned down a $47.5 billion offer from Microsoft in
2008, rankling investors. The two companies later forged a 10-
year agreement to outsource Yahoo&#8217;s search engine to Microsoft,
diminishing the chance of a full acquisition. Since then, Yahoo
has struggled to invigorate sales growth and beat back
competition from Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman at Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo, and Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Multiple Parties&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, the biggest U.S. Web portal, said in a September
memo to employees that its advisers have fielded inquiries from
&#8220;multiple parties&#8221; interested in unspecified options. Last
week, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma said he&#8217;s
&#8220;very interested&#8221; in buying Yahoo, which owns about 40 percent
of his company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private-equity firm Silver Lake also has discussed a
possible bid for Yahoo, part of a deal that may include Alibaba
and Russia&#8217;s Digital Sky Technologies, people with direct
knowledge of the matter have told Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silver Lake group contacted Yahoo and its advisers in
recent weeks to inform them of a possible offer, said one
person, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. The discussions are still at an early stage and it&#8217;s
not certain that the group will agree to make a bid, the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Yahoo&#8217;s stock surge today, the shares had declined
13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc., which is considering
strategic options in the wake of ousting its chief executive
officer last month, rose 10 percent after Reuters reported that
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may make a bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft might enlist a partner to go after Yahoo, Reuters
reported today, citing sources close to the situation. Yahoo
spurned a $47.5 billion bid from Microsoft in 2008. No decision
has been made to come back to the negotiating table, and there
are internal divisions at Microsoft over the idea, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo takeover speculation has intensified over the past
month, following the board&#8217;s decision to fire CEO Carol Bartz
and embark on a review of its options. Yahoo, the biggest U.S.
Web portal, has struggled to revive growth and beat back
competition from Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares rose $1.46 to $15.92 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, marking the biggest one-day gain
since October 2008. The stock had dropped 13 percent this year
before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said in a September memo to employees that its
advisers have fielded inquiries from &#8220;multiple parties&#8221;
interested in unspecified options. Last week, Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma said he&#8217;s &#8220;very interested&#8221; in
buying Yahoo, which owns about 40 percent of his company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private-equity firm Silver Lake also has discussed a
possible bid for Yahoo, part of a deal that may include Alibaba
and Russia&#8217;s Digital Sky Technologies, people with direct
knowledge of the matter have told Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silver Lake group contacted Yahoo and its advisers in
recent weeks to inform them of a possible offer, said one
person, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. The discussions are still at an early stage and it&#8217;s
not certain that the group will agree to make a bid, the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) may finally
be cheap enough to lure International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) or
Verizon Communications Inc. as the most speculated U.S. takeover
target since 2005 approaches its lowest valuation on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth as much as $9.9 billion last year, the shares have
plunged 57 percent in the past 12 months for the third-biggest
drop in the Nasdaq 100 Index, giving it a market value of $3.8
billion. Akamai is valued at 7.6 times earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, almost two-thirds less
than a year ago and near a 2008 record low. It&#8217;s more affordable
than 94 percent of the largest U.S. Internet software companies,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai may now attract acquisition interest from IBM, which
is hunting for takeovers, and Verizon (VZ), owner of the largest U.S.
wireless operator, said Blaylock Robert Van LLC and SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey Inc. While earnings forecasts that missed
analysts&#8217; estimates and price cuts triggered Akamai&#8217;s drop, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company is still projected to
have record revenue in 2011 and a fifth straight profit gain as
increasing Internet traffic buoys demand for the provider of
server space that helps websites load faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a no-brainer for someone like IBM who wants a very
dynamic, global, mission-critical content distribution
network,&#8221; Joel Achramowicz, an analyst at investment bank
Blaylock Robert Van, said in a telephone interview from Oakland,
California. &#8220;It represents a very compelling acquisition
target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buyout Rumors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Young, a spokesman for Akamai, declined to comment on
whether the company had been approached by IBM or Verizon about
an acquisition. Michael Fay, a spokesman for IBM, and Robert Varettoni, a spokesman for Verizon, said the companies don&#8217;t
comment on rumors and speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai, which supplies the computer power that speeds
delivery of content for customers including Apple (AAPL) Inc. and
Netflix Inc., was the subject of more buyout rumors than any
other American company from 2005 through 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It was named as a target 21 times by electronic
news services, brokerages or newspapers, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t see any need to be bought,&#8221; Tom Leighton,
Akamai&#8217;s co-founder and chief scientist, said in an interview
yesterday at Bloomberg&#8217;s New York headquarters. &#8220;Akamai is very
attractive. We&#8217;re very unique in what we do. We&#8217;d be of interest
to any big player that cares about the Internet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Akamai may be an acquirer as it looks to use its
cash for potential takeovers, Leighton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intelligent, Clever, Cool &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai, whose name means intelligent, clever and cool in
Hawaiian, was co-founded by Leighton, a former Massachusetts
Institute of Technology professor, and Daniel Lewin, a former
graduate student at the school. The two were trying to meet a
1995 challenge by MIT colleague and World Wide Web pioneer Tim Berners-Lee to find better ways to deliver Internet content to
users. Lewin died aboard one of the two hijacked planes that
crashed into the World Trade Center during the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai was formed in 1998 and sold shares to the public in
1999. After the Internet bubble burst, deal speculation coupled
with a more than fourfold increase in revenue since 2004 drove
Akamai&#8217;s Ebitda multiple to 21 times a year ago, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai&#8217;s stock plummeted 57 percent in the last 12 months
through yesterday. The company was forced to keep up with price
cuts from competitors such as Limelight (LLNW) Networks Inc. and Level
3 Communications Inc. (LVLT) and sales from advanced services like
cloud-computer security failed to make up for the lost profits.
That reduced its market value to $3.8 billion as of yesterday
after reaching a 10-year high of $9.9 billion on Dec. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Usage &#8216;Explosion&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sure makes a lot of sense for Akamai to be acquired,
more sense than at the beginning of the year,&#8221; Aaron Schwartz,
a New York-based analyst at Jefferies  Co., said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai rose 8.7 percent to $22.35 today for the fourth-biggest gain the in the Nasdaq 100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valued at 7.6 times Ebitda as of yesterday&#8217;s close, the
company is approaching its record low of 4.9 times set in
November 2008. That makes it cheaper than 15 of 16 U.S. Internet
software and services companies with market values greater than
$1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Traffic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the stock is down here, it wouldn&#8217;t be very
surprising if somebody looked at them as a possible
acquisition,&#8221; Scott Tapley, who helps oversee $2.5 billion at
1st Source Investment Advisors Inc. in South Bend, Indiana, said
in a phone interview. &#8220;The thesis behind their existence -- the
explosion of bandwidth consumption -- is playing out in
spades.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet traffic will quadruple by 2015 to almost a
zettabyte, driven by growth in smartphones, tablet computers and
appliances connected to the Web, Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) said in its
fifth annual Visual Networking Index report in June. More
consumers watching videos and accessing the Web on mobile
devices will strain service providers&#8217; abilities to transmit
data quickly, said Cisco, the largest maker of networking
equipment. A zettabyte is equal to a trillion gigabytes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Akamai competitor such as Limelight, the $241 million
company based in Tempe, Arizona, may be acquired first because
it is &#8220;bite-size&#8221; and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. owns 27
percent, Donna Jaegers, a Denver-based analyst at DA Davidson 
Co., said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai is projected to post a 13 percent gain in 2011 net
income to $194 million, a fifth consecutive increase, according
to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts also
project that sales will reach an all-time high of $1.14 billion
this year and $1.28 billion next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may not be willing to sell for less than $40 a
share, which would be a 95 percent premium to yesterday&#8217;s
closing price of $20.56, Rodney Ratliff, a Memphis, Tennessee-based analyst at SunTrust Robinson, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is planning more acquisitions to fuel growth in its
$22.5 billion software business, Senior Vice President Steve Mills said in an interview. The Armonk, New York-based company,
which last week surpassed Microsoft Corp. to become the world&#8217;s
second-most valuable technology company after Apple, said it may
spend $100 million to $300 million on targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM has made a lot of software acquisitions, it&#8217;s a
player in the cloud and it&#8217;s looking to increase that exposure
to the cloud,&#8221; DA Davidson&#8217;s Jaegers said. &#8220;They also have a
resale agreement with Akamai. You would expect anybody who has a
resale agreement with Akamai to think about maybe buying it
since they&#8217;ve already been test-driving the product.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verizon as Buyer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A telecommunications company, such as New York-based
Verizon Communications, could buy Akamai to be able to charge a
premium price for guaranteed Internet content delivery at better
performance rates on mobile phones, said Jefferies&#8217; Schwartz.
Verizon Communications, the second-largest U.S. phone company,
is the majority owner of Verizon Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. mobile
operator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the telco side, the one that would make the most sense
would be Verizon,&#8221; SunTrust Robinson&#8217;s Ratliff said. &#8220;Verizon
is a big Akamai reseller.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai is now &#8220;an even more attractive acquisition
target&#8221; than it was earlier this year, Ratliff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market can&#8217;t stay this depressed forever,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s much more likely that you
ultimately will see Akamai taken out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugmaker Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) doesn&#8217;t
plan to buy Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s $3.58 billion animal-health business,
Chief Executive Officer John Lechleiter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer CEO Ian Read said July 7 that he would seek to
divest the animal health and nutrition units of the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker. Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice
said in July the Indianapolis-based company was interested in
some Pfizer assets, and Pfizer said it wouldn&#8217;t break any into
smaller pieces to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think we have to make a large acquisition,&#8221;
Lilly&#8217;s Lechleiter said today in an interview at Bloomberg&#8217;s
Innovation and the Economy roundtable in Washington. &#8220;In our
animal-health business, we&#8217;ve got a pretty good mix of organic
growth and growth from smaller acquisitions. I think that&#8217;s the
approach we&#8217;re going to take.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly also isn&#8217;t interested in New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s
nutrition business, Lechleiter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to more or less stay the course with
innovative medicines,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should
expect us to do anything around generics or OTC or things of
that sort&#8221; referring to over-the-counter medicines. Pfizer&#8217;s
unit generated $1.87 billion in revenue in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lechleiter was among more than a dozen chief executive
officers and university presidents discussing job creation and
the economy today at the Bloomberg forum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares gained 39 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $17.98 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Lilly
gained 30 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $37.03. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman, said no decisions have
been made about the drugmaker&#8217;s units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re continuing to explore strategic alternatives for
our animal-health business, and are evaluating a variety of
options including a sale, spinoff or other transaction,&#8221; she
said in an e-mail. Campion said the company doesn&#8217;t anticipate
making an announcement on the units until 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the line about never getting
a second chance to make a first impression? Luckily for
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), it turns out not to be true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7, Microsoft&#8217;s attempt to claw its way back
into the lucrative smartphone arena, was released a year ago to
respectful but hardly adulatory reviews. It was good, but not
good enough to go head-to-head with the big boys, Apple Inc. (AAPL) and
Google Inc. (GOOG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is. Microsoft is rolling out Windows Phone 7.5, also
known as &#8220;Mango,&#8221; an altogether more polished and potent
contender. The software began going out to existing users as a
free upgrade last week; new handsets from manufacturers
including HTC Corp. (2498) and Samsung Electronics Co. will begin
showing up shortly. It deserves consideration if you&#8217;re in the
market for a new phone and not already committed to another
operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a dominant player in smartphones, Microsoft was slow
to react to the 2007 release of Apple&#8217;s iPhone and saw its
market share implode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, though, a combination of factors is giving it an
opening. Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) is struggling to hold onto its
BlackBerry customers; Google&#8217;s acquisition of Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. may lead competing manufacturers to think twice
about their dependence on Android; Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) pulled
the plug on its competing WebOS platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest oil company, is offering for sale a 25 percent stake in
an offshore Brazilian oil prospect after drilling two wells that
failed to strike crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect, known as Block BM-S-22 in the Santos Basin,
may hold as much as 1.5 billion barrels of recoverable crude,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in an offering document on
Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)&#8217;s oilfield-marketing website. One of Exxon&#8217;s
partners on the project, Hess Corp. (HES), last year wrote down the
value of two of the three wells already drilled at the prospect
after they came up dry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block lies beneath a layer of salt below the sea floor
in the same region that yielded discoveries such as Tupi, a 6.5
billion-barrel field now known as Lula, Exxon said in the
offering document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon owns 40 percent of the prospect and is the operator
of the project. Hess of New York holds a 40 percent stake, and
Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) owns the rest. Hess
expensed its share of costs for the Exxon-drilled Sabia-1 and
Azulo wells during the fourth quarter of 2010, Gregory Hill,
Hess&#8217; executive vice president of worldwide exploration, said
during a Jan. 26 conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and partners Hess and Petrobras, as the Brazilian oil
company is known, &#8220;agreed to seek a fourth co-venturer&#8221; for
the project, Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for Exxon&#8217;s exploration
unit, said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain interested in future opportunities in Brazil,&#8221;
McGinn said in the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the offering document, Exxon said an investor must fund
the drilling of one well in the prospect in exchange for the 25
percent stake. The site has already received drilling permits
from the Brazilian government, Exxon said. A data room is being
set up in Houston for prospective buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This opportunity should appeal to companies looking to
gain access to the significant pre-salt play in Brazil,&#8221; Exxon
said in the offering document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By James Sterngold and Scott Lanman" date="Oct 05, 2011 12:48 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-05/fed-urges-banks-including-goldman-sachs-to-improve-pay-risks.html"><headline>Fed Urges Banks Including Goldman Sachs to Control Risk Tied to Worker Pay</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve urged Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. (C) and 22 other
large banks to take additional measures to control employee-pay
practices that can put an entire company at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the banks have made progress based on guidance from
regulators, the Fed said today in Washington in a report based
on appraisals that began in late 2009. &#8220;Yet every firm also
needs to do more&#8221; in reforming compensation practices that
&#8220;were a contributing factor to the financial crisis,&#8221; policy
makers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report didn&#8217;t single out any individual company. Most
of the banks should do more to account for the &#8220;full range of
risks&#8221; in employee pay, and some are still trying to identify
mid- and lower-level workers whose compensation arrangements
could generate excessive risks, the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A June 2010 statement from the Fed and other U.S. agencies
said many big banks were &#8220;deficient&#8221; in curbing excessive
risk-taking that helped fuel the financial panic that began in
2007. The central bank didn&#8217;t repeat that word in today&#8217;s
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, last month discovered a
$2.3 billion loss from unauthorized trading and New York-based
Goldman Sachs agreed in July 2010 to pay $550 million in a
settlement after the Securities and Exchange Commission claimed
the bank misled investors about the way its investment bankers
put together a subprime mortgage security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vesting Policies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banking organizations in the horizontal review have made
progress in improving deferral practices, but many still have
work to do on performance conditions for vesting,&#8221; the Fed said
in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms in the Fed review also included Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. (BAC), New York&#8217;s JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS), as well as the U.S. operations of
Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and UBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report focused on several methods to control excessive
compensation and to &#8220;promote safety and soundness,&#8221; including
deferring pay for executives so that eventual cash payouts are
based on longer term results, and reducing pay of company
officials if they produce profits by creating large risks for
their firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent of the incentive pay of senior
executives at the 25 banks reviewed was deferred on average, and
some had more than 80 percent deferred, the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Imprudent Risks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the credit crisis, firms that deferred some pay
typically didn&#8217;t cut the awards if there were ultimately bad
outcomes, according to the report. &#8220;Some employees were
provided incentives to take imprudent risks,&#8221; the Fed said.
Now, the deferred pay, typically for three to five years, can be
reduced later if there are poor results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the firms also have claw-back provisions on pay if
officials engage in malfeasance or if financial results must be
restated, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed also noted that, in a change from past practices,
risk-management employees are involved in designing compensation
arrangements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yet every firm needs to do more,&#8221; the Fed said. &#8220;As
oversight of incentive compensation moves into the regular
supervisory process, the Federal Reserve will continue to work
to ensure progress continues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Dmitry Pugachevsky, who oversaw analysis of some of the bank&#8217;s
derivatives risks, joined Quantifi Inc. to run the research
division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pugachevsky, who has more than 18 years&#8217; experience in the
field, was the head of counterparty credit modeling at New York-
based JPMorgan. Before that, he was the global head of credit
analytics at Bear Stearns Cos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to derivatives regulation in the U.S. and new
international capital rules for banks &#8220;have brought a
heightened focus on counterparty risk and highlight the need for
firms to adopt active counterparty risk-management systems,&#8221;
Pugachevsky said in a statement released by Summit, New Jersey-

&lt;p&gt;Pugachevsky has a doctorate in applied mathematics from
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unit of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ), the bankrupt investment bank, sued a unit of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) over a failed $1.25 billion real estate deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosslyn LB Syndication Partner LLC, a Lehman unit not in
bankruptcy, accused USREO/Rosslyn Investors LLC, a Goldman Sachs
unit, of terminating a transaction related to an office building
portfolio in Arlington, Virginia, according to a filing today in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman unit&#8217;s &#8220;obligations (which it failed to
perform) are absolute,&#8221; according to the filing. Rosslyn LB is
seeking more than $100 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S.
history on Sept. 15, 2008. The U.S. brokerage went into
liquidation four days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge overseeing Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy approved the
proposed sale of its 78.5 percent interest in the 3 million-
square-foot commercial real estate project on Aug. 17, court
papers show. Two days before the scheduled closing date
USREO/Rosslyn terminated the agreement based on &#8220;pretextual
reasons,&#8221; Lehman lawyers said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;unilateral&#8221; termination of the agreement
wrongfully prevented the Lehman unit from exercising its right
to extend the closing date, court papers show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees and Relief &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman lawyers characterized Goldman&#8217;s action as
&#8220;unjustified repudiation,&#8221; and also asked a judge to award
legal fees and &#8220;further relief&#8221; deemed appropriate, according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosslyn LB is a non-debtor unit of New York-based Lehman
Brothers Holdings and its Lehman Commercial Paper unit,
according to the filing. USREO/Rosslyn Investors LLC is a unit
of U.S. Real Estate Opportunities LP, a joint venture in which
Goldman Sachs is the general partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Lehman were unchanged at 3 cents in over-the-
counter trading in New York today. Goldman Sachs rose $3.64 or
3.8 percent to $97.93 in NYSE trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rosslyn LB Syndication Partner LLC v.
USREO/Rosslyn Investors, LLC, 11-02764, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,

&lt;p&gt;Crescent Real Estate Holdings LLC
sold its stake in six Texas office properties valued at about $2
billion to its partner, a unit of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), a person
with knowledge of the transaction said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition, completed Sept. 28, gave J.P. Morgan Asset
Management full ownership of Houston Center and The Crescent
office and retail complex in Dallas, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the information is private. The six
properties have 9.1 million square feet (845,000 square meters)
of space, said the person, who declined to give the price for
Crescent Real Estate&#8217;s 24 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crescent has been selling assets as the commercial real
estate market recovers from the recession. Well-leased office
buildings with steady income have attracted institutional
clients as yields on other investments hover near record lows.
J.P. Morgan Asset bought two Seattle office towers from
developer Schnitzer West LLC for $480 million in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crescent has been owned since November 2009 by a joint
venture between Barclays Capital, a unit of Barclays Plc (BARC), and
Fort Worth-based Goff Capital Inc. Goff is led by John Goff, who
was vice chairman and chief executive officer of Crescent&#8217;s
predecessor company, Crescent Real Estate Equities Co., when it
was acquired by Morgan Stanley for $6.5 billion in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan Asset
Management, declined to comment. Brandon Ashcraft, a Barclays
Capital spokesman, had no immediate comment. Jean Suitt, a
spokeswoman for Crescent, referred questions to John Goff, who
she said wasn&#8217;t available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real Estate Alert reported last week that the deal was
imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value Includes Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crescent will continue to operate the properties, according
to the person with knowledge of the deal, who said the estimated
$2 billion value of the buildings includes debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from Houston Center and The Crescent, the properties
include Fulbright Tower in downtown Houston, Post Oak Central in
Houston&#8217;s West Loop/Galleria section, and Fountain Place and
Trammell Crow Center in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston Center has three office buildings, the tallest of
which is 46 stories. The complex is connected via sky-bridges to
a Four Seasons Hotel and the 52-story Fulbright Tower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post Oak Central has three 24-story buildings designed by
Philip Johnson. Fountain Place, in downtown Dallas, is a 60-
story, prism-shaped building of green glass designed by I.M. Pei
 Partners. Trammell Crow Center, also downtown, has 50 floors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crescent continues to own Greenway Plaza, a 52-acre (21-
hectare), 10-building office, retail, hotel and residential
complex near downtown Houston, as well as office buildings in
Denver, Fort Worth and Las Vegas. It also has a Ritz-Carlton
Hotel in Dallas, and Canyon Ranch spas in Tucson, Arizona, and
Lenox, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protesters assembling today outside a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) building in New Jersey were met by
almost as many security guards and police officers as &#8220;Occupy
Wall Street&#8221; demonstrators sought to single out the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50 people gathered at a Goldman Sachs building
surrounded by metal barricades in Jersey City, where 30 to 40
officers and guards were waiting. The investment bank&#8217;s
employees watched from windows as the crowd chanted &#8220;We are the
99 percent&#8221; before breaking into discussion groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs has too many people in government, and too
much influence,&#8221; said Pat Meany, 53, who arrived on his bicycle
and wore clothes painted with fluorescent colors and peace
symbols. &#8220;It seems like they&#8217;re looking out for America&#8217;s rich.
It&#8217;s not for the good of all Americans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Trenton, about three dozen protesters were initially
outnumbered by members of the media for a simultaneous gathering
at the World War II memorial across from the Statehouse. The
crowd grew to about 75 people within an hour as participants
took turns to speak about corporate greed, the influence of
money on politics, war and the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no reason why this country should be the way it
is,&#8221; said Heath Weaver, 46, of Toms River, a self-employed
videographer who came to the Trenton event with a sleeping bag.
&#8220;Instead of people coming together we&#8217;ve been fighting against
each other and nothing&#8217;s getting solved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the demonstration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Martha
Coakley said she may sue major banks after she &#8220;lost
confidence&#8221; that they will reach an adequate agreement to
resolve disputes over foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from all 50 states last year announced a
probe of bank foreclosure practices following reports that
faulty documents were used to seize homes. Since then, attorneys
general and federal officials have been negotiating a settlement
with the five largest mortgage servicers in the U.S. -- Bank of
America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C), Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have lost confidence that the banks will bring to the
table an agreement that properly holds them accountable for
wrongful foreclosures,&#8221; Coakley, 58, said in a statement today.
&#8220;Because our office for some time has anticipated that result,
we have begun preparing for litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Attorney General Kamala Harris said last week
that she was rejecting a proposed settlement with the banks and
would pursue her own mortgage investigation, according to a
letter she wrote to the U.S. Justice Department and Iowa
Attorney General Tom Miller, who is leading talks for the
states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Delaware
Attorney General Beau Biden and Nevada Attorney General
Catherine Cortez Masto are also conducting mortgage-related
investigations as settlement talks with the banks continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller said yesterday that the settlement being worked on
will hold the banks accountable &#8220;in ways that are
unprecedented&#8221; and will help struggling homeowners across the
country. Further negotiations took place this week in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While attorneys general are free to criticize an
agreement that does not yet exist, we expect that they&#8217;ll soon
see the tangible results of our yearlong efforts to address
improper servicing and foreclosure practices, and provide relief
to homeowners,&#8221; Miller said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coakley said her office is &#8220;aggressively proceeding&#8221; with
plans to file lawsuits. They would include claims tied to the
failure to establish the right to start a foreclosure and the
filing of false or misleading documents, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coakley, who has been investigating a mortgage database
used by banks known as MERS, didn&#8217;t disclose when or which banks
would be sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merrill Lynch Sued Over Collateralized Debt Obligations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit was sued in New
York by Loreley Financing over alleged misrepresentations
involving $92 million of collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit stems from Loreley&#8217;s purchase of classes of notes
issued in connection with two CDOs, according to a complaint
filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants made material misrepresentations to
plaintiffs, omitted material facts, conspired to defraud
plaintiffs, were responsible for fraudulent conveyances, aided
and abetted others&#8217; fraud and fraudulent conveyances,&#8221; Loreley
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, said the company believes &#8220;there is no
merit to the claims&#8221; and plans to defend itself in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v.
Merrill Lynch, 652732/2011, New York State Supreme Court,
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conservation Groups Sue U.S. to Block Keystone XL Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport oil
from western Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, should be halted
because the U.S. didn&#8217;t complete an environmental impact review,
advocacy groups said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth
Inc. and Western Nebraska Resources Council sued the U.S. in
Omaha, Nebraska, federal court yesterday, calling the government
review a &#8220;sham public process&#8221; because the pipeline is moving
forward without final approval. They seek a ruling that the work
violates the National Environmental Policy Act and an order
blocking the pipeline until requisite approvals are obtained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $7 billion pipeline, being built by TransCanada Corp. (TRP),
runs through north-central Nebraska&#8217;s Sand Hills region. The
construction is forcing the clearance of native grasses and
relocation of an endangered species of whooping cranes,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These activities are on-going and are having adverse
environmental impacts and are being carried out before the
environmental reviews for the pipeline are complete,&#8221; and
before permits have been issued, the groups claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyn Hornbuckle, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice
Department, declined to comment on the filing. TransCanada
spokesman Terry Cunha didn&#8217;t return a call and e-mail seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S.
Department of State, 11cv345, U.S. District Court, District of
Nebraska (Omaha). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup Sues to Block Arbitration of Saudi Investors&#8217; Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Citigroup Inc. unit sued two Saudi investors seeking to
block Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration of
their $383 million claim that the bank &#8220;wiped out&#8221; their
family&#8217;s wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdullah and Ghazi Abbar, a father and son from Jeddah who
put family money into hedge funds, have no customer agreements
or accounts with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a New York-based
broker dealer that they blame for mismanaging their family&#8217;s
life savings, according to a complaint the Citigroup unit filed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Citigroup entities that handled two leveraged option
transactions and a private-equity loan for the Abbars are based
in the U.K., Switzerland and the Cayman Islands and aren&#8217;t
subject to arbitration by Finra, a Washington-based brokerage
regulator, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident this matter will be appropriately
resolved when it is reviewed by legal authorities in the
jurisdictions that the parties agreed to when they executed
their trades,&#8221; Natalie Marin, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Citigroup, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Rich, an attorney for the Abbars, didn&#8217;t return a
voice-mail message left after regular business hours seeking
comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abbars, whose money comes from food products importing,
travel and tourism, oil investments and other businesses, were
courted by top bank officers, including Chief Executive Officer
Vikram Pandit and former global wealth management chief Sallie
Krawcheck, to maintain or expand business with the New York-based company, they said in their Finra claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Due to a pattern of gross misconduct by CGMI and its
employees and affiliates, from late 2005 to present, the
considerable family wealth which the Abbars entrusted to
Citigroup has been virtually wiped out,&#8221; the Abbars said in the
claim they filed with Finra on Aug. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Citigroup Global Markets v. Abbar, 11-6993,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Madoff Trustee Seeks to Pursue Racketeering Claim Against Kohn &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s former firm asked
a U.S. judge not to dismiss civil racketeering claims from a
$58.8 billion lawsuit against Bank Medici AG founder Sonja Kohn
and UniCredit SpA (UCG)&#8217;s Bank Austria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Sheehan, a lawyer for trustee Irving Picard, asked
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan yesterday to deny
the defendants&#8217; request that he throw out claims brought under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.
The law provides the basis for most of the damages Picard seeks
in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the defendants argued that Picard lacks
standing to sue because he stands in the shoes of the Madoff
firm, which was responsible for the fraud, and that Kohn didn&#8217;t
run a separate racketeering enterprise for purposes of the RICO
law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense lawyers also told Rakoff that RICO doesn&#8217;t
cover a racketeering enterprise that is located primarily
overseas. Most of the defendants in the suit, including Kohn,
based in Austria, were located outside the U.S., they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed in December, Picard, calling Kohn
Madoff&#8217;s &#8220;criminal soul mate,&#8221; sued her, along with UniCredit,
Bank Austria, Bank Medici and dozens of other Austrian and
Italian parties. He claimed Kohn fed more than $9.1 billion of
investor money into the Madoff fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Rakoff agreed to take the case from U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, saying the case required &#8220;significant
interpretation of RICO.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Kohn, 11-cv-01181, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BNY Mellon &#8216;Sledgehammer&#8217; Lawsuits Raise Pressure to Settle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the largest custody bank,
faces increased pressure to reach settlements on foreign-exchange cases following new lawsuits brought by New York and
federal officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York attorney general and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s
Office in Manhattan, each of which filed complaints Oct. 4,
bring deeper resources and more expertise on financial cases,
Barry Barbash, head of the asset-management group at law firm
Willkie Farr  Gallagher LLP, said in an interview from his
Washington office. New York Attorney General Eric T.
Schneiderman can also wield the state&#8217;s powerful Martin Act, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Martin Act is a fairly significant sledgehammer of a
statute&#8221; that makes it easier for prosecutors to prove fraud
compared with many other states&#8217; laws, said Barbash, a former
director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
division of investment management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York suit, brought in the state&#8217;s Supreme Court,
accuses BNY Mellon of defrauding public pension funds of $2
billion over 10 years. The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office filed a
separate suit in federal court. Florida and Virginia have also
filed claims against the bank, and Massachusetts regulators are
investigating similar claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon will fight the lawsuits, said Kevin Heine, a
spokesman for the bank. The complaints are based on a &#8220;flawed
analysis&#8221; and a misunderstanding of the global foreign-exchange
market, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Street Corp. (STT), the third-largest custody provider,
faces similar lawsuits from California and Arkansas. The Boston-based firm has said it will defend itself against the claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teva Put Profit Ahead of Propofol Patient Safety, Jury Told &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), the world&#8217;s biggest
generic-drug maker, was accused by lawyers at a Nevada trial of
putting profit ahead of the safety of colonoscopy patients who
got the company&#8217;s Propofol anesthetic from reused vials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, along with drug distributors Baxter International
Inc. (BAX) and McKesson Corp. (MCK), marketed Propofol in &#8220;jumbo-sized
vials&#8221; knowing it would entice doctors to reuse the containers
and increase the spread of blood-borne diseases, Robert Eglet, a
lawyer for colonoscopy patients who developed hepatitis after
getting the medicine, told a Las Vegas jury yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Responsible drug companies should not put profits above
patient safety,&#8221; Eglet said in closing arguments in the Nevada
state court trial of three patients&#8217; lawsuits. &#8220;It&#8217;s undisputed
that these larger vials provided the temptation and the
opportunity&#8221; for reuse, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva faces almost 300 lawsuits stemming from a hepatitis C
outbreak three years ago in southern Nevada, the Petach Tikva,
Israel-based company said in a regulatory filing last month.
Nevada health officials blamed the reuse of Propofol vials for
infecting patients with the incurable liver disease. The trial
of the first case against Teva and Baxter last year resulted in
a verdict of more than $500 million against the drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva&#8217;s lawyer countered that improperly sanitized medical
equipment, not reused Propofol containers, caused some Nevada
colonoscopy patients to develop hepatitis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the number of daily procedures being done by
some clinics it was &#8220;often impossible to properly clean&#8221;
medical equipment, Mark Tully, one of the drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers,
told jurors yesterday in his closing argument at the trial,
which started more than a month ago. &#8220;There were multiple
failures to follow proper medical procedures,&#8221; he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probes by Nevada health officials and the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention blamed the reuse of Propofol
vials for infecting patients with the incurable liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sacks v. Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada
LLC, 08A572315, District Court for Clark County, Nevada (Las
Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SP Rater Was a &#8216;Wuss&#8217; for Bending for Bankers, Court Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s, bending to pressure from a bank selling
investment notes, gave its highest rating to some that resembled
a gambler&#8217;s tactic of doubling down on losing bets, an
Australian court was told. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratings company, under investigation by the U.S. over
the nation&#8217;s credit downgrade, was sued by Australian towns over
the sale of notes that plummeted in value during the global
financial crisis in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You are the wuss for bending over in front of bankers and
taking it,&#8221; Sebastian Venus, who had prepared an internal model
for the notes at SP, told Derek Ding, an analyst responsible
for rating the note, according to e-mail transcripts in a
written version of the plaintiffs&#8217; opening statement that was
released by the court. &#8220;You rate something AAA, when it&#8217;s
really A-?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dozen Australian townships claim they lost A$15 million
($14.3 million) of A$16 million invested in the Community Income
Constant Proportion Debt Obligation Notes, or Rembrandts, as
they were called. The notes were unwound less than two years
after the towns bought them because credit spreads kept
increasing and the notes&#8217; cash value was exhausted, according to
the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CPDO strategy may be seen as a sophisticated version
of the doubling strategy in which a gambler doubles his/her bet
every time he/she loses, until a win occurs,&#8221; Columbia
University Professor Rama Cont said, according to the
submission. &#8220;A gambler with limited capital might eventually
run out of capital before winning and lose everything.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP denied it was pressured by the bank to give the notes
the AAA rating, in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg News
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The councils are trying to deflect the weakness of their
case by pointing to out-of-context e-mails,&#8221; the ratings
company said. &#8220;We conducted our own analysis in line with our
rating process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is scheduled for 10 weeks in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;

Financial Services Ltd. NSD936/2009. Federal Court of Australia

&lt;h2&gt;Siga Seeks to Re-Argue Ruling in PharmAthene Smallpox Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siga Technologies Inc. (SIGA) asked a Delaware judge to reconsider
his award of 50 percent of the profit from a smallpox drug to
rival PharmAthene Inc. (PIP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr. ruled
Sept. 22 that Siga must share a possible profit of more than
$400 million. Siga shares fell as much as 38 percent that day,
and declined 3.8 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siga, which is seeking permission to re-argue the award,
said in a court filing yesterday that Parsons &#8220;misapprehended
both the law and the facts&#8221; in awarding a share of ST-246&#8217;s
profit to PharmAthene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsons said New York-based Siga breached its obligation to
negotiate in good faith on the antiviral drug designed for use
in case of a biological attack. He rejected PharmAthene&#8217;s claim
that Siga breached a binding license agreement and also denied
claims for a lump-sum award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no legal justification for the court to
speculate concerning the terms on which the parties might have
agreed in the ultimate negotiation,&#8221; Andre Bouchard, a lawyer
for New York-based Siga, said in his motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Goldman, a spokesman for Annapolis, Maryland-based
PharmAthene, said yesterday that he couldn&#8217;t immediately comment
on Siga&#8217;s request to re-argue the profit-award ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is PharmAthene Inc. v. Siga Technologies Inc.,
CA2627, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AIG&#8217;s United Guaranty to Appeal $45 Million SunTrust Order &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit of American International Group Inc. (AIG), the insurer
majority owned by the U.S. government, filed a notice of appeal
challenging a judge&#8217;s order to pay more than $45 million to
SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) to fulfill mortgage insurance contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG&#8217;s United Guaranty unit is seeking to reverse a court
ruling that it must pay Atlanta-based SunTrust about $34 million
for covered losses, $6 million in interest and $5.4 million in
legal fees and costs, according court records. The notice of
appeal was filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Richmond, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunTrust sued United Guaranty in 2009 for breach of
contract, saying the insurer didn&#8217;t meet obligations to cover
losses tied to borrower defaults. Beginning in January 2008,
United Guaranty &#8220;systemically&#8221; denied claims on loans that
hadn&#8217;t been underwritten using an automated system from mortgage
investor Fannie Mae, SunTrust said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Guaranty also denied claims for losses from loans
where SunTrust didn&#8217;t verify all the information on borrower
applications, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Herr, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, said the
insurer expected the appeals court to reverse the lower court&#8217;s
exclusion of evidence that, if admitted, &#8220;would have changed
the outcome.&#8221; Hugh Suhr, a spokesman for SunTrust, declined to
comment on the appeal notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loans at issue in the litigation, known as combo loans,
involve a combination of first- and second-lien mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SunTrust Mortgage Inc. v. United Guaranty
Residential Insurance Company of North Carolina, 09-00529, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Societe Generale Wins U.K. Lawsuit Over Saad Group Unit Loan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA (GLE), France&#8217;s second-biggest bank, won a
U.K. lawsuit alleging a unit of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Saad Group failed
to repay a loan of almost $50 million guaranteed by its
billionaire founder Maan al-Sanea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment in the case against Saad Trading Contracting 
Financial Services was issued yesterday in London by Judge Nigel
Teare. Saad was accused in a trial in July of defaulting on the
January 2009 loan four months before the company said it would
seek to restructure its debt during the global credit crunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Sanea, deemed the world&#8217;s 62nd-richest person by Forbes
Magazine in 2009, faces separate fraud claims by another Saudi
company, Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi  Brothers Co., which alleges al-Sanea used fake documents to take out billions of dollars in
loans in Algosaibi&#8217;s name. Al-Sanea denies the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units of Saad Group and Algosaibi, both based in the Saudi
oil city of Al-Khobar, defaulted after borrowing about $15.7
billion from more than 80 banks. Al-Sanea married into the
Algosaibi family before founding Saad Group, which has
businesses ranging from construction to health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saad Group was also ordered to repay interest and at least
250,000 pounds ($386,000) in legal costs. A spokesman for the
company wasn&#8217;t immediately able to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will be seeking leave to appeal,&#8221; Saad Group&#8217;s
London-based spokesman, Tim Robertson, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zuckerman Spaeder Hires as New York Crime Practice Grows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerman Spaeder LLP hired Andrew E. Tomback, formerly a
partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley  McCloy LLP, as the law firm
expands its New York white-collar criminal defense practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomback joins recent hires Steven M. Cohen, a former aide
to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and defense attorney Paul
Shechtman, in Washington-based Zuckerman Spaeder&#8217;s New York
office, the firm said yesterday in a statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 3, Zuckerman Spaeder said it added Shechtman, a
former director of criminal justice under Governor George
Pataki. All three new hires are former federal prosecutors, the
firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partner William W. Taylor III successfully defended
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former director of the International
Monetary Fund, who was accused of sexual assault and attempted
rape by a hotel maid in New York. Manhattan prosecutors dropped
the charges in August. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Proskauer Rose Sued by Former CFO for Discrimination &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proskauer Rose LLP was sued for employment discrimination
in New York by former Chief Financial Officer Elly Rosenthal,
who accused the law firm of firing her after she took leave for
breast cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal, 57, of Colts Neck, New Jersey, who served as CFO
from 1992 to 2008, filed the lawsuit in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan yesterday, seeking $10 million in
compensatory and punitive damages, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal was hired as CFO of the New York-based firm in
1992 and held the position until she was demoted to chief
administrative financial officer in September 2008, she said in
the complaint. She was fired in March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After one of its most senior female employees worldwide
was diagnosed with breast cancer and took cancer treatment
leave, Proskauer Rose demoted and then terminated her,&#8221;
Rosenthal&#8217;s attorney, David Sanford of Sanford Wittels 
Heisler, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh Epstein, a spokesman for Proskauer, didn&#8217;t respond to
a phone call and e-mail seeking comment on Rosenthal&#8217;s
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger will take on the added role of chairman next
year at the theme-park and entertainment company, part of a plan
to appoint a new CEO in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 60, will succeed John E. Pepper at the annual meeting
in March, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a
statement. Pepper, 73, a former chairman and CEO of Procter 
Gamble Co., has led the board since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney didn&#8217;t name a successor for Iger, who oversaw the
acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel in the past five years and will
become executive chairman in 2015. The company will combine the
top roles for the first time since 2004, when CEO Michael Eisner
was stripped of the chairmanship after a failed proxy fight
waged by Roy Disney, Walt&#8217;s nephew. The company wanted to keep
Iger and have a smooth transition, Pepper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m totally surprised that they would do this again,&#8221;
said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware&#8217;s
John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. &#8220;Why stick
your head in a blender? An executive just shouldn&#8217;t be in charge
of the board that monitors him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of Disney&#8217;s top executives, Tom Staggs and Jay Rasulo,
swapped roles at the end of 2009, with Chief Financial Officer
Staggs assuming the job of parks chief and Rasulo becoming CFO,
in a move designed to bolster the experience of both men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race to the Top? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger &#8220;set up a race between the two by having them switch
jobs that ought to help him make that decision,&#8221; said David Joyce, a Miller Tabak  Co. analyst in New York who recommends
buying Disney shares. &#8220;They are both 20-year veterans at the
company and have strong operational backgrounds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s largest business is media networks, led by Anne Sweeney and George Bodenheimer, co-chairmen. The division, which
includes ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channel, had $17.2 billion in
fiscal 2010 sales and contributed two-thirds of Disney&#8217;s $7.6
billion in operating income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 33 cents to $31.70 at the close in New York and
has declined 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also extended Iger&#8217;s contract through 2016 and
is increasing his salary to $2.5 million annually from $2
million now. The new agreement includes a $12 million annual
cash bonus target, as well as options and restricted stock
valued at $15.5 million, Disney said. His current agreement ends
in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strong Performer&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iger has made some forward thinking moves that have made
the company a strong performer,&#8221; Joyce said in an interview.
&#8220;He was the first to embrace digital technology and positioned
the company well with the Pixar and Marvel acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonus is based on performance yardsticks that include
operating income, return on capital, after-tax free cash flow
and earnings per share, the company said. The stock awards will
be based on total shareholder return and earnings per share,
relative to the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the announcement, Disney said total shareholder return
under Iger is five times higher than the SP 500 index since he
took over as CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board is delighted that the company has been able to
secure the longer-term continuation of Bob&#8217;s unique blend of
experience and leadership skills,&#8221; Pepper said. Iger &#8220;will
continue to serve the long-term interests of shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the transition, Disney will appoint an
independent lead director when Iger becomes chairman, according
to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger was named president of Disney in 2000 and succeeded
Eisner as CEO in October 2005. He led the $8.06 billion purchase
of the Pixar animation studio in 2006 and the $4.2 billion
acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2010. He previously
headed Disney&#8217;s ABC television unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is trying to
persuade the National Hockey League&#8217;s New Jersey Devils to sell
bonds backed by the team&#8217;s future television revenue, newsletter
Asset-Backed Alert reported, without saying where it got the
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale, which Goldman Sachs bankers proposed to the team
this week, could raise between $75 million and $100 million, the
report said today. The team&#8217;s officials are reviewing the pitch,
according to the newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sale may depend on whether Jeff Vanderbeek, the former
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. executive who owns 47 percent of
the team, can buy the stake held by co-owner Ray Chambers, the
report said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in
New York, declined to comment. Vanderbeek didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" date="Oct 07, 2011  1:04 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-07/goldman-sachs-tells-investors-to-buy-morgan-stanley-call-options.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Says Buy Morgan Stanley</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) shares are likely to
rally when the firm reports earnings this month as management
eases concern that profit will be hurt by risks linked to
European sovereign debt, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is likely to provide more details on its
sovereign risk and improved liquidity, helping shares to rally
to 70 percent of tangible book value from their current 57
percent, analysts at New York-based Goldman Sachs wrote in a
note today. They recommended investors buy $16 October calls and
sell short-dated credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, which
is also based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors&#8217; concerns that the firm has large European swap
exposures are &#8220;overdone,&#8221; analysts and strategists including
John Marshall and Louise Pitt said in the note. They made the
recommendation even as they said third-quarter earnings are
likely to be &#8220;weak.&#8221; Goldman Sachs left its &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating
unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk/reward balance of MS shares at current levels
appear tempting,&#8221; the analysts said, referring to the company
by its stock ticker. &#8220;MS should be able to ride out the current
market duress assuming global macroeconomic indicators do not
materially decay. Moreover, concerns regarding its European swap
and loan exposures appear unwarranted, as the firm has signaled
its net exposures to France and the periphery are modest if not
immaterial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley fell 80 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $14.38 at
12:40 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares gained 22 percent the three days through yesterday, the
largest three-day climb since May 2009. That rally left the
shares down 44 percent this year. An increase to 70 percent of
tangible book value would imply a jump to $18.63. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the
world&#8217;s biggest retail brokerage, fell 54 basis points to 420 as
of 11:07 a.m. in New York, according to broker Phoenix Partners
Group. The five-year contracts have declined from 650 basis
points on Oct. 4, the highest since October 2008, the month
after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won European Union
approval to buy Skype Technologies SA in an $8.5 billion deal
adding the world&#8217;s most popular Web-calling service to the
biggest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal won&#8217;t harm competition in the region, partly
because of the presence of rivals such as Google Inc., the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investigation found that the parties&#8217; activities
mainly overlap for video communications, where Microsoft is
active through its Windows Live Messenger,&#8221; the commission
said. &#8220;However, the commission considers that there are no
competition concerns in this growing market where numerous
players, including Google, are present.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed in May to acquire Luxembourg-based Skype,
with 170 million active users, from investors led by private
equity firm Silver Lake. The acquisition, Microsoft&#8217;s largest,
is also the biggest Internet takeover in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN), Turkey&#8217;s
biggest listed lender, had the biggest weekly drop in eight as
traders said U.S.-based funds may be selling the stock after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the bank to its &#8220;focus sell&#8221;
list on Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garanti fell 14 kurus, or 2.1 percent, to 6.52 liras at
5:30 p.m. in Istanbul, taking losses this week to 10 percent.
The share rose 16 percent last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Along with the Goldman Sachs sell report, I guess one of
the big funds is massively selling,&#8221; Ata Doganoglu, a trader at
Ekspres Invest in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. &#8220;I think U.S. funds are going underweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garanti has lost 30 percent since reaching a record high of
9.38 liras in November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garanti is &#8220;exposed to deteriorating banking dynamics
should Turkish economic growth turn to a recession, an outcome
that Goldman economists are now assigning a relatively high
probability,&#8221; the e-mailed report issued by Goldman&#8217;s equity
research division said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael Patterson" date="Oct 07, 2011  8:38 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-07/cash-beats-cheapest-emerging-market-stocks-since-08-at-jpmorgan.html"><headline>Cash Better Than Cheap Emerging-Market Stocks: JPMorgan</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. dollars are a more attractive
investment than developing-nation stocks trading at the lowest
valuations since 2008 as Europe struggles to solve its debt
crisis and China&#8217;s economy slows, said Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s chief Asia and emerging-market strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has tumbled as much as 31
percent from this year&#8217;s high, sending its price-to-earnings
ratio to 9.4 on Oct. 5, the lowest level since December 2008,
three months after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed. The
gauge yields 3.2 percent in dividends, compared with 0.04
percent for the biggest money-market mutual funds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg and Crane Data LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low valuations aren&#8217;t enough to spur a rally, Mowat said in
an interview today. Shares may keep falling because European
leaders haven&#8217;t agreed on a &#8220;serious&#8221; plan to recapitalize
banks and China&#8217;s inflation is still too high for the central
bank to ease monetary policy, he said. The MSCI index sank 54
percent in 2008 as the Dollar Index rose 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lesson from the Lehman debacle was that U.S. cash was
really the only safe asset,&#8221; Mowat, who leads JPMorgan&#8217;s
emerging-market strategy team from Hong Kong, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;Unfortunately Europe has to get a lot worse before
it&#8217;s going to get better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund Outflows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market equity funds have posted 10 straight weeks
of outflows, with investors withdrawing $3.3 billion in the
seven days ended Oct. 5, according to data compiled by
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research firm EPFR Global. China
funds had $167 million of outflows during the week as the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index sank to the lowest level since
April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re still in a world where a significant amount of
international speculative risk flow comes out of the U.S.,&#8221;
said Mowat. &#8220;You tend to repatriate capital so it&#8217;s closer to
where your liabilities are when there&#8217;s a big risk event.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mowat&#8217;s outlook contrasts with a forecast for &#8220;big gains&#8221;
in developing-nation stocks during the next 12 months by
Geoffrey Dennis, the head of emerging-market strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in New York. Dennis wrote in a report dated
yesterday that low valuations make a rally likely and that
domestic demand in emerging markets including China will shield
the economies from a global slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI emerging gauge has climbed 6.1 percent in the past
three days, including a 2.1 percent gain to 882.41 as of 1:09
p.m. in London. The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency
against those of six trading partners, slipped 0.2 percent
today, paring its gain since the end of August to 5.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short Rallies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For emerging-market shares, &#8220;I see an environment of these
rather short, sharp rallies that then fade because people come
back to realizing that this European situation is more
serious,&#8221; said Mowat. &#8220;Stocks can easily go through previous
valuation lows.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks&#8217; capital will be a subject for discussion at
the Oct. 17-18 summit of European Union leaders, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin today. Lenders in the
region may need as much as 200 billion euros ($269 billion) of
additional capital, according to the International Monetary
Fund&#8217;s European head Antonio Borges. The Bloomberg Europe Banks
and Financial Services Index has dropped 30 percent this year as
investors became concerned that financial firms will have to
write down their holdings of Greek, Italian, Spanish and
Portuguese government bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Slowdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I could just completely ignore Europe, we would have a
different recommendation,&#8221; Mowat said. &#8220;But unfortunately our
perspective at JPMorgan is that you need a very serious proposal
to recapitalize the European banking system, and that is not
really being discussed at a euro-wide basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mowat began 2011 forecasting the MSCI index would
rise to 1,500, he cut his year-end estimate to 1,300 in
February. Mowat told Bloomberg Television on April 18 that the
gauge may fall about 20 percent. The index peaked two weeks
later and entered a bear market on Sept. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should hold &#8220;underweight&#8221; positions in Chinese
stocks, Mowat wrote in a report today. The biggest emerging
economy will slow as an inflation rate 50 percent higher than
the central bank&#8217;s stated target keeps it from easing policy,
while a worsening real-estate market, slower corporate spending
and rising nonperforming loans weigh on demand, Mowat said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs that leaders in Europe and the U.S. are finding ways
to end the debt crisis and boost growth, along with easing
inflation in China, would create a more bullish outlook for
emerging-market stocks, Mowat said. Shares began surging from
their 2008 lows after the Group of 20 nations and China
announced stimulus plans, the strategist said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Look for the policy response,&#8221; Mowat said. &#8220;That&#8217;s when
the market changes direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. said it&#8217;s responding
to an oil sheen observed Oct. 7 near its Billings, Montana,
refinery, about 15 miles from an Exxon pipeline spill in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ExxonMobil has no pipelines or similar oil containing
equipment in close proximity to the leak,&#8221; said Rachael Moore,
a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based company, in an e-mail
today. The company has &#8220;no reason&#8221; to believe its facilities
were the source of the oil, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spill response team from the refinery laid boom to limit
potential environmental damage, and the &#8220;small amount of oil&#8221;
is contained in a side channel of the river, Moore said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is investigating the source of the sheen, she
said. Moore declined to provide an estimate of how much oil is
in the sheen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 1, Exxon&#8217;s Silvertip pipeline in Montana ruptured,
spilling as much as 1,000 barrels of crude into the Yellowstone
River. The cleanup effort, which is being led by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, has involved more than 600
people and is expected to cost the company an estimated $42.6
million, Exxon has said. &lt;/p&gt;

scheduling conflict,&#8221; Kathryn Kolbert, director of Barnard&#8217;s
Athena Center for Leadership Studies, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We expect that his talk will be rescheduled for a
future date.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Power Talk&#8221; with Blankfein was cancelled because he
&#8220;must be in Washington D.C. that evening,&#8221; the Athena Center
said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debora L. Spar, president of the women-only liberal-arts
school, joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board at a meeting in London on
June 16, her 48th birthday. Blankfein, 57, and his wife Laura, a
Barnard College alumna and former trustee, donated $50,000 to
the New York-based college in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31,
2010, their nonprofit foundation&#8217;s federal tax filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at Columbia University, across the street from
Barnard, had organized a week-long protest against Blankfein
called &#8220;School the Squid,&#8221; which included discussions about
corporate greed and power abuse, the student-run Columbia Daily
Spectator reported on its website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before it converted to a bank in
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., set a pay record in 2007 when it awarded
Blankfein a $67.9 million bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2009 article by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone magazine
labeled the company &#8220;a great vampire squid wrapped around the
face of humanity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
confirmed that Blankfein cancelled his talk due to a scheduling
conflict. He declined further comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services company, rose to a
record, surpassing the mark set in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 2.3 percent to $186.62 at the close in New York,
giving it a market value of $222.9 billion. The price topped the
$185.21 it reached July 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s attractive as a safer, less volatile investment in
tech in very turbulent times,&#8221; said Ed Maguire, an analyst at
Credit Agricole Securities USA in New York who rates the shares
&#8220;outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which went public in 1915, has gained 27 percent this
year, making it the best performer of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The index, down 1.3 percent this year, jumped 3 percent
today as global markets rallied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano divested the
company&#8217;s PC business six years ago, turning the company once
known for mainframe computers into the world&#8217;s biggest computer-
services provider. IBM is celebrating its 100th anniversary this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), trying to reverse
disappointing sales for its Windows Phone, is counting on
Samsung Electronics Co. and other manufacturing partners to step
up retailer incentives and boost in-store promotions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Samsung and HTC Corp. have committed to increasing
marketing budgets for the phones, said Andy Lees, president of
Microsoft&#8217;s mobile unit, in an interview. While manufacturers
will determine how the money is spent, some of it will probably
go toward spurring retail staff to tout Windows Phone models, he
said. New handsets with the new Windows Phone 7.5 will go on
sale in the coming weeks, Lees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of the previous version last October, the
Windows Phone has missed the company&#8217;s sales expectations, and
Microsoft has continued to lose ground to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone
and devices based on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android. Microsoft needs to
do a better job of marketing the new software, which is much
improved, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a technical perspective, it really does put them on
par with the other competitors, but a lot of times Microsoft
gets it right with the technology and then fumbles the marketing
message,&#8221; he said. Mobile-phone retailers haven&#8217;t cooperated in
the past, Gartenberg said. &#8220;If you went to a store they showed
you anything other than a Windows Phone. If you asked for a
Windows Phone, they tried to talk you out of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is especially reliant on the carriers&#8217; retail
salespeople in the U.S., where more than 80 percent of phones
are sold by stores owned by mobile operators, Lees said. In
other countries, a larger percentage of handsets are sold by the
phone makers themselves. He didn&#8217;t specify what form the
incentives might take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7.5, also known as Mango, was released last
month to existing Windows handset customers. In addition to more
aggressive marketing, Microsoft&#8217;s partnership with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)
will help sales, Lees said. Nokia announced earlier this year
that it would base its handsets on Windows Phone software, a bid
to reinvigorate its smartphone strategy. Nokia directly or
indirectly controls more than 6,000 stores, Lees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gartner forecasts that Microsoft will become the No. 2
smartphone operating system in 2015, with market share of 20
percent. That would vault it past Apple&#8217;s iOS, with Android
remaining in the top spot. Achim Berg, head of Windows Phone
marketing, said at a September conference in Berlin that the 20
percent share may be a conservative estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Quarter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year, Microsoft will account for 11 percent of the
market, up from 5.6 percent this year, Gartner said in an April
report. Lees declined to forecast numbers himself, except to say
he expects market share to rise starting in the first quarter of
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers plan to produce a Windows phone that uses the
high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution, or
LTE, in the &#8220;not-too-distant future,&#8221; Lees said. That will
make mobile carriers more eager to promote the Windows Phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheaper models also will be produced, giving a boost to the
operating system, Lees said. While handset makers and the
carriers determine prices and subsidies, consumers should see
Windows Phone devices for less than $100 in the U.S., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stars are really starting to align for us,&#8221; Lees
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new software, which better integrates apps, search and
phone features, received positive reviews from AllThingsD,
Gizmodo and Bloomberg&#8217;s Rich Jaroslovsky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies, Maps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for a movie, and the phone brings up a synopsis,
running time, showings nearby, and lets you buy tickets. It also
lists apps related to movies. It has indoor maps so you can find
the parking lot at the mall where the theater is located. A
local app gives you nearby restaurants and if you&#8217;ve downloaded
OpenTable, there&#8217;s a reserve button right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search key brings up the option to scan book or album
covers for product matches. It will also scan foreign language
text to translate a French restaurant menu. The software can
listen to a piece of music and identify it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 2.6 percent to $26.94 at close in New York.
The stock has dropped 3.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swiss National Bank may raise
its ceiling for the franc to 1.30 per euro from 1.20 per euro,
according to the private-banking unit of JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain of the view that a further upward adjustment in
the ceiling is both justified and likely,&#8221; Audrey Childe- Freeman, global head of currency strategy at JPMorgan Private
Bank in London, said in an e-mailed research note today. &#8220;1.25
has recently been mentioned as a new possible reference level,
but that would still leave the Swiss franc largely overvalued.
Instead, the monetary authorities may set a more ambitious
target, at say 1.30.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank decided on Sept. 6 to cap the franc&#8217;s
strength at 1.20 per euro to deter investors using it as a
shelter from market turmoil. The currency appreciated to a
record 1.00749 per euro on Aug. 9 as investors bought it as a
haven from Europe&#8217;s deepening debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franc appreciated 0.4 percent to 1.2363 per euro as of
11:39 a.m. in London today and was 1.9 percent stronger at 90.96
centimes per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The still uncertain international context should
theoretically be supportive for the Swiss franc, but we remain
of the view that this is not the year to challenge the SNB,&#8221;
Freeman wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She declined to give a probable timeline for the move when
contacted by phone today, saying it was &#8220;feasible&#8221; before the
end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy&#8217;s credit downgrade by Fitch
Ratings means the bonds will no longer be eligible for inclusion
in the liquidity asset buffer required by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FSA requires from certain firms, including branches
of foreign banks, to hold a liquidity buffer of high-quality,
unencumbered assets with credit rating of AA or above,&#8221;
Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global-markets strategist in London,
wrote in an investor report on Oct. 7. &#8220;Belgium is the obvious
beneficiary, as it is the next cheapest paper that can be used
for the FSA&#8217;s liquidity buffer. The impact should be limited, as
bank treasuries have been largely anticipating this downgrade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch cut Italy&#8217;s credit rating to A+ from AA- on Oct. 7.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said third-quarter profit rose as proceeds
from a refinery sale and the strengthening U.S. dollar more than
offset slowing oil demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s net income in the period that ended Sept. 30 was
&#8220;comparable&#8221; with second-quarter results, when the company
reported a profit of $7.73 billion, exceeding the $3.77 billion
earned during the third quarter of 2010. Chevron announced
selected third-quarter results in a statement distributed via
Business Wire. The company, based in San Ramon, California, is
scheduled to release full third-quarter results on Oct. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron sold a U.K. oil refinery and related storage
terminals and marketing assets in Ireland to Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)
in August for $1.73 billion as part of Chief Executive Officer
John Watson&#8217;s effort to shed lower-profit fuel-making units. The
company said today that it recorded a $500 million third-quarter
gain from the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s oil and natural-gas production during July and
August fell 5 percent from the full third-quarter of 2010 to the
equivalent of 2.6 million barrels a day, the company said. The
declines stemmed from a pipeline incident in Thailand and repair
work to installations in the Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan and the
U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.K. tax increase on oil and gas production prompted
Chevron to take a $150 million &#8220;catch-up charge&#8221; during the
third quarter and will cost an additional $40 million during the
current period, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. of Irving, Texas, is the largest U.S. oil

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the top-ranked
fixed-income research firm on Wall Street, upgraded its
recommendation on high-grade corporate debt to &#8220;neutral&#8221; as
the assets attract more money from investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which cut the debt to &#8220;underweight&#8221; on June 15,
said valuations are more attractive than low-yielding U.S.
Treasuries, especially after the Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;Operation
Twist&#8221; program announced last month, analysts led by Eric Beinstein wrote in a note today. Inflows to the asset class,
high cash balances and &#8220;solid&#8221; corporate credit fundamentals
also fueled the outlook shift, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Year-end tends to be when investors review their asset
allocations, and we believe HG U.S. corporate bonds will be
deemed about the best asset class to own heading into the low
growth and potentially recessionary environment of 2012,&#8221;
analysts from the New York-based bank wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury have fallen to
about 2.1 percent from 2.97 percent four months ago as Europe&#8217;s
sovereign debt crisis worsens and after the Fed decided to
replace short-term Treasuries in its $1.65 trillion portfolio
with long-term bonds in a policy known as Operation Twist.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have increased to
4.13 percent from 3.72 percent on June 15, increasing the allure
of such securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts, ranked No. 1 investment-grade strategists in
Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s annual poll, didn&#8217;t assign an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation to high-grade corporate debt,
citing growth slowdowns in the U.S. and Europe that will lead to
heightened &#8220;event risk,&#8221; according to the note. They also
cited the lack of a solution to the European debt crisis, asset
sales by European banks and limited allocations to financial
debt versus non-financial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation at JPMorgan means the position
is expected to perform in line with benchmarks over the next
three months, according to today&#8217;s note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade bonds are rated Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and BBB- and above by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stock analysts
took top honors in Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s rating of
the best U.S. financial researchers for the second consecutive
year, winning by the narrowest margin of any firm since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, had 40
top-ranked analysts in the survey, edging out Barclays Plc (BARC) and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch, which tied for second
place with 39 each, the publication said today in a statement.
The number of top analysts at Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) rose to 25 from
18, the largest increase, as Germany&#8217;s biggest lender climbed to
eighth place from ninth last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Investor&#8217;s 40th annual All-America Research
Team ranking tallied ratings from 3,500 fund managers and
analysts at more than 1,000 investment firms overseeing $10.7
trillion of U.S. equities. New York-based JPMorgan, Barclays and
Bank of America held the top spots even as fewer of their
analysts made the cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The competition is fierce,&#8221; Thomas Johnson, the
magazine&#8217;s research editor, said in the statement. &#8220;In a period
of unprecedented economic uncertainty, from sovereign debt
crises in Europe and political unrest in the Middle East to
gridlock in Washington, it&#8217;s not surprising that investors would
flock to banks with global platforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had 46 analysts on the list in 2010 to capture the
top ranking for the first time, snapping a two-year winning
streak for Barclays Capital, the brokerage arm of London-based
Barclays, which placed second with 43 analysts. Barclays owns
the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which
ranked No. 1 in each of the previous five years. Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America ranked third in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, climbed to tie Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) in fourth place with 43 analysts, up from fifth
last year. New York-based Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. was the
only firm in the top 10 to fall, slipping to ninth place from
sixth with 22 analysts, down from 25 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners include John Pitzer, who covers technology for
Zurich-based Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan&#8217;s Steven Alexopoulos,
who took the top spot for Banks/Midcap analysts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world&#8217;s biggest payment networks, were sued by a trade group
representing operators of automated teller machines over claims
the firms fix prices and suppress competition among ATM
networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, in a lawsuit filed today in federal court in
Washington, accused Visa and MasterCard of antitrust violations
for restricting independent ATM operators from charging varying
prices for customers using alternative networks such as STAR,
Shazam Inc. or TransFund. Under a uniform agreement, the
operators can&#8217;t charge less for transactions over a network that
competes with Visa and MasterCard, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is the latest assault on the firms, which are
grappling with the effects of new Federal Reserve rules that
reduced the fees charged to merchants for debit-card purchases.
Visa and MasterCard processed cash transactions totaling at
least $547 billion in the U.S. last year, including withdrawals
from ATMs, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ATM restraints prevent ATM operators from offering
their customers a discount or benefit for completing a
transaction over a network that is less costly to the ATM
operator,&#8221; the group contended in its complaint. &#8220;Consumers
cannot be rewarded for using a lower cost and more efficient
network.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Group &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations were made by the National ATM Council Inc.,
a trade group based in Jacksonville, Florida, and 13 operators
of ATMs in nine states. The plaintiffs, who are asking to
represent the 350 non-bank ATM operators nationwide, are seeking
triple damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard, based in
Purchase, New York, declined to comment, saying the company
hadn&#8217;t been served with the suit. Will Valentine, a spokesman
for San Francisco-based Visa, declined to comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATM operators claim that the &#8220;overwhelming&#8221; majority
of so-called PIN debit cards used for ATM transactions are
branded by Visa or MasterCard. In order to accept one of these
cards, an ATM operator must have access to the Visa and
MasterCard networks. Independent or non-bank operators must be
sponsored by a financial institution that is a member of the
Visa and MasterCard networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service Fee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard and their member banks require the service
fee for any transaction at an ATM to be &#8220;no less than the
amount charged at that ATM or terminal for a Visa or MasterCard
transaction,&#8221; even for transactions that don&#8217;t use the
companies&#8217; networks, the lawsuit alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By restricting their ability to attract customers to
lower cost ATM services through lower prices, the ATM restraints
put a competitive straightjacket on ATM operators,&#8221; the lawsuit
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa climbed 66 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $91.17 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. MasterCard fell 0.5
percent to $327.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National ATM Council v. Visa Inc. (V), 11-1803,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley may consider dropping their status as bank holding
companies to avoid expenses tied to the Volcker rule, said David Hilder, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule in its current form would impose costs on lenders
and drive capital to non-bank market makers, causing the two New
York-based firms to consider whether to stop being banks, Hilder
said in a note yesterday, when four regulatory agencies issued a
298-page draft of the rule for public comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the biggest U.S.
securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The regulators have proposed a massive new compliance
burden on banks to prove that their market-making activities are
just that, and not proprietary trading in disguise,&#8221; wrote
Hilder, who&#8217;s based in New York. &#8220;If these regulations are
adopted in anything close to their proposed form, there will be
large additional costs imposed on banks as market-makers that
will not apply to market-makers not owned by banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Konrad, a bank analyst at KBW Inc., said Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) are unlikely to change their status as
bank holding companies to dodge the Volcker restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Protecting Deposits&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they tried to do that, Congress would amend the rule
to say systemically important banks rather than bank holding
companies,&#8221; Konrad said in a phone interview. &#8220;This is part
protecting deposits, but also part too-big-to-fail. I don&#8217;t
think there&#8217;s any interest from the investment banks in doing
that, and I don&#8217;t think it would serve that purpose.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said
Jan. 21, 2010, the same day President Barack Obama announced his
support for the Volcker rule, that it was &#8220;unrealistic&#8221; to
imagine the firm won&#8217;t be a federally supervised bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley made &#8220;modest profits&#8221;
from pure proprietary trading, which is why they willingly shut
down those desks, David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities,
wrote in a note today. The rule&#8217;s draft indicates regulators
won&#8217;t interfere with customer flow trading, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs may be hurt by provisions that limit
investments in hedge funds and private equity, Trone wrote. Had
those restrictions been in place in recent years, they would
have cost the firm about $700 million, or 9 percent, of annual
earnings, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Crown Jewel&#8217; Businesses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, was
included in last year&#8217;s regulatory overhaul to rein in risky
trading that helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The central
bank, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency worked with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on the draft issued yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley climbed 45 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $15.84
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Goldman Sachs
advanced 2.5 percent to $99.11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased regulation and capital rules may mean the largest
banks have to split off some &#8220;crown jewel&#8221; businesses, said
Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern
School of Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to ask which parts of the business are they
simply not going to be able to continue to do or maintain the
talented people who do it because those guys would have better
options if they left the firm and went to a hedge fund,&#8221; Smith
said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to be left with the third team running
your expensive market-making trading desk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s too soon to say whether banks affected by the rule
would have to break up to remain competitive and the costs of
the proposal are likely to shift some business to smaller
players, Glenn Schorr, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst, wrote in
a note today. Companies and investors are likely to push back
during the comment period to &#8220;dial back&#8221; some parts of the
rule, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Mark Lake declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patriot Coal Corp., the U.S. coal
producer spun off from Peabody Energy Corp. in 2007, was
downgraded to &#8220;sell&#8221; by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on the
expectation that demand for metallurgical coal will fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patriot&#8217;s sales of met coal will decline in 2012, Andre Benjamin, a New York-based analyst with Goldman Sachs, wrote in
a research note today. Patriot &#8220;is the most likely to see
reduced demand or pricing pressures from less European demand,&#8221;
Benjamin said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patriot, based in St. Louis, has high costs and exports
about 70 percent of its met coal to Europe, he said. Met coal
demand will fall by 18 million metric tons in 2012 with 60
percent of the decline occurring in Europe, according to
Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal is used to make coke, which some steel
producers combine with iron ore to produce the metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patriot fell 5.3 percent to $9.69 at the close in New York.
The shares have tumbled 50 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia, the world&#8217;s largest
cocaine producer, said illegal gold mining is becoming the
&#8220;next major threat&#8221; to security as government efforts to crack
down on drug crops prompt rebels to seek new revenue sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike cocaine, gold can easily be sold into the economy
and be used to finance terrorist groups, Mines and Energy
Minister Mauricio Cardenas said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s something that has been growing fast, and in some
ways it&#8217;s Colombia&#8217;s next major threat from the point of view of
illegal groups,&#8221; Cardenas, 49, said Oct. 10 at his office in
Bogota. &#8220;We have to combat this very effectively, very fast. We
cannot let this problem grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian gold deposits, which enriched Spanish
conquistadors more than four centuries ago, have attracted
investment from billionaire Eike Batista and AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. (ANG) Guerrilla and paramilitary groups, whose suppression has
been the cornerstone of government efforts to boost security and
lure investments, also have been drawn to mining for the
precious metal as gold trades near record levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold&#8217;s rally has made illegal mining &#8220;a lot more
profitable,&#8221; threatening to bring &#8220;reinvigorated strength&#8221; to
terrorist groups, according to Cardenas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures for December delivery rose 1.3 percent to
settle at $1,682.60 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the metal reached $1,693.90, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept 23. Gold has surged 25 percent
in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Terrible Effect&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A stronger guerrilla would recruit better, make it easier
to extort people and companies, and attack infrastructure and
the military,&#8221; Alfredo Rangel, a former member of Colombia&#8217;s
Security Council, said yesterday by phone. &#8220;All of which would
have a terrible effect on security and investment expectations
and be very negative for economic growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidnappings, including by guerrilla groups, slumped to 282
people last year from 2,882 in 2002, while murder and attacks by
illegal groups against police, infrastructure and citizens also
fell, according to government figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved security has helped President Juan Manuel Santos
to draw international investment in mines, oil fields and coal
projects. Foreign direct investment may rise to a record $12
billion this year, according to the finance ministry, more than
quadruple levels a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batista&#8217;s AUX Canada Acquisition Inc. purchased control of
Ventana Gold Corp. this year to gain gold deposits in Colombia,
while AngloGold Ashanti, the gold producer whose largest
shareholder is billionaire John Paulson, is developing the La
Colosa gold mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug-Fueled Violence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guerrilla groups and organized crime gangs are also tapping
the deposits as a way to expand beyond drug trafficking, fund
weapons purchases and manpower, Vice President Angelino Garzon
said in an interview last month. He estimates a &#8220;high&#8221; amount
of output from illegal gold mining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a diversification of revenue,&#8221; Garzon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has increased arrests and seizures of
equipment at illegal mines this year, Cardenas said. Colombia is
studying additional steps to combat the operations, such as
tracking raw materials used to extract gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guerrilla and paramilitary groups thrived on drug revenue
in the 1990s, fueling violence that led investors to shun the
Andean nation. Since then, cocaine output in Colombia, still the
world&#8217;s largest producer of the drug processed from coca leaves,
has plunged amid government eradication and anti-trafficking
efforts, according to United Nations figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian production shrank to 350 metric tons in 2010 from
410 tons in 2009, the UN said. Declining output means Peru may
be on track to become the world&#8217;s top supplier of cocaine, the
International Narcotics Control Board said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakened FARC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eradicating coca production over the past decade has
weakened the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
Latin America&#8217;s oldest guerrilla group, as well as the smaller
ELN and paramilitary groups that purchase weapons and secure
manpower with drug money, kidnappings and extortion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cocaine production fell, gold output climbed to a record
53.6 metric tons last year, according to Colombian government
figures. Output has more than tripled from 15.5 tons in 2007.
The government doesn&#8217;t have an estimate on how much gold is
mined illegally because, like coca cultivation, it often takes
place in isolated areas with few roadways and steep terrain,
Cardenas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guerrillas already long present in some mining areas are
now bringing in heavy equipment and consolidating to increase
output in provinces in central and southwestern Colombia, Rangel
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike drugs, &#8220;illegal gold mining is easy to legalize
once you have a gram of gold in your hands, because then you can
sell it anywhere,&#8221; Cardenas said. &#8220;It&#8217;s something you have to
control&#8221; at the mine site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K.''s tax authority &#8220;made a
mistake&#8221; in agreeing to forgive Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as
much as 10 million pounds ($16 million) of interest on unpaid
tax, its most senior official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m entirely responsible for the Goldman Sachs mistake,&#8221;
Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs Permanent Secretary for Tax
David Hartnett told a parliamentary committee in London today.
It was investigating his role in an agreement HMRC made with the
New York-based investment bank in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal resulted in Goldman Sachs paying back taxes it
owed on National Insurance payments for bankers&#8217; bonuses, while
foregoing interest payments. According to a Guardian report
yesterday, which cited documents leaked to Private Eye magazine,
Goldman Sachs had avoided paying National Insurance tax on
bonuses for bankers working in London by setting up an entity in
the British Virgin Islands. The offshore unit technically
employed the staff, which were seconded to the U.K. capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartnett said he and his colleagues created a &#8220;bespoke&#8221;
tax arrangement for Goldman Sachs in order to resolve a &#8220;huge
relationship issue&#8221; between the bank and HMRC.  The reprieve
was worth &#8220;less than 10 million pounds&#8221; to Goldman Sachs,
Hartnett said. He declined to elaborate further, citing tax
confidentiality rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hartnett should resign,&#8221; Jesse Norman, the Conservative
Member of Parliament for Hereford and South Herefordshire, who
sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said on his website. &#8220;In
my constituency I have hundreds of small firms, for whom the
Revenue&#8217;s penalties on unpaid tax are 200 times as high on
average as those on large companies. This settlement with
Goldman is the last straw.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs,
the U.K. tax authority, &#8220;made a mistake&#8221; in granting Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) a reprieve on the interest it owed on bonus
payments, HMRC Permanent Secretary for Tax David Hartnett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s most senior tax official was answering questions
from a parliamentary committee on his role in an agreement with
Goldman in December, which resulted in the U.S. investment bank
paying tax it owed but foregoing interest payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reprieve was worth &#8220;less than 10 million pounds&#8221; to

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said conventional quantitative easing may
not be enough for the U.S. and U.K. economies and more
&#8220;targeted&#8221; policies are needed to boost confidence and growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not obvious to me that conventional QE in the U.K.
or the U.S. has got that much bang for its buck,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said
in an interview with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;The Pulse&#8221; program in London today. &#8220;More imaginative QE or
forms of specific targeted easing, probably involving more
infrastructure or doing something to get bank funding spreads
down, would be more likely to get a stronger result.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comments were echoed by former Bank of England policy
maker Sushil Wadhwani, who said today that global central banks
need to do &#8220;more creative&#8221; forms of monetary policy to prevent
the global economy slipping into a recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England restarted asset purchases last week,
its first expansion of policy since 2009, citing risks to the
recovery from the euro-area debt crisis, while data today showed
the unemployment rate rose to the highest since 1996 in the
quarter through August. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve
announced last month an operation to replace $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries,
aiming to reduce borrowing costs and spur the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England&#8217;s new stimulus &#8220;will have less effect
this time than it did last time,&#8221; former Bank of England policy
maker Charles Goodhart said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Last
Word&#8221; with Andrea Catherwood today. &#8220;The real problem isn&#8217;t
the level of official interest rates, but it&#8217;s the difficulties
the banks have in getting funding and the spreads the banks
charge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said there is a &#8220;very strong case&#8221; for trying to
provide more assistance to small businesses and first-time home
buyers. Referring to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne&#8217;s credit-easing proposal, he said &#8220;more innovative
ways&#8221; to help boost credit are necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wadhwani, founder of Wadhwani Asset Management LLP, said
global policy makers need to do three things &#8220;if they are to
prevent a relapse,&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;First, they need to get firms better access to credit,&#8221;
he said in an e-mailed note co-written with Michael Dicks.
&#8220;Second, they need to help boost demand. And, third, they need
to deal with the euro crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct Approach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wadhwani recommended U.K. authorities take a more direct
approach to boosting demand by issuing every adult a voucher
that can be spent in the next three months. That is &#8220;surely a
more effective form of quantitative easing&#8221; than the central
bank buying gilts, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said the U.K. and the U.S. can&#8217;t &#8220;play the
innocent bystander and plead with Europe to sort out its mess.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Better surely to recognize both the global scale of the
problem and the political constraints that are currently
limiting European policy makers&#8217; room for manoeuvre, and act in
accordance,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. unemployment data also showed that jobless claims
rose 17,500 in September, a seventh straight increase. Prime
Minister David Cameron said the figures were &#8220;very
disappointing,&#8221; adding that the government won&#8217;t abandon its
budget-reduction plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it would be a dangerous thing to rule out&#8221; the
U.K. economy deteriorating further &#8220;given what the evidence is
showing,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;It might be because of the fiscal
tightening that is coming home to roost.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Susanne Walker" date="Oct 12, 2011  8:48 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-12/treasury-clients-short-for-first-time-in-3-weeks-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Treasury Clients Short for First Time in 3 Weeks, JPMorgan Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Investors are betting that U.S.
Treasuries will decline for the first time in three weeks,
according to a JPMorgan Chase  Co. customer survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of net &#8220;shorts&#8221; in the firm&#8217;s &#8220;all clients&#8221;
survey rose to 2 percent for the week ending Oct. 11, compared
with a net &#8220;long&#8221; position of 11 percent the prior week. About
85 percent of the clients surveyed remained neutral. A short
position is a wager the price of a security will fall, while a
long position is a bet it will rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury yields have risen since reaching record lows on
Sept. 23, two days after the Federal Reserve announced purchases
of the securities as part of a plan known as Operation Twist.
Yields on 10-year securities rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.21 percent at 8:48 a.m. in New York,
after falling to a record 1.6714 percent on Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn&#8217;t immediately available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Oct 12, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-12/jpmorgan-third-quarter-profit-may-show-10-decline-on-investment-banking.html"><headline>JPMorgan Net Income May Show 10% Decline</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may say profit
slid 10 percent in the third quarter, the biggest drop in more
than two years, as Europe&#8217;s credit crisis and the U.S. debt-
ceiling debate spoiled optimism for an economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow&#8217;s report from the New York-based bank will
probably show earnings of $3.96 billion, according to the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That
compares with $4.42 billion a year earlier and $5.43 billion in
the three months ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, braced investors last month for a 30 percent
drop in trading revenue from the second quarter, when the
company generated $5.5 billion from that business. He said fees
from investment banking would tumble almost 50 percent to $1
billion. About $2 trillion in corporate bond issues came to
market in the first half before volume plummeted to about $550
billion in the third quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect another challenging quarter for the universal
bank group,&#8221; Frederick Cannon and David Konrad, analysts at
Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc. in New York, wrote in an Oct. 10
research note. &#8220;Declining markets and elevated volatility is
expected not only to slow investment-banking and trading
revenues but also to cause negative marks in investments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the first of the major U.S. banks to report
third-quarter earnings, will be a barometer for the rest of the
industry and the broader U.S. economy, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve Releases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon, 55, led the bank to a record $17.4 billion
in net income last year, the most of any U.S. bank. Earnings
were buoyed by the release of $7 billion in reserves back into
income as the U.S. economy improved, a benefit that may have
continued in the third quarter and helped &#8220;soften the blow,&#8221;
Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
wrote in an Oct. 7 research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, legal costs to settle lawsuits and other
claims against the company&#8217;s soured mortgage book will continue
to erode earnings, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, whose $2.25 trillion in assets as of June 30
makes it second to Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), is &#8220;the safe play&#8221; for investors in the sector,
Cannon and Konrad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia and analyst with FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia, instead recommends that investors either
&#8220;stay on the sidelines&#8221; or place their bets on better
capitalized banks such as Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. and U.S. Bancorp, he said in an Oct. 10
research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, Wells Fargo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S.
lender, may report a profit of $2.5 billion when it releases
results on Oct. 17, and Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco,
will probably say it earned $3.87 billion when it announces
results the same day, the survey of analysts shows. Bank of
America may report a profit of $2.69 billion on Oct. 18 while
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) may say it earned $45.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowing economic growth and heightened worries about
European sovereign debt have weighed on bank stocks all year.
None of the 24 members of the KBW Bank Index has posted a gain
in 2011, and the worst performer, Bank of America, is down 52
percent through yesterday. A jump in borrowing costs at some
banks, including New York-based Morgan Stanley, subsided last
week as investors became more optimistic that European Union
policy makers would solve the sovereign debt and banking crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political &#8216;Incompetence&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American and EU politicians reached the limit of their
incompetence many months ago,&#8221; Christopher Whalen, founder of
Institutional Risk Analytics, said in a research note yesterday.
&#8220;We see the lack of business volumes and political uncertainty
going into 2012 as far more troubling trends in terms of non-
interest revenue sources for all financials.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frederic Janbon, the global head of fixed-income at Paris-
based BNP Paribas SA, said in an interview that financial
markets have become &#8220;almost as dysfunctional and illiquid as
they were in 2008.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is very difficult to trade and highly
sensitive to political news,&#8221; Janbon said. &#8220;Political risk has
moved to the forefront of people&#8217;s minds when looking at the
U.S. and Europe. Since July, anticipation of global economic
slowdown has fundamentally changed this situation. Anxiety has
now spread to all credit products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan growth in the U.S. remains stagnant and net interest
margins, which measure the profit margin on lending, continue to
decline. Bank loans and leases fell $2.1 billion to $6.829
trillion from August 2010 through Sept. 28, according to Federal
Reserve data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$2.09 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPC index advanced 0.3 percent to 34,584.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO MM), Mexico&#8217;s second-largest land-
line phone company, declined 0.6 percent to 5.05 pesos after
dropping as much as 7.9 percent earlier today. The company was
rated &#8220;underweight&#8221; in new coverage by Barclays Capital, which
has a price target of 5.50 pesos per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil SAB (AMXL MM), the wireless carrier
controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, rose 0.6 percent to 15.71
pesos, the highest in three weeks. The company was rated
&#8220;overweight&#8221; in new coverage by Barclays Capital. The
brokerage has a price target of $28 per American depositary
receipt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, gained 9 percent to 4.96 pesos after falling as much
as 5.9 percent earlier today. The stock has gained 27 percent
over the past two sessions. The company said it had nothing to
disclose regarding the share move in a statement to the Mexican
stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, dropped 1.7 percent to 52.92
pesos. The company was rated &#8220;underweight&#8221; in new coverage by
Barclays, which has a price target of $21 per American
depositary receipt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP MM), Mexico&#8217;s second-largest
broadcast television network, gained 0.5 percent to 7.48 pesos.
The company was rated &#8220;equalweight&#8221; in new coverage by
Barclays, which has a price target of 9.00 pesos per share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a U.S. producer
of steelmaking coal, jumped 13 percent in New York after the
U.K.&#8217;s Independent reported that Anglo American Plc (AAL) and BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) may bid for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential bidder may be advised by JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the London-based newspaper said,
without citing anyone. Brazil&#8217;s Vale SA (VALE3) and Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA may also may bid, the newspaper said. The shares
rose to $75.22, the biggest gain in five weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter investor Audley Capital Advisors LLP said in July
that the Birmingham, Alabama-based company should explore a sale
because it lacked the leadership to take advantage of an
&#8220;unprecedented market opportunity&#8221; after coal prices jumped.
Walter appointed Walter J. Scheller III as Chief Executive
Officer on Sept. 12. He replaced interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard
and followed Keith Calder, who resigned as CEO in June after
telling the board he had differing opinions concerning
&#8220;management philosophy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand from steelmakers in China and flood-related supply
disruptions in Australia have driven prices for coal to record
highs. Low-volatility coking coal traded at $270 a ton,
Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy Publishing said in a report
last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Blyth, a spokeswoman for London-based Anglo, declined
to comment, as did Ruban Yogarajah, a spokesman for Melbourne-
based BHP, and Paul Blalock, a spokesman for Walter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal MA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vale doesn&#8217;t respond to market rumors, an official at the
company&#8217;s press office who asked not to be named citing Vale
policy, said in a telephone interview. No one at CSN returned
calls and e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Walter could allow Anglo to replace assets it might
lose in Chile, Dominic O&#8217;Kane, an analyst at Liberum Capital
Ltd. in London, said today in a note. Chilean copper producer
Codelco said yesterday it plans to exercise an option to buy as
much as 49 percent of Anglo&#8217;s unit in the South American
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were $20.5 billion of takeover offers for coal miners
valued at $100 million or more announced in the first nine
months of 2011, compared with $10.4 billion in the year-earlier
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Natural Resources Inc. bought rival U.S. coal
producer Massey Energy Co. in June for $7.1 billion. Peabody
Energy Corp. and ArcelorMittal agreed in August to pay A$4.8
billion ($4.9 billion) for Australia&#8217;s Macarthur Coal Ltd.,
which like Walter produces metallurgical coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter acquired Vancouver-based Western Coal Corp. in April
for C$5.3 billion ($5.2 billion). Calder was the former CEO of
Western Coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter operates mines in Alabama, West Virginia, British
Columbia and Wales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led
increases in the cost of protecting the debt of U.S. companies
on renewed concern that Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis will continue to
derail the economic recovery and after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
reported a drop in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs added 39 basis points
to 340 basis points, according to data provider CMA. Contracts
on JPMorgan climbed 8 to 142 and those tied to Morgan Stanley,
owner of the world&#8217;s largest retail brokerage, increased 29 to
387, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk rose from
the lowest level in three weeks after JPMorgan said revenue at
its investment-banking unit fell 13 percent from the second
quarter amid concern that Greece would default and the U.S.
economic recovery was stalling. That overshadowed a report that
applications for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S.
fell more than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the biggest U.S. banks tend to
swing with market sentiment, acting as a &#8220;bizarre bellwether,&#8221;
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit group at DoubleLine
Capital LP, which has $17.5 billion in assets under management,
said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. &#8220;I still don&#8217;t
get a sense that this is over yet in terms of the bank and
finance risk out there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Citigroup Inc. (C) increased 22 basis points to
250 basis points and contracts on General Electric Co. (GE)&#8217;s finance
arm General Electric Capital Corp. added 32 to 275. Those on San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) climbed 7 to 140.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Largest Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with today&#8217;s rise, contracts tied to the debt of the
six largest U.S. banks have decreased to 270 basis points from
360 basis points on Oct. 4, CMA data show, as European leaders
signaled progress in stemming the region&#8217;s debt crisis and
investor concern eased that bank balance sheets would be
infected by sovereign defaults. That&#8217;s equivalent to an average
of $270,000 to protect $10 million of debt for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan swaps have dropped from 185 and Morgan Stanley (MS)
credit swaps declined from 650 basis points during the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said third-quarter earnings fell to about $3.1
billion, or 73 cents a share, not including a 29 cents
accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on the same basis a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today. Net income was
$4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with the average per-
share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92 cents in a survey of
30 analysts by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company Risk Gauge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 132.6 basis points at 4:56 p.m. New York time,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, snapped two days of
declines after dropping from 150.1 on Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence in company creditworthiness dropped
even as applications for unemployment insurance payments
decreased 1,000 in the week ended Oct. 8 to 404,000 Labor
Department figures showed. Economists forecast 405,000 claims,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Oct 13, 2011  4:48 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-13/jpmorgan-earnings-beat-estimates.html"><headline>JPMorgan&#8217;s Profits Decline 33%</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 4.8 percent in New York
trading after the company reported that profit declined on a
slump in investment banking and trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan dropped $1.60 to $31.60 at 4:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter earnings at the New York-
based lender fell to about $3.1 billion, or 73 cents a share,
not including a 29-cent accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on
the same basis a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the investment-banking unit slid 13 percent from
the second quarter as concern that Greece would default and U.S.
lawmakers would fail to raise the debt ceiling roiled markets.
The firm said the division will face similar market conditions
for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a lot of noise in this number,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets. &#8220;When you look
at the core number and back out the benefit of securities gains
and tax benefit, it&#8217;s starting to look like a mid-70 cent
number&#8221; for earnings per share, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared
with the average per-share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92
cents in a survey of 30 analysts by Bloomberg, the New York-
based company said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying Business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt-valuation accounting gain &#8220;does not relate to the
underlying operations of the company,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, 55, said in a statement. Dimon said on a conference
call with journalists that the after-tax effect of the
accounting change was about 60 percent of the total gain for the
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), estimated
JPMorgan would post $350 million in gains from the change in
debt valuation. U.S. accounting rules require the adjustment
when the value of a company&#8217;s debt declines, under the theory
that a profit would be realized if it were repurchased at a
discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter revenue declined 0.2 percent to $23.8 billion
from a year earlier. Fixed-income and equity-markets revenue
rose to $4.75 billion from $4.3 billion, driven by more than
$900 million in debt-valuation adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jes Staley, CEO of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, braced
investors last month for the drop in trading revenue from the
second quarter, when the company generated $5.5 billion from
that business. The investment bank&#8217;s staff dropped to 26,615 in
the third quarter from 27,716 in the second quarter, a decline
of 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposit Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total deposits surged 21 percent from a year earlier, to
$1.1 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s credit-card division, which posted losses for
all of 2009, generated almost 20 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s net
income for the quarter. The investment bank accounted for 38
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer consumers fell behind on their credit-card payments
in the third quarter. Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal
of future write-offs, fell to 2.9 percent from 4.6 percent in
the same quarter in 2010 and 3.0 percent in the second quarter.
Write-offs dropped to 4.7 percent from 8.9 percent the prior
year and 5.8 percent in the previous quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slower decline in delinquency rates explains why the
company reduced its loan-loss reserve by only $170 million,
Dimon said on a conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you look at delinquencies, low rates, first-time
delinquent, all that kind of stuff, they&#8217;re kind of mixed. It
could very well improve again, but it&#8217;s flattened out,&#8221; Dimon
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brennan Hawken at UBS Investment Research in New York was
expecting a reserve release closer to $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The worry is that they are seeing something in credit that
has caused them to stop releasing reserves,&#8221; Hawken said in an
interview. &#8220;That means there could be some trend going on that
has caused them to be cautious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail banking, which includes home loans and checking
accounts, earned $1.16 billion, compared with $383 million
during the second quarter and $716 million a year earlier. The
division benefited from a $370 million reduction in loan-loss
provisions to $1.03 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Interest Margin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has benefited from record low costs of
funding mortgages and other assets, faces a squeeze on its net
interest margin -- the difference between what it pays to borrow
money and what it gets for loans and on securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s margin narrowed to 2.66 percent from 2.72
percent the previous quarter and 3.01 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Trading overall in the third quarter is going to be
challenged amid dislocations both home and abroad,&#8221; Jason Goldberg, a senior bank analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;During the quarter, you saw
both a slowdown in investment-banking activity and more
challenging trading conditions amid a spike in volatility fueled
by concerns in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowing economic growth and heightened concern about
European sovereign debt have weighed on bank stocks all year.
The KBW Bank Index (BKX) had dropped 28 percent this year, and the
worst performer, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), is down 53 percent. A
jump in borrowing costs at some banks, including New York-based
Morgan Stanley, subsided last week as investors became more
optimistic that European Union policy makers will find a
solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the first of the major U.S. lenders to report
third-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, may report a
profit of $2.49 billion when it releases results on Oct. 17, and
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, will probably say it earned
$3.87 billion when it announces results the same day, the
surveys of analysts shows. Bank of America may report a profit
of $2.73 billion on Oct. 18. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, paring gains from
the best Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rally over seven days since
2009, amid lower earnings from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and concern
equities rose too much on optimism about Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks trimmed losses as chipmakers in the SP 500 added
1.9 percent and Yahoo! Inc. rose as much as 3.8 percent after
people with knowledge of the matter said KKR  Co. and
Blackstone Group LP are among firms considering bids for the
company. JPMorgan dropped 4.8 percent after reporting a 33
percent profit decline, excluding a $1.9 billion accounting
benefit, as investment banking and trading income slumped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 retreated 0.3 percent to 1,203.66 at 4 p.m. New
York time, paring its loss from 1.4 percent. It had rebounded
9.8 percent from a 13-month low on Oct. 3 through yesterday. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 40.72 points, or 0.4
percent, to 11,478.13 today. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed
0.6 percent, rallying a fourth straight day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to find a port in the storm,&#8221; Barry James, who
helps oversee $2.5 billion as president of James Investment
Research in Xenia, Ohio, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The
announcement today doesn&#8217;t make it any better for the banks. We
keep getting this back-and-forth in Europe. We&#8217;ve had a nice run
in stocks and people are taking a bit off the table.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 4.5 percent over the previous three days
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said European leaders
would do &#8220;everything necessary&#8221; to ensure banks have adequate
capital. The rebound had yet to bring the gauge out of a price
range where it&#8217;s traded for more than two months. The index has
fluctuated between 1,074.77 and 1,230.71 since Aug. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology shares in the SP 500 rose 1 percent. At 4:29
p.m., following the close of exchanges, Google Inc. (GOOG) added 5.4
percent and Nasdaq-100 Index futures climbed 1.3 percent after
the world&#8217;s most-popular search engine beat profit estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo added 1 percent to $15.93 during the regular trading
session. KKR and Blackstone may become part of a consortium that
would pool the financing needed for a bid, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the review is preliminary and
the firms may decide not to make an offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in a bottoming process,&#8221; Bruce McCain, who helps
oversee $22 billion as chief investment strategist at the
private-banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;The question becomes: Do I risk sitting on the
sidelines as this thing begins to take off on me?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harm to Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. equities followed European stocks lower as the
European Central Bank said the involvement of the private sector
in euro-area bailouts through enforced investor losses is a risk
to financial stability and would have &#8220;direct negative
effects&#8221; on the banking sector. Pacific Investment Management
Co. Chief Executive Officer Mohamed A. El-Erian said European
leaders are beginning to recognize the need for Greek
bondholders to take bigger losses than previously agreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no way to sugarcoat this,&#8221; Daniel Genter, who
oversees about $3.7 billion as president of RNC Genter Capital
Management in Los Angeles. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to take some pretty
severe medicine to solve Europe&#8217;s debt crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index (BKX) slumped 2.9 percent. JPMorgan fell 4.8
percent to $31.60 after revenue at its investment-banking unit
fell 13 percent from the second quarter as concern that Greece
would default and U.S. lawmakers would fail to raise the debt
ceiling roiled markets during the third quarter. The firm said
the division will face similar market conditions for the rest of
the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA, Citigroup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the largest U.S. lender by assets,
dropped 5.5 percent to $6.22. Citigroup Inc. (C) declined 5.3
percent to $27.64. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy declined 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average retreated 0.6 percent. FedEx Corp. (FDX) lost 1.7 percent to
$73.87. General Electric Co. (GE) decreased 1.1 percent to $16.22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat of a bear market is receding after the SP 500
rallied the most in 31 months, leaving the gauge about 1 percent
away from a level where two advances have stopped since August.
The measure climbed 1 percent yesterday. Gains were reduced in
the last hour of trading yesterday after the SP 500 climbed
past 1,220, just above levels reached on Sept. 16 and Aug. 31
when declines began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest prices relative to earnings since 2009 and a
shortage of better investment options have boosted equities,
according to David Spika, who helps oversee $14 billion as an
investment strategist at Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t going to take much good news to drive the
market higher,&#8221; Spika said yesterday in a telephone interview.
&#8220;You had 30-year Treasuries yielding less than 3 percent, 10-
year Treasuries yielding less than 2 percent, and stocks trading
at 11 times earnings. You have to believe that at some point
it&#8217;s not going to take much for investors to get back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) persuaded a
judge to throw out shareholders&#8217; claims that the investment
bank&#8217;s compensation system improperly rewarded employees for
taking risks that hurt the firm&#8217;s stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock concluded
yesterday that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board acted properly in setting
up a pay plan for the fifth-biggest U.S. bank. The judge
dismissed a consolidated investor lawsuit claiming the plan
wrongly awarded billions of dollars in bonuses to executives and
employees, including Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, even as the
firm&#8217;s market value declined by $50 billion since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware law &#8220;provides corporate directors and officers
with broad discretion to act as they find appropriate in the
conduct of corporate affairs&#8221; and &#8220;in the exercise of their
business judgment on behalf of the corporation,&#8221; Glasscock
wrote in a 67-page opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007,
faced criticism from politicians and labor unions for its
compensation practices after getting taxpayer aid during the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the New York-based company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first
six months of this year, according to its website. That was 9
percent less than in the same period in 2010 as revenue tumbled
11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Limited Value&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The complaint fails to present facts that demonstrate
that the work done by Goldman&#8217;s 31,000 employees was of such
limited value to the corporation that no reasonable person in
the directors&#8217; position would have approved their levels of
compensation,&#8221; Glasscock said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, the operator of Philadelphia&#8217;s bus and rail network
and a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argued that the firm&#8217;s board
should be held accountable for not properly overseeing the
compensation system and employees&#8217; wrongful conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Septa&#8217;s lawyers said in court filings that Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year, while the firm settled U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission claims that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$550 Million Penalty &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million, the largest
penalty ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to
resolve claims that marketing materials about the investments
had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007 as the U.S.
housing market faltered, without disclosing that a hedge fund
helped pick the underlying securities and then bet against the
investment vehicles, the SEC said in the suit Goldman settled.
The bank didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing as part of the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the Delaware ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, a New York judge threw out another pension
fund&#8217;s suit that challenged Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation plan
for providing millions of dollars in bonuses to executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Court Justice Bernard J. Fried
dismissed suits filed by the Security Police  Fire
Professionals of America Retirement Fund and investor Judith A.
Miller on Sept. 21, according to court dockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delaware case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Shareholder Litigation, CA5215, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc. (EBAY)&#8217;s PayPal business will
expand its partnership with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to let consumers buy
virtual goods over its game consoles, part of an effort to lure
more users to its payment products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal customers will be able to purchase goods over
Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360 game consoles, the company said today at
EBay&#8217;s developer conference in San Francisco. PayPal expects
$4.7 billion in payment volume for digital goods this year,
compared with $3.4 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s symbolic of us moving beyond just the browser as a
payment experience,&#8221; Carey Kolaja, senior director of emerging
opportunities at PayPal, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay, based in San Jose, California, is vying for a share
of a video game industry that will generate about $30 billion in
software sales worldwide this year, more than half of that
through consoles, said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W.
Baird  Co. in San Francisco. Content purchases on TVs and game
consoles are a &#8220;huge&#8221; opportunity if PayPal can integrate the
technology in a way that is simple to use, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal also will provide new ways to pay for content with
partners such as the Financial Times and News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Wall
Street Journal, and will team up with Blizzard Entertainment
Inc. in gaming and Spotify Ltd. in digital music, the company
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier Payment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing customers to log in and pay with a user name and
password rather than interrupting a game to enter credit card
information is something PayPal has that other companies don&#8217;t,
said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los
Angeles. With more than 100 million users, the company will
attract game junkies who want to buy virtual goods, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Much of the potential for growth for PayPal beyond the
Web has to do with its ability to become the preferred payment
choice for in-product purchases such as Zynga&#8217;s games --
FarmVille, CityVille,&#8221; where more than 90 percent of revenue
came from virtual goods, Luria said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it moves more services from personal computers to
devices including mobile phones and tablet computers, PayPal
could expand revenue 10-fold to more than $32 billion from its
shift into advertising, said Richard Crone, head of research
firm Crone Consulting LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal has done an independent study on the benefits of
expanding into commerce over televisions, and will announce the
results later this year, the company said. More conceptual
ideas, such as paying for food in a car before reaching a drive-
through window, or adding payment options to navigation systems
are possibilities that will depend on consumer demand, Kolaja
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-commerce Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re creating the tech stack and the platform to go onto
any device, whatever the market may dictate at a given time,&#8221;
Kolaja said. &#8220;Is &#8217;t-commerce&#8217; going to be a growth area in the
future? I tend to think it will,&#8221; she said, referring to paying
for products over televisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s announcement is an extension of PayPal&#8217;s effort to
make payments easier in a number of mediums. For local
retailers, the company is rolling out products that will let
consumers pay through a mobile phone application, by swiping a
card or by entering a name and PIN number at the point of sale
in a store, said Sara Gorman, a PayPal spokeswoman. The company
will test the products with a &#8220;major&#8221; retailer by the end of
this year and introduce them more extensively in 2012, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PayPal&#8217;s system would be simpler to use in television
commerce than entering credit card information, competing with
companies such as Google Inc., the largest Internet search
company, and Visa Inc. (V), the biggest payments network, won&#8217;t be
easy, Luria said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not that much of a stretch to be able to do that on
the TV,&#8221; Luria said. &#8220;You&#8217;re starting to see that
functionality come. PayPal isn&#8217;t going to be the only one who
does it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Charles Mead and John Tucker" date="Oct 13, 2011 12:40 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-13/volcker-rule-may-mostly-go-up-in-smoke-goldman-s-levitt-says.html"><headline>Volcker Rule May Mostly &#8216;Go Up in Smoke,&#8217; Goldman&#8217;s Levitt Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule, which would bar
banks from trading for their own accounts, is likely to be
postponed and weakened amid lobbyists&#8217; resistance, said former
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, who
advises Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street &#8220;will be doing all it can to delay this until
they hope there&#8217;s a Republican president and a Republican
Senate,&#8221; Levitt said in a radio interview on &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. &#8220;This is going
to be a long slog, and much of that rule that you see today is
going to go up in smoke.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A version of the rule, released by regulators this week,
&#8220;is much sterner, much more rigorous than most people
expected,&#8221; Levitt said. It will likely prompt firms to consider
giving up their status as bank holding companies to avoid its
costs, he said, without naming specific lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) were the biggest U.S.
securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, was
included in last year&#8217;s Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul to rein
in risky trading that helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The
central bank, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency worked with the SEC on a draft
issued this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its current form, the regulation would impose costs on
lenders and drive capital to non-bank market makers, said David Hilder, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP, in a note
to clients earlier this week, in which he also predicted that
firms may consider giving up their bank status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt, a Democrat appointed to the SEC by former President
Bill Clinton, is also on the board of Bloomberg LP, the parent
company of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank Saint Petersburg rose for a
sixth day, its longest winning streak in more than a month after
the Russian lender was upgraded by JPMorgan Chase  Co. to
&#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; The share price may climb 125
percent from current levels, JPMorgan said in an e-mailed note
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock rose as much as 14 percent and closed up 7.7
percent at 94.10 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Oct 13, 2011 11:08 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-13/jpmorgan-investment-bank-pay-pool-falls-to-289-611-per-person.html"><headline>JPMorgan&#8217;s Investment Bank Cut Workforce, Compensation Costs Last Quarter</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reduced its
investment-bank workforce by almost 4 percent in the third
quarter and cut employee compensation costs 28 percent as the 
division grappled with fallout from the European debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank had 1,101 fewer employees at the end of
September than three months earlier and will continue to shrink
its staff of 26,615, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55,
told reporters on a conference call after releasing third-
quarter earnings today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bank isn&#8217;t planning layoffs, &#8220;we always trim our
sails,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see the headcount coming down as
some of these systems get rolled off to reduce costs.&#8221; The firm
will be &#8220;squeezing a little bit here and squeezing a little bit
there&#8221; to trim the workforce by about 1,000 additional people,
or &#8220;maybe a little bit more&#8221; in the next 18 months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jes Staley, CEO of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, braced
investors last month for a drop in third-quarter revenue as the
European debt crisis roiled markets, and the bank today said it
may face similar challenges in the year&#8217;s final months. A pay
reduction won&#8217;t likely drive out top performers amid such a
difficult environment, said Michael Holland, founder and
chairman of New York-based investment firm Holland  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When things get better they will participate,&#8221; Holland
said in an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; &#8220;When things are crummy, as they
have been for the last number of quarters, they participate in
the downside as well. A number of the star performers who are
getting paid less will stick around, and I think it&#8217;s exactly
the right way to run the business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay Per Employee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank generated a $1.64 billion profit in the
third quarter, compared with $2.06 billion in the prior three
months, according to figures posted today on the New York-based
company&#8217;s website. Revenue at the unit fell 13 percent from the
second quarter to $6.37 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first three quarters, the unit set aside $7.71
billion, or 2 percent less than a year earlier, even as it
generated 10 percent more revenue. The expense, which includes
salaries, bonuses and benefits, was enough to give each of the
division&#8217;s employees $289,611. For the same period last year,
the unit set aside $7.88 billion to pay traders, dealmakers and
other personnel, or $298,866 for each of the 26,373 people on
staff as of Sept. 30, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation costs fell to $1.85 billion in the third
quarter, compared with $2.56 billion in the second quarter.
Average compensation per employee dropped to $69,510 from
$92,510, the bank said. Companywide, staff expanded 3 percent to
256,663. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Revenue Spent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley set aside 35 percent of the division&#8217;s revenue for
pay in the first nine months, down from 37 percent in the same
period a year earlier, excluding a 2010 U.K. bonus tax,
according to today&#8217;s disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees from investment banking tumbled 46 percent to $1.04
billion in the third quarter, compared with the previous three
months. About $2 trillion in global corporate bond issues came
to market in the first half before volume plummeted to $553.3
billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market-related businesses clearly experienced
pressure from the volatility, reduced volumes and mark-to-market
pressures&#8221; amid the quarter&#8217;s market tumoil, Chief Financial
Officer Doug Braunstein told reporters on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s patent-infringement
jury award against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may be lowered to $26.3
million from $70 million, a federal judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff in San Diego said at a
hearing yesterday that she will review more legal arguments
before issuing a ruling. Huff said she agreed with the world&#8217;s
largest software maker that the jury&#8217;s July 29 award wasn&#8217;t
supported by evidence presented during a 10-day trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said she disagreed with how an expert witness for
Alcatel-Lucent calculated damages and told lawyers $26.3 million
is &#8220;a fair damages figure that is not excessive based on the
totality of the evidence.&#8221; She asked attorneys on both sides to
file additional legal arguments on her finding by the&#160;end of the
month before she makes her decision final. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infringed patent relates to technology used in
Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook program and two other applications.
Microsoft asked the judge to reduce the award to no more than $5
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft attorney Roger Denning told the judge that
Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s formula for computing damages didn&#8217;t comply
with guidelines set by Huff and appellate court rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those went ignored,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lucent put its head down
and bullied through with its $70 million figure ignoring the
guidance that was given.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s lawyers argued there was more than
sufficient evidence to support the jury&#8217;s verdict and that the
verdict should be respected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;High&#8217; Standard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the court is going to take the judgment out of the
jury&#8217;s hands the standard is extraordinarily high,&#8221; said
company attorney Luke Dauchot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Alcatel-Lucent also asked Huff to award $38.3
million in prejudgment interest on top of the jury&#8217;s $70 million
award. Alcatel-Lucent, France&#8217;s largest maker of
telecommunications equipment, also has been awarded $450,479 in
trial costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology at issue, called the &#8220;Day patent,&#8221; was
described in court during the trial as involving a touch-screen
form entry. Microsoft argued the patent relates to a simple
&#8220;date-picker&#8221; function and has nothing to do with e-mail, the
most popular function on Outlook. Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent
described the technology as a tool that &#8220;plays a central role
in the entire operation&#8221; of Outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different jury in San Diego in 2008 found that Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded
$358 million in damages. An appeals court, upholding the
infringement verdict, overturned the damages award, finding the
calculation lacked sufficient evidentiary support. The case was
sent back for retrial on damages only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., 07-
cv-02000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(San Diego). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent today rose as much as 11 percent to 2.31
euros in Paris trading after the Financial Times reported,
without saying how it got the information, that the company
agreed to sell its corporate call-center business. Alcatel-
Lucent spokesman Simon Poulter declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), which rose to a record today, may keep climbing to $200
or more, according to analysts who are boosting their price
targets for the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of the 19 analysts with price targets surveyed by
Bloomberg estimate IBM will rise to at least $200, 7.1 percent
above yesterday&#8217;s close, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Three analysts increased their price targets to $200
or more this week, ahead of IBM&#8217;s Oct. 17 earnings announcement,
and Macquarie Capital began coverage with a $210 target today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM&#8217;s high recurring revenue business model has
&#8216;Goldilocks&#8217; characteristics, allowing IBM to perform well in a
good or bad macro environment,&#8221; said Louis Miscioscia, an
analyst for Collins Stewart, who raised his price target to $210
today and has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 60, IBM sold
off its personal computer business and focused on software and
services, helping lift per-share profit for more than 30
straight quarters. Now the world&#8217;s largest computer-services
provider, IBM has gained more than 80 percent since Palmisano
took over, including 30 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been drawn by &#8220;a very stable earnings
stream,&#8221; said David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus  Co., who has
price target of $210 for IBM. &#8220;If revenues start to come under
pressure for economic reasons, there are several levers at their
disposal that they can exercise to support earnings
expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 2 percent to $190.53
at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zijin Mining Group Co. has sold
bonds convertible into shares of Glencore International Plc, the
world&#8217;s largest publicly traded commodities supplier, according
to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds were sold at 128.25 percent of face value, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
process was private. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managed the sale,
according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zijin Mining, China&#8217;s biggest gold miner by market value,
acquired the bonds ahead of Glencore&#8217;s May initial public
offering, which ended its more than three decades as a closely
held partnership. Glencore, which sold $10 billion of shares in
the biggest IPO this year, has dropped 20 percent since going
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2009 Glencore had sold $2.2 billion of
convertible 5 percent bonds, its first such offering, saying the
debt could be exchanged for shares in the event of an IPO. Zijin
Mining invested in those bonds together with BlackRock Inc. (BLK),
Government of Singapore Investment Corp. and First Reserve Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zijin was offering the $175 million of December 2014 bonds
at 128.25 percent to 130.25 percent of face value, plus accrued
interest, according to the term sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Reserve, a private equity firm, sold $800 million of
the bonds last month at $135,313.89 for each $100,000 of
principal amount, and used the proceeds to buy Glencore common
stock. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Morgan Stanley managed First
Reserve&#8217;s transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call made to the Zijin&#8217;s office outside of regular
business hours wasn&#8217;t answered. Simon Buerk, a spokesman for
Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore dropped 3 percent to 422.5 pence at the close of
London trading, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 2.8
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group
LLC co-founder whom prosecutors called &#8220;the modern face of
illegal insider trading,&#8221; was sentenced to 11 years in prison,
one of the longest terms ever for insider trading, though less
than half of the maximum sought by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, is the central figure in what U.S.
investigators called the largest hedge fund insider trading case
in U.S. history. The probe, which leveraged the widespread use
of FBI wiretaps for the first time in such an inquiry, led to
convictions of more than two dozen people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell sentenced Rajaratnam
yesterday. Holwell, who agreed with prosecutors that Rajaratnam
led the scheme and that he obstructed a Securities and Exchange
Commission probe, pointed to Rajaratnam&#8217;s philanthropy and
health in giving him less time than prosecutors had sought.
According to filings unsealed yesterday, Rajaratnam suffered a
&#8220;severe cryptogenic stroke&#8221; in 2007, and, also has kidney
disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and
sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a lighter sentence than anticipated,&#8221; said
Anthony Sabino, a professor at St. John&#8217;s University in New
York, pointing to the U.S. request for as many as 24 1/2 years.
Sabino said the judge still sent a message with the 11-year
term. &#8220;Holwell is clearly achieving a crucial goal here,&#160;that
is, telling Wall Street that this kind of criminality will not
be tolerated, and will be severely punished.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holwell denied Rajaratnam&#8217;s request to remain free on bail
while he appeals his conviction, and told him to surrender on
Nov. 28. The judge said he would recommend sending him to the
medical center at the federal correctional complex in Butner,
North Carolina. Bernard Madoff, the convicted Ponzi scheme
mastermind, is serving a 150-year term at the facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge also ordered Rajaratnam to forfeit $53.8 million
and sentenced him to two years of supervised release after his
prison term is up. Prosecutors said he made more than $72
million by using illegal tips to trade in stocks of companies
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Intel Corp. (INTC), Google Inc. (GOOG),
ATI Technologies Inc. and Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam said nothing to reporters as he left the
courthouse and got into a black sport-utility vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no parole in the federal prison system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Investor Lawsuit Over Pay Plan Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. persuaded a judge to throw out
shareholders&#8217; claims that the investment bank&#8217;s compensation
system improperly rewarded employees for taking risks that hurt
the firm&#8217;s stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock concluded Oct.
12 that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board acted properly in setting up a pay
plan for the fifth-biggest U.S. bank. The judge dismissed a
consolidated investor lawsuit claiming the plan wrongly awarded
billions of dollars in bonuses to executives and employees,
including Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, even as the firm&#8217;s market
value declined by $50 billion since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware law &#8220;provides corporate directors and officers
with broad discretion to act as they find appropriate in the
conduct of corporate affairs&#8221; and &#8220;in the exercise of their
business judgment on behalf of the corporation,&#8221; Glasscock
wrote in a 67-page opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007,
faced criticism from politicians and labor unions for its
compensation practices after getting taxpayer aid during the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, the operator of Philadelphia&#8217;s bus and rail network
and a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argued that the firm&#8217;s board
should be held accountable for not properly overseeing the
compensation system and employees&#8217; wrongful conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Septa&#8217;s lawyers said in court filings that Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year, while the firm settled U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission claims that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million, the largest
penalty ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to
resolve claims that marketing materials about the investments
had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; The bank didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing
as part of the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the Delaware ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delaware case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
Shareholder Litigation, CA5215, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford Judge Says Receiver May Need to Wind Down Search &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s court-appointed receiver may need to
stop searching for a secret &#8220;pot of gold&#8221; and pay defrauded
investors from the assets he has recovered so far, the judge
overseeing the case said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m concerned the receiver is expending resources that
could otherwise be distributed to investors trying to track down
missing resources,&#8221; U.S. District Judge David Godbey said
during a court hearing yesterday in Dallas for dozens of
Stanford-related civil cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission in February 2009 on claims he swindled investors of
more than $7 billion through allegedly bogus certificates of
deposit at his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we knew where it was and were able to go get it, we
would&#8217;ve,&#8221; SEC attorney David Reece told Godbey, referring to
Stanford&#8217;s missing billions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the U.S. Justice Department has already checked and
there&#8217;s no pot of gold, then the receiver can stand down,&#8221;
Godbey told lawyers for the receiver and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godbey told lawyers in Dallas yesterday he&#8217;s concerned that
receiver Ralph Janvey is duplicating efforts by U.S.
prosecutors, who are also tracking Stanford&#8217;s assets overseas.
The Justice Department has won administrative freezes on more
than $300 million in Stanford-related bank accounts in
Switzerland and the U.K. These accounts are beyond Janvey&#8217;s
control and may represent the receivership&#8217;s largest category of
recoverable assets, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stanford receivership has about $100 million in
unrestricted cash on hand, Kevin Sadler, Janvey&#8217;s lead lawyer,
told Godbey yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials and Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Brocade Chief Reyes Conviction for Backdating Upheld &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Reyes, the former chief executive officer of Brocade
Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD), lost a bid to reverse his
conviction for backdating employee stock-option grants and
hiding the practice from auditors and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco yesterday upheld
the 18-month prison sentence and $15 million fine imposed after
his second criminal trial. Reyes&#8217;s first conviction was thrown
out by the same appeals court in 2009 because of prosecutorial
misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-judge appeals panel said that it found no
misconduct in the second trial and that there was sufficient
evidence that the backdating was material to investors. Reyes,
49, argued that prosecutors falsely alleged that he granted
himself backdated stock options and made other mistakes at
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth Waxman, Reyes&#8217;s attorney, didn&#8217;t immediately return a
message seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Reyes was the first chief executive convicted by a
jury in a broad government crackdown on options backdating.
Hiding the backdated stock grants inflated the San Jose,
California-based company&#8217;s shares because the costs associated
with the grants weren&#8217;t reported to shareholders or regulators,
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brocade investors lost as much as $197.8 million in 2005
when they sold shares that had fallen in value after the
practice was uncovered and the company restated financial
results, prosecutors said in court filings. The company paid a
$7 million fine to resolve a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit over backdating and $160 million to settle
securities-fraud claims by shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reyes was ousted from Brocade, a maker of switches for
data-storage systems, in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Reyes, 10-10323, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, Nortel Lose Appeal Over $3.5 Billion Pension Shortfall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administrators of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and
Nortel Networks Corp. lost a bid to overturn a court order
forcing them to pay 2.25 billion pounds ($3.5 billion) into
underfunded pensions plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London appeals court ruled in favor of the U.K. Pensions
Regulator, which is seeking 148 million pounds from Lehman and
2.1 billion pounds from Nortel to meet the shortfall. The case
hinged on whether employee pensions take priority over creditors
when a company collapses into administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be extraordinary if the onset of insolvency were
to thwart a process already under way, or even only
contemplated, on the part of the Pensions Regulator,&#8221; Justice
Timothy Lloyd said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008, and the U.K. unit is being liquidated in London.
Nortel and affiliates filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and
Canada in January 2009 while its U.K. operations were placed in
administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a December ruling appealed by the companies, Judge
Michael Briggs said Lehman and Nortel&#8217;s administrators would
have to find money to ensure they could meet their obligations
to a combined 43,000 members of their pension plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is likely to be appealed to the U.K. Supreme
Court, said Nick Moser, an insolvency lawyer in the London
office of Taylor Wessing LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts and Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinault&#8217;s Artemis to Settle AIG Suit for $62.5 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French billionaire Francois Pinault&#8217;s holding company
Artemis SA agreed to pay American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s
SunAmerica unit $62.5 million to settle a lawsuit over an
investment in a California insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG Retirement Services, as SunAmerica is now known, and
Artemis on Oct. 12 filed a request for U.S. District Judge John
Walter in Los Angeles to approve the settlement, The other
defendants in the case, Credit Lyonnais SA and MAAF Assurances
SA, already settled with AIG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Artemis settlement, AIG&#8217;s total recovery from the
lawsuit is $236.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very pleased to have resolved this matter
amicably,&#8221; Mark Herr, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, said
yesterday in a phone interview. The case was scheduled for trial
Oct. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AIG unit sued a group of French companies including
Artemis in 2005, alleging that it was defrauded when it bought a
33 percent stake in New California Holdings Inc. because it
didn&#8217;t know that the French owners, a group led by MAAF
Assurances, were a front for Credit Lyonnais. At the time, the
French bank couldn&#8217;t own an insurer under U.S. law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinault&#8217;s holding company, whose other investments include
auction house Christie&#8217;s International and retailer and luxury-
goods maker PPR SA, is still a defendant in a lawsuit by the
California Insurance Commissioner over the company&#8217;s role in the
Executive Life transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Salpeter, a lawyer representing Artemis, didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls seeking comment on the AIG settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is AIG Retirement Services v. Altus Finance,
05-1035, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth Reaches Settlement in Natural Gas Class Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth Advisors LLC, the hedge fund that collapsed in
2006 after losing $6.6 billion on natural gas trades,
tentatively settled a class-action lawsuit in which it was
accused of market manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin in Manhattan said
in an order Oct. 5 that the parties in the case had reached an
agreement. In August 2009, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission announced that Greenwich, Connecticut-based Amaranth
paid $7.5 million to settle allegations that the hedge fund
tried to manipulate natural gas futures three years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a
$30 million civil penalty against Amaranth trader Brian Hunter,
who was accused of manipulating the natural gas market in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter&#8217;s attorney, Michael Kim, didn&#8217;t return calls seeking
comment. Chris Lovell, an attorney for the plaintiffs at Lovell
Stewart Halebian LLP in New York, and Stephen Senderowitz, a
lawyer for Amaranth at Winston  Strawn LLP in Chicago, declined
to comment. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Nov. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Amaranth Natural Gas Commodities
Litigation, 07-06377, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noven Files Patent Suit Against Watson Over Daytrana Copy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co.&#8217;s Noven Pharmaceuticals unit
sued Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) to prevent it from selling a
generic version of Daytrana, a skin patch for children with
attention deficit disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval to sell a copy of Daytrana, according to the complaint
filed yesterday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Miami-
based Noven said the Watson version would infringe two patents
and seeks a court order to prevent sales until the patents
expire in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under federal drug law, the filing of the lawsuit prevents
the FDA from granting Watson final approval for 30 months unless
a court rules in the generic-drug maker&#8217;s favor before then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are challenging the patents on the product,&#8221; said
Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson, in a phone interview. He declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Noven Pharmaceuticals v. Watson Laboratories,
U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clifford Chance Boosts New York Practice With Three Hires &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifford Chance LLP hired former Nixon Peabody partner
Edward O&#8217;Callaghan and former prosecutors David Raskin and
Christopher Morvillo in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moves will help Clifford Chance strengthen its white
collar criminal defense, regulatory enforcement and government
investigations group, the firm said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a rare occurrence when three litigators the caliber
of David, Chris and Ed agree to move from different
organizations to form, and join, a terrific team,&#8221; David
DiBari, head of Clifford Chance&#8217;s U.S. Litigation  Dispute
Resolution practice, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three new hires are former federal prosecutors.
O&#8217;Callaghan, 42, led Nixon Peabody&#8217;s government investigations
and white-collar defense group. Morvillo, 47, is a partner at
the New York white-collar firm Morvillo, Abramowitz, Grand,
Iason, Anello  Bohrer and the son of name partner Robert
Morvillo. Raskin, 47, joins Clifford from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;European investment banks may post a
decline of about 28 percent in revenue for the third quarter of
this year mainly due to &#8220;weak market conditions,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities
trading may have dropped 31 percent, while equities fell 30
percent, Goldman Sachs analysts including London-based Jernej Omahen said in a report to clients yesterday. Goldman Sachs also
cut its 2011 earnings estimates for UBS AG (UBSN), Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) by 19 percent, 12 percent and 17 percent
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Squeezed by a tough revenue environment and regulatory
change, European investment banks are struggling to deliver
returns above their costs of equity,&#8221; the analysts said.
&#8220;Capital markets have been weak in third quarter 2011,
affecting investment banks in Europe and in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said yesterday that revenue at its
investment-banking unit slid 13 percent from the second quarter,
as concern that Greece would default and U.S. lawmakers would
fail to raise the debt-ceiling roiled markets. The firm said the
division will face similar market conditions for the rest of the
year. Deutsche Bank scrapped its profit forecast this month and
announced 500 job cuts and further writedowns of Greek bond
holdings amid a &#8220;significant and unabated slowdown in client
activity&#8221; in the wake of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said its preferred European investment bank
is UBS as Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank moves to curb its
investment banking activities. The firm has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on
UBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nina Mehta" date="Oct 17, 2011 11:54 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-17/chi-x-global-says-goldman-sachs-getco-quantlab-acquire-stakes.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Buys Stake in Chi-X Global Equity Venue With Morgan Stanley</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Getco LLC,
Morgan Stanley and two other firms bought equal stakes in Chi-X
Global Holdings LLC, the operator of equity markets in Canada
and Japan owned by Instinet Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Quantlab Group LP also made
investments, according to a statement issued by Instinet. No
prices were disclosed. New York-based Instinet, a unit of Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) in Tokyo, remains majority owner of Chi-X, Tal Cohen, its chief executive officer, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers have become owners of exchanges and alternative
trading venues to get more say in how the markets are run and
ensure they remain competitive with bigger rivals. Exchanges are
seeking combinations to build scale and process more
transactions on a single trading technology infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having major order-flow providers as equity partners
gives trading venues an important competitive edge,&#8221; Justin Schack, managing director for market structure analysis at New
York-based Rosenblatt Securities Inc., wrote in an e-mail.
&#8220;Firms that own part of an exchange or alternative market have
an incentive to favor that venue, within the bounds of best-
execution obligations and regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return, brokers get more influence over pricing, the
rules that define the market and new products, Shack said. They
also get the &#8220;opportunity to realize capital gains should the
venue go public or be sold,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getco in Chicago and Houston-based Quantlab are proprietary
trading firms that buy and sell stocks and financial products
with their own money. Bank of America in Charlotte, North
Carolina, and New York-based Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
are among the biggest banks trading U.S. equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi-X Japan accounted for 2.7 percent of the Nikkei 225
Stock Average by value traded in September, according to the
company. Chi-X Canada had 10 percent of Canadian equities in the
third quarter, data from the Investment Industry Regulatory
Organization of Canada shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Technology Partners LP and FTP Securities LLC
advised Instinet and Chi-X Global on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi-X Global is considering an equity participation program
that could give its owners varying stakes in the company based
on their supply of orders to its markets, Cohen said. The five
brokers made equal capital investments in Chi-X Global and no
program offering incentives is currently in place, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will look at different strategies to broaden
ownership,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll definitely consider a strategy
where we provide ownership stakes for participation. That&#8217;s
separate from the deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European System &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a plan could work similarly to one by Chi-X Europe
Ltd., which is separate from Chi-X Global, Cohen said. The
European market is owned by Instinet and more than a dozen
brokers including Getco, Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs and Bank
of America. That venue runs Europe&#8217;s largest alternative trading
system and agreed in February to be bought by Bats Global
Markets Inc. in Lenexa, Kansas. The deal is expected to close in
the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chi-X Europe is a good example,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;There was
an initial capital investment and then over time firms increased
their stakes or more firms came on board through those types of
programs. It helped build the market and has proven to be
successful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Mergers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse AG in Frankfurt said in February it would
acquire NYSE Euronext (NYX), operator of the New York Stock Exchange,
for $9.53 billion. The value of that agreement has plummeted by
26 percent. Sydney-based ASX Ltd. (ASX)&#8217;s merger agreement with
Singapore Exchange Ltd. and London Stock Exchange Group Plc&#8217;s
combination with TMX Group Inc. (X) in Toronto fell through as
shareholders balked or regulators nixed the cross-border deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Stock Exchange and other markets used to be
membership-based entities owned by the brokerage firms that
traded there. NYSE went public in 2006 by purchasing Chicago-
based Archipelago Holdings Inc. Nasdaq Stock Market acquired
electronic rivals and later the Philadelphia and Boston
exchanges. As exchanges converted members into shareholders and
regulators changed trading rules, brokers began to form
competing markets or take stakes in them to reduce the fees they
pay for executions and make sure their needs are met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bats Global Markets, Chi-X Europe and Jersey City, New
Jersey-based Direct Edge Holdings LLC, which operates two U.S.
stock markets, have sold stakes to groups of brokers that could
send them orders. Bats is owned in part by Bank of America,
Tradebot Systems Inc. and Getco. Direct Edge is owned by the
International Securities Exchange, Goldman Sachs, Citadel LLC
and Knight Capital Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas Ambitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi-X Global plans to extend its holdings internationally
with the help of new owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to expand into markets principally in Asia and
Latin America and bring regulatory reform and technological
competition to the benefit of issuers and investors,&#8221; Cohen
said. While individual markets haven&#8217;t yet been discussed, the
brokerage investors in Chi-X Global &#8220;see the opportunity to
open up markets,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi-X Global is already expanding its businesses. It&#8217;s
preparing to introduce Chi-X Australia, a market designed to
compete with Sydney-based ASX&#8217;s Australian stock exchange on Oct.
31. The company also operates Chi-East, a joint venture with the
Singapore Exchange that runs a dark pool for Japanese, Hong Kong
and Singapore securities. Dark pools are private venues that
don&#8217;t display prices in advance. Australian securities will be
added to the platform in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system called Chi-FX will start in Brazil early next year.
That market will provide quotes in domestic equities in
different currencies and is a venture with Sao Paulo-based
BMFBovespa SA (BVMF3), Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sang Lee, managing partner at Boston-based Aite Group LLC,
said in a phone interview that selling stakes to brokers has
been successful in drawing volume to new venues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brokers invest in many types of ventures,&#8221; Lee said of
the Chi-X Global deal. &#8220;They&#8217;ll hedge their bets. But if this
succeeds, they&#8217;ll certainly have a strong say in determining how
the market structure changes happen and how they benefit from
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, reported third-
quarter sales that missed analysts&#8217; estimates on slowing revenue
growth at its software, hardware and services businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales climbed 7.8 percent to $26.2 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. Analysts predicted
$26.3 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is focusing on areas
such as business analytics, emerging markets and cloud computing
to boost sales amid sluggish economic expansion. The U.S.
economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter
following a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months, the
weakest performance in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because they didn&#8217;t beat, the stock&#8217;s going to trade
down; the expectation is pretty high for this name,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. A slowdown in
hardware revenue growth is occurring &#8220;sooner than I expected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second time in nine quarters that IBM missed
sales estimates. Hardware sales growth slowed to 4 percent from
17 percent in the second quarter. Sales growth at IBM&#8217;s services
business slowed to 8 percent from 10 percent, while revenue
expansion at its software unit decelerated to 13 percent from 17
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Last Week &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell as much as 4.1 percent to $179.02 in extended
trading after closing at $186.59 in New York today. It has risen
27 percent this year as of the close of regular trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock reached a record of $190.53 on Oct. 14, and at
least three analysts revised their price estimates to $200 a
share or higher. In September, IBM passed Microsoft in market
value based on closing prices for the first time since 1996
before the companies switched back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a name that you&#8217;re expecting in this environment
to perform very strong,&#8221; said Brad Zelnick, a Macquarie Capital
USA analyst who added coverage of IBM last week. &#8220;Any
deceleration in signings or any significant drain on backlog is
going to send shares down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contract signings for services, which make up about 60
percent of IBM revenue, were $12.3 billion, compared with $14.3
billion in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects Software &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company projects software will make up half of total
profit in 2015. Analytics software, which helps businesses
predict trends, is expected to draw $16 billion in sales by
2015, while cloud computing will draw $7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smarter Planet, Palmisano&#8217;s initiative to provide digital
monitoring of anything from roads to hospitals to make them more
efficient, will grow to a $10 billion business, the company has
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, climbed 19 percent last quarter. Sales from the regions
will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the company
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growth market performance was terrific across all
segments,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
call with analysts and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth
in these markets, and it led revenue growth in all business
segments, Loughridge said. IBM opened up 80 new branches, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Footprint&#8217; Important &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re very ahead of where the big markets will be in a
few years, and it&#8217;s very important for them to have a footprint
there,&#8221; Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities
USA, said in an interview. He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano has said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions between 2010 and 2015. So far the company has spent
about $3 billion in acquisitions related to cloud computing,
said Steven Tomasco, an IBM spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of IBM&#8217;s global position and broad set of computer
services, it is &#8220;about as close as you can get to a technology
index fund,&#8221; Maguire said. &#8220;They&#8217;re a bellwether for the rest
of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accenture Plc and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which compete with IBM in
selling services to technology companies, both benefited from
increased spending by business clients in their most recent
quarters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader
Damien Bombell, who left when the bank closed a unit that bet on
commodities last year, started a hedge fund to invest in metals,
grains and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Strand Global Macro Fund began investing this year with
money provided by Bombell and his partners, he said in a
telephone interview. The fund plans to start trading with
capital from outside clients in January, and is seeking to have
at least $200 million under management, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reason why people should invest in strategies like
mine is that we are not in an investing environment anymore,&#8221;
he said in an Oct. 7 interview. &#8220;For the next five to 10 years,
we are likely to be in a very disjointed market place, where
politicians lurch from one crisis to another. You need tactical
traders and people who are mentally flexible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bombell, 39, left JPMorgan in November 2010 after the New
York-based company told him and other members of the commodities
proprietary trading desk it would shut down the unit to comply
with U.S. rules that prevent banks from using their own money to
wager on markets. He joins traders from firms including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) who&#8217;ve left
to join or start hedge funds after the Volcker rule restricted
risk-taking by banks following the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20% Return Target &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund startups had the most active first six months of
the year since before the financial crisis, helped by investors
seeking higher returns as central banks hold interest rates near
record lows. Money managers founded 578 new hedge funds during
the first six months of 2011, the most since the first half of
2007, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Strand fund will try to produce annual returns of 15
percent to 20 percent, said Bombell, who serves as chief
investment officer of Zug, Switzerland-based Strand Asset
Management AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds are private pools of capital whose managers can
buy or sell assets and bet on falling as well as rising prices.
The Strand fund, like many of its peers, will charge clients 2
percent of assets under management to cover costs plus 20
percent of any profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices as measured by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
Spot Index of raw materials gained 5.2 percent last week,
erasing losses for the year. The increase, the biggest weekly
jump since December, came after investors gained confidence that
European policy makers would take steps to bolster the region&#8217;s
banks. Oil and copper declined in August and September on
concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would hurt demand for
commodities by spurring a global recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bombell, who was born in Sydney, said the Strand fund is
buying Arabica coffee based on his view that demand will
outstrip supply. He&#8217;s also becoming &#8220;quite bullish&#8221; on Brent
crude oil, predicting a &#8220;nasty situation&#8221; in which it could
rise to $150 a barrel from about $110. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would ensure a global recession in 2012, regardless
of the fix being found for euro zone banking and sovereign
problems,&#8221; said Bombell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian medical-diagnostics firm
Diagnosticos da America SA (DASA3) fell to the lowest price in three
weeks after JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its recommendation to
&#8220;underweight&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; as sales growth slows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dasa, as the company is known, lost 2.4 percent to 14.89
reais at 6:15 p.m. in Sao Paulo. That&#8217;s the lowest close since
Sept. 23 and extends its slump this year to 34 percent. The
benchmark Bovespa index declined 2 percent today and is down 22
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales growth has decelerated in all segments, and in the
outpatient business it is underperforming its largest
competitor, Fleury,&#8221; Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan in
New York, said in a note to clients today. She further cited
&#8220;uncertainties regarding the company&#8217;s ability to accelerate
growth and improve margins.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleury SA (FLRY3) fell 0.5 percent to 21.10 reais today. JPMorgan
reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dasa may also be affected by delays in integrating its 2010
acquisition of MD1 Diagnosticos SA after Brazil&#8217;s antitrust
regulator Cade indicated that it may block the transaction,
Teixeira wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cade&#8217;s general attorney, Gilvandro Vasconcelos Coelho de
Araujo, recommended ordering Dasa to keep its administration
separate from MD1 Diagnosticos SA on concern the combined
company would have too much market share, an agency official
said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dasa&#8217;s second-quarter net sales increased 9.7 percent from
a year earlier to 541.2 million reais ($309 million), according
to an Aug. 15 regulatory filing. That compares to annual growth
of 13 percent in the previous quarter, a May 23 filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property owners needing to refinance
will fuel issuance of bonds backed by commercial-mortgages to as
much as $30 billion in 2012, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of securities tied to shopping mall, skyscraper and
hotel loans are projected to be between $25 billion and $30
billion next year, JPMorgan analysts led by Ed Reardon in New
York said in an Oct. 14 report. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)
estimated last week there will be $20 billion to $30 billion of
transactions in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $36 billion in mortgages packaged as bonds matures
next year, said Reardon. Some of those borrowers will turn to
Wall Street even as banks pull back from originating new loans
and charge higher interest rates after Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis
spurred price swings in the $600 billion commercial-mortgage
backed securities market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a certain percentage of maturing loans that need
to be refinanced in CMBS,&#8221; Reardon said in an e-mail. &#8220;The
interest rate is not the only feature that drives
originations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has arranged about $25.6 billion in commercial
mortgage-backed securities this year, compared with about $11.5
billion in all of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles of loans for new deals have shrunk amid
volatility that&#8217;s increased since July as Europe&#8217;s leaders
failed to stem the region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. Bank of
America Corp. cut its 2011 issuance forecast to between $25
billion and $30 billion in August after predicting more than $40
billion in new sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of the debt plummeted to $3.4 billion in 2009
compared with a record $234 billion in 2007, choking off funding
to borrowers with maturing loans, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Duper Spreads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of loans coming due next year should be able to
refinance with as much as $30 billion in projected sales, RBS
analysts Brian Lancaster, Richard Hill and Joseph Ruszkowski in
Stamford, Connecticut wrote in their report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries soared to 323
basis points, or 3.23 percentage points, on Oct. 4, the most
since February 2010, according to the Barclays Capital CMBS AAA
Super Duper Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads have narrowed to 3.18 percentage points after
widening from 2.26 percentage points at the end of July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Selcuk Gokoluk" date="Oct 17, 2011  9:22 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-17/lira-will-remain-under-fundamental-pressure-goldman-says.html"><headline>Lira Under &#8216;Fundamental&#8217; Pressure Even as Bank Sells Dollars, Goldman Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The lira sank the most in two weeks
and was the worst emerging-market performer against the dollar
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said the currency remains under
&#8220;fundamental&#8221; pressure and may drop to 1.95 in three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lira is &#8220;unlikely to outperform its emerging-market
peers, even in a &#8216;risk-on&#8217; environment and notwithstanding the
central bank&#8217;s relatively more &#8216;hawkish&#8217; stance on the exchange
rate,&#8221; Goldman economist for the region Ahmet Akarli said in an
e-mailed report today from London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency weakened 1.4 percent to 1.8540 per dollar at
3:58 p.m. in Istanbul, the biggest drop among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, in its biggest decline since
Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s central bank has sold dollars in auctions since
Aug. 5 in an effort to stem the currency&#8217;s declines, selling a
record $750 million on Oct. 5 after the lira reached a record-
low 1.9096 per dollar the previous day. It has reduced the
amount and frequency of the sales, selling $210 million in two
auctions last week. It sold $70 million for liras today, the
smallest amount since Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The appetite for the Turkish lira is waning,&#8221; Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. &#8220;A lot of investors
have counted on the central bank to support the lira by its
daily auctions. But since it is clearly not offering sufficient
amounts at the moment and thus not intending to drive lira
lower, investors are disappointed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lira Forecasts, Probability &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter forecasts for the lira vary from 1.65 to
1.95 per dollar, with a median estimate of 1.80 liras, according
to estimates from 18 banks compiled by Bloomberg. There is a 53
percent probability that the lira will drop to 1.95 per dollar
in three months, according to implied probability calculated
from currency options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble, zloty and forint may fare better than the lira
&#8220;if and when we get some normalization in Europe,&#8221; Akarli
said. &#8220;For the lira, the real inflection point will come as the
re-balancing process reaches a more advanced stage and the
economy troughs, possibly sometime in the second quarter of
2012,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas SA said it&#8217;s &#8220;less constructive&#8221; on the lira
after the currency strengthened to a target of 1.82 per dollar
last week. &#8220;The central bank is refraining from selling high
amounts of foreign exchange and save ammunition for the rainy
days,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was expected to sell $350 million to $500 million
for liras today, reacting to the lira&#8217;s under-performance
against emerging market peers, BNP said in an e-mailed report
today before it announced the auction&#8217;s size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Patrick Cole" date="Oct 17, 2011 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-17/met-opera-donations-rose-goldman-charity-gifts-fell-in-2010-survey-says.html"><headline>Met Opera Donations Rose, Gifts to Goldman Charity Fell in 2010</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;New York&#8217;s Metropolitan Opera saw
private donations recover in the recession&#8217;s wake last year,
rising 21.7 percent to about $127 million, according to a survey
released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miami-based New World Symphony, which is pursuing a
$200 million capital campaign to expand its campus, had the
largest percentage increase in private gifts last year.
Donations rose to $52.1 million from about $6.2 million in 2009,
according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the U.S. economy still struggled long after the
recession&#8217;s official end in mid-2009, and compared to the Met,
many of the 400 largest U.S.-based nonprofits surveyed by the
Chronicle felt the squeeze. In 2010, the same group saw private
gifts rise by a median 3.5 percent after a record 11 percent
decline in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fundraising environment is still really tough,&#8221; said
Chronicle editor Stacy Palmer by phone. &#8220;There are pockets of
the economy that are brighter than others, but most charities
are finding that it&#8217;s extraordinarily difficult to raise money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donations to Goldman Sachs Gives, the charitable fund
started by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in 2007, dropped 36.4
percent to $123.2 million last year. New York&#8217;s Metropolitan
Museum of Art saw a 5.3 percent drop in private funding to about
$131 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts nonprofits that saw steep declines in private giving
include the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts with a 42.4
percent drop to $46.4 million, the New York Public Library down
6.6 percent to $70.3 million, and the Art Institute of Chicago,
with a 32.5 percent plunge from about $58.5 million last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humane Society &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gifts to the Humane Society of the U.S. rose 35.2 percent
to $131.2 million last year, while the World Wildlife Fund
climbed 9.9 percent to $124.5 million. The Memphis-based Ducks
Unlimited, which works to protect the habitats of wildlife, saw
private funding decline by 33 percent to $98.7 million last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nonprofits are going to have to try different fundraising
techniques and not rely on one,&#8221; Palmer said. &#8220;A lot of groups
are thinking already that it&#8217;s going to take years before the
economy recovers and their fundraising recovers along with it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah McDonald" date="Oct 18, 2011  8:54 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-18/cba-beating-goldman-sachs-in-default-swaps-australia-credit.html"><headline>Commonwealth Bank Beating Goldman Sachs in Default Swaps: Australia Credit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Credit risk on Australian bank bonds
fell to a two-year low compared with global peers and is headed
for the biggest monthly drop on record as investors seek assets
unscathed by Europe&#8217;s debt crisis, while slowing growth cuts
U.S. financial companies&#8217; profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average cost of credit-default swaps to speculate on or
insure against losses on Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) bonds
tumbled 41 basis points this month to 180 yesterday, while
contracts on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rose 15 to 345, CMA prices
show. The average cost of bond protection on Australia&#8217;s four
biggest banks was 184 basis points less than an index of
contracts on global lenders on Oct. 17, the biggest advantage
since at least 2009, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s banks are &#8220;well positioned&#8221; to withstand
further turmoil in markets, the Reserve Bank said yesterday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s office on Oct. 17 knocked down
what it called &#8220;dreams&#8221; that an Oct. 23 meeting of policy
makers will be the last word in taming Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt
crisis. Australian-dollar bonds sold by financial companies
returned 1.9 percent since June 30, beating U.S. counterparts,
which lost 1.8 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian lenders are &#8220;in pretty good shape,&#8221; said
Justin Davey, a money manager at BT Investment Management Ltd.,
which has about A$13 billion ($13.3 billion) of fixed-income
assets under management. &#8220;While the attention is focused on
European and U.S. banks, I think the Australian banks on a
comparative basis look pretty good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt-Ceiling Fight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and its Wall Street peers have seen their
shares tumble and bond risk soar this year amid concern revenue
from trading and investment banking would drop because of
Europe&#8217;s sovereign crisis and the U.S. debt-ceiling fight. Banks
in the SP 500 Index tumbled 6.3 percent on Oct. 17 as Citigroup
Inc. and Wells Fargo  Co. said revenue dropped amid economic
weakness and market turmoil linked to Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs yesterday reported a third-quarter loss of
$393 million, the second time it failed to post a profit since
becoming a public company in 1999. An index of credit-default
swaps on six U.S. banks including Goldman has jumped 137 basis
points in 2011 to 271, CMA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB), Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) and Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC) rank among the top 25 most-creditworthy lenders in
an index of default swaps on more than 140 global financial
firms, CMA and Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge has fallen 20 basis points to 362 this month as
of yesterday. The cost of insuring the debt of European lenders
fell 15 to 457 in the same period, a separate index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Bailouts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s top four banks avoided government bailouts when
funding froze worldwide in 2008 and posted an average 17 percent
jump in profits in their most-recent half-year reports,
according to the RBA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are reducing their reliance on offshore bond markets
as Australian consumers save the most ever, lured by the
developed world&#8217;s highest benchmark interest rate. Term deposits
at banks surged to a record A$480.2 billion in August, the most
relative to offshore bank debt in data from the RBA going back
to 1984. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian lenders&#8217; outstanding borrowings from overseas
dropped to A$304 billion in August from A$314.6 billion in July,
the biggest fall in nine months and the lowest total since
November 2008, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposit growth continues to outpace lending, the central
bank said in minutes released yesterday of its Oct. 4 meeting,
when it left borrowing costs unchanged for an 11th month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RBA saw scope to reduce the 4.75 percent rate if needed
as a slower domestic economy eased concerns that inflation may
accelerate, the minutes showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Growth Risks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the RBA to be on hold until the end of this
year, with core inflation gradually rising, but not at a pace
sufficient to spook officials given persistent global growth
risks,&#8221; JPMorgan Chase  Co. economist Ben Jarman said in a
note to clients yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between yields on Australian government bonds and
inflation-indexed notes shows investors estimate consumer prices
will rise an average of 2.5 percent for the next five years, up
from 2011&#8217;s low of 2.37 percent on Oct. 4. Last week&#8217;s 10 basis-
point advance was the biggest since the five days to May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s 10-year government bond yield was little
changed today at 4.47 percent, or 231 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries. The so-called Aussie dollar, the
world&#8217;s fifth-most traded currency, bought $1.0239 at 11:17 a.m.
in Sydney today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 5 basis points to
186 as of 11:21 a.m., according to Westpac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece Investments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian banks have no investments in Greece, compared
with $56.7 billion owed to French banks, according to data from
the Bank for International Settlements as of the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders are working on multiple fronts to manage
Greece&#8217;s finances, protect banks and overhaul the currency
bloc&#8217;s economic governance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package of measures should include requiring banks to
hold more capital so they can withstand potential losses from
bond holdings, according to the International Monetary Fund,
which has put the cost as high as $200 billion. Euro-area banks
need at least 150 billion euros ($206 billion) of capital under
a plan similar to the U.S. government&#8217;s U.S. Troubled Asset
Relief Program, according to analysts at JPMorgan led by Kian Abouhossein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Review &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc had long-term issuer default grades cut on Oct. 13 by
Fitch Ratings. Fitch also placed viability ratings, and in some
cases credit grades, on negative watch for seven global banks
including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold UBS&#8217;s $1.5 billion
of 3.875 percent bonds due in January 2015 compared with
government debt has increased 87 basis points this quarter to
401, according to RBS prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread on Commonwealth Bank&#8217;s $1.75 billion of 3.5
percent notes due in March 2015 widened 12 basis points to 226
in the same period, the prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four biggest Australian lenders reported aggregate
profits of A$12.4 billion in their latest half-yearly results,
the central bank said in its financial stability review on Sept.
23. That&#8217;s about A$1.6 billion higher than a year earlier,
mainly due to declines in bad and doubtful debt charges, the RBA
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian banks &#8220;are fundamentally sound in their credit
dynamics and they&#8217;ve improved their funding,&#8221; said Michael Korber, who manages A$6 billion in cash and fixed-income assets
as head of credit at Perpetual Ltd. in Sydney. &#8220;Financial
institutions overall are under stress and Australian bank
spreads have widened in concert with that, but they&#8217;re better
positioned to withstand those stresses and come out the other
side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owners of Florida&#8217;s Sawgrass
Marriott Resort won bankruptcy court approval for a
reorganization plan that will give ownership of the resort to
secured lender Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul Glenn in Jacksonville, Florida,
today signed the final order approving the plan, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan will give the unit of New York-based Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) ownership of the resort, an unsecured claim of about
$63.8 million, and a secured claim of $132 million. Trade
suppliers with $190,000 in claims will recover about half of
that amount, court papers show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise agreement with Marriott International Inc.
will continue under Goldman Sachs&#8217;s ownership while the
management agreement with Interstate Hotels  Resorts LLC will
be canceled, according to the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Capital LP helped finance
the $220.5 million purchase of the 65-acre resort in Ponte Vedra
Beach, Florida, by RQB Resort and RQB Development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RQB Resort sought Chapter 11 protection in March 2010
listing assets and debt of as much as $500 million each. RQB
Development also filed for bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re RQB Resort LP, 10-01596, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, posted an 8.1 percent increase in third-
quarter profit after boosting global sales volumes and raising
retail pricing in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income advanced to $2.22 billion, or 95 cents a share,
from $2.06 billion, or 88 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Excluding some items,
profit was $1.03 a share, topping the $1.02 average of 13
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has built new plants in
emerging markets and pushed more profitable package sizes
overseas, helping boost global case volume sales 5 percent in
the quarter. Coca-Cola also raised pricing 2 percent to
retailers in North America, its largest market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are still growing in terms of volume, and that&#8217;s
what you want to see,&#8221; Chris Shanahan, a San Antonio-based
analyst at Frost  Sullivan, said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;They are able to maintain organic growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola fell 0.4 percent to $66.74 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 1.5 percent this year, while rival
PepsiCo Inc. has decreased 4.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter revenue rose 45 percent to $12.2 billion,
helped by the Coca-Cola&#8217;s purchase of its largest bottler last
year. The average estimate of 10 analysts was $12 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales volumes gained 7 percent in Latin America, 6 percent
in the company&#8217;s Eurasia and Africa region and 5 percent in
North American and its Pacific units. The gains were the result
of investments made throughout several years, Kent said today in
an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to take a long-term approach to investments and
a shorter term approach to execution,&#8221; said Kent, who last
month announced a plan to spend $3 billion in Russia in the next
five years to develop Coca-Cola&#8217;s brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said today it plans to buy back as much as $3
billion of its shares this year, up from its previous target of
at least $2.5 billion. The company said today it has repurchased
$2.2 billion shares so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said today on a
conference call that the company&#8217;s commodity costs will jump
$800 million this year from 2010, more than the $700 million
Coca-Cola previously estimated. The increase is driven by higher
costs for corn syrup used as a sweetener and petroleum-based
plastic for bottles and packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said in July it would boost North American
pricing as much as 4 percent in the second half of the year to
offset higher commodity costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, fell the most in
two months after missing sales estimates for the first time in
five quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM dropped 4.1 percent to $178.90 at the close in New
York, the biggest daily decline since Aug. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales for the third quarter climbed 7.8 percent to
$26.2 billion, Armonk, New York-based IBM said yesterday.
Analysts predicted $26.3 billion, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue showed slowing growth in IBM&#8217;s
software, hardware and services businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because they didn&#8217;t beat, the stock&#8217;s going to trade
down; the expectation is pretty high for this name,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. A slowdown in
hardware revenue growth is occurring &#8220;sooner than I expected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is focusing on areas
such as business analytics, emerging markets and cloud computing
to boost sales amid sluggish economic expansion. The U.S.
economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter
following a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months, the
weakest performance in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowing Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declines in Japan and the public sector weighed on the
performance of IBM&#8217;s services business, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. IBM has more exposure
to Japan than competitors, David Grossman, an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus in San Francisco, said in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales growth at IBM&#8217;s services unit slowed to 8 percent
from 10 percent in the second quarter, while revenue expansion
at its software unit decelerated to 13 percent from 17 percent.
Hardware sales growth slowed to 4 percent from 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares have risen 22 percent this year. The stock
reached a record of $190.53 on Oct. 14, and at least three
analysts revised their price estimates to $200 a share or higher
that week. In September, IBM passed Microsoft Corp. in market
value based on closing prices for the first time since 1996
before the companies switched back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a name that you&#8217;re expecting in this environment
to perform very strong,&#8221; said Brad Zelnick, a Macquarie Capital
USA analyst who added coverage of IBM last week. &#8220;Any
deceleration in signings or any significant drain on backlog is
going to send shares down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts at BMO Capital Markets and FBN Securities reduced
their ratings for IBM shares after the earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlog Shrinking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contract signings for services, which make up about
60 percent of IBM revenue, were $12.3 billion, compared with
$11 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average estimated
$12.5 billion, UBS AG said in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlog, which measures expected future revenue
from contracts, shrank to $137 billion in the quarter from
$144 billion in the second quarter, largely because of changes
in currency exchange rates, Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income rose 7 percent to $3.84 billion.
Profit on an operating basis rose to $3.28 a share, beating the
$3.22 average analyst estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating earnings will climb to at least $13.35 a share
this year, up from a previous projection of at least $13.25, IBM
said. Analysts predicted $13.33 on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bellwether&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, climbed 19 percent last quarter. Sales from the regions
will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the company
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growth-market performance was terrific across all
segments,&#8221; Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth
in these markets, and it led revenue growth in all business
segments, Loughridge said. IBM opened up 80 new branches, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re very ahead of where the big markets will be in a
few years, and it&#8217;s very important for them to have a footprint
there,&#8221; Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities
USA, said in an interview. He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano has said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions between 2010 and 2015. So far the company has spent
about $3 billion in acquisitions related to cloud computing,
said Steven Tomasco, an IBM spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of IBM&#8217;s global position and broad set of computer
services, it is &#8220;about as close as you can get to a technology
index fund,&#8221; Maguire said. &#8220;They&#8217;re a bellwether for the rest
of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accenture Plc and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which compete with IBM in
selling services to technology companies, both benefited from
increased spending by business clients in their most recent
quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Oct 18, 2011  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-18/goldman-sachs-posts-third-quarter-loss.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Rises on Comeback Bets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rose 5.5
percent in New York trading as investors looked past a third-
quarter loss and focused on gains in trading revenue and
prospects for a rebound in underwriting and takeovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from trading stocks and bonds increased 16 percent
from the second quarter and the backlog of investment-banking
assignments climbed, Goldman Sachs said today. The third-quarter
loss, which was driven by markdowns on the value of the firm&#8217;s
own investments, was $393 million, or 84 cents a share, the New
York-based company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
57, has tied Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fortunes to trading, which
accounted for 62 percent of revenue in the first nine months of
2011. After reporting weaker second-quarter revenue than
competitors in that business, Goldman Sachs beat both Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) last quarter, excluding
accounting gains related to the decline of the banks&#8217; own debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the core business there are some encouraging signs,&#8221;
said William Fitzpatrick, a Milwaukee-based financial-services
analyst at Manulife Asset Management, which manages $217 billion
and owns Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;It was the private-equity
business that weighed on results in the quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose $5.35 to $102.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain in more than
two months, as the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financial Index climbed
5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Rough Patch&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Trading wasn&#8217;t as bad as we all thought, and the bigger
losses came from writedowns in their investing and lending
unit,&#8221; Thomas Brown, chief executive officer of Second Curve
Capital LLC, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In
the Loop.&#8221; &#8220;I see Goldman as going through a rough patch in
the environment, but it&#8217;s environment-driven, not Goldman Sachs-
driven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-quarter loss, which compared with a year-earlier
profit of $1.9 billion, was the second time that Goldman Sachs
failed to post a profit since it became a public company in
1999. In both cases the loss was caused by reductions in the
value of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investments in companies, private-
equity funds and loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which said in July that it planned to cut about
1,000 jobs to reduce annual costs by $1.2 billion, said it
employed 34,200 people at the end of September, down 1,300 from
the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litton Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar told analysts on a
conference call today that about 500 of the job cuts in the
quarter related to the effort to cut costs. The other 800 came
from the sale of Litton Loan Servicing LP to Ocwen Financial
Corp., which more than offset the addition of personnel when the
firm gained control of its Australian joint venture, JBWere Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing and Lending, which includes Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
stakes in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (1398) Ltd. and other
companies, as well as holdings by the Special Situations Group
run by Jason M. Brown, reported negative revenue of $2.48
billion for the quarter. That compared with $1.8 billion in
revenue in the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $1.05 billion of last quarter&#8217;s negative revenue was
attributed to a drop in the value of ICBC, China&#8217;s biggest
lender, and $1 billion was caused by losses on other equity
securities. The unit also booked $907 in negative revenue from
&#8220;debt securities and loans,&#8221; while gaining $477 from
investments in other entities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., had
estimated the unit&#8217;s loss would be $1.67 billion, and predicted
the debt securities and loans segment would post $200 million in
revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezzanine Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the writedowns related to spread widening on senior
debt and so-called mezzanine debt, although the segment also
included some distressed loan losses, Viniar said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Investing and Lending division&#8217;s losses were
unrealized, meaning they reflected markdowns in asset values and
not actual sales at lower values, Viniar said. He said that
division sold some assets at a profit during the period, which
helped to offset the writedowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to think it won&#8217;t rebound,&#8221; Manulife&#8217;s
Fitzpatrick said of the Investing and Lending results. &#8220;I think
it will remain a big part of the business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects Investing and Lending to produce a
return in excess of 10 percent over the long run, Viniar told
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In any quarter it can be extremely volatile and up or
down a lot more than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our history has been a
lot better than a 10 percent return.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter revenue fell 60 percent to $3.59 billion from
$8.9 billion a year earlier and declined 51 percent from $7.28
billion in the second quarter. The company&#8217;s book value per
common share decreased to $131.09 from $131.44 at the end of the
second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall revenue from trading, run since February 2008 by
Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz, rose 16 percent to $4.06 billion from $3.52 billion
in the second quarter and was down 13 percent from $4.67 billion
in the third quarter of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading results included about $450 million of so-
called debt valuation adjustments, or DVAs, with about $300
million in fixed-income and about $150 million in equities
trading, Viniar said. U.S. accounting rules require that banks
book losses when the value of their debt rises and gains when it
declines on the theory that a loss, or profit, would be realized
if the bank were to repurchase the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;A Little Confused&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most of its rivals, spreads on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
corporate debt and credit-default swaps widened during the
quarter as investors became more cautious about risk from the
European sovereign debt crisis. Viniar said the wider spreads
make him &#8220;a little confused&#8221; because the firm believes it has
strong capital and liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s had minimal impact on our business so far,&#8221; Viniar
said in response to a question on the call. &#8220;It might affect us
versus some competitors who might have lower spreads, but we
also compete on execution as well and our execution tends to be
pretty good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has about $5 billion in &#8220;plain vanilla
debt&#8221; maturing by the end of the year, Viniar said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to replace it or
we want to wait for a better time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities,
typically the firm&#8217;s biggest source of revenue, dropped 36
percent to $1.73 billion from $2.69 billion a year earlier and
increased from $1.6 billion in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding DVAs the business produced $1.43 billion, which
fell short of the $2.27 billion that Citigroup reported and the
$2.8 billion that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported on the same
basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s average value-at-risk, a measure of the
amount of money the firm estimates it could lose in a single
day, was little changed during the quarter at $102 million
compared with $101 million in the prior period. Viniar told
analysts that the company&#8217;s value-at-risk, or VaR, climbed at
the end of the quarter as market volatility, one of the
ingredients of VaR, increased. Most of the rise took place in
the firm&#8217;s bets on interest rates, Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would expect, assuming we made no changes to positions
at all, that our VaR would be fairly significantly higher in the
fourth quarter than the third quarter,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities trading revenue rose to $2.33 billion from $1.98
billion a year earlier and from $1.92 billion in the second
quarter. Excluding DVAs, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $2.18 billion of
equities trading revenue beat Bank of America, Citigroup and
JPMorgan Chase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Best Performer&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were the best performer of the four so far,&#8221; said
David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in New York who
rates the stock &#8220;outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banking, overseen globally by Richard J. Gnodde,
David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, generated $781 million of
revenue in the third quarter, down from $1.45 billion in the
second quarter and $1.16 billion in the third quarter of last
year. The company ranks No. 1 among advisers on global takeovers
announced this year and also has the top spot among managers of
global equity and equity-linked offerings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banking&#8217;s relative contribution within the group
has grown this year. The business generated 15 percent of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue in the first nine months of the year, up
from 11 percent in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation and Benefits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation and benefits, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest expense,
fell 59 percent to $1.58 billion in the third quarter from $3.83
billion in the same period last year. The amount set aside to
pay employees in the first nine months of the year fell 24
percent to $10 billion, or enough to pay each employee $292,836.
That compares with $13.1 billion in the first nine months of
2010, or enough to pay each of the firm&#8217;s 35,400 employees at
the time $370,700. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost $2.12 billion, or $4.97 per share, in
the fourth quarter of 2008 after markets plunged following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman Sachs
rebounded to record profit in 2009 as asset values climbed and
the company slashed pay. &lt;/p&gt;

Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as long-term investments. He spoke today at the
Value Investing Congress in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curry said Goldman Sachs could buy back 30 percent of its
shares, driving them to $172 within a few years. The shares rose
2.1 percent to $98.92 at 1:48 p.m. New York time as investors
looked past the company&#8217;s third-quarter loss and focused on
gains in trading revenue and prospects for a rebound in

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
$10 billion to pay employees in this year&#8217;s first nine months,
down 24 percent from the same period last year as revenue slid
and the firm cut jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compensation expense, which includes salaries, bonuses,
stock awards and benefits, was equivalent to $292,836 for each
of the company&#8217;s 34,200 workers as of Sept. 30. A year earlier
Goldman Sachs employed 35,400 people, who shared about $13.1
billion, or $370,706 each, for the nine-month period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is among firms that have been targeted by
lower Manhattan protests, called Occupy Wall Street, that seek
to call attention to the income disparity between the wealthiest
1 percent of the population and everyone else. Related
demonstrations took place on four continents over the weekend.
Sixty-seven percent of New York City voters support the
movement, according to a Quinnipiac University survey yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record for a
securities firm before converting to a bank in response to the
financial crisis, may cut compensation for the second year in a
row as declining markets sap trading revenue. After setting
aside 39 percent of revenue for compensation in 2010, the
company has allocated 44 percent of revenue for pay and benefits
so far this year. Revenue for this year&#8217;s first nine months fell
25 percent $22.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported last week that it reduced its investment bank&#8217;s
workforce by almost 4 percent in the third quarter and cut
employee compensation costs 28 percent. The investment bank&#8217;s
compensation expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and
benefits, was enough to give each of the division&#8217;s employees
$289,611 for the nine-month period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Nigerian unit
said armed men attacked a supply vessel near its oil facilities
offshore the southern state of Akwa Ibom yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Operation is normal, and production has not been
impacted,&#8221; Ozemoya Okordion, a spokesman based in Lagos, the
commercial capital, said today in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The
incident has been reported to security and relevant government
agencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunmen on Sept. 30 attacked a vessel supplying one of
Exxon&#8217;s offshore oil platforms, wounding one worker and seizing
another. There&#8217;s &#8220;no update on the incident,&#8221; Okordion said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violence has risen in the southern Niger River delta, home
to Nigeria&#8217;s oil and gas industry, after a period of relative
quiet that followed a government amnesty in 2009 and the
disarming of thousands of fighters. Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s largest
oil producer and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed attacks in the delta cut Nigeria&#8217;s oil output more
than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. Royal Dutch Shell Plc said on Sept. 26 it shut 25,000
barrels a day of crude output from its Imo River field in the
country&#8217;s southern Abia state because of the level of theft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erste Group Bank AG (EBS), Austria&#8217;s
biggest lender, should have marked its credit-default swaps to
market prices &#8220;years earlier,&#8221; JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts
said as they reduced their rating on the Austrian lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erste posted a 460 million-euro ($630 million) loss last
week after reclassifying CDSs it had previously kept off balance
sheet. The change, which Erste said was triggered by new
guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board,
&#8220;came as a surprise,&#8221; analysts led by Paul Formanko, said in a
report yesterday as they cut their recommendation on the Vienna-
based lender to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IASB paper Erste blamed &#8220;was a restatement of current
rules&#8221; rather than a change to existing rules, they wrote.
&#8220;Erste should have adopted mark-to-market methodology some
years earlier,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of Erste Bank&#8217;s 5.2 billion-euro CDS portfolio
coupled with the associated volatility&#8217;&#8217; because the derivatives
will be now marked to market price &#8220;may limit investor appetite
in the near term,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erste also wrote down the value of its Hungarian and
Romanian subsidiary banks on Oct. 10 and created additional
provisions for rising bad debt in Hungary. All the measures
together will lead to a loss of as much as 800 million euros
this year, the lender said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erste has declined 23 percent in Vienna trading since the
announcement, the third-worst performance in the 46-member
Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index after Dexia
SA and National Bank of Greece SA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) lost its
ranking as the largest U.S. lender by assets as Chief Executive
Officer Brian T. Moynihan cut jobs and sold units and rival
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) expanded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s total assets increased 1.9 percent in the third
quarter to $2.29 trillion as of Sept. 30, while Bank of America
reported today a 1.8 percent decrease to $2.22 trillion. San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) was the largest by market
value as of yesterday&#8217;s close on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America became biggest by assets under former CEO
Kenneth D. Lewis through acquisitions, including credit-card
issuer MBNA Corp. and home lender Countrywide Financial Corp.
Both were the largest in their industries and later triggered
writedowns that contributed to six quarterly losses since mid-
2008 at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in ranking &#8220;tells me that Bank of America is
behind JPMorgan,&#8221; said Jefferson Harralson, an analyst at KBW
Inc. &#8220;Their capital levels are 200 to 300 basis points behind
JPMorgan; their ability to pay a dividend is 8 to 12 quarters
behind. The acquisition of Countrywide was a key determinant of
why they&#8217;re so far behind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moynihan has been shutting branches and selling assets such
as Canadian credit-card operations and a stake in health-care
company HCA Holdings Inc. as the bank prepares for capital rules
set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. He said last
month he would eliminate about 30,000 jobs after consumer-
protection rules squeezed revenue from debit and credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Driven&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to be the biggest company out there,&#8221;
Moynihan said at a Sept. 12 investor conference in New York.
&#8220;We can get out of things we don&#8217;t need to do, make the company
leaner, more straightforward, more driven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by CEO Jamie Dimon, never reported a losing
quarter throughout the financial crisis, even as it rescued Bear
Stearns Cos. and took over the banking unit of Washington Mutual
Inc. after that Seattle-based lender collapsed. Dimon added
units to the commodities business and has been increasing the
branch count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its dividend in March to 25 cents a share
from 5 cents after the Federal Reserve reviewed the ability of
the largest U.S. lenders to withstand another economic slump.
Bank of America said that month that the Fed rejected its
request to increase its dividend from 1 cent a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s third-quarter net income was $4.26 billion, the
New York-based company reported last week. Moynihan&#8217;s firm
posted third-quarter net income of $6.23 billion helped by an
accounting gain, the bank said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America became the largest bank in the first
quarter of 2009. JPMorgan had supplanted New York-based
Citigroup Inc. (C) as the biggest U.S. bank in 2008 after taking
over Bear Stearns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
yesterday reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years, sold
$500 million of 50-year unsecured bonds in a transaction aimed
at individual investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold the debt in increments of $25 at a yield
of 6.5 percent after doubling the size of the offering,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based firm
has the option to redeem the bonds at par after five years,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction was the second Goldman Sachs has targeted
at individual investors, allowing the firm to diversify its
sources of capital while locking in &#8220;attractive&#8221; borrowing
costs, said James Leonard, a credit analyst at Morningstar Inc.
in Chicago. Goldman Sachs issued $1.3 billion of 6.125 percent
notes with a similar structure a year ago, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a great deal for Goldman,&#8221; Leonard said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re sitting in a win-win situation,
because if interest rates stay low they can call them, but if
rates go up they&#8217;ve got 50 years of funding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonard said he wouldn&#8217;t recommend individual investors buy
the notes because of the difficulty of valuing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
option to redeem them after 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s third-quarter loss of $393 million, or 84
cents per share, compared with a profit of $1.9 billion, or
$2.98, a year earlier, the company said yesterday in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Swaps Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect Goldman Sachs&#8217;s debt for five years
using credit-default swaps fell 24 basis points to 321 basis
points, according to London-based data provider CMA. It reached
410 basis points on Oct. 4, the highest since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses
on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline
as investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Confused and Disappointed&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told
analysts on a conference call yesterday that a widening of the
firm&#8217;s credit spreads over the last six weeks has had a
&#8220;minimal&#8221; impact on its business. He said the firm, which
yesterday reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years as a
public company, has about $5 billion of debt maturing by year
end and &#8220;we&#8217;ll decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to
replace it or we want to wait for a better time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives have been &#8220;confused and
disappointed&#8221; by the rising prices on the firm&#8217;s credit-default
swaps, Viniar said, which investors use to hedge against losses
on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on its creditworthiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given how strong our capital is, our liquidity is, the
maturity of our funding, the balance sheet, we kind of scratch
our heads a little bit,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;But it really hasn&#8217;t
affected anything other than our emotions. We don&#8217;t like seeing
it but it hasn&#8217;t had a big effect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 1.5 percent to $100.79 in New York after
reaching $102.25 yesterday, the highest since Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. energy policy is rife with
contradictions and companies gain access to natural resources
&#8220;by exception, not by rule,&#8221; Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. needs to encourage production of oil and natural
gas rather than limiting energy development, Watson said today
in written remarks for a speech at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No matter where you look in the world -- China and
developing Asia, the Middle East, Latin America or Africa -- the
development of affordable fossil fuels is at the top of the
policy agenda,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Without a change in U.S. policy, we
will continue to be marginalized in the global competition for
energy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, joined oil
companies such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), trade associations led
by the American Petroleum Institute and Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, in criticizing
President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration for limiting access to
domestic fuel resources and increasing dependence on imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson said an estimated $1 billion investment to update
Chevron&#8217;s refinery in Richmond, California, required four years
of review and was halted by a lawsuit. Chevron is refiling for
permits for the project near San Francisco, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell&#8217;s Alaska Experience &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvin Odum, the president of Shell&#8217;s U.S. operations,
called the the U.S. regulatory system &#8220;reactionary&#8221; and
overburdened in a July 28 speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
in Washington. He cited The Hague-based company&#8217;s experience in
Alaska, where it hasn&#8217;t been allowed to drill after spending
more than $2 billion in a 2008 purchase of federal leases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perry said in an Oct. 14 speech that Obama intentionally
pushed up oil and gas prices, and the governor urged opening
swaths of Alaska and additional areas to oil development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration proposal to increase taxes for the
oil industry would reduce U.S. competitiveness for U.S. energy
companies relative to their Chinese, Russian and Indian
counterparts, Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He compared his California company with another: Apple
Inc. (AAPL), based in Cupertino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple earns about what we earn, but Apple has profit
margins two times Chevron&#8217;s, and an effective tax rate one-third
less, about 28 percent,&#8221; Watson said today. &#8220;Yet we don&#8217;t hear
calls for tax increases on Apple or the tech sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable Energy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transformation from fossil fuels to renewable
substitutes should be market-driven, Watson also said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The United States is now coming to grips with high-cost,
subsidized renewable,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solyndra LLC, a solar-panel manufacturer that received
about $527 million in federal loan guarantees, shut down on Aug.
31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Fetcher, Interior Department spokesman, and Damien LaVera, a spokesman for the Energy Department, didn&#8217;t
immediately return e-mails seeking comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) of Irving, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) were sued for allegedly colluding
to fix the fees paid by consumers for access to automated teller
machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust suit, brought in federal court in Washington
by an ATM user and made public today, also names Visa Inc. and
MasterCard Inc. (MA), the world&#8217;s biggest payment networks, as
defendants. It&#8217;s the third lawsuit filed in Washington in the
past week alleging price-fixing of ATM fees and surcharges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The violation in this case is a horizontal agreement
among every bank that is a member of the Visa and/or MasterCard
networks that charges ATM access fees on foreign ATM
transactions,&#8221; the complaint alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by a New Jersey man on behalf of
consumers who &#8220;have been forced to pay artificially inflated,
supra-competitive ATM access fees,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two earlier lawsuits, one filed yesterday and the other on
Oct. 12, accuse Visa and MasterCard of antitrust violations for
restricting independent ATM operators from charging varying,
lower prices for customers using alternative networks such as
STAR, Shazam Inc. or TransFund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniform Agreement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a uniform agreement, the operators can&#8217;t charge less
for transactions over a network that competes with Visa and
MasterCard, according to complaints filed by ATM users and a
trade group representing operators of automated teller machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard, based in
Purchase, New York, said in an e-mailed statement that the
lawsuits &#8220;challenging certain MasterCard ATM rules are without
merit&#8221; and that the company will defend itself against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the rules were put in place to protect consumers
from ATM operators seeking to impose &#8220;discriminatory
surcharges&#8221; on cardholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, and
Will Valentine, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Visa,
declined to comment on the suit. Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman
for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, and Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to telephone messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branded Cards &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three suits claim that the &#8220;overwhelming&#8221; majority of
so-called PIN debit cards used for ATM transactions are branded
by Visa or MasterCard. In order to accept one of these cards, an
ATM operator must have access to the Visa and MasterCard
networks. Independent or non-bank operators must be sponsored by
a financial institution that is a member of the Visa and
MasterCard networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard and their member banks require the service
fee for any transaction at an ATM to be &#8220;no less than the
amount charged at that ATM or terminal for a Visa or MasterCard
transaction,&#8221; even for transactions that don&#8217;t use the
companies&#8217; networks, the lawsuits allege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit against the banks involve so called &#8220;foreign
ATM transactions&#8221; in which a customer of one bank withdraws
money from an ATM owned or operated by another bank. It seeks
class action status on behalf of those who paid an access fee
for a foreign ATM transaction since Oct. 1, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By collusively agreeing to set a price floor for all ATM
access fees at every ATM terminal throughout the country, the
bank defendants and the bank co-conspirators shelter themselves
from natural and beneficial price competition that otherwise
would exist in the market,&#8221; the lawsuit claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involving banks is Genese v. Visa Inc. (V), 11-1838;
the case filed by ATM users is Barton v. Visa Inc., 11-1831; and
the case filed by independent ATM operators is National ATM
Council v. Visa Inc., 11-1803, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, had the most third-quarter trading revenue
of any Wall Street firm that has reported results so far,
leading the pack for the fourth consecutive period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, has supplanted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as No. 1 in
revenue from buying and selling bonds, stocks, currencies,
commodities and derivatives, according to company reports.
JPMorgan&#8217;s trading revenue was more than triple that of Bank of

&lt;p&gt;The table below details third-quarter and nine-month
trading revenue reported by Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. (C),

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
payment network, will raise its dividend 47 percent as profits
advance and customers outside the U.S. use their cards more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payout will increase to 22 cents a share from 15 cents,
the San Francisco-based company said today in a statement.
Investors who own common stock as of Nov. 18 will be paid on
Dec. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa reported four straight profit increases as credit-card
spending accelerated. Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders
is buying back shares and looking to expand abroad as consumers
shift away from cash and checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board of directors, which authorized the dividend
increase, is &#8220;demonstrating their ongoing confidence in the
strength of the business,&#8221; Saunders said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa announced dividend increases of 20 percent last year
and 19 percent in 2009. With today&#8217;s action, the stock yields
about 1 percent annually. Visa&#8217;s total return for 2011 including
stock appreciation and dividends was 34 percent through
yesterday. Visa gained 0.6 percent to $94.50 in early New York
trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil traded near the highest price in
more than a month in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
predicted &#8220;upside&#8221; potential, amid signs U.S. crude stockpiles
are increasing less rapidly than previously forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures were little changed after advancing 2.3 percent
yesterday. Energy Department data today may show that supplies
climbed 2 million barrels. Yesterday&#8217;s report by the industry-
funded American Petroleum Institute indicated they dropped for a
third week. Goldman Sachs said an improving economic outlook in
Europe and declining crude supplies may present &#8220;a real upside
risk&#8221; to Brent prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market certainly drew some support from pronounced
crude and product draws in the API data, as well as more
optimism creeping back in about the euro-zone bailout,&#8221; said
Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital in London, who
predicts prices will end the year little changed from current
levels. &#8220;Libya will come back on line, but not especially fast,
and geopolitical risks surrounding Iran will give support.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for November delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange was at $88.29 a barrel, down 5 cents, at 1:19 p.m.
London time. The contract yesterday closed at $88.34, the
highest settlement since Sept. 15. The more-actively traded
December contract was down 6 cents at $88.47. Front-month prices
are down 3.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for December settlement was at $110.73 a barrel,
down 42 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent &#8216;Upside Risk&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent futures, which dropped 12 percent in London trading
in August and September, may fall &#8220;too low&#8221; because of
&#8220;uncertainty&#8221; over the economy, Goldman Sachs said in a
report. The so-called backwardation in Brent contracts, where
prices for soonest delivery are higher than those for later
months, creates an incentive to draw from inventories, Goldman
Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Persistent uncertainty over Europe would likely continue
to increase the upside risk to Brent crude oil prices,&#8221; David Greely, a managing director for Goldman Sachs based in New York,
said in the report. &#8220;Destocking makes the market increasingly
vulnerable to upside demand surprises or supply shortfalls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel said yesterday a European
Union summit on Oct. 23 will be an &#8220;important step&#8221; though not
the final one to solve the region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude supplies fell 3.1 million barrels last week, the
API said yesterday. The Energy Department&#8217;s figures today were
forecast to show they climbed a second week, based on the median
of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Stockpiles Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline inventories dropped 1.6 million barrels, according
to API data. They were forecast to slip 1.5 million barrels in
the Bloomberg survey. Distillate stockpiles, including heating
oil and diesel, decreased 2.2 million barrels compared with an
estimate for a 1.5 million decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry-funded API collects stockpile information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Department for its weekly survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market&#8217;s just looking for some sort of price
direction,&#8221; said David Lennox, a resource analyst at Fat
Prophets in Sydney who predicts prices will trade at $80 to $90
a barrel. &#8220;Traders aren&#8217;t willing to push prices higher, given
the weak economic outlook in the U.S. and what&#8217;s happening in
Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) reported more demands from investors to repurchase
faulty mortgages made after 2008, when the banks said they
upgraded their standards to curb defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims from investors for loans originated in 2009 or later
more than tripled to $153 million from a year earlier for New
York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, and almost
tripled to $164 million for Bank of America, according to their
third-quarter reports. The firms also said claims increased for
loans made in 2005, before the housing bubble peaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demands may signal that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the
government-back mortgage finance companies, are becoming more
aggressive in their quest for refunds as bad home loans spread
to more recent years. Regulators have blamed record defaults and
foreclosures on lax underwriting from 2004 through most of 2008.
Lenders have said they&#8217;ve tightened standards since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is really surprising,&#8221; said Chris Gamaitoni, a
mortgage and banking analyst at Compass Point Research and
Trading LLC, adding that banks have been telling investors that
delinquencies weren&#8217;t as bad for loans originated after the
bubble years. &#8220;Maybe the banks didn&#8217;t really tighten until
2010,&#8221; Gamaitoni said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five largest mortgage lenders have absorbed more than
$66 billion of costs tied to repurchases, litigation,
foreclosure problems and other errors on faulty mortgages since
2007. Investors who buy the loans are entitled to ask for
refunds or compensation if they find missing or inaccurate data
on home values or the borrower&#8217;s income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been among the biggest
claimants, while Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
has suffered the most damage, committing about $40 billion for
refunds, litigation and foreclosures, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America reported repurchase demands for post-2008
loans jumped to $164 million in the third quarter from $158
million in the second and $56 million a year earlier. Repurchase
demands on its 2005 loans declined from $957 million in the
fourth quarter of last year to $431 million in the second
quarter, then rose to $668 million in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of this is simply driven by the &#8216;seasoning&#8217; of claim
volume as time passes, for the post-2008 volumes, and not an
indication of underwriting,&#8221; said Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of
America spokesman. &#8220;Keep in mind the numbers are still at
relatively low levels and are not necessarily going to result in
a repurchase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA&#8217;s Reaction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its 2010 annual financial report, Bank of America said
changes made in operations and underwriting &#8220;reduced our
exposure after 2008.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repurchase requests and resolutions involving Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac have &#8220;become increasingly inconsistent with our
interpretation of our contractual obligations,&#8221; Bank of America
said yesterday in a slide presentation accompanying its third-
quarter earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson told reporters on a
conference call the bank has seen &#8220;some stuff come over the
wall that&#8217;s older than what we historically have seen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it received demands in the third quarter for
$153 million of faulty mortgages made after 2008, up from $89
million in the second quarter and $46 million in the third
quarter of last year. For the 2005 vintage, repurchase demands
rose to $200 million in the third quarter from $67 million a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s annual report said that demands against loans
issued before 2005 and after 2008 hadn&#8217;t been significant due to
&#8220;the comparatively favorable credit performance of these
vintages and to the enhanced underwriting and loan-qualification
standards implemented progressively during 2007 and 2008.&#8221;
Thomas Kelly, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the nation&#8217;s biggest home lender, didn&#8217;t
disclose year-by-year data. The San Francisco-based company said
in its third-quarter report that repurchase demands on loans
made from 2006 through 2008 rose due to requests from Fannie Mae
and that &#8220;newer vintage demands continued to emerge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancel Martinez, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to
comment on whether the statement signals an increase in demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The housing-finance companies have increased repurchase
demands on loans that are still current as well as those in
default, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance,
a trade publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxpayer Interest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That is very, very unusual,&#8221; Cecala said. &#8220;My
understanding is that the biggest reason for the demands on the
performing loans is problems with the appraisals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government-run housing-finance companies, which were bailed
out and seized during the financial crisis, have said they&#8217;re
acting to protect taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8217;s focus on loan quality is more important
than ever since we are in conservatorship, and taxpayers
shouldn&#8217;t have to pay for losses related to the sale of bad
loans to Freddie Mac,&#8221; said Douglas Duvall, a spokesman for the
McLean, Virginia-based firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae defended its practice of seeking the repurchase
of performing loans as well as those in default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All lenders agree to sell us loans that meet our
requirements,&#8221; Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for Washington-
based Fannie Mae, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;When a lender
fails to comply with this obligation, whether a loan is
performing or not, we will pursue repurchase or other options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Rigorous Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month the inspector general for the Federal Housing
Finance Agency, the regulator of and conservator for Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae, criticized Freddie Mac for agreeing to a
settlement of repurchase claims earlier this year with Bank of
America without having thoroughly sampled older mortgages for
faults. The inspector general, Steve Linick, encouraged the
housing companies to conduct more rigorous reviews and increase
recoveries for taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The level of fear around the lenders I talk to about
getting these loans right is just unbelievable,&#8221; said Christine
Clifford, vice president of Access Mortgage Research 
Consulting Inc. in Columbia, Maryland. &#8220;There were so many
mistakes made that we&#8217;re swinging from the extreme of not
dotting any I&#8217;s or crossing any T&#8217;s to having eight people check
every item.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UniCredit SpA (UCG) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
may have the biggest shortfall in capital among European banks
should stricter regulations be passed and they incur sovereign
debt losses, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milan-based UniCredit would need to raise 13.5 billion
euros ($18.7 billion) assuming a &#8220;stress&#8221; scenario and
Germany&#8217;s Deutsche Bank would need 11.7 billion euros, JPMorgan
analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks may need a total of 230 billion euros to
recapitalize in 2012, they said. Using the European Banking
Authority&#8217;s calculation method, the amount of capital required
would be 243 billion euros, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more we look at the details, we question EBA input
assumptions and hence we remain cautious,&#8221; the analysts said.
&#8220;Overall we believe the JPMorgan methodology is more
realistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts said they used calculations based on the so-
called Basel III reforms for capital ratios and assumed banks
with a capital deficit will cease paying dividends, among other
changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the EBA&#8217;s assumptions, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS) has the largest shortfall at 19 billion euros, followed by
UniCredit with 17 billion euros needed, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies will use mergers and
acquisitions to boost growth even amid volatile markets,
creating opportunities for investors to profit from deal
strategies, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate cash balances grew more than 50 percent between
the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter this year,
stocks are below historic valuation levels and forecasts for
earnings growth have declined, supporting an appetite for MA,
according to Robert Boroujerdi, Goldman&#8217;s co-director of
Americas equity research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boroujerdi recommends a portfolio of companies in which
Goldman sees at least a 15 percent chance of deal activity in
the next 12 months, including Federal-Mogul Corp. (FDML) and GenOn
Energy Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see several drivers that can support appetite for the
&#8216;right&#8217; consolidation opportunities,&#8221; New York-based Boroujerdi
said in the note. &#8220;For many companies MA will act as a means
of enhancing growth and margin profiles, diversifying revenue
streams or consolidating weaker competitors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced MA volume fell 20 percent in the third quarter
from the previous year, Goldman said. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index fell 14 percent in that period, the most since 2008, amid
signs U.S. economic growth was slowing and concern the European
debt crisis would spread. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
dropped to its second-lowest level on record last month.
Volatility was high as well, with a gauge of the intraday change
in the SP 500 having an average over the past 30 days of 3.12
on Sept. 12, its highest level since April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;GSRHACQN&#8221; basket of recommendations includes
168 stocks, up from 165 in a March rebalancing. Of those, 51 are
new. The average market value of a company in the basket is $4.2
billion, Goldman said. That compares with a mean of $23.1
billion for stocks in the SP 500 (SPX), according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman put the stocks into two categories -- those labeled
as having a 30 percent to 50 percent chance of MA in the next
12 months according to the firm&#8217;s analysts, and those with a 15
percent to 30 percent chance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), owner of the ESPN
sports channel and the world&#8217;s largest theme-park operator,
apologized to customers after demand for limited editions of its
princess dolls crashed the Disney Store website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1,200 Facebook users posted comments when the
company acknowledged yesterday that the site was &#8220;extremely
busy&#8221; and that it &#8220;won&#8217;t allow such high volume to check out
simultaneously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The furor erupted when the Burbank, California-based
company put the last five models in its Disney Princess Designer
Doll Collection for sale on its website yesterday for $59.50
each. All of the dolls -- the characters Tiana, Jasmine,
Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Pocahontas -- sold out the same
day, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! I think Disney should go back to the
meeting room on this one,&#8221; Susan Herd Collier posted to
Disney&#8217;s Facebook page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was contrite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We acknowledge that this has been a poor experience for
many of you, and we are truly sorry for those of you who were
unable to purchase,&#8221; Disney said yesterday in a statement on
the store&#8217;s Facebook page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Disney Princess Designer Doll collection made its debut
on Aug. 23, starting with the Cinderella model and a plan to
introduce one more character a week for a total of 10. Trouble
started when Snow White went on sale Sept. 19 and it sold out
the same day. The company said the doll was &#8220;oversold&#8221; and
blamed a &#8220;system malfunction&#8221; on its Disney Store blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five More Dolls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want you to know that we read your comments on
Facebook, saw your Tweets, and our Cast Members have told us
what they heard from our Guests who visited our stores,&#8221; Jim
Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said in a Sept.
23 post on the store blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney said then it would release the five remaining dolls
all on the same day, starting Oct. 17 in its stores and
yesterday from its website. Customers were allowed to order only
one of each character, and even with that limit, demand led to
the website crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney spokesman Gary Foster said the company would have no
comment beyond its online posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jonathan D. Salant and Jeff Bliss" date="Oct 20, 2011 11:39 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-20/google-follows-microsoft-playbook-in-boosting-lobbying-spending.html"><headline>Google Follows Microsoft Playbook in Boosting Spending</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), the subject of a
Federal Trade Commission investigation, has ratcheted up its
lobbying to the level of another high-tech company that also
faced government scrutiny: Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Google spent $5.9 million
from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, a 51 percent increase over the $3.9
million spent during the same period a year earlier, according
to reports filed today with the House and Senate. Microsoft
spent $5.5 million in the first nine months of 2011, up from
$5.2 million during the same period in 2010. Google&#8217;s lobbying
team included 23 outside firms, up from six a year earlier and
one more than Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has doubled its lobbying spending in the last two
years and this year began an expansion of its political action
committee, which is used to give donations to candidates. Both
of these developments come as the owner of the world&#8217;s most
popular search engine faces scrutiny from both federal
regulators and U.S. lawmakers. The actions are similar to those
taken by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, one of Google&#8217;s
biggest competitors, after it faced a Justice Department
antitrust suit and congressional hearings in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When scrutiny arrived, Microsoft chose to ramp up its
lobbying presence and let the professionals handle its
concerns,&#8221; said Rogan Kersh, associate dean of New York
University&#8217;s Wagner School, who tracks lobbying. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
blueprint that Google is successfully following.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitching Google&#8217;s View &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lobbying expenditures are part of an effort to give
Congress and the Obama administration Google&#8217;s view on an array
of issues, said Samantha Smith, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to help policy makers understand our business and
the work we do to keep the Internet open, to encourage
innovation and to create economic opportunity,&#8221; she said in a
statement. &#8220;Lobbying is a part of that process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google first registered to lobby in Washington in June 2007
and spent $2.9 million in the first nine months of 2009.
Microsoft spent $5 million during the same period that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this transition happen in every sector,&#8221; Kersh
said. There&#8217;s &#8220;an initial resistance to lobbying followed by a
recognition that whatever your business model, you have to have
an active lobbying presence, both to stave off regulation and to
gain benefits from government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s lobbying team now includes Richard Gephardt, a
former House Democratic leader; Kyle Simmons, former chief of
staff to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell; and Charles Black Jr., the former Republican presidential adviser who now is
chairman of the Washington-based Prime Policy Group lobbying
firm. All were hired in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring Spree &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s hiring spree &#8220;shows how concerned they are
with regulatory matters,&#8221; said Benjamin Schachter, an Internet
analyst at Macquarie Capital in New York. &#8220;They&#8217;ve grown up and
realized they have to have their voice heard so they&#8217;re not
backed into a corner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enhanced lobbying presence won&#8217;t affect the
investigation at the FTC, whose probes have been resistant to
political pressure, said William Blumenthal, the agency&#8217;s former
general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is extraordinarily rare when you&#8217;d see political
intervention have a significant effect on the outcome of the
investigation,&#8221; said Blumenthal, chairman of the U.S. antitrust
group at Clifford Chance LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increased lobbying presence didn&#8217;t shield Microsoft from
the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust probe of the company. The
government pressured Microsoft into accepting a nine-year
consent decree to stop using its monopoly Windows operating
system for personal computers to quash competition. The decree
expired in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with Microsoft&#8217;s past spending pattern, Google also
increased the amount of money it spends on politics. Its PAC,
which began in 2006, raised $570,115 from employees during the
first six months of 2011, 12 times greater than the $47,769
raised during the same period in 2009, Federal Election
Commission records show. Microsoft&#8217;s PAC took in $546,784 from
January to June, slightly more than the $534,530 raised two
years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft experienced a similar fundraising jump in 1998,
the year the Justice Department filed its antitrust suit. Its
PAC took in $534,050 that year, compared with $46,000 two years
earlier, FEC reports show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust Allegations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC earlier this year began investigating whether
Google has violated antitrust laws by unfairly ranking search
results to favor its own businesses and increasing rivals&#8217; ad
rates, a person familiar with the probe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency also is examining if Google is using its control
of the Android mobile operating system to discourage smart-phone
makers from using rivals&#8217; applications and services, said the
person, who wasn&#8217;t authorized to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt testified before a
Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing that his search
engine doesn&#8217;t discriminate against competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department Antitrust Division is reviewing
Google&#8217;s proposed $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. and its $400 million purchase of Internet-
advertising company Admeld Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index fell 0.4 percent to 34,395.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Mexican stocks followed the peso lower as France and
Germany wrangled over proposals to tackle Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consorcio Ara SAB (ARA* MM), a Mexican homebuilder,

the country&#8217;s biggest construction company, dropped 2.7 percent
to 14.78 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Mexico SAB (GMEXICOB MM), the country&#8217;s largest
mining company, fell 2.3 percent to 34.06 pesos. Copper futures
for December delivery declined as much as 7 percent in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, gained 4.2 percent to 54.92 pesos,
the highest in more than three months. Third-quarter advertising
sales in the broadcast division, Televisa&#8217;s largest unit, rose
2.4 percent to 6 billion pesos ($434.9 million), compared with
the estimate of 5.95 billion pesos by Gregorio Tomassi, an
analyst at Banco Santander SA. Advertising sales had declined
from a year earlier in the previous two quarters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $14.5
million to settle a lawsuit brought by two whistle-blowers who
claimed the company improperly marketed its bladder-control drug
Detrol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whistle-blowers, former sales representatives David
Wetherholt and Marci Drimer, sued Pfizer in federal court in
Boston in 2006, claiming the company cheated Medicaid, the
state-administered, federal health-care program for low-income
people, by pushing Detrol for a prostate condition. The suit was
filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. and
multiple states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will pay $14.5 million to the U.S. government, 49
states and the District of Columbia, Thomas M. Greene, a lawyer
for the whistle-blowers, said today in a statement. The ex-
Pfizer employees will receive 27 percent of the federal portion
of the recovery, or about $3.3 million, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plan to market Detrol off-label to new patient
populations was hatched by a marketing team, not by research and
development,&#8221; Greene said in an interview. &#8220;Instead of asking,
&#8216;Who will Detrol help?&#8217; or even, &#8216;How does Detrol work?&#8217; the
question became, &#8216;Who can we convince to buy Detrol?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Favorable Terms&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer denied any wrongdoing. The New York-based company
settled the lawsuit on &#8220;favorable terms,&#8221; it said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement allows Pfizer to avoid the cost and
distraction of litigation and put this matter behind us,&#8221; the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, paid $2.3 billion in
2009 to settle U.S. investigations into improper marketing of
its Bextra painkiller and other drugs. The Detrol claim was the
last of the False Claims Act cases connected to these suits, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. declined to intervene, or join, the Detrol lawsuit
in 2009. The whistleblowers pursued the claim on their own after
that decision, Greene said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former Pfizer sales representatives claimed that the
company marketed Detrol, approved for treatment of overactive
bladder conditions, for an additional, unapproved, use, in
violation of federal regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer encouraged prescriptions for patients who have an
impeded flow of urine caused by a condition called benign
prostatic hyperplasia, the whistle-blowers claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unlawful Conduct&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer intentionally embarked on a course of unlawful
conduct that it knew would lead to the submission by physicians
and pharmacists of thousands of Medicaid claims for Detrol uses
that were not covered by Medicaid and for which the drug was
ineffective,&#8221; the whistle-blowers said in their complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was initially settled in January while the
conclusion of the case was delayed as the plaintiffs got
agreements from the states, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetherholt and Drimer also alleged Pfizer forced them out
after they complained about marketing practices. Greene declined
to comment on whether their claims of wrongful termination were
settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetherholt and Drimer will also receive an undetermined
amount from the $2.62 million portion of the settlement shared
by the states, Greene said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They will receive a percentage of the state settlements
for those states with false claims acts,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. ex. rel. Wetherholt v. Pfizer Inc.,
06-10204, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By James Sterngold" date="Oct 20, 2011  1:48 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-20/jpmorgan-s-legal-bills-push-industry-tally-of-bad-mortgages-to-69-billion.html"><headline>JPMorgan, BofA Push Tally for Faulty Mortgages to $69 Billion</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) disclosed $1.3
billion of new expenses tied to faulty mortgages and
foreclosures in its third quarter, pushing the bill for the five
biggest home lenders since 2007 to almost $69 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, set aside $314
million for buying back defective loans and incurred $1 billion
in litigation costs caused mostly by mortgages, according to its
Oct. 13 report. That brought the New York-based bank&#8217;s total to
at least $17.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost are mounting as borrowers, investors and states accuse
banks of sloppy lending and improper foreclosures. The total may
top $120 billion because mortgage buyers such as Fannie Mae are
becoming more aggressive, said Paul Miller, the FBR Capital
Markets  Co. analyst, and claims are spreading to loans written
after banks said they reformed their practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is still far from over,&#8221; said Neil Barofsky, former
inspector general for the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program.
&#8220;These numbers are very high to begin with, but this is now an
enormous overhang on the industry, and it&#8217;s well deserved.
Sooner or later the banks will pay the price for their
behavior.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the housing boom, banks issued mortgages and bundled
them into securities sold to private investors and government-
backed enterprises. They usually offered &#8220;representations and
warranties&#8221; in which lenders promised to buy back the mortgages
or cover losses if the loans turned out to be based on
inaccurate or missing data on criteria such as the borrower&#8217;s
income, the property&#8217;s value or whether it would be used as a
primary residence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators said banks abandoned their own lending standards
to approve unjustified loans, leading to record defaults and
foreclosures. Investors who owned the mortgages began scouring
the loans for defects and lodging claims, while homeowners and
state attorneys general alleged that banks based seizures on
missing or false documents. Litigation costs for JPMorgan alone
have come to more than $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), whose Countrywide unit was the
biggest lender during the housing bubble, had $1.18 billion in
third-quarter costs, according to its Oct. 18 report. That
included a $278 million provision for repurchases, $500 million
for litigation costs and $400 million for waivers and
assessments related to foreclosure problems. The total for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company since 2007 is now $40.3
billion, the most of any U.S. home lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage Servicing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) added $390 million to its reserves for
repurchases in the third quarter, bringing its total to $5.48
billion. The San Francisco-based company, the biggest U.S. home
lender, also wrote down the value of its mortgage servicing
rights by $2.64 billion, in part because of expenses &#8220;including
delinquency and foreclosure costs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writedown was excluded from Bloomberg&#8217;s tally because
the bank didn&#8217;t say how much of the decline was attributable to
extraordinary foreclosure costs, and Ancel Martinez, a Wells
Fargo spokesman, declined to elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) reported a $301 million provision for
repurchase demands, lifting the New York-based bank&#8217;s total to
$2.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly at JPMorgan, Shannon Bell at Citigroup and
Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to
comment. Ally Financial Inc., previously known as GMAC Inc., has
not reported its third-quarter data yet. As of the second
quarter, the Detroit-based lender had been hit with $3.28
billion in costs. Ally is 74 percent owned by the U.S.
government after being rescued from collapse in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie and Freddie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were also bailed out, say
they&#8217;re getting tougher in demanding repurchases, even for loans
that have not gone into default. Some guarantees offered by
banks oblige them to give refunds merely if the underwriting was
defective, even if the borrower is still paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fannie Mae in particular seems to be getting more
aggressive,&#8221; FBR&#8217;s Miller said. Bank of America said it had
$11.67 billion in outstanding claims and JPMorgan had $3.09
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most claims have been concentrated in the years
before the housing bubble burst, JPMorgan and Bank of America
reported that demands for repurchases on loans issued after 2008
had about tripled from the year earlier. Previously, the banks
had said they expected few claims those mortgages were faulty
because they had tightened their lending procedures after the
credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newer Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo said it had received a rising number of
repurchase demands from Fannie Mae for mortgages from 2006 to
2008 and that &#8220;newer vintage demands continued to emerge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, banks have been in negotiations with the
attorneys general of the 50 states to resolve litigation for
foreclosure abuses and errors. A settlement may cost about $20
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&#8217;s tally was compiled from regulatory filings,
company statements and financial presentations by the nation&#8217;s
five biggest mortgage lenders. The data cover provisions and
expenses attributable to repurchases, foreclosure errors and
abuses, payments to reimburse investors for lost value on faulty
mortgages, legal settlements and litigation expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compilation also includes writedowns of assets, such as
mortgage servicing rights, when the company attributed the loss
in value to problems in mortgage underwriting or foreclosures
and the costs of remedies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tally would be higher if it included settlements with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading
investors in mortgage-related securities, such as collateralized
debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC announced Wednesday a $285 million settlement with
Citigroup. In July, 2010, the agency announced a $550 million
settlement with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan paid
$153.6 million in a similar case in June. SEC officials have
said more cases are likely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
to raise a collateralized loan obligation with a target size of
$400 million to be managed by Ares Management LLC, according to
three people with knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLO may include a $254 million piece rated AAA by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. Bank of America Corp.
priced a $410 million CLO for the Los Angeles-based investment
manager in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been more than $7.6 billion of CLOs backed by
widely syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, more than
double the $3.4 billion raised in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. At the peak of the market in 2007, $91.1
billion of that type of CLO was issued in the U.S., Morgan
Stanley data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ares fund may also consist of a $23 million slice rated
AA, a $40 million piece ranked A, a $21 million portion graded
BBB and an $18 million BB piece. There may also be $44 million
of equity, the people said. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs
spokesman, and Bill Mendel, an Ares spokesman, both declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. The SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100
Index, which tracks the 100 largest dollar- denominated first-
lien leveraged loans, has climbed 1.5 cents since September to
90.06 cents on the dollar, the highest level since Aug. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, was sued by Israel-based MiniFrame Ltd. for
allegedly offering anticompetitive terms for multiserver
operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiniFrame said Microsoft uses its monopoly on the client
operating-system market to interfere with potential partners and
customers. Before 2007, Microsoft didn&#8217;t include any
restrictions in its licenses that would prevent multiple users,
MiniFrame said in a complaint filed today in Manhattan federal
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiniFrame alleges that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
is attempting to retain its monopoly on the server operating-
system market and the client operating-system market and is
attempting to monopolize the personal-computer sharing software
market and the multi-user software market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft recognized the competitive threat which shared
PC systems posed and engaged in several anticompetitive
strategies in order to ensure that it will maintain or otherwise
have a monopoly for any multi-user market, whether it be the
server operating system market, the PC sharing software market,
or the combination of the two markets,&#8221; MiniFrame said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiniFrame said there no technological reason multiple users
can&#8217;t access or use the same Windows Client Operating System at
the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft representative didn&#8217;t immediately return a
voice-mail message seeking comment about the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MiniFrame v. Microsoft Corp. 11-CV-7419, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, gained the most in a year
after its advertising sales overcame the absence of Carlos Slim&#8217;s business and World Cup soccer broadcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter advertising sales in the broadcast division,
Televisa&#8217;s largest unit, rose 2.4 percent to 6 billion pesos
($444.8 million), compared with the estimate of 5.95 billion
pesos by Gregorio Tomassi, an analyst at Banco Santander SA.
Advertising sales had declined from a year earlier in the
previous two quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soccer tournaments such as the Copa America helped the unit
sell more advertising than last year, when Televisa aired the
World Cup finals. Televisa is counting on other large customers
after Slim&#8217;s companies pulled their advertisements at the
beginning of this year because of a pricing dispute, said
Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investment in advertising by our core, long-lasting
client base remains strong,&#8221; de Angoitia said today on a
conference call. &#8220;Televisa&#8217;s over-the-air network continues to
be their preferred advertising vehicle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose 5.6 percent to 55.7 pesos at 10:57 a.m. in
Mexico City after earlier gaining as much as 6 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since Oct. 5, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income dropped to 2.05 billion pesos from 2.2 billion
pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based Televisa said yesterday
in a statement. Sales rose 8.1 percent to 16 billion pesos,
compared with the 15.8 billion peso average estimate of four
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;High-Level Fights&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Results beat on many important measures, which should help
quiet some concerns of the high-level fights between Televisa
and Carlos Slim and his entities,&#8221; David Joyce, an analyst at
Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, said in a research note today.
He advises buying the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa&#8217;s cable-TV unit is offering phone and Internet
service to compete with Slim&#8217;s Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the
nation&#8217;s largest phone company. The companies have each filed
antitrust complaints against the other this year as they jockey
for position in Mexico&#8217;s telecommunications market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income included a 389-million peso foreign-exchange
loss, a non-cash charge reflecting the value of its debt in
foreign currency. The peso slid 16 percent against the dollar
between June 30 and Sept. 30, the second-worst performer among
Latin America&#8217;s top currencies after Brazil&#8217;s real, on concern
that Mexico&#8217;s economy would falter as its biggest trading
partner, the U.S., struggled to expand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite Subscriptions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is diversifying beyond its over-the-air
broadcasting business to tap into growing demand for pay-TV
service in Mexico, where about 40 percent of households have a
cable or satellite subscription, according to government data.
Broadcast revenue has slowed as viewers turn to cable channels
and the Internet for entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa last year recorded a gain of 513 million pesos
from the sale of its stake in airline Volaris, a one-time
benefit that inflated profits compared with this year&#8217;s income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite subscriptions rose by 238,205 to 3.82 million,
and the three cable carriers controlled by Televisa added almost
34,000 TV customers for a total of 2.12 million. The carriers
are Cablemas SA, Empresas Cablevision SAB and Television
Internacional SA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veolia Environnement SA (VIE), the world&#8217;s
biggest water company, and rival Suez Environnement will be hurt
by a European economic decline as factories make less waste that
needs treating, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A deterioration of the economic environment in Europe may
result in weaker business, in particular for Veolia&#8217;s and Suez
Environnement&#8217;s waste activities,&#8221; analyst Dario Carradori said
in a note today. &#8220;Both stocks have a high sensitivity to
changes in GDP forecasts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank lowered earnings forecasts and share price targets
for the utilities because of reduced profits from waste
collection and treatment. Suez Environnement shares are now
rated &#8220;neutral&#8221; by Goldman, downgraded from a &#8220;buy,&#8221; while
the bank kept a &#8220;neutral&#8221; call on Veolia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veolia and Suez Environnement struggled to turn around
earnings after the economic slowdown that followed the 2008
financial crisis. That decline led to factory closures and
prompted the companies to shut waste sites. Veolia earlier this
year unveiled a restructuring plan to curb its global reach and
sell assets in a bid to reverse losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suez Environnement said in August it&#8217;s keeping targets for
2011 through 2013. This year it aims for growth in earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of at
least 10 percent at constant foreign exchange rates, and at
least 7 percent on average for 2012 and 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects Ebitda growth of 4 percent to 5
percent in 2012 and 2013, lower than the company&#8217;s targets,
according to today&#8217;s note. Suez Environnement spokeswoman Helene
Enginger declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suez Environnement will report third-quarter earnings Oct.
26 while Veolia Environnement is scheduled for publication on
Nov. 19 and will hold an investor day Dec. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veolia Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot
plans to halt operations in at least 37 countries and sell 1.3
billion euros ($1.8 billion) of assets this year to restore
profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which lost half its value this year, posted a
first-half loss on writedowns on operations in Italy, Morocco
and the U.S. and said it uncovered fraud at a U.S. business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said it&#8217;s unlikely that the U.S. economy
will slip back into recession.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There appears to be this mood around of inevitability
about the next quarter that we&#8217;re back into recession or close
to it,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in an interview on CNBC today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
really buy. Most of the ongoing reliable data is quite strong.
There&#8217;s no momentum for a recession.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It certainly seems that the U.S. is struggling with trend
growth, but something&#8221; about 2 percent &#8220;strikes me as the
cruising speed the U.S. is at now,&#8221; the economist told CNBC.
There will need to be &#8220;a lot of negative shocks going on to
drag the U.S. down,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill also said that &#8220;people seem to be convinced that
Europe going wrong is going to drag the U.S. down. That&#8217;s might
happen, but there&#8217;s a strong likelihood it won&#8217;t.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said support from European leaders for
Italy is critical for resolving the euro-zone debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Italy is what it&#8217;s all about now,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in an
interview on CNBC today. &#8220;Whatever they do, they&#8217;ve got to
ensure Italy is funded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There appears to be such a ingrained negative mood,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill told CNBC. &#8220;People are convinced that the euro zone
going down will drag the U.S. down. That&#8217;s possible,&#8221; but it&#8217;s
also may not happen, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s proposed
$8.5 billion settlement with mortgage-bond investors must be
considered in federal court and not in New York state court
where it was first filed, a U.S. judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement agreement at issue here implicates core
federal interests in the integrity of nationally chartered banks
and the vitality of the national securities markets,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan said in a decision
filed yesterday. &#8220;A controversy touching on these paramount
federal interests should proceed in federal court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed agreement would settle claims from investors
in Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage bonds and is a move by
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America to resolve
liabilities tied to its 2008 purchase of the home lender. The
deal was reached with an institutional investor group that
includes BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Pacific Investment Management Co.
and would apply to 530 mortgage-securitization trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the trustee for the
mortgage-bond trusts, filed the settlement in state court and
planned to seek approval at a November hearing. Under the state
proceeding, approval would bind investors outside the group that
negotiated the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. The bank had asked Pauley to return the
case to state court after it had been moved to federal court.
Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the institutional investor group
that negotiated the agreement, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail
seeking comment on it yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement agreement has been criticized by
some investors in the bonds, including American International
Group Inc. (AIG), which said in a court filing that Bank of America is
&#8220;drastically underpaying on its liability.&#8221; Other investors
have filed objections to the agreement, saying they need more
information to evaluate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One investor group, Walnut Place LLC and related entities,
moved the case to federal court in August. They said in a court
filing that they have &#8220;serious concerns about the adequacy of
the settlement and conflicts of interests of the parties that
negotiated it.&#8221; Investor claims &#8220;are worth many times&#8221; more
than $8.5 billion, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owen Cyrulnik, a lawyer for the Walnut Place entities,
declined to comment after a Sept. 21 court hearing about why
they wanted the case in federal court. In court papers, they
said Bank of New York filed the Article 77 proceeding, to
&#8220;cherry-pick&#8221; the benefits of class-action settlements and
&#8220;cast aside the aspects that it finds inconvenient,&#8221; mainly
the right of investors to opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David J. Grais, a lawyer for Walnut Place, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup to Pay $285 Million Over SEC&#8217;s CDO Fraud Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. lender, agreed to
pay $285 million to settle U.S. regulatory claims it misled
investors about a $1 billion financial product linked to risky
mortgages that defaulted within months of its sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup structured and sold the collateralized debt
obligation in 2007 without telling investors that it helped pick
about half the underlying assets and was betting they&#8217;d decline
in value, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a
statement yesterday. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) agreed to pay $2.5
million for its role in selecting the assets, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s settlement, the third-biggest penalty paid for
conduct related to the credit crisis, is the latest SEC action
against banks that bundled and sold securities linked to the
housing market. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) paid a record $550
million in 2010 for failing to tell investors that a hedge fund
that helped select a CDO&#8217;s assets was betting it would decline.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) paid $153.6 million in a similar matter in
June, and SEC officials have said more cases are on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors were not informed that Citigroup had decided to
bet against them and had helped choose the assets that would
determine who won or lost,&#8221; Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s
enforcement director, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approximately 15 clients in the deal known as Class V
Funding III lost virtually their entire investments. Citigroup
received about $34 million in fees and reaped about $126 million
in profits from the short position, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC also sued Brian Stoker, a former Citigroup employee
who the agency said was responsible for structuring the deal,
according to a complaint filed yesterday at U.S. District Court
in New York. Stoker&#8217;s attorney, Fraser Hunter, said his client
will &#8220;defend this lawsuit vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, McGraw-Hill Win Appeals in Retirement Plan Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and McGraw-Hill Cos. won appeals-court
decisions upholding dismissal of lawsuits brought by employees
claiming their retirement plans lost money invested in company
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld the
dismissals in companion ruling yesterday. In 2009, U.S. District
Judge Sidney Stein in New York found that Citigroup, the third-
biggest U.S. lender, didn&#8217;t breach its duty to the workers by
offering Citigroup stock as an investment option. In February
2010, U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan ruled similarly in
favor of McGraw-Hill, the finance and media company that is
splitting into two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Citigroup plan fiduciaries &#8220;didn&#8217;t abuse their
discretion here,&#8221; the appeals court wrote in that ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Citigroup suit was filed on behalf of 150,000 employees
covered by two retirement plans. The plaintiffs in the McGraw-
Hill case participated in one of two defined-contribution plans
offered by the company. Both cases were brought under the
federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, also
known as ERISA. Both companies are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re totally disappointed with the decision,&#8221; Marc I.
Machiz, a lawyer for the Citigroup employees, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed both for the Citigroup employees
who are not going to get a remedy for their losses and because
the decision makes it difficult or impossible to get a remedy
from a company that mismanages its plan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machiz, of Cohen Milstein Sellers  Toll PLLC in
Philadelphia, said it was likely the Citigroup plaintiffs would
ask the full appeals court to rehear the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwin Mills, a lawyer for the McGraw-Hill employees at
Stull, Stull  Brody in New York, didn&#8217;t immediately return a
call for comment on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Gray v. Citigroup Inc., 09-3804, and Gearren
v. McGraw-Hill Cos., 10-792, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iberiabank to Pay $2.5 Million to Settle Overdraft Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iberiabank Corp. (IBKC) agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle
consumer lawsuits accusing the Louisiana bank of illegally
charging excessive overdraft fees, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iberiabank officials also will change policies governing
the way debit-card transactions are handled in connection with
overdraft fees, the Lafayette, Louisiana-based bank said in an
Oct. 18 court filing in federal court in Miami. Overdraft suits
filed across the U.S. have been consolidated in that court for
pre-trial proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank customers who are covered by the settlement will
receive their share of the settlement fund &#8220;without having to
do anything at all,&#8221; lawyers for consumers who sued Iberiabank
over the overdraft policy, said in the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement comes nine months after Bank of America
Corp., the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, agreed to pay
$410 million to resolve similar claims over its overdraft
policies. In May, a judge in Miami gave preliminary approval to
the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daryl Byrd, Iberiabank&#8217;s president and chief executive
officer, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment on the settlement
yesterday. The bank didn&#8217;t admit any wrongdoing in the
settlement, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KV Pharmaceutical Sued Over Pregnancy Drug Pricing Statements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KV Pharmaceutical Co. (KV/A) was sued by an investor who accused
it of misleading shareholders about its marketing plans for
Makena, a drug intended to prevent premature births. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Julianello&#8217;s complaint, filed yesterday in federal
court in St. Louis, accuses the Bridgeton, Missouri, drugmaker,
Chief Executive Officer Gregory Divis and another executive,
Scott Goedeke, of making false statements in February about its
intent to make the drug widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and
Sherrod Brown of Ohio criticized KV the following month for
pricing Makena at $1,500 per injection, when it previously was
available for $10 to $20 per weekly dosage. KV shares fell 21
percent on March 30 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
said pharmacists were free to provide less-expensive versions.
KV dropped from $13.07 on March 8 to $4.60 on April 5, losing 65
percent of its value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decrease in the price of KV&#8217;s stock was a result of
the artificial inflation caused by defendants&#8217; misleading
statements,&#8221; according to Julianello&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seeks class-action, or group, status on behalf of
everyone who bought the company&#8217;s stock from Feb. 14 to April 4,
an an award of unspecified money damages, plus interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no reply yesterday to voice-mail or e-mail
messages left with the company&#8217;s investor relations department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Julianello v. KV Pharmaceutical Co., 11-
cv-01816, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri (St.
Louis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Sued by ATM User Over Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. were sued for allegedly colluding to fix access fees for
automated teller machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust suit, brought in federal court in Washington
by an ATM user and made public yesterday, also names Visa Inc. (V)
and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the world&#8217;s biggest payment networks, as
defendants. It is the third lawsuit filed in Washington in the
past week alleging price-fixing of ATM fees and surcharges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The violation in this case is a horizontal agreement
among every bank that is a member of the Visa and/or MasterCard
networks that charges ATM access fees on foreign ATM
transactions,&#8221; the complaint alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by a New Jersey man on behalf of
consumers who &#8220;have been forced to pay artificially inflated,
supra-competitive ATM access fees,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two earlier lawsuits, one filed Oct. 18 and the other Oct.
12, accuse Visa and MasterCard of antitrust violations for
restricting independent ATM operators from charging varying
prices for customers using alternative networks such as STAR,
Shazam Inc. or TransFund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman
for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the
suit. Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to telephone messages seeking
comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard, based in
Purchase, New York, said in an e-mailed statement that the
lawsuits &#8220;challenging certain MasterCard ATM rules are without
merit&#8221; and that the company will defend itself against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Valentine, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Visa,
declined to comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Genese v. Visa Inc., 11-1838, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Judge Grants Mets Owners&#8217; Request for Confidentiality &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Mets owners won new confidentiality
restrictions on information the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s
firm gathers ahead of a trial over his right to take back money
withdrawn from the con man&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan set a March 19
trial date for trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s case against the Major
League Baseball team owners after narrowing by two-thirds the $1
billion demanded by Picard from Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz. In an
order published yesterday, Rakoff said he disagreed with Picard,
who had said Rakoff couldn&#8217;t modify the confidentiality rules
the trustee currently uses in bankruptcy court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants&#8217; proposal keeps confidential everything
that was previously marked confidential and simply adds some
modest, standard, further restrictions,&#8221; Rakoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee&#8217;s fear of added administrative burdens from the
changes &#8220;appears exaggerated,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-
mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard initially sued the Mets owners in bankruptcy court.
They asked Rakoff to handle the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Seeks Data on Sprint&#8217;s Wireless Deals in Antitrust Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T), the wireless carrier fighting U.S. efforts to
block its proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA Inc., asked for
data on rival Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)&#8217;s past corporate transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT asked Sprint for documents relating to transactions
entered into since January 2004, including deals with Nextel
Communications Inc., Virgin Mobile and Clearwire Corp.,
according to a filing in Washington federal court yesterday by
Sprint, which filed its own lawsuit to halt the T-Mobile deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint said the request shows why U.S. District Judge Ellen
Segal Huvelle should give it access to data Dallas-based ATT
turned over to the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Requests for these types of documents go far beyond
ordinary, non-party merger case discovery, which focuses on the
current competitive landscape, not on the details of every
transaction entered into by a competitor in the last eight
years,&#8221; Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint and Ridgeland, Mississippi-based Cellular South Inc.
urged Huvelle to let their outside lawyers and experts use
ATT&#8217;s private data to prepare for trial in their own lawsuits.
To deprive them of that opportunity creates a &#8220;fundamental
unfairness,&#8221; the wireless carriers said in an earlier filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Taylor, a spokesman for Sprint, declined to comment
beyond the filing. Michael Balmoris, an ATT spokesman, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department sued ATT and Bonn-based Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a combination of
the two companies would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce competition.
Seven states and Puerto Rico joined the effort to block the
deal, which would make ATT the biggest U.S. wireless carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countrywide Suit Belongs in N.Y. State Court, FHFA Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countrywide Financial Corp. defendants improperly moved a
suit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency to federal court in
Manhattan from state court in an attempt to transfer it to a
multidistrict litigation case in California, the agency said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countrywide was among 17 banks sued by the FHFA in
September. The FHFA alleges it lost &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221;
after Countrywide offered $26.6 billion worth of residential
mortgage backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from
2005 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FHFA says Countrywide filed a removal notice to move the
case to federal court in Manhattan on Sept. 30. At least 11 of
16 other suits brought by the agency are currently before
federal judges in New York. Countrywide also filed a notice on
Oct. 3 to transfer the case to the Central District of
California, where a multidistrict litigation that relates to it
is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In their bid to achieve removal, the Countrywide
defendants stretch the doctrines upon which they rely beyond the
breaking point,&#8221; FHFA said in court papers filed yesterday.
&#8220;The Countrywide defendants&#8217; preferred forum is not the legal
forum,&#8221; FHFA said. &#8220;Plaintiff FHFA thus respectfully requests
that this action be remanded to New York state Supreme Court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, which
acquired Countrywide in 2008, declined to comment on the U.S.
request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is FHFA v. Countrywide Financial Corp., 11cv6916,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Loses Bid to Revise $2.4 Billion Lehman Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) lost a bid to reclassify $2.4 billion in
claims on Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) as a judge denied a
request to force the defunct firm to upgrade their value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, which told a judge that about $100 million
is at stake in the classification, can take up the issue again
later, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck said at a court hearing
yesterday in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s largest lender bought the claims from a Lehman
affiliate, Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG, in July 2010. Consisting
of a $1.4 billion IOU from the Lehman parent and a $1 billion
IOU from Lehman&#8217;s commercial-paper unit, they were classified at
the time as general unsecured claims. Lehman ranked them in
August as affiliate claims, which were worth less, in the third
version of its $65 billion liquidation plan, Deutsche Bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My understanding is that Deutsche Bank bought the claims
under an acquisition agreement,&#8221; Peck told lawyers from the
Frankfurt-based bank. &#8220;You acquired affiliate claims and you
can&#8217;t improve your position simply because Deutsche Bank isn&#8217;t
an affiliate of Lehman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is &#8220;still discussing internally&#8221; if it would
continue to support Lehman&#8217;s plan if the claims aren&#8217;t revised,
Alan Kolod, a lawyer for Deutsche Bank, told Peck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman had a right to reclassify the claims under a deal
struck with bankrupt Bankhaus last year on settling intercompany
obligations, lawyer Harvey Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing limited Lehman&#8217;s ability to make different
classifications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nothing says Bankhaus will get the
highest recovery of all unsecured claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sophisticated buyer, &#8220;Deutsche Bank took a business
risk&#8221; by buying the Bankhaus claims before Lehman settled on a
final plan, Miller said. The bank made the purchase without
consulting Lehman about their possible value in a revised plan,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus Jury Reviews More Testimony at Hynix-Micron Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury deliberating whether Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) and
Micron Technology Inc. (MU) conspired to push Rambus Inc. (RMBS) out of the
memory-chip market reviewed trial testimony by Farhad Tabrizi, a
former Hynix executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Superior Court Judge James McBride in San
Francisco said yesterday that the 12-member jury, which has been
deliberating since Sept. 22, requested information about
Tabrizi&#8217;s testimony that he was &#8220;pressured to become more
upbeat about&#8221; Rambus-designed dynamic random access memory
chips, or RDRAM, at a May 2000 chip industry forum. Rambus
lawyers questioned Tabrizi, a former Hynix vice president of
worldwide marketing, &#8220;extensively&#8221; about whether his
enthusiasm was &#8220;genuine,&#8221; McBride said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McBride said in his chambers that he reviewed testimony
excerpts with lawyers from both sides to be read back to the
jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know that Mr. Tabrizi was not the most terse
witness,&#8221; and that he &#8220;tended to fold in a lot of topics in
any answer,&#8221; which produced objections from lawyers during
trial, McBride said. &#8220;The jury in its collective wisdom will
ask further questions&#8221; if the testimony isn&#8217;t satisfactory, the
judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus, based in Sunnyvale, California, contends that
Boise, Idaho-based Micron and Ichon, South Korea-based Hynix
colluded to cut the prices of their own SDRAM, or synchronous
dynamic random access memory, chips and deserted their
commitment to produce RDRAM, relegating it to a niche role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus contends it would have earned $3.95 billion in
royalties without the alleged conspiracy. Under California law,
a jury finding of damages in that amount would be automatically
tripled to $11.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Hynix and Micron argued that Rambus has only
itself to blame, not collusion by rivals, for the flaws and
production delays that led to the failure of its product to

&lt;p&gt;Milan Swap Fees May Not Cover Risk, Depfa Executive Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks that sold swaps to Milan may lose money on the
transactions because the fees charged don&#8217;t cover all the risk
assumed, Marco Santarcangelo, a Depfa Bank Plc banker on trial
for fraud, told a Milan court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Milan isn&#8217;t required to post collateral against
a potential loss on its swaps while banks such as Depfa must do
so with their counterparties, Santarcangelo said yesterday.
Margins on the swaps may be insufficient to cover the banks&#8217;
cost of funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG (UBSN), Deutsche Bank AG and Dublin-
based Depfa are on trial on charges of mis-selling swaps to
Milan, derivatives that adjusted payments on a 1.7 billion-euro
($2.4 billion) bond offering in 2005. Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo
said the banks misled Milan by telling the city it could save
about 55 million euros with the bond sale and a series of swaps.
Robledo says the banks earned 101 million euros in hidden fees.
The banks deny the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depfa, a unit of Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, charged total
gross margins of about 18 million euros on the 2005 swaps and
subsequent restructurings, Santarcangelo told the court. The
firm&#8217;s derivative traders assured Santarcangelo that the fees
were in line with market practice, he said. At the end of the
30-year deal, banks may still record a loss, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queen&#8217;s Law Firm Knew of News Corp. (NWSA) Hacking Lie to Lawmakers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farrer  Co., the law firm whose clients include Queen
Elizabeth II, knew News Corp.&#8217;s U.K. unit lied to Parliament in
2009 about the extent of phone hacking at its British tabloid
and didn&#8217;t take action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. had evidence hacking was widespread when it told
Parliament two years ago that a &#8220;rogue&#8221; reporter at the News
of the World was to blame, Farrer  Co. lawyer Julian Pike told
lawmakers yesterday. He also revealed a previously undisclosed
May 2008 meeting at which he said James Murdoch was told about
phone-hacking at the paper, in addition to the June 2008 meeting
about which other company executives had testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation was &#8220;not ideal,&#8221; Pike said when asked by
lawmakers whether the queen&#8217;s law firm should let other clients
lie to Parliament. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it caused me any professional
embarrassment. I do behave with integrity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which negotiated the company&#8217;s first settlement
with a hacking victim in 2008, was dropped by News Corp. two
days ago after it said it needed to consolidate its legal
representation in dozens of lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence centered around an e-mail produced by police
during settlement talks with hacking victim Gordon Taylor, the
head of the Professional Footballers&#8217; Association, which showed
transcripts of hacked voice mails had been passed around the
News of the World newsroom. The e-mail showed wrongdoing went
beyond the tabloid&#8217;s royal reporter Clive Goodman and private
investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who were both jailed in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quinn Emanuel to Open Moscow Office to Aid London Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan LLP, a Los Angeles-based
law firm, plans to open a Moscow office this year as more
Russians seek to bring cases in London courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russians don&#8217;t have a lot of faith and confidence in
their own legal system in Moscow and so they often agree to
resolve disputes in London,&#8221; John Quinn, the firm&#8217;s managing
partner, said yesterday in a phone interview. &#8220;We want to have
a base in Moscow and to be close to clients there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinn Emanuel, which has 20 lawyers in London, plans to
have 10 attorneys in Moscow within six months, he said. The firm
hired Ivan Marisin and Vasily Kuznetsov from Dechert LLP in
Moscow to start the new office, with Marisin as managing
partner. Their clients have included Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. (BK) and Societe Generale SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are both experienced, extremely well-respected
litigators with a track record of success both in Russia and
internationally,&#8221; Quinn said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinn Emanuel specializes in intellectual-property and
class-action litigation. The firm has nine offices and most
recently opened a site in Mannheim, Germany, in March 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Friend Goel&#8217;s Sentencing Postponed Until January &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajiv Goel, a former Intel Corp. (INTC) managing director who
testified at the insider-trading trial of his onetime friend Raj
Rajaratnam, will be sentenced Jan. 20 for his crimes, a judge
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goel had been set to be sentenced in Manhattan federal
court last month. In response to a letter from prosecutors
seeking a delay, U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell set the
January date. The decision was posted on the docket yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goel pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud in
February 2010, and testified in March against the Galleon Group
LLC co-founder in a bid for leniency. Goel said he had known
Rajaratnam for 25 years and said he told him about Intel&#8217;s
earnings in 2007 and a $1 billion transaction in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top penalty for insider trading is 20 years in prison,
prosecutors said at the time of Goel&#8217;s plea. Rajaratnam, 54, the
central figure in what U.S. investigators called the largest
hedge fund insider trading case in U.S. history, was sentenced
to 11 years in prison on Oct. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goel said he and Rajaratnam became friends at the Wharton
School at the University of Pennsylvania, from which they
graduated in 1983, and grew close over ensuing years. The
families vacationed together, said Goel, a native of Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goel, who worked in Intel&#8217;s treasury unit, was arrested
along with Rajaratnam in 2009, charged with passing tips about a
firm that Santa Clara, California-based Intel made an investment
in as well information about Intel&#8217;s $1 billion investment in a
new wireless network company formed by Clearwire Corp. and
Sprint Nextel Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goel, 10-cr-90, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) expects production
costs of handsets using Windows Phone 7 software next year to
drop by more than half from when the platform was introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with parts makers including Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) will
allow phones using Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft&#8217;s mobile
operating system to be produced for less than $200, compared
with $400 when the software was released last year, Andy Lees,
head of the Windows Phone division, said in an interview in Hong
Kong today. The actual retail price will be determined by
operators, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is competing with Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) to
gain a bigger share of the $207 billion mobile-phone market,
where it lags behind the Android and iOS platforms. The first
models using the latest version of Windows Phone 7, called
Mango, have already been shipped in Japan, with devices to be
available in China next year, Lees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Volume, volume, volume,&#8221; is Microsoft&#8217;s main motivation
for helping vendors offer cheaper handsets, Lees said, declining
to identify phone makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models using Mango to be introduced in the next few months
will require as little as $220 to produce, before the cost falls
further in 2012, Lees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are supporting componentry that will allow us to go
below $200,&#8221; he said, referring to handset production costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower prices will mean less royalty revenue per phone
because Microsoft offers tiered pricing, based on the
manufacturing cost of the handset, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft works exclusively with Qualcomm to develop chips
that power handsets using its system, allowing it to specify
technical details to ensure devices run more smoothly, the
executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no plan to work with other semiconductor
makers for Windows Phone 7 devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC Corp. (2498), Samsung Electronics Co. and ZTE Corp. (000063) are among
device makers that have already developed handsets using Windows
Phone 7. Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), which has agreed to develop phones with
Microsoft, will outline its plans for Windows phones next week,
Lees said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank,
may cut about 1,700 more jobs at the investment bank as it
shrinks the fixed-income business, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts
led by Kian Abouhossein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors would welcome a strategy aimed at shrinking
UBS&#8217;s investment bank division and aligning it to mainly support
the private banking franchise,&#8221; the analysts said in a note
today. &#8220;We would expect the restructured investment bank to
consume materially less capital with improved returns for the
investment bank and the group.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank could reduce risk-weighted assets in the fixed-
income business by 70 billion Swiss francs ($77.4 billion),
freeing up about 7 billion francs of capital, the analysts
estimated. The job cuts, representing about 11 percent of total
headcount at the investment bank, would be on top of the
announced reductions of about 1,575 positions, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich-based UBS plans to reorganize the investment bank to
focus on &#8220;advisory, capital markets and client flow and
solutions businesses,&#8221; making the unit &#8220;less complex,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Tom Naratil said at an investor presentation
in London on Oct. 4. The unit will aim to boost return on equity
as UBS reallocates more shareholders&#8217; funds toward wealth and
asset management, Naratil said. The bank plans to explain its
strategy to investors on Nov. 17.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank may shrink its rates and structured credit 
businesses to one third of their current size, exit the 
commodities business and slim the credit trading unit by about 
20 percent, the JPMorgan analysts, who have an &#8220;overweight&#8221; 
rating on the bank, estimated. UBS is unlikely to seek 
reorganization of its equities business, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank''s interim chief executive officer, Sergio 
Ermotti, has decided to reduce the size of the investment bank
and to bolster UBS''s focus on wealth management, the Wall 
Street Journal reported today, citing unidentified people 
familiar with his thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS said last month it suffered a $2.3 billion loss from
unauthorized trading in stock index futures at its investment
bank. The trading losses have led to the departures of Chief
Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel and the co-heads of global
equities, Francois Gouws and Yassine Bouhara, as well as the
suspension of a number of front office staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kweku Adoboli, the trader accused of causing the loss, goes
before a London judge today and may enter a plea before his case
is transferred to a higher criminal court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR) AS, Turkey&#8217;s
largest listed bank by assets, was added to the &#8220;focus sell&#8221;
list of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which said the bank is exposed
to &#8220;increasing macro headwinds&#8221; that are likely to &#8220;weigh on
price performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asset growth will likely remain capped by lack of
abundant resources in local currency and unattractively priced
wholesale funding,&#8221; analysts including Waleed Mohsin in London
said in an e-mailed report today. &#8220;Macro headwinds and below-
sector returns would drive share price underperformance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s 12-month price estimate for Isbank is 4.33 liras.
Isbank fell 1.1 percent to 4.55 liras at 10:04 a.m. in Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isbank joins Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN), Turkey&#8217;s largest

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a
judge in New York state court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by
Allstate Insurance Co. over the alleged fraudulent sale of
residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer sued New York-based
Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Aug. 15 over the sale of more than $100 million worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
including the lost market value of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allstate filed the lawsuit and seven similar complaints
against various issuers and underwriters of residential
mortgage-backed securities, using &#8220;generalities and unsupported
assumptions&#8221; to recoup investment losses on certificates it
bought in five offerings in 2006, Goldman Sachs said in court
documents filed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite its financial sophistication and expertise
(including in the housing market, where it is a leading
insurer), Allstate now suffers from buyer&#8217;s remorse and has sued
the counterparties with which it traded at arm&#8217;s length,
claiming in separate actions that each of the eight sellers of
RMBS misled it as to characteristics of the securities,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allstate has also sued lenders including JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill
Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over residential
mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investments, pools of home loans securitized into
bonds, were a central part of the housing bubble that helped
send the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The
housing market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and
investment banks as the market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,
652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sophia Pearson" date="Oct 21, 2011  3:52 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-21/goldman-sachs-sued-for-role-in-el-paso-s-21-billion-takeover.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Sued Over &#8216;Conflict&#8217; in Planned $21 Billion El Paso Takeover</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by
a pension fund that alleges the New York-based investment bank
had a conflict of interest in its role as adviser in the planned
$21 billion purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP) by Kinder Morgan Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder
Morgan, steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan,&#8221; lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Goldman Sachs, the complaint also names
individual El Paso directors and Kinder Morgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser on the
sale, Goldman&#8217;s presence &#8220;tainted the entire process,&#8221; lawyers
for the retirement fund said in the complaint. Goldman continued
to act as financial adviser on &#8220;related matters&#8221; in connection
with the transaction, the pension fund said in the complaint,
citing the companies&#8217; joint press statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiduciary Duty &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is accused of aiding and abetting a breach of
fiduciary duty by El Paso directors. In addition to seeking
unspecified damages, the pension fund is asking a judge to order
the directors to give &#8220;full and fair consideration&#8221; to any
alternative offers for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retirement fund also faulted El Paso directors for
agreeing to an inadequate deal in light of the surge in demand
for pipelines, the pricing power Kinder Morgan will garner as a
result of the transaction and the premiums paid for past energy
deals. The board &#8220;virtually eliminated&#8221; the prospect of
a superior offer by agreeing to unreasonable deal protection
devices including a no-shop clause and a punitive $650 million
termination fee, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the lawsuit except to say that the bank&#8217;s
representatives on Kinder Morgan&#8217;s board recused themselves from
the deal process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan,
said in an e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending
litigation. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, also
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash and Stock &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Paso, based in Houston, said Oct. 16 it would be bought
for cash and stock to create the largest natural-gas pipeline
network in the U.S. The company was sued earlier this week by a
shareholder over claims the deal undervalues it shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity arm was one of Richard
Kinder&#8217;s co-investors when he took his company private in 2007.
The firm remains one of the largest Kinder Morgan shareholders
and has two representatives on the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Kinder kicked off the takeover talks in late August
when he approached El Paso&#8217;s Douglas Foshee, said Joe Hollier, a
Kinder Morgan spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That disrupted a previous plan by El Paso, announced in
May, to spin off its exploration and production assets to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Steve Daniel had been advising El Paso on
the spinoff. For the talks with Kinder Morgan, El Paso instead
turned to a Morgan Stanley team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Shannon D. Harrington" date="Oct 21, 2011  3:06 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-21/liquidity-is-squeezed-for-block-trading-of-corporate-bonds-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Liquidity Pinched on Corporate Block Trades, JPMorgan Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Banks and money managers are having
a tougher time trading corporate bonds in large sizes and older
issues as Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis limits risk-taking,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of transactions in the investment-grade bond
market that are larger than $5 million, known as block trades,
has dropped to 43 percent from as high as 54 percent in 2011,
JPMorgan credit strategist led by Eric Beinstein in New York
wrote in a note to investors today. Buying and selling has
become concentrated in so-called on-the-run bonds, which
typically are recent issues, while relative trading in non-
financial company debt is at a record low, compared to financial
debentures, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report illustrates where liquidity in credit markets
has evaporated most as a JPMorgan survey of investors this month
showed all respondents were concerned with the ease at which
they can trade. While such corners of the market have been
impacted, overall volumes have remained stable, they said, even
as dealers reduced their inventories to an eight-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Liquidity is people&#8217;s ability to get done what they want
to get done,&#8221; Beinstein said in a telephone interview. &#8220;If
you&#8217;re trying to trade off-the-run bonds now, that&#8217;s a little
bit harder. If you&#8217;re trying to trade larger blocks, the data
suggests that&#8217;s harder as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of trading completed in blocks of $5 million
or larger reached as low as 41 percent at the end of September.
      Trading volumes in the top 20 percent of investment-grade
corporate bonds have climbed to levels on par with those during
the months before the 2008 credit crisis, the strategists wrote
in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more concentrated the trading, the less breadth there
is to liquidity,&#8221; the New York-based analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of buying and selling in non-financial company
debt, which makes up two thirds of the investment-grade bond
market, has shrunk relative to trading in bonds of banks and
other financial companies, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of trading in non-financial debt relative to the
amount of debt outstanding has dropped to 0.17 percent, compared
with 0.23 percent for financial debt. The gap &#8220;has never been
this large and this long-lasting,&#8221; the strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor perceptions of liquidity have deteriorated as
banks globally face increased capital requirements and potential
losses from debt-laden European nations including Greece,
Portugal and Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealer Inventories &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bondholders will need to take deeper losses on Greek
government bonds to make the country&#8217;s debt sustainable,
according to a report dated today on the nation&#8217;s finances by
international creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve data showed that dealer inventories of
corporate bonds dropped to the lowest since July 2003 the week
ended Oct. 5. The 22 primary dealers of U.S. government
securities that trade directly with the Fed reduced inventories
of corporate debt due in more than a year to $54.6 billion, down
42 percent since May. The level climbed to $55.5 billion in the
week ended Oct. 12, Fed data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the drop in inventories and overall limits in risk-
taking by investors is likely impairing liquidity in pockets of
the market such as block trades, overall trading volumes have
increased this year, the JPMorgan analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Trading volumes are actually pretty stable, even though
it&#8217;s true that dealers have smaller positions than they had
previously,&#8221; Beinstein said in the interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little
more subtle than the general perception.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between where dealers will buy and sell securities
also has widened, although the analysts said that&#8217;s because of
the higher relative yields at which bonds are trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average bid-ask spread has increased to 12 basis points
from eight at the start of the year, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proportion of bid/ask spread to the overall level of
spreads is slightly down, meaning that nothing has changed
structurally,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;Merely, more bonds are trading at
wider levels than before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Xavier Niel teamed up with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s private-
equity unit to bid for France Telecom SA (FTE)&#8217;s Swiss mobile-phone
unit, according to a person familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50-50 joint offer for Orange Suisse is being made
through one of Niel&#8217;s personal holding companies, rather than
Iliad, the broadband provider in which he is the majority
shareholder, the person said, declining to be identified because
the talks are private. The Swiss unit could fetch about 2
billion euros ($2.8 billion), people with knowledge of the
matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France Telecom is exiting Switzerland as part of a plan to
re-orient its business toward fast-growing markets in the Middle
East and Africa. The company this week agreed to buy Congo-China
Telecom, the fourth-largest mobile operator in the Democratic
Republic of Congo. The Swiss sale has also drawn interest from
Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris and private-equity firms
including Apax Partners LLP and EQT Partners, people familiar
with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Les Echos reported
earlier today that Niel had bid for Orange Suisse with
assistance from the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France Telecom Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard
today said he aims to sell the Swiss operation by the end of
this year. The company is also targeting its Austrian and
Portuguese units for disposal. The former French phone monopoly
is under pressure at home due in part to Iliad, which is
entering the mobile market next year with a pledge to drive down
prices that are higher than the European average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France Telecom shares traded 1.6 percent higher at 12.82
euros as of 3:46 p.m. in Paris. The stock has declined 18
percent this year as competition and regulatory changes cut
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niel, whose stake in Iliad is worth about 2.9 billion
euros, has used his fortune to become one of France&#8217;s most
prolific venture capitalists, putting about 50 million euros a
year into young technology companies. This year he and two other
French Internet executives, vente-privee.com founder Jacques-
Antoine Granjon and Meetic.com founder Marc Simoncini, opened a
school in central Paris to train aspiring digital entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) appointed
Greg Agran and Magid Shenouda as co-heads of commodities
trading, according to a company memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo, dated Oct. 18, was confirmed today by Sophie
Bullock, a company spokeswoman based in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agran and Shenouda are based in New York and London,
respectively. They replace Jeffrey Resnick, global head of
commodities trading, who decided to retire at the end of this
year after 18 years at the Wall Street firm, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $3.6 billion of revenue from its
commodities business in 2006 and $3.4 billion in 2007, according
to documents released this year by the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. Goldman likely has a 15 percent
to 20 percent market share in commodities, which generated
industry revenue of $6 billion to $7 billion last year,
according to estimates from Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agran is currently head of U.S. natural gas and power
trading and head of global commodities principal investing. He
joined Goldman Sachs in 1991 as an analyst in New York and was
named managing director in 1999 and partner in 2006, according
to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenouda is the bank&#8217;s head of European crude oil and
products trading and European gas and power trading. He joined
Goldman Sachs in 1999 as a vice president in London, after
working as a physical fuel oil trader at independent energy
trader Trafigura Beheer BV. He was responsible for expanding
Goldman&#8217;s physical commodities business, including expanding its
coal, freight, and emissions franchise, the memo said. He was
promoted to managing director in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs competes with other banks in commodities,
including Morgan Stanley (MS), which also has a 15 to 20 percent
market share, according to Schorr at Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kweku Adoboli, the trader accused of
costing UBS AG (UBSN) $2.3 billion by making unauthorized trades,
falsified records on exchange-traded-fund transactions,
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors amended two of the four charges against Adoboli
to indicate that records he allegedly falsified were on ETF
trades. A London magistrates court yesterday transferred the
case against the 31-year-old to a criminal court where he will
be expected to enter a plea on the accusations at a Nov. 22
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges, which also include two counts of fraud and
date back to 2008, cover &#8220;a large number of transactions,&#8221;
prosecutor David Williams said at the hearing yesterday. &#8220;He
exposed the bank to risk of large losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli has been in custody since his arrest on Sept. 15,
when UBS asked the City of London police to detain him after he
reported the losses. He was charged two days later with fraud
and false accounting. The trading loss prosecutors claim he was
responsible for led to the departures of Chief Executive Officer
Oswald Gruebel and the co-heads of the Swiss bank&#8217;s global
equities business. Adoboli was fired by the bank on Sept. 17,
Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs are exchange-listed products that mirror indexes,
commodities, bonds and currencies and allow investors to buy and
sell them like stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli, who holds a Ghanaian passport, appeared before a
panel of three judges yesterday and his lawyer Patrick Gibbs
said he wouldn&#8217;t indicate how his client planned to plead. He
said through his lawyer at a hearing last month he was &#8220;sorry
beyond words&#8221; for his &#8220;disastrous miscalculations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC Cases Bypass Top Executives, Target Employees for Negligence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central piece of evidence against Citigroup Inc. (C) that led
to a $285 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission is an e-mail message from a former employee to his
supervisor, Bloomberg News&#8217; Joshua Gallu and Jesse Hamilton
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell&#8221; a counterparty that Citigroup is shorting
the security, former employee Brian Stoker wrote in 2006 to his
unnamed supervisor. The agency sued Stoker, saying he was
responsible for structuring the deal in which Citigroup failed
to disclose that it had chosen about half the assets and was
betting they would decline in value. No charges were announced
against the supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That detail highlights a pattern in SEC enforcement cases
that is drawing criticism from lawyers and lawmakers: Even as
the agency has collected $2 billion in penalties from financial
firms for wrongdoing related to the 2008 financial crisis, few
top executives have been sanctioned, particularly in connection
with complex instruments like collateralized-debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very good to hold a corporation responsible, but
these corporations are run by people,&#8221; Representative Michael
Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat and senior member of the House
Financial Services subcommittee on investigations, said in an
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible for me to believe&#8221; a firm would
allow an individual to make deals without supervision that later
&#8220;are found to be so beyond the pale that someone has to pay
hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoker&#8217;s attorney, Fraser Hunter, said his client will
&#8220;defend this lawsuit vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has faced growing criticism from investors,
lawmakers and judges who have claimed the agency has been more
concerned about reaching expedient settlements with companies
than rooting out wrongdoing by individuals that may have
contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC officials have countered that many of the causes of the
financial crisis involved poor decision-making that might not
qualify as illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let&#8217;s keep in mind that obviously not all losses in the
financial crisis resulted from fraud and misconduct,&#8221; SEC
Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said Oct. 19 in an interview
with Bloomberg Television. &#8220;We can&#8217;t sue people based on poor
judgment or poor risk-management policies or procedures or
investments that perform badly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failed Bank&#8217;s Shabudin, Yu Plead Not Guilty in Fraud Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former United Commercial Bank executives Ebrahim Shabudin
and Thomas Yu pleaded not guilty to hiding loan losses from
auditors and investors in the failed San Francisco-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shabudin, a former chief credit officer, and Yu, a former
credit risk manager, were charged by federal prosecutors with
six counts. The pair and Thomas Wu, the bank&#8217;s former chief
executive officer, were also sued by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and accused of hiding $65 million in loan
losses before the bank collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shabudin and Yu were the first senior bank officials
charged with fraud at a financial institution that got money
from the government&#8217;s Trouble Assets Relief Program, known as
TARP. The program was meant to shore up financial institutions
hit with losses from mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Commercial received $298 million from TARP in
November 2008 after Yu and Shabudin manipulated books and
records to conceal the amount of bad loans and avoid publicly
reporting losses, according to a Sept. 15 indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank failed in November of that year and was taken over
by the government, which has paid out $397 million. The failure
has cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&#8217;s insurance fund
$2.5 billion, the SEC said in its complaint. No TARP funds have
been repaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shabudin and Yu were released yesterday after the judge
ordered them each to post a $500,000 property bond. The next
court hearing is scheduled for Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v Shabudin, 3:11-cr-00664, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).
The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Wu, 4:11-

&lt;p&gt;Two Oil Traders Admit Kickbacks to Ex-LyondellBasell Worker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two oil traders pleaded guilty to paying more than $20
million in kickbacks to a former LyondellBasell Industries NV
executive who scheduled oil shipments for the company&#8217;s Houston
refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders Bernard Langley, 54, of the U.K., and Clyde
Meltzer, 65, of Houston and Livingston, New Jersey, said in
federal court in Houston that they paid the kickbacks to
LyondellBasell&#8217;s Jonathan Barnes, according to a statement by
the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office. Barnes agreed to pay above-market
shipping rates to tanker companies controlled by the two traders
to transport Venezuelan crude oil to Houston, in exchange for
one-third of the profits the traders received, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From 2007 through late 2009, when new management at
Lyondell discovered the overcharges, Langley and Meltzer used
Swiss bank accounts to pay Barnes more than $20 million in
kickbacks,&#8221; Houston U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langley and Meltzer agreed to forfeit more than $20 million
in assets, including cash from bank accounts in Switzerland and
Monoco, luxury and classic cars, jewelry, real estate in Texas
and Florida, and their investment in a Houston sports bar,
according to Magidson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langley and Meltzer could be sentenced to as much as 20
years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of as much as $57
million when they are sentenced in January, according to
Magidson&#8217;s statement. The two men have been in federal custody
since December, when both were arrested in Houston after a
recorded meeting with Barnes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes was indicted in November of last year and has been
cooperating with prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to his role in
the scheme in March, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We found a problem, we reported it, and we worked closely
with the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in Houston to identify what had
happened,&#8221; David Harpole, a spokesman for Rotterdam-based
LyondellBasell, said in a phone interview yesterday. He said the
company discovered the kickbacks when an internal audit &#8220;raised
questions about certain marine charter payments that were
outside the norms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Barnes, H-10-787-S, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Sued by MiniFrame Over Alleged Unfair Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest software maker, was
sued by Israel-based MiniFrame Ltd. for allegedly offering
anticompetitive terms for multiserver operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiniFrame said Microsoft uses its monopoly on the client
operating-system market to interfere with potential partners and
customers. Before 2007, Microsoft didn&#8217;t include any
restrictions in its licenses that would prevent multiple users,
MiniFrame said in a complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan
federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiniFrame alleges that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
is attempting to retain its monopoly on the server operating-
system market and the client operating-system market and is
attempting to monopolize the personal-computer sharing software
market and the multiuser software market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft recognized the competitive threat which shared
PC systems posed and engaged in several anticompetitive
strategies in order to ensure that it will maintain or otherwise
have a monopoly for any multiuser market, whether it be the
server operating system market, the PC sharing software market,
or the combination of the two markets,&#8221; MiniFrame said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiniFrame said there no technological reason multiple users
can&#8217;t access or use the same Windows Client Operating System at
the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft representative didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail
message seeking comment about the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MiniFrame v. Microsoft Corp. 11-CV-7419, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedbush Lawsuit Says Ex-Employees Took Secrets to Liquidnet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedbush Securities Inc. sued two former employees and
trading platform Liquidnet Holdings Inc., accusing them of
taking customer lists, documents and disclosures from the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit accuses New York-based Liquidnet, used by
institutional investors to buy and sell large blocks of shares,
and the ex-employees, Louis Kerner and Michael Silverstein, of
working together to take proprietary information from Wedbush in
order to start the same business at Liquidnet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidnet said on Oct. 17 that it hired Kerner to run a new
group focused on private companies, and that he would be joined
by Silverstein. Wedbush filed the lawsuit yesterday in New York
State Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Kerner, Silverstein and Liquidnet engaged, and continue
to engage, in the premeditated taking and misappropriation of
certain of Wedbush&#8217;s most valuable trade secret and confidential
and proprietary information,&#8221; Wedbush said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidnet received the lawsuit and is reviewing it closely,
Melissa Kanter, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-
mail. She declined to comment further on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerner began working for Los Angeles-based Wedbush in its
New York office in April 2010 and had been managing director of
its Private Shares Group since March, while Silverstein began
working in Wedbush&#8217;s Los Angeles office in February and had been
reporting to Kerner and others since April, Wedbush said in the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerner called a Wedbush managing director on Oct. 16 and
told him that he and Silverstein would be joining a competitor
the next day, Wedbush said in the complaint. The managing
director, Cyrus Pirasteh, reminded Kerner of his confidentiality
obligations, and Kerner replied that the Private Shares Group&#8217;s
clients belonged to him and that Wedbush could speak to his
lawyers if the firm had &#8220;a problem with that,&#8221; according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wedbush Securities Inc. v. Liquidnet Inc.,
652875/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Louis Berger Group President Charged With False Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former president and chief executive officer of Louis
Berger Group Inc., a New Jersey engineering consulting firm, was
charged with overbilling the U.S. government on overseas
reconstruction projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derish Wolff, 76, was accused of conspiring to defraud the
U.S. Agency for International Development by inflating overhead
and other indirect costs over almost two decades on hundreds of
millions of dollars in contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. He
surrendered yesterday to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in
Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During decades at the helm of a company entrusted with
the rebuilding of battle-scarred nations Derish Wolff focused on
profits over progress,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a
statement. &#8220;Wolff allegedly used his position to lead others in
the scheme, setting targets that could be reached only through
fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment follows an agreement by the company on Nov.
5 to pay $69.3 million to resolve criminal and civil probes
related to overbilling for reconstruction contracts in Iraq and
Afghanistan and other work. Two former executives also pleaded
guilty that day in federal court in Newark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolff was charged with conspiring with Salvatore Pepe, the
former chief financial officer, and Precy Pellettieri, the
former controller, who admitted to conspiring to defraud USAID.
The Wolff indictment, unsealed yesterday, doesn&#8217;t specify a
specific amount of loss by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolff, a resident of Miami and Bernardsville, New Jersey,
appeared in federal court in Newark, where he was released on $1
million bail. He faces as long as 10 years in prison on the
conspiracy charge and five years on each of five counts of
filing false claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Wolff intends to plead not guilty because he is not
guilty, and he looks forward to establishing it in court,&#8221; his
attorney, Herbert Stern, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Wolff, U.S. District Court, District of
New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart&#8217;s Massmart Purchase Faces South Africa Court Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African government lawyers urged the Competition
Appeal Court to compel regulators to review a decision allowing
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) to buy control of Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM),
saying they failed to adequately consider the public interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Competition Tribunal ruled on May 31 that the world&#8217;s
biggest retailer could proceed with the deal on condition no
jobs are cut for two years and the companies set up a 100
million-rand ($12.4 million) fund to assist local suppliers and
manufacturers. The government objected, saying the conditions
were inadequate to protect the economy and prevent a surge in
imports undermining manufacturing output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question before court is whether the merger can or
cannot be justified on public-interest grounds,&#8221; Wim Trengove,
the government&#8217;s senior counsel, told the court yesterday. &#8220;The
tribunal erred&#8221; by failing to place the onus on the companies
to prove they wouldn&#8217;t increase imports and destroy jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, paid 16.5 billion
rand in June for a 51 percent stake in Massmart, South Africa&#8217;s
biggest food and general-goods wholesaler. The U.S. company
outlined plans on June 26 to create 15,000 jobs in South Africa
within five years and allocate most of an expected 60 billion
rand in additional purchases of food or fast-moving consumer
goods to local suppliers in that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court papers filed on July 20, Economic Development
Minister Ebrahim Patel, Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies
and Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson said
the transaction should be reconsidered because the tribunal&#8217;s
hearings were flawed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattel Wins Dismissal of MGA Entertainment&#8217;s Antitrust Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel Inc. (MAT) won dismissal of an MGA Entertainment Inc.
lawsuit accusing it of antitrust violations related to the fight
between the two companies over MGA&#8217;s Bratz dolls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge David Carter in Santa Ana, California,
said in yesterday&#8217;s ruling that MGA&#8217;s claims against Mattel
should have been, or might have been, raised in earlier
lawsuits. Carter, saying it didn&#8217;t &#8220;appear impossible for MGA
to allege anticompetitive conduct&#8221; after a cutoff date in
August 2010, gave the company until Nov. 11 to file an amended
complaint to make those claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGA said in its antitrust complaint filed in February that
it sought $1 billion in damages and asked that the amount be
tripled for the alleged antitrust violations. The Van Nuys,
California-based company accused Mattel and Chief Executive
Officer Robert Eckert of embracing a &#8220;litigate MGA to death&#8221;
strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Hale, an MGA spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately return
phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on the ruling after
regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MGA Entertainment v. Mattel, 11-01063, U.S.
District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Settles Whistle-Blower Suit Over Detrol Marketing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $14.5 million to settle a lawsuit
brought by two whistle-blowers who claimed the company
improperly marketed its bladder-control drug Detrol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whistle-blowers, former sales representatives David
Wetherholt and Marci Drimer, sued Pfizer in federal court in
Boston in 2006, claiming the company cheated Medicaid, the
state-administered, federal health-care program for low-income
people, by pushing Detrol for a prostate condition. The suit was
filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. and
multiple states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will pay $14.5 million to the U.S. government, 49
states and the District of Columbia, Thomas M. Greene, a lawyer
for the whistle-blowers, said yesterday in a statement. The ex-
Pfizer employees will receive 27 percent of the federal portion
of the recovery, or about $3.3 million, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plan to market Detrol off-label to new patient
populations was hatched by a marketing team, not by research and
development,&#8221; Greene said in an interview. &#8220;Instead of asking,
&#8216;Who will Detrol help?&#8217; or even, &#8216;How does Detrol work?&#8217; the
question became, &#8216;Who can we convince to buy Detrol?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer denied any wrongdoing. The New York-based company
settled the lawsuit on &#8220;favorable terms,&#8221; it said yesterday in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement allows Pfizer to avoid the cost and
distraction of litigation and put this matter behind us,&#8221; the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. declined to intervene, or join, the Detrol lawsuit
in 2009. The whistle-blowers pursued the claim on their own
after that decision, Greene said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetherholt and Drimer also alleged Pfizer forced them out
after they complained about marketing practices. Greene declined
to comment on whether their claims of wrongful termination were
settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetherholt and Drimer will also receive an undetermined
amount from the $2.62 million portion of the settlement shared
by the states, Greene said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They will receive a percentage of the state settlements
for those states with false claims acts,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. ex. rel. Wetherholt v. Pfizer Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;EDF Aid Appeal Should Be Reviewed, EU Court Adviser Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricite de France SA, Europe&#8217;s biggest power producer,
may lose a case over more than 1.2 billion euros ($1.65 billion)
in French government aid if the European Union&#8217;s top court
follows its adviser&#8217;s opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocate General Jan Mazak of the EU Court of Justice said
yesterday in a non-binding opinion that a lower court made
errors in a 2009 ruling in favor of EDF and it should re-examine
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s executive agency is challenging a court&#8217;s ruling
in December 2009 overturning its decision that aid EDF received
from France was unlawful. The EU General Court, the region&#8217;s
second-highest court, at the time said the European Commission&#8217;s
analysis of the subsidies was flawed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission ordered the Paris-based utility in 2003 to
pay 889 million euros in back taxes plus interest due since
1997, when EDF booked a tax concession related to its ownership
of France&#8217;s high-voltage electricity network. EDF repaid France
more than 1.2 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDF appealed to the EU court in 2004 arguing the commission
made mistakes and forced a repayment far greater than what was
due. The commission checks whether government aid distorts
competition in the 27-nation EU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advocate general yesterday said the EU General Court
improperly assessed how the commission should have examined the
state aid to EDF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;EDF takes note of the advocate general&#8217;s opinion which
doesn&#8217;t prejudge the final ruling of the court, which is
expected in 2012,&#8221; a spokeswoman for EDF said by telephone
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission &#8220;notes with interest the opinion of the
Advocate General&#8221; and waits for the court&#8217;s ruling, according
to Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-124/10, Commission v. EDF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Le-Nature&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Sentenced to 20 Years &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Le-Nature&#8217;s Inc. Chief Executive Officer Gregory J.
Podlucky was sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud, tax
evasion and money-laundering related to the 2006 collapse of the
bottled-water company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podlucky was the mastermind behind a scheme that cost
lenders, shareholders and others $684.5 million, Assistant U.S.
Attorney James Y. Garrett said in court papers filed yesterday.
Podlucky was sentenced yesterday in U.S. District Court in
Pittsburgh to the maximum allowed under a plea agreement,
Garrett said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether or not defendant&#8217;s conduct should be deplored as
evil, the ingenuity, industry and magnitude of his extraordinary
crimes are plain to see,&#8221; Garrett said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podlucky&#8217;s brother Jonathan and at least three other Le-
Nature&#8217;s employees also pleaded guilty to charges related to the
fraud, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander H. Lindsay Jr., Podlucky&#8217;s attorney, didn&#8217;t
return a call for comment on the sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Podlucky, 2:09-cr-00279, U.S. District
Court, Western District of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsky Juggles Conflicting Roles as Financial Cop in N.Y. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Lawsky, the first person to head New York&#8217;s newly
established Financial Services Department, said he&#8217;ll be
juggling conflicting roles of enforcer and promoter as he
oversees the state&#8217;s banks and insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being a better consumer-protection agency and fraud
detector, while keeping New York the financial center of the
world, aren&#8217;t necessarily contradictory,&#8221; Lawsky, 41, said
during an interview in his office in lower Manhattan. &#8220;But
doing this well requires a delicate balance that&#8217;s hard to
achieve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Governor Andrew Cuomo initially proposed investing
Lawsky&#8217;s department with powers comparable to those of the state
attorney general. The idea got scaled back, though the
legislature did give Lawsky oversight of new financial products
that fall outside the jurisdiction of existing regulations. That
was designed to counter what Lawsky called Wall Street&#8217;s history
of devising products that circumvent regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is designed for the future,&#8221; Lawsky said. &#8220;We will
have oversight of products intentionally designed to be neither
fish nor fowl, where they&#8217;re not a commodity, not a security and
not insurance -- products designed to fall into regulatory
gaps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsky, who will monitor about 4,400 financial companies
managing more than $6.2 trillion in assets, is &#8220;a prosecutor at
heart&#8221; who will take an aggressive approach, said Neil
Barofsky, the former special inspector general for the Troubled
Assets Relief Program and an ex-colleague. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former assistant U.S. attorney, Lawsky also spent four
years as the top financial crimes prosecutor for then-New York
Attorney General Cuomo, and was in the thick of Cuomo&#8217;s effort
to force banks that received taxpayer bailouts to disclose
sensitive information about bonus payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsky led the probe into $3.6 billion in bonuses Merrill
Lynch  Co. gave executives as Bank of America Corp. (BAC) acquired
the company. As Cuomo&#8217;s special assistant, he was the prime
mover behind the ongoing lawsuit filed in early 2010 accusing
former Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Ken Lewis of
misleading shareholders and government officials about Merrill&#8217;s
financial condition. &lt;/p&gt;

Salant and Jeff Bliss" date="Oct 21, 2011 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-21/google-follows-microsoft-playbook-in-boosting-lobbying-spending.html"><headline>Google Follows Microsoft Playbook in Boosting Lobbying Spending</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), the subject of a
Federal Trade Commission investigation, is following Microsoft
Corp. in ratcheting up its lobbying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google spent $5.9 million from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, a 51
percent increase over the $3.9 million spent during the same
period a year earlier, according to reports filed yesterday with
the House and Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Google has doubled its
lobbying spending in the last two years and this year began an
expansion of its political action committee, which is used to
give donations to candidates. Both of these developments come as
the owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search engine faces
scrutiny from both federal regulators and U.S. lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions are similar to those taken by Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, one of Google&#8217;s biggest competitors,
after it faced a Justice Department antitrust suit and
congressional hearings in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When scrutiny arrived, Microsoft chose to ramp up its
lobbying presence and let the professionals handle its
concerns,&#8221; said Rogan Kersh, associate dean of New York
University&#8217;s Wagner School, who tracks lobbying. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
blueprint that Google is successfully following.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitching Google&#8217;s View &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lobbying expenditures are part of an effort to give
Congress and the Obama administration Google&#8217;s view on an array
of issues, said Samantha Smith, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to help policy makers understand our business and
the work we do to keep the Internet open, to encourage
innovation and to create economic opportunity,&#8221; she said in a
statement. &#8220;Lobbying is a part of that process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google first registered to lobby in Washington in June 2007
and spent $2.9 million in the first nine months of 2009.
Microsoft spent $5 million during the same period that year and
has remained at about that level, spending $5.2 million during
the first nine months of 2010 and $5.5 million this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this transition happen in every sector,&#8221; Kersh
said. There&#8217;s &#8220;an initial resistance to lobbying followed by a
recognition that whatever your business model, you have to have
an active lobbying presence, both to stave off regulation and to
gain benefits from government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s lobbying team now includes Richard Gephardt, a
former House Democratic leader; Kyle Simmons, former chief of
staff to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell; and Charles Black Jr., the former Republican presidential adviser who now is
chairman of the Washington-based Prime Policy Group lobbying
firm. All were hired in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring Spree &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s hiring spree &#8220;shows how concerned they are
with regulatory matters,&#8221; said Benjamin Schachter, an Internet
analyst at Macquarie Capital in New York. &#8220;They&#8217;ve grown up and
realized they have to have their voice heard so they&#8217;re not
backed into a corner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enhanced lobbying presence won&#8217;t affect the
investigation at the FTC, whose probes have been resistant to
political pressure, said William Blumenthal, the agency&#8217;s former
general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is extraordinarily rare when you&#8217;d see political
intervention have a significant effect on the outcome of the
investigation,&#8221; said Blumenthal, chairman of the U.S. antitrust
group at Clifford Chance LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increased lobbying presence didn&#8217;t shield Microsoft from
the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust probe of the company. The
government pressured Microsoft into accepting a nine-year
consent decree to stop using its monopoly Windows operating
system for personal computers to quash competition. The decree
expired in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with Microsoft&#8217;s past spending pattern, Google also
increased the amount of money it spends on politics. Its PAC,
which began in 2006, raised $570,115 from employees during the
first six months of 2011, 12 times greater than the $47,769
raised during the same period in 2009, Federal Election
Commission records show. Microsoft&#8217;s PAC took in $546,784 from
January to June, slightly more than the $534,530 raised two
years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft experienced a similar fundraising jump in 1998,
the year the Justice Department filed its antitrust suit. Its
PAC took in $534,050 that year, compared with $46,000 two years
earlier, FEC reports show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust Allegations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC earlier this year began investigating whether
Google has violated antitrust laws by unfairly ranking search
results to favor its own businesses and increasing rivals&#8217; ad
rates, a person familiar with the probe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency also is examining if Google is using its control
of the Android mobile operating system to discourage smart-phone
makers from using rivals&#8217; applications and services, said the
person, who wasn&#8217;t authorized to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt testified before a
Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing that his search
engine doesn&#8217;t discriminate against competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department Antitrust Division is reviewing
Google&#8217;s proposed $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. and its $400 million purchase of Internet-
advertising company Admeld Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
were sued by Capmark Financial Group Inc., which accused them of
wrongly collecting $147 million five months before Capmark went
bankrupt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they were co-owners of Capmark in May 2009, a group
of Goldman units used their influence to help convince Capmark
to refinance $1.5 billion in unsecured debt owed to Goldman,
according to the lawsuit filed today in Manhattan federal court.
The refinancing allowed Goldman to collect $147 million,
including $7 million in cash, based on the new secured loan,
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite these conflicts and close connections -- indeed,
as a result of the influence and insider status that its
multiple simultaneous roles created -- Goldman Sachs actively
and directly participated in internal meetings and discussions
that led to the secured credit facility, which gave it
preferential treatment as a creditor,&#8221; Capmark claimed in the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmark, the commercial lender once a part of the former
General Motors Corp., exited bankruptcy in September, co-owned
by lower-ranking creditors, some of whom had fought with Goldman
over the refinancing and the payments in bankruptcy court in
Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman, declined comment
on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2006 Purchase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmark, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, became partly
owned by affiliates of New York-based Goldman Sachs when the
bank and a group of investors bought 78 percent of Capmark, then
called GMAC Commercial Mortgage, in 2006 for $1.5 billion in
cash and the repayment of $7.3 billion of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creditors committee also battled with Goldman Sachs
over how to handle so-called insider preference claims --
lawsuits sometimes brought against company insiders, including
equity holders, accused of wrongly taking money from the company
in the months before the bankruptcy filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs bring this action seeking avoidance and
recovery of all preferential payments made to defendant or for
defendants&#8217; benefit under the pre-petition credit facilities,&#8221;
Capmark said in the complaint filed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi gave
Capmark permission to settle allegations that the entire
$1.5 billion refinancing was a fraud on creditors because it
wrongly boosted the repayment priority of Goldman Sachs and
other lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that settlement, Capmark paid New York-based Goldman
Sachs and the other lenders about $835 million, less than the
full value of the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
property values and a drop in lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Capmark Financial Group Inc. v. Goldman Sachs,
11-CV-7511, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Phillies declined
to pick up contract options on Roy Oswalt and Brad Lidge, making
the 34-year-old pitchers unrestricted free agents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will remain in contact with representatives for both
players about the possibility of bringing them back for the 2012
season,&#8221; Phillies General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr. said in an e-
mailed news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt started 23 games this season, going 9-10 with a 3.69
earned run average. He joined the Phillies at the 2010 trade
deadline, going 16-11 with a 2.96 ERA since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt pitched this season on a staff that included past Cy
Young Award winners Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee, All-Star Cole Hamels and Vance Worley, who went 11-3. All four are under
contract next season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidge, who struck out the Tampa Bay Rays&#8217; Eric Hinske to
secure the Phillies&#8217; World Series title in 2008, made 25 relief
appearances this season, going 0-2 with one save and a 1.40 ERA.
The former full-time closer had 48 saves in as many attempts in
2008, including the postseason, and in four seasons in
Philadelphia had 100 saves and a 3.73 ERA. He also went 12-
for-12 in save opportunities during the playoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phillies led Major League Baseball with a 102-60 record
this season, falling in five games in the National League
Division Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), fighting
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. over $6 billion in claims it filed
against the defunct firm, asked a judge to allow continued
sealing of some information in court papers, saying secrecy was
needed to protect entities from harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s claims against Lehman and its brokerage are
&#8220;significantly overstated,&#8221; Lehman said in August. The bank, a
go-between for the brokerage&#8217;s repurchase agreements with short-
term investors after the parent&#8217;s Sept. 15, 2008 bankruptcy,
failed to sell collateral securing the loans in a &#8220;commercially
reasonable manner,&#8221; it alleged in a filing where passages were
blacked out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman asked the judge to hold a hearing on the issue and
then cut the claims as he considered appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan later agreed to let Lehman publish a mostly
uncensored version of its objection to the claims, the New York-
based bank said in a filing today. The information that is still
blacked out includes names and account numbers of JPMorgan&#8217;s
trading partners, phone numbers and certain e-mail addresses, it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential Harm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bankruptcy code provides courts with the power to
issue orders that will protect entitles from potential harm that
may result from the disclosure of certain confidential
information,&#8221; it said in the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the partially uncensored objection to JPMorgan&#8217;s claim,
Lehman gave details about the sale of collateral. On the morning
the Lehman brokerage went into liquidation, JPMorgan started to
sell the securities, calling the plan &#8220;Project Tassimo,&#8221; after
a coffee maker owned by a bank employee involved in the
transactions, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale was handled &#8220;without any limits or safeguards
ensuring a fair price,&#8221; Lehman alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the largest U.S. bank,
declined to comment on the allegations. Kimberly Macleod, a
Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan is contesting an $8.6 billion lawsuit
by Lehman, saying it was protected by so-called safe harbor law
when it took collateral from the defunct firm in 2008. Congress
created the law to protect banks lending to faltering companies,
JPMorgan has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud Allegations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, sued Lehman
back, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc., is being separately
liquidated from its parent, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., after
going into liquidation four days after its parent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-
13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European debt crisis and
government belt-tightening may cause the U.S. economy to slow in
early 2012 even as the risk of it faltering this year has waned,
said JPMorgan Chase  Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we are picking up some steam, we&#8217;re now obviously
facing a new set of drags, mostly emanating from Europe,&#8221;
Kasman said today in a radio interview on &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. &#8220;We also have
this uncertainty about where U.S. fiscal policy is heading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth may slow to 1 percent early next year &#8220;on
the back of Europe going into recession and on the back of
fiscal tightening&#8221; in the U.S., New York-based Kasman said. The
slowdown may lead to a rise in the unemployment rate, which was
at 9.1 percent in September for a third month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More immediately, Kasman said a waning of headwinds, which
included higher fuel prices and supply disruptions from Japan&#8217;s
natural disaster, has helped U.S. growth speed up after
proceeding at a 0.9 percent rate in the first half of this year,
the weakest pace since the recession ended in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product expanded at about a 3 percent pace
from July to September, Kasman said. Economists project a 2.5
percent advance, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey ahead of the Commerce Department figures on Oct. 27. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin Nunez, a former Columbia
University football player in his second year at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), earned the unofficial title of Wall Street&#8217;s best
athlete by winning a charity decathlon held at his alma mater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nunez, 27, finished atop a field of almost 100 traders,
bankers and financial advisers in the 10-event competition,
which benefits the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. Kyle VanFleet, a former Georgetown University fullback who
also works at Goldman Sachs, was runner-up in the competition
that took place over the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nunez finished with 7,095 points -- 27 ahead of VanFleet
and 41 better than Brad Bagdis of Knight Capital Group -- to
improve on his third-place showing at the 2010 Wall Street
Decathlon. Nunez&#8217;s victory came at Columbia&#8217;s Wien Stadium on
the northern tip of Manhattan, where he played four years at
defensive back for the Lions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To come back and actually have a chance to compete again
on my home turf felt great,&#8221; Nunez, who works in the investment
management division at Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It brings back a lot of good memories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nunez, cheered by family, college friends, his girlfriend
and colleagues from Goldman Sachs, said his experience last year
helped him win this time around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss banks will likely settle a
sweeping U.S. probe of offshore tax evasion by paying billions
of dollars and handing over names of thousands of Americans who
have secret accounts, Bloomberg News&#8217; David Voreacos, Klaus
Wille and Giles Broom report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Swiss officials are concluding negotiations on a
civil settlement amid U.S. criminal probes of 11 financial
institutions, including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), suspected of
helping American clients hide money from the Internal Revenue
Service, according to five people with knowledge of the talks
who declined to speak publicly because they are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland, the biggest haven for offshore wealth, wants
an end to new U.S. probes while preserving its decades-old
tradition of bank secrecy, the people said. The U.S. seeks data
on Americans who have dodged U.S. taxes and a pledge by Swiss
banks to stop helping such clients, according to the people. The
Swiss reached accords this year with Germany and the U.K. on
untaxed assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Swiss would like to get out of this by paying money,
and they&#8217;ve done that with other countries,&#8221; said tax attorney
H. David Rosenbloom of Caplin  Drysdale Chartered in
Washington, who isn&#8217;t involved in the talks. &#8220;For the U.S.,
it&#8217;s not primarily a money question. It&#8217;s a matter of making
sure the laws apply fairly among taxpayers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss government seeks to outline a final accord for
the Foreign Affairs Committee of its Parliament&#8217;s upper house on
Nov. 10, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
number of banks that will pay to resolve the U.S. negotiations
may extend beyond the 11 under criminal investigation, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are aiming for an all-encompassing solution that will
apply to all the banks,&#8221; Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-
Schlumpf said in an Oct. 4 interview in the Swiss capital Bern.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be confronted with the same issues time and
again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department also may bring criminal charges or
civil enforcement actions against any of the 11 financial
institutions. They could avoid prosecution by separately paying
fines, admitting wrongdoing and disclosing data, the people
said. On Aug. 30, the Justice Department requested statistical
data from the 11 about their U.S. accounts, which the U.S. has
received and is analyzing, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of 11 also includes HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), the
biggest European bank, Basler Kantonalbank (BSKP), Wegelin  Co.,
Zuercher Kantonalbank, and Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), the people
said. Three Israeli banks -- Bank Leumi Le-Israel BM (LUMI), Bank
Hapoalim BM (POLI), and Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF) -- are on the list,
as well as Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG (LLB) and an asset
manager, NZB AG, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Sued Over Role in El Paso&#8217;s $21 Billion Buyout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by a pension fund that
alleges the New York-based investment bank had a conflict of
interest in its role as adviser in the planned $21 billion
purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP) by Kinder Morgan Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder
Morgan, steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan,&#8221; lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed Oct. 20 in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Goldman Sachs, the complaint also names
individual El Paso directors and Kinder Morgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser on the
sale, Goldman&#8217;s presence &#8220;tainted the entire process,&#8221; lawyers
for the retirement fund said in the complaint. Goldman continued
to act as financial adviser on &#8220;related matters&#8221; in connection
with the transaction, the pension fund said in the complaint,
citing the companies&#8217; joint press statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment except to say that the bank&#8217;s representatives on
Kinder Morgan&#8217;s board recused themselves from the deal process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan,
said in an e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending
litigation. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, also
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard Bank Sues Saudi Billionaire Over $150 Million Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Bank Plc sued Saudi billionaire Mohamed bin Issa
al Jaber for $150 million in a London court, saying loans made
to companies in his MBI International  Partners Inc. group
weren&#8217;t repaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank says al Jaber personally guaranteed three loans to
JJW Hotels  Resorts Ltd. and Ajwa for Food Industries Co. in
2008, according to court papers outlining its claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Jaber, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s third-richest man according to
Arabian Business, believes he has a claim against the bank over
a $96.5 million loss from unauthorized foreign-exchange trades,
his lawyer Catharine Otton-Goulder said Oct. 20 at a pre-trial
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He blames Standard Bank, a unit of Johannesburg-based
Standard Bank Group Ltd., for the trades from a personal account
he held with the company and says the loans were provided to
cover the foreign-exchange losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Garraway, a spokeswoman for Standard Bank in London,
declined to comment on the case via e-mail Oct. 20. Gary Pegg,
an attorney for al Jaber, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail requesting
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham Exploration Sued by Shareholders Over Statoil Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigham Exploration Co. (BEXP) was sued by shareholders contending
that Statoil ASA (STL)&#8217;s $4.4 billion buyout price is too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer price is a discount to the oil and gas producer&#8217;s
52-week high trading price, according to separate suits filed by
the same law firm on behalf of shareholders Robert Fioravanti
and Howard Weisberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed transaction is the product of a flawed
process that involved no known open auction,&#8221; Weisberg said
Oct. 20 in a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil said Oct. 17 that it would buy all of Brigham&#8217;s
shares for $36.50 each, a 20 percent premium to the company&#8217;s
Oct. 14 closing price. The deal is the seventh-largest takeover
announced this year in the oil and gas industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil, Norway&#8217;s biggest oil company, is using Brigham to
expand into unconventional U.S. assets such as the Bakken shale
area in North Dakota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer price reflects an inadequate premium given
Brigham&#8217;s strong growth prospects and is still below the 23
percent average premium for the industry this year, the
shareholders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal also includes preclusive protection devices
include a clause prohibiting Brigham from seeking a third-party
bid and a $136.5 million termination fee that discourages other
potential buyers, according to the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weisberg and Fioravanti are seeking to represent all
Brigham shareholders in their request to bar the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Roosa, a spokesman for Brigham Exploration, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Weisberg v. Brigham Exploration Co., CA6957,
and Fioravanti v. Brigham Exploration Co., CA6962, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATT Seeks to Knock Out Government&#8217;s Ally in T-Mobile Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T) will ask a federal judge to throw out Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)&#8217;s lawsuit to stop its purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., seeking a decision that would curb Sprint&#8217;s ability to
help the U.S. block the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT will argue at a hearing today in Washington that
Sprint, as a competitor rather than a consumer, has no right
under antitrust law to bring the suit and that Sprint&#8217;s claims
the $39 billion deal would hurt its business are unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should ATT persuade U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal
Huvelle to dismiss the case, Sprint&#8217;s advice on the Justice
Department&#8217;s suit would be limited by its restricted access to
confidential ATT information, said Thomas Horton, a law
professor at the University of South Dakota Law School and
former antitrust attorney in the department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will expedite the government&#8217;s case to have Sprint as
an official ally,&#8221; said Horton, who spent about eight years in
the antitrust division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint told Huvelle on Oct. 12 that to prepare its case it
needed access to confidential data the Justice Department
collected from ATT during the U.S. probe of the proposed T-
Mobile merger. The company said it suffered from &#8220;fundamental
unfairness&#8221; because, as a competitor with relevant information,
ATT is allowed to subpoena Sprint documents in the government&#8217;s
antitrust case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huvelle, overseeing all the ATT cases, froze the document
exchanges while she weighs the motion to dismiss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-01560;
Sprint&#8217;s case is Sprint Nextel Corp. v. ATT Inc., 11-01600; and
Cellular South&#8217;s case is Cellular South Inc. v. ATT Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asks New York Court to Dismiss Allstate Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a judge in New York state
court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Allstate Insurance Co. over
the alleged fraudulent sale of residential mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer sued New York-based
Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Aug. 15 over the sale of more than $100 million worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
including the lost market value of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allstate filed the lawsuit and seven similar complaints
against various issuers and underwriters of residential
mortgage-backed securities, using &#8220;generalities and unsupported
assumptions&#8221; to recoup investment losses on certificates it
bought in five offerings in 2006, Goldman Sachs said in court
documents filed Oct. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite its financial sophistication and expertise
(including in the housing market, where it is a leading
insurer), Allstate now suffers from buyer&#8217;s remorse and has sued
the counterparties with which it traded at arm&#8217;s length,
claiming in separate actions that each of the eight sellers of
RMBS misled it as to characteristics of the securities,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allstate has also sued lenders including JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill
Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over residential
mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,
652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Madoff Seeks Appeal in Picard $198 Million Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Madoff, son of confidence man Bernard L. Madoff,
asked to appeal a bankruptcy judge&#8217;s ruling that allowed a $198
million lawsuit by the liquidator of his father&#8217;s firm to go
forward, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard last month won a court ruling
permitting him to pursue most claims in a 2009 lawsuit alleging
that the Madoffs treated the now-defunct firm, Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC, as their &#8220;family piggy bank.&#8221; U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland also dismissed some claims in
the case while allowing Picard to file a new complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Madoff asked a U.S. District Court judge to allow an
appeal, according to Oct. 6 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York. In court papers filed in his own behalf and as
executor of his late brother&#8217;s estate, he said the judge&#8217;s
decision would result in a &#8220;massive expansion of liability&#8221;
for managers of banks and large corporations for the wrongs of
individual units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard opposed Andrew Madoff&#8217;s request to appeal Oct. 20,
saying in his court papers that Lifland&#8217;s ruling was &#8220;well-
reasoned&#8221; and that he would seek to prove his claims at a
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his lawsuit, Picard said that Madoff family members --
including Bernard&#8217;s brother Peter Madoff, sons Andrew and Mark
Madoff and niece Shana Madoff Swanson, all of whom held senior
positions at Madoff Securities -- profited from the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of preventing the crime, they took $198 million in
investor money from the New York-based money-management firm to
finance a business venture, pay for restaurants, vacations and
clothing and to buy cars, boats and vacation homes, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard didn&#8217;t try to prove in his complaint that the family
&#8220;engaged in any kind of securities fraud, dishonesty, or
deception,&#8221; only that they were derelict in their duty and
misused company funds, he said in the Oct. 20th filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer for Andrew Madoff and Mark
Madoff&#8217;s estate, has said that the Madoff sons didn&#8217;t know of
their father&#8217;s scheme and that they contacted prosecutors after
their father told them of his fraud. Bernard Madoff is serving a
150-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Madoff, 09-1503, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIG Bid to Move BofA Lawsuit to State Court Denied by Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s request to move a $10
billion lawsuit against Bank of America Corp. to state court
from federal court was denied by a U.S. judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG in August sued Bank of America in New York state court
over $10 billion in losses on mortgage-bond investments.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America then moved the
case to federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan denied New
York-based AIG&#8217;s request to return the case to state court in an
order dated Oct. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American International Group Inc. v. Bank of
America Corp., 11-06212, U.S. District Court. Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kimelman Appeals Conviction, Sentence for Insider Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Kimelman, the co-founder of Incremental Capital
LLC, appealed his conviction and sentence for insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimelman, sentenced Oct. 12 to 2 1/2 years in prison,
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, according to
a court filing dated Oct. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury found Kimelman guilty in June in a scheme to bribe
two lawyers at the Boston-based law firm Ropes  Gray LLP to
disclose secret information about companies including 3Com Corp.
and Hilton Hotels Corp. Also found guilty were brothers Zvi and
Emanuel Goffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimelman was sentenced a day before Raj Rajaratnam, the
founder of Galleon Group LLC, received an 11-year sentence for
insider trading. Kimelman&#8217;s lawyers include Michael Sommer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Goffer, 10-00056, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massmart Ruling Failed to Consider Economy, Jobs, Union Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African regulators who let Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) buy
control of Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) failed to take account of
negative effects on the economy or jobs, a lawyer for a union
seeking to dismantle the deal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Competition Tribunal &#8220;has reached a fundamentally
wrong conclusion&#8221; in its conditional approval of the
acquisition, Paul Kennedy, senior counsel for the South African
Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union, told an appeal
court in Cape Town Oct. 21. &#8220;Certainly this merger will benefit
the shareholders of the merged parties. It may have very
negative consequences. There is a danger of job losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union is asking the Competition Appeal Court to
overturn the tribunal&#8217;s May 31 clearance of Wal-Mart&#8217;s purchase
of a 51 percent holding in Johannesburg-based Massmart, South
Africa&#8217;s biggest food and general-goods wholesaler. Approval was
subject to the companies promising to refrain from firing
workers for two years and set up a fund to assist local
suppliers and manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart, the world&#8217;s largest retailer, paid 16.5 billion
rand ($2.05 billion) in June for the stake in Massmart. On June
26, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said it would create
15,000 jobs in South Africa within five years and spend about 60
billion rand more on food or fast-moving consumer goods in the
period, most of which would go to local suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said there was a &#8220;dearth of information&#8221; about
what effect the takeover will have on imports and employment,
and that the companies failed to disclose sufficient information
to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Dennis Davis, the court president, said that while he
had &#8220;significant difficulty&#8221; with evidence provided by the
companies, &#8220;they can&#8217;t have information that goes outside the
confines of their business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Unterhalter, the retailers&#8217; senior counsel, argued
that takeovers under South African law should be approved
provided they don&#8217;t significantly reduce competition. There&#8217;s no
onus on companies to prove a takeover is counter to the public
interest, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel will &#8220;take time to consider&#8221; its
ruling, Davis said at the conclusion of the hearings Oct. 21,
without specifying a deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the court decide against referring the decision back
to the tribunal, it may either uphold the approval of the
takeover or rule that it should have been rejected or subjected
to different conditions, the judge said Oct. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is South Africa Commercial, Catering and Allied
Workers Union v Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Massmart Holdings Ltd.,
111/CAC/Jul11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge Fund CEO Brownstein Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew &#8220;Bo&#8221; Brownstein, the founder and chief executive
officer of Denver-based Big 5 Asset Management, pleaded guilty
to trading on inside information about a corporate merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brownstein, 35, made more than $2.5 million in illegal
profits for his hedge fund and for relatives by trading on a tip
in advance of Apache Corp. (APA)&#8217;s $2.7 billion acquisition of Mariner
Energy Inc. (ME) in April 2010, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve severely disappointed my family, colleagues,
investors and friends,&#8221; Brownstein told U.S. District Judge
Robert Patterson in Manhattan federal court Oct. 21. &#8220;I&#8217;m truly
sorry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentencing guideline is 37 to 46 months with the plea
agreement, the judge said. Brownstein, who pleaded guilty to one
count of securities fraud, will be sentenced on Dec. 20. He was
released on a $500,000 personal recognizance bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You had inside information about the fact that Mariner&#8217;s
stock would probably go up because it was about to be acquired
by another company,&#8221; Patterson said to Brownstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip originated with H. Clayton Peterson of Denver, a
retired former Arthur Andersen partner who served on Mariner
Energy&#8217;s board of directors, prosecutors said. Peterson, who was
also a director of Re/Max International Inc. and Lone Pine
Resources Inc., pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in August. His son, Drew, a Denver financial adviser,
pleaded guilty to the same charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clayton Peterson, who was appointed to Mariner&#8217;s board in
March 2006, said he passed information about the planned
transaction in April 2010 to his son. At his guilty plea, Drew
Peterson, 35, said he bought shares of Mariner stock based on
the tip and passed the information to another unidentified
person who also traded on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Peterson, 11-CR-665, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macklowe Wins Case Icahn Filed Over Aborted 2006 Reckson Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York developer Harry Macklowe won a jury verdict that
his company doesn&#8217;t owe Carl Icahn&#8217;s Meadow Star LLC $60 million
for backing away from a 2006 bid to buy six New York skyscrapers
from Reckson Associates Realty Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macklowe&#8217;s attorney, Roger Netzer, said a unanimous jury
voted in favor of his client after two hours of deliberations in
a lawsuit filed in 2008 by Meadow Star, an affiliate of Icahn
Enterprises LP, in New York state court in Manhattan. A verdict
was entered Oct. 19 for Macklowe, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meadow Star alleged Macklowe company WH Rome Partners LLC
failed to put up its half of $1.2 billion to outbid SL Green
Realty Corp. (SLG) for the Reckson buildings, according to court
filings. SL Green paid $4.5 billion in cash and stock to buy all
of Reckson&#8217;s holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A deal is a deal and Mr. Macklowe honored his obligations
under the language of the contract that these very sophisticated
parties had agreed to,&#8221; Netzer said Oct. 22 in a telephone
interview. Herbert Beigel, an attorney who represented Icahn&#8217;s
company at trial, declined to comment about the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aborted offer cost Icahn $60 million, according to his
complaint. Netzer said Macklowe&#8217;s half of the bid wasn&#8217;t
required unless certain conditions were met, including a signed
acquisition agreement with Reckson and a guarantee that the bid
wouldn&#8217;t exceed $1.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Meadow Star LLC v. Harry Macklowe and WH Rome
Partners LLC, 08-603165, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Said to Agree to Pay $1.3 Billion for Depakote Suits [bn:WBTKR=ABT:US]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories (ABT) [] agreed to pay at least $1.3 billion to
settle claims by the U.S. government and 24 states alleging the
company illegally marketed its Depakote epilepsy drug, people
familiar with the accords said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott executives, federal prosecutors and state officials
reached a tentative agreement calling for the drugmaker to pay
about $800 million to resolve civil claims over Depakote and
about $500 million in criminal penalties for marketing the
epilepsy medicine for unapproved uses, said three people
familiar with the settlement who declined to be identified
because the agreement hasn&#8217;t been made public. Abbott said last
week it was reserving $1.5 billion to cover costs of the
potential settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Settlement negotiations are ongoing,&#8221; Scott Stoffel, a
spokesman for Abbott, said in a phone interview Oct. 21. He
declined to comment further. Charles Miller, a U.S. Justice
Department spokesman, had no comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abbott Park, Illinois-based company said Oct. 19 that
it will split next year, with one company selling medical
products and the other prescription medicines. Powered by
Humira, an anti-inflammatory with $6.5 billion in annual sales,
the new drugmaker may attract a bid from Merck  Co., Roche
Holding AG or Bayer AG, said Jeffrey Holford, a Jefferies Group
Inc. analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement would be the third-largest illegal
pharmaceutical marketing accord in U.S. history, behind the $2.3
billion Pfizer paid in 2009 over the marketing of its Bextra
painkiller and other drugs and the $1.4 billion Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)
paid the same year over sales of its Zyprexa anti-psychotic
medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. ex rel. McCoyd v. Abbott Laboratories,
1:07-cv-00081, U.S. District Court, Western District of Virginia
(Abingdon). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markit to Settle Suit Against Former Employees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markit Group Ltd. agreed to settle a lawsuit against two
former employees in Singapore after they pledged not to compete
with the firm for one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhibo Li, previously a vice-president of sales, and Shiyang
Cui, who was an associate vice-president, are permanently banned
from using or disclosing information obtained from Markit,
according to a filing with the Singapore High Court this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markit, a swap prices data provider, sued Li and Cui last
month, accusing them of breaching their employment contracts and
misusing the firm&#8217;s trade secrets to set up rival Fundamentrix
Pte. Li and Cui are also banned from soliciting clients of the
London-based company for one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caroline Lumley, a spokeswoman at Markit, declined to
comment Oct. 20 on the agreement. Both Li and Cui didn&#8217;t reply
to two e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Markit Asia Pte.  Ors v Zhibo Li  Ors

&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) to Pay $4.8 Million to End Dowler Hacking Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s U.K. unit agreed to pay 3 million pounds ($4.8
million) to settle claims that its News of the World tabloid
hacked the mobile-phone messages of a murdered schoolgirl in
2002, hampering a police investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal -- the biggest payout by News Corp. since the
hacking scandal erupted -- includes a 2 million-pound payment to
the family of Milly Dowler and a 1 million-pound donation to
charity, London-based News International said Oct. 20. News
Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, 80, was personally involved in
the negotiations, a person familiar with the matter said last
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I met with the Dowlers in July, I expressed how
deeply sorry I was for the hurt we had caused this family,&#8221;
Murdoch said in the statement, which indicated he would
personally pay the 1 million-pound charitable donation. &#8220;The
behavior that the News of the World exhibited towards the
Dowlers was abhorrent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement was confirmed by News Corp. the same day as
the New York-based company&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting in Los
Angeles. U.K. lawmaker Tom Watson, who is part of a government
probe of the scandal, said he would attend the meeting to speak
against the company&#8217;s management. The California Public
Employees&#8217; Retirement System and other large investor groups
have also taken stances aimed at loosening Murdoch&#8217;s control,
citing concerns about how the phone-hacking issue was handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports in July that Dowler&#8217;s messages had been
intercepted, hampering a police search when she was still
missing, triggered a public outcry that led News Corp. to close
the 168-year-old tabloid and drop its 7.8 billion-pound bid for
full control of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) The hacking
was previously thought to be limited to celebrities, athletes,
royalty and other public figures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Canada (RY)&#8217;s investment

advising clients in the financial services industry in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vo is a former a co-head of European insurance research at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), while Eves was head of financial
institutions equity capital markets at UBS AG, Toronto-based RBC
Capital Markets said in an e-mailed statement today. The pair
will report to Robin Mackie and Mike Carter, co-heads of RBC&#8217;s
European financial institutional group, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC, Canada&#8217;s largest lender, has been expanding its
investment banking and wealth management operations in London in
recent years. In April, the firm hired Kevin Smith from Standard
Chartered Plc to be head of mergers and acquisitions in Europe.
RBC also acquired London-based BlueBay Asset Management Plc for
about C$1.52 billion ($1.5 billion) last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointments &#8220;will add greater depth to our coverage

&lt;p&gt;China Mengniu Dairy Co., the
nation&#8217;s biggest dairy company, may bid for Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s
infant-nutrition business, two people with knowledge of the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mengniu&#8217;s consideration of a potential bid is at an early
stage, the people said, asking not to be identified because the
information is private. The company won&#8217;t decide whether to
proceed until more financial data on the unit is available, one
of the people said. Mengniu said in a stock-exchange filing
today that it isn&#8217;t &#8220;in any direct negotiation&#8221; with Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infant-nutrition business may fetch as much as $10.5
billion, and draw interest from companies including Danone (BN),
Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Nestle SA (NESN), people familiar with the
transaction said in July. Mengniu&#8217;s market value is just over
half that amount, and shares in the cheese and milk producer
fell today after its interest was reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deal size for the whole global division is really a
bit big,&#8221; said Jacqueline Ko, an analyst with Kim Eng
Securities. &#8220;I wonder if they can just buy the China part of
the business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice Cream &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trupti Wagh, a Pfizer spokeswoman in Singapore declined to
comment on market speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mengniu said it will &#8220;closely monitor&#8221; developments
related to a bid for the Pfizer unit. &#8220;The company is not in
any direct negotiation with Pfizer, and currently has no
concrete arrangement or plan in connection with the bid,&#8221; the
Chinese milk producer said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mengniu&#8217;s products include liquid milk products, ice cream,
and milk powder. Milk powder contributed less than 1 percent of
the company&#8217;s revenue in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s largest shareholder is a unit of Cofco Ltd.,
a state-backed grains trader which said on Oct. 20 that it is
seeking overseas acquisitions to help secure food supplies for
China. Through a special purpose vehicle, Cofco and Hopu
Investment Management Co. own 20 percent of Mengniu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mengniu fell 1.7 percent to HK$25.75 at the 4 p.m. close of
trading in Hong Kong. Its market value is about HK$45 billion
($5.8 billion), and the company had about $1 billion in cash and
short-term securities at the end of June, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMA Gold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors may be concerned that Mengniu may have to issue
new shares to fund the bid and that would dilute per share
earnings,&#8221; Jason Yuan, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Holdings Ltd.
in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infant-nutrition unit, which makes the SMA Gold line of
products for infants and children, reported $1.9 billion in
sales last year. About 60 percent of those were from Asia, with
another 30 percent from Europe, according to Credit Suisse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is looking for &#8220;strategic alternatives&#8221; for the
unit that may also include a spinoff, said Wagh, repeating
comments the company made in July. The company may send sales
documents to suitors in November at the earliest, people with
knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times earlier reported Mengniu&#8217;s interest in
the unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Mengniu &#8220;currently has no concrete arrangement or
plan&#8221; related to the bid, according to a statement to the Hong

development,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) each sold $1 billion of 10-year bonds on the most
active day of corporate debt sales in almost two weeks as
spreads for financial firms tightened relative to the rest of
the market over the last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planned or completed bond sales of $7.95 billion today
would mark the most issuance since Oct. 12, when $9.1 billion of
securities were sold. Borrowers are showing renewed confidence
in the market as investors wager that European leaders will
prevent the region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis from infecting bank
balance sheets globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1 billion Citigroup issue yielded 245 basis points, or
2.45 percentage points, more than comparable Treasuries, while
the Goldman Sachs issue paid a 295 basis-point spread, according
to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s pricing is expensive for investors since the
bank&#8217;s outstanding 10-year notes trade at spreads of about 250
basis points, James Leonard, a Chicago-based securities analyst
at Morningstar Inc., wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an interesting day with Citi coming out and doing
a billion tight to where its old issuance traded, so obviously
there is demand in the market,&#8221; said Leonard. &#8220;I think these
banks are trying to get ahead of any potential European
problems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canceled Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meeting of European finance ministers scheduled for
tomorrow to decide on bank recapitalization was canceled, the
U.K. government and a person familiar with the matter said on
condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. That
fueled concern the region&#8217;s leaders may struggle to resolve the
debt crisis at a summit tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outstanding Goldman bonds traded yesterday at a spread
of 300 basis points, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors demanded yields of 3.29 percentage points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries to hold Citigroup debt
yesterday, compared with 3.75 percentage points at the beginning
of the month, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. Spreads on Goldman Sachs debt tightened by 29 basis points
over the same period, while spreads for all U.S. banks decreased
30 basis points. Spreads on U.S. investment-grade companies
tightened by 23 basis points, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services provider, added $7 billion
to its share-buyback plan to boost per-share earnings and
investor returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition brings the size of the repurchase program to
$12.2 billion, as IBM had $5.2 billion remaining of its previous
repurchase authorization, according to a statement from the
Armonk, New York-based company today. Last week, IBM said it had
bought back $11.5 billion of stock this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The buyback program, given their exceptional cash flow,
is one of the key elements of continuing to grow their
earnings&#8221; per share, said Louis Miscioscia, a Collins Stewart
analyst in Boston, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is using buybacks as
he targets operating earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015,
up from $13.35 the company projects for this year. IBM has spent
more than $100 billion on dividends and buybacks since 2003, the
year Palmisano became the chairman. He has also increased
earnings by steering the company toward software and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has said it plans to spend $50 billion on
buybacks through 2015. In the third quarter, the reduction in
share count contributed 18 cents to earnings of $3.28 a share,
which beat analysts&#8217; estimates. IBM ended the third quarter with
$11.3 billion in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividend Increases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also declared a quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share,
payable on Dec. 10. IBM has increased its dividend every year
for 16 years, bumping it to 75 cents in April. Since 2006, IBM
has bumped the dividend up by 10 cents each year, except for in
2009, when the increase was halved amid the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1 percent to $180.36 at the close in New York. The
shares have climbed 23 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyback extension is in line with IBM&#8217;s repurchase
strategy and was largely expected by investors, said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) said its board authorized $7 billion in funds for stock
buybacks, in addition to about $5.2 billion remaining at the end
of September from a prior authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said it expects to request additional share repurchase
authorization at the company&#8217;s April 2012 board meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BankInvest, a Danish asset manager
which owns a 0.25 percent stake in G4S Plc (GFS), will vote against
the security provider&#8217;s $8.2 billion takeover of ISS A/S at next
week&#8217;s shareholder meeting, its stock portfolio manager said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve already closed the envelope and mailed the proxies
for the shareholder meeting to vote against,&#8221; Kasper Brix- Andersen said in phone interview from Copenhagen today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Danish shareholders, including Carnegie Asset
Management and Nykredit Asset Management also opposed the deal,
newspaper Borsen reported today, citing their portfolio
managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see a risk of negative synergies,&#8221; Brix-Andersen said.
&#8220;Combining two service companies only allows cutting middle
management and account managers, which are the ones who tie
clients to the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G4S Chief Executive Officer Nick Buckles needs at least 75
percent of shareholders to approve the purchase of ISS, the
world&#8217;s largest cleaning service provider, at a Nov. 2
shareholder meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawley, England-based G4S plans a 2 billion-pound ($3.2
billion) rights offer to fund the purchase. G4S is buying
Copenhagen-based ISS from EQT Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital
Partners for a total value of 5.2 billion pounds, of which 3.7
billion pounds is assumed debt. &lt;/p&gt;

Goran Avdicevic as a managing director for industrials
investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avdicevic was an executive director and senior coverage

banking group, New York-based Jefferies said today in a

transportation and logistics industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies said in September its headcount expanded 29
percent in its fiscal third quarter from the year-earlier period
as the firm added bankers and traders from some of the biggest
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goran&#8217;s significant experience with clients in the

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) signed a deal with
Compal Electronics Inc. for tablets, mobile phones, e-readers
and other consumer devices running the Android or Chrome
platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific details and financial terms of the agreement
weren&#8217;t disclosed other than a mention that the company will
receive royalties from Taipei-based Compal, Microsoft said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s patent licensing business began when Marshall Phelps joined the Redmond, Washington-based software company in
2003 after spending 28 years growing patent-licensing into a
billion dollar business at International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
Phelps was Microsoft&#8217;s Corporate Vice President and Deputy
General Counsel for Intellectual Property and Licensing until
his departure in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company began using litigation as part of its patent-
licensing strategy after Horacio Gutierrez took over management
of the company&#8217;s patent portfolio in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Microsoft statement, Gutierrez said the licensing
agreement with Compal meant that more than half the companies in

range infringe a &#8220;fundamental&#8221; Gigaset patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is seeking money damages and an injunction
regarding the use of its technology. It also asked for a court
order for destruction of the allegedly infringing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phyton Sues Samyang in Germany Over Paclitaxel Production Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phyton Ltd.&#8217;s Phyton Biotech unit filed a patent-
infringement suit against Seoul&#8217;s Samyang Corp., according to a
company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in a German court, is related to a patent
for plant cell fermentation using cell lines derived from the
Taxus species to produce the paclitaxel compound. Taxus is the
family to which yew trees belong, and paclitaxel is used to
treat a variety of cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phyton claims Samyang&#8217;s method of producing paclitaxel
infringed the patent. It asked the court to order Samyang to
halt its alleged infringement, and requested a ban on the sale
and use of Samyang&#8217;s paclitaxel in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phyton, based in San Antonio, is a global supplier of
paclitaxel and docetaxel, a related anti-cancer compound also
produced from yew trees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Tells German Cafe&#8217;s Logo Infringes Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), maker of the iPod and iPad, has sent a cease-
and-desist letter to the owners of a Bonn, Germany, cafe,
Geek.com technology news website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apfelkind cafe, which registered its mark in Munich in
June, was told its logo was confusingly similar to Cupertino,
California-based Apple, according to Geek.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cafe, which offers a family-oriented coffeehouse
setting with a playroom for kids, features apple-related foods
and drinks on its menu, such as apple blossom tea, Geek.com
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proprietor of the cafe said she doesn&#8217;t think the
public is confused by her logo, according to the news website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s Says Wonderful&#8217;s &#8216;W&#8217; Logo Infringes Arches Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD), the world&#8217;s largest restaurant chain, has
filed a second trademark infringement suit against Wonderful, a
Beijing restaurant, the WantChinatimes.com news website
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2003 Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald&#8217;s has been
objecting to Wonderful&#8217;s logo, a red letter &#8220;W&#8221; on a yellow
background it says too closely resemble its &#8220;golden arches&#8221;
logo, according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, China&#8217;s trademark appeal board said that despite
McDonald&#8217;s protests, the logo could be used for non-restaurant
purposes, WantChinatimes.com reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s argues in Beijing No. 1 People&#8217;s Court that the
restaurant&#8217;s application to register the mark was made in a
malicious fashion, the website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration Sought for &#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; movement has led to several new
applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
according to that office&#8217;s trademark database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resident of Los Angeles filed an application Oct. 6 to
register &#8220;Occupy D.C. 2012,&#8221; with the mark to be used on T-
shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; application was filed Oct. 18 by
a resident of West Islip, New York. According to the
application, the mark would be used for beach bags, back packs,
overnight bags, umbrellas, bumper stickers and clothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 19 a resident of Powell, Ohio, filed an application
to register &#8220;Every Where I Go I Occupy.&#8221; That mark would be
used on T-shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As further evidence of the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; zeitgeist, Caf&#233;Press
Inc.&#8217;s website lists 99 pages of print-on-demand items the San
Mateo, California-based company says are related to the
movement. And a search yesterday of EBay Inc. (EBAY)&#8217;s auction website
for &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; items for sale yielded 3,335
listings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Files Suit in Utah over &#8216;The Biggest Loser&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s Universal City Studios sued 14 Utah-based
companies and residents and another 50 unnamed defendants for
trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed Oct. 21 in federal court in Salt Lake City,
Utah, is related to &#8220;The Biggest Loser&#8221; trademark associated
with Comcast&#8217;s NBC unit&#8217;s television program by the same name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, the defendants have made
unauthorized use of the trademark on www.premierfitnesscamp.com,
which is used to promote the weight-loss camp with which the
defendants are involved in what Universal calls a &#8220;tangled
web&#8221; of ownership and control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal claims it has suffered &#8220;great detriment and
injury&#8221; to its trademark, business, goodwill and profits. News
Corp (NWSA) is a co-plaintiff with Universal because of an agreement
sharing the rights to the mark, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company asked the court to bar further infringement of
its mark, and for awards of money damages, profits the
defendants realized as the result of their alleged infringement,
and attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Fitness Camp didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-
mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal is represented by Karthik Nadesan and Ivan
LePendu of Nadesan Beck PC of Salt Lake City; Mark Kalmansohn of
Kalmansohn  Anderson LLP and Bassil Hamideh of the Hamideh Firm
PC, both of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Universal City Studios Products LLP v. Harbor
Fitness LLP, 2:11-cv-00980-CW, U.S. District Court, District of
Utah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Isn&#8217;t Cutting Piracy Enough, Software Alliance Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China isn&#8217;t reducing software piracy quickly enough and the
government should aim to cut illegal use by 10 percentage points
in the next two years, according to a trade group that tracks
counterfeiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country will eventually surpass the U.S. to become the
industry&#8217;s largest source of piracy losses, Robert Holleyman,
chief executive officer of the Business Software Alliance, said
at a press conference in Beijing yesterday. He declined to
provide a more specific forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, almost four out of five programs in use are
pirated, the alliance said in its annual report in May. The
$7.78 billion commercial value of software pirated in China last
year was second only to the $9.52 billion lost in the U.S., the
report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing progress, but it&#8217;s not progress at the pace
we would have liked to have seen or anticipated,&#8221; Holleyman
told reporters. &#8220;Virtually everyone agrees, piracy in China is
higher than it should be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China isn&#8217;t currently on pace to achieve a 10 percent age-
point reduction over the next two years, Holleyman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should that target be reached in four years, it would
result in creation of 250,000 industry jobs and generate $4
billion in tax revenue in China, Holleyman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of software in China that is pirated dropped
to 78 percent last year, from 79 percent in 2009 and 92 percent
in 2003, according to the May report. While the proportion of
stolen software has declined, its value has increased as the
Chinese software market expands, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holleyman called on the country to update its copyright law
to provide for criminal offenses for piracy and said the country
wouldn&#8217;t see a significant decline in the practice unless it
takes that step. The group will &#8220;ramp up&#8221; lawsuits against
users of unlicensed software, he said, without giving details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has said it increased enforcement of intellectual
property rights. Last year, Chinese courts ruled on 48,051 cases
of intellectual property rights violations, a gain of 33 percent
from the previous year, Wang Shengjun, president of the Supreme
People&#8217;s Court, said in a report to the National People&#8217;s
Congress on March 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of pirated software worldwide rose 14 percent to
$58.8 billion in 2010, almost double the total in 2003,
according to the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Washington-based Business Software Alliance
are some of the biggest software companies including Microsoft
Corp., Apple Inc. and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leesburg Claims Details of Smart Grid Contract Are Trade Secrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Leesburg, Florida, has refused to release the
cost of a contract with General Electric Co. (GE) to own and operate
the city&#8217;s &#8220;smart grid&#8221; electrical grid system, Florida&#8217;s
Orlando Sentinel reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is claiming the price and the details of the
bidding process are trade secrets, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leesburg Finance Director told the Sentinel that rate
payers needn&#8217;t worry that the project will cause power-delivery
problems because &#8220;as high-profile as GE is, they&#8217;re not going
to let this puppy fail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City officials have said that once the contract with GE is
signed, the total price will be revealed, minus the specifics of
the bid, the Sentinel reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article One Hires Head of Clorox IP Litigation Team &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winghart has undergraduate degrees in chemical engineering
and in pulp and paper technology from North Carolina State
University and a law degree from Tulane University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheppard Mullin Richter  Hampton LLP hired Nagendra
&#8220;Nick&#8221; Setty for its IP practice group, the Los Angeles-based
firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setty, a litigator, joins from Boston&#8217;s Fish  Richardson

&lt;p&gt;Handy, who does transactional work for life sciences
companies, joins from Chicago&#8217;s DLA Piper LLP. He has handled
development, collaboration, license and material transfer
agreements; software, telecommunications and information
technology agreements, and supply, distribution, sales
representative and other supply-side agreements for
biopharmaceuticals, diagnostic, medical device,
telecommunications and software products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree in molecular biology and a
master&#8217;s degree in biology from the University of California,

&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks fell from a month-
high before talks in Europe aimed at containing the region&#8217;s
debt crisis and after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
recommendation for two of the country&#8217;s biggest metals
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-stock Micex Index (INDEXCF) dropped 0.5 percent to 1,475.51 as
of 2:05 p.m. in Moscow, paring yesterday&#8217;s 2.5 percent gain. OAO
GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia&#8217;s largest miner, slipped 4.2 percent
after Goldman downgraded the stock to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221;
United Co. Rusal, the world&#8217;s biggest aluminum producer, dropped
0.8 percent after it was reduced to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks have risen 17 percent from this year&#8217;s low
on Oct. 5 and reached a one-month high yesterday amid hopes that
European Union policy makers will reach a deal to stop the
banking crisis from spreading. Officials are seeking to bolster
the region&#8217;s rescue fund, recapitalize banks and provide debt
relief to Greece to avoid contagion spreading to Italy and
Spain. Emerging-market stocks climbed for a third day today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A downturn in Europe and slower growth in the U.S. may lead
to less demand growth for commodities, Goldman said in the note
e-mailed today. Norilsk fell to 6,290 rubles, its biggest
intraday drop since Oct. 4, while Rusal&#8217;s Russian depositary
receipts declined to 270.10 rubles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar-measured RTS Index added 0.2 percent to
1,511.73. OAO Sberbank, Russia&#8217;s biggest lender, slid 0.9
percent on the Micex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex has lost 13 percent in 2011 and trades at 5.2
times analysts&#8217; earnings estimates for member companies. That
compares with an 18 percent slide for Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa index,
which trades at 10 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 11
times estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index has
a ratio of 14.7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivek Rajpal, a Mumbai-based fixed-
income strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan&#8217;s biggest
brokerage, comments on the outlook for India&#8217;s bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India raised the repurchase rate to
8.50 percent today from 8.25 percent and signaled it&#8217;s nearing
the end of its record cycle of increases as the economy cools.
Eighteen of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News survey
predicted the decision, with the remainder forecasting no change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The RBI is more dovish than what the market expected, and
they have brought growth concerns to the fore. The interest-rate
swap curve should bull steepen now that the RBI is indicating a
pause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since the RBI has clearly mentioned it will &#8216;manage
liquidity to ensure it remains in moderate deficit,&#8217; I expect
them to conduct open-market operations at the end of November or
early December when liquidity conditions will be outside the
comfort zone. So bonds should rally on expectations of open-
market operations. The bond yield and repurchase rate should
converge on expectations of a pause.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

the research company in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Windows Phone will be the fastest growing

&lt;p&gt;ABC Spark will go on the air in early 2012 targeting 10

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is among
firms that could gain by buying part or all of MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MF), said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale
Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman could benefit from MF Global&#8217;s plight,&#8221; Bove
said in a note today. &#8220;One might argue that Goldman is over
capitalized and that it has too much liquidity. Buying some or
all of MF Global might create the opportunity to make a windfall
profit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global, run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jon Corzine, is exploring strategic options, including a potential
sale, after reporting its biggest quarterly loss ever and having
its credit ratings cut by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, a person
with knowledge of the matter said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm needs to generate liquidity and find a partner
with excess capital and a &#8220;sizable&#8221; trading operation, Bove
said in a telephone interview. Goldman Sachs, which Corzine
helped run from 1994 to 1999, and Citigroup Inc., both based in
New York, would be &#8220;logical buyers,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos at Citigroup declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large deposit-taking banks may not want to buy MF Global
because they would have to set aside cash to back the futures
trades placed by the firm&#8217;s customers, said Allan Zavarro, the
former global head of futures trading for ABN Amro Bank NV.
Regulatory capital in the range of 6 percent to 10 percent of
client funds on deposit must be set aside by the broker or bank,
Zavarro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Allocation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure the big banks would want a big futures
position on their books now because they have to allocate
regulatory capital to it,&#8221; he said in an Oct. 25 telephone
interview. As of Aug. 31, MF Global had $7.2 billion of customer
funds in segregated accounts, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, MF Global sold $300 million in preferred shares
and notes to the public and as much as $300 million in equity-
linked securities to buyout firm JC Flowers  Co. to help repay
a $1.05 billion bridge loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR), the investment bank founded by
former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, might also
show interest in a deal with MF Global, Bove said. The firm is
advising MF Global on the review of its business, said a person
with knowledge of the matter today. Evercore may be interested
in providing advisory clients with the ability to raise funds
through a fixed-income trading platform, Bove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if Evercore jumped up as a
company that was going to acquire them,&#8221; he said. Such a deal
might not resolve MF Global&#8217;s liquidity needs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evercore would more likely be interested in fee-based, low-
capital-intensive businesses, said Warren Gardiner, an analyst
for Ticonderoga Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana Gorman, a spokesman for Evercore, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
Director Rajat Gupta pleaded not guilty to insider trading
charges today in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
director Rajat Gupta was indicted for conspiracy and securities
fraud, making him the highest-ranking executive charged in a
nationwide crackdown on insider trading centered on Raj Rajaratnam, co-founder of hedge fund Galleon Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co. (PG),
was charged with five counts of securities fraud and one count
of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in an indictment
unsealed today in Manhattan federal court. The U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission also sued Gupta, 62, today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From 2008 through January 2009, Gupta disclosed to Raj
Rajaratnam material, nonpublic information that Gupta had
learned in his capacity as a member of the boards of directors
of Goldman Sachs and PG with the understanding that Rajaratnam
would use the inside information to purchase and sell
securities,&#8221; according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation and prosecutors in the
office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara have spent four
years probing illegal trading at hedge funds, technology
companies, banks and consulting firms. Gupta gave himself up to
the FBI today in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam on Oct. 13 was sentenced to 11 years in prison,
the longest term for insider trading in U.S. history. Gupta
faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted on each of the
securities fraud charges and as long as five years if convicted
of the conspiracy charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Totally Baseless&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government&#8217;s allegations are totally baseless,&#8221; Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, said in an e-mailed statement
today. &#8220;The facts in this case demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is
innocent of any of these charges and that he has always acted
with honesty and integrity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftalis said there were &#8220;legitimate reasons&#8221; for his
client to communicate with Rajaratnam, including a $10 million
investment Gupta had with a fund Rajaratnam managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He did not trade in any securities, did not tip Mr.
Rajaratnam so he could trade, and did not share in any profits
as part of any quid pro quo,&#8221; Naftalis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment describes a series of calls between Gupta
and Rajaratnam in which the inside information was allegedly
passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the close of the New York Stock Exchange on Sept.
23, 2008, Gupta participated by phone in a meeting of the
Goldman Sachs board, according to the indictment. During the
meeting, Goldman agreed to accept a $5 billion investment from
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised holdings in the past year in the
London Metal Exchange, the 134-year old bourse that&#8217;s facing a
possible takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman increased its stake in LME Holdings Ltd. by 330,000
ordinary shares to 1.23 million shares as of Sept. 26, according
to filings with the U.K.&#8217;s Companies House. JPMorgan owned
800,000 shares compared with 550,000 shares a year earlier,
while ScotiaMocatta transferred 30,000 shares in the period to
leave the company with no shares, the filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LME, which handles 80 percent of global trade in metals
futures, told members last month that it would begin a process
that may lead to &#8220;an acceptable offer for the company being
received.&#8221; Any sale would take at least until the end of the
second quarter to complete, Martin Abbott, chief executive
officer, said earlier this month. The bourse operates London&#8217;s
last open-outcry transactions in which traders shout out orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange issues two share classes. Ordinary shares
confer ownership and 330,000 of them traded at 4.925 pounds
($7.89) in July, according to data on the bourse&#8217;s website. B
shares exchanged hands at 85.425 pounds on Sept. 27. Neither
shares trade on an exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LME spokeswoman Miriam Heywood declined to comment on the
latest holdings. Sophie Bullock, Goldman&#8217;s spokeswoman, declined
to comment. Kate Haywood, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe has complained to the
United Nations and the Swiss government because members of
President Robert Mugabe&#8217;s entourage were denied visas to attend
a telecommunications conference in Geneva, the Herald said,
citing Mugabe&#8217;s spokesman, George Charamba and an unidentified
official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charamba, Mugabe&#8217;s wife, Grace, the head of Mugabe&#8217;s
Central Intelligence Organization and at least two other members
of Mugabe&#8217;s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
party weren&#8217;t allowed to visit the country, the state-owned
newspaper said on its website. Mugabe was granted a visa before
he canceled the trip in protest, the Herald said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refusal to grant visas contravenes UN regulations, the
Herald said. A Swiss official said the country had issued visas
to an &#8220;adequate&#8221; number of Zimbabwean delegates, it added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men and women denied visas are all listed in a European
Union travel ban imposed on senior members of Mugabe&#8217;s party.
Telecommunications Minister Nelson Chamisa, a member of the
Movement for Democratic Change, was given a visa to attend the
conference, said the Herald. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Oct 27, 2011  6:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-27/exxon-s-tillerson-needs-record-oil-output-to-meet-production-growth-target.html"><headline>Exxon&#8217;s Tillerson Needs Record Oil Output to Meet Production Growth Target</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson may struggle to reach his full-year
production target after rallying oil prices reduced the
company&#8217;s take from wells in Africa and output slumped in the
U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest company by market value, needs
to boost production in the current quarter to the equivalent of
5 million barrels a day to meet the 4 percent growth target for
2011 that Tillerson set forth during a March presentation to
analysts in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest Exxon ever came to pumping that much crude and
natural gas was during the final three months of 2010, when
daily output reached 4.97 million barrels. Even with new wells
in Iraq and Russia adding to the company&#8217;s global production,
Tillerson may fall short of the mark, said Allen Good, an oil-
industry analyst at Morningstar Investment Services Inc. in
Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d be surprised if they hit that number,&#8221; Good said
during a telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re having long-term trouble
growing oil volumes and I don&#8217;t see how they get to five&#8221;
million barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s worldwide oil and gas production declined by 3.8
percent during the July-to-September period to the equivalent of
4.28 million barrels of crude a day, the Irving, Texas-based
company said yesterday in a statement. It was the lowest output
since the second quarter of last year and the largest decline
since 2008, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production Agreements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When international crude prices rise, energy prospectors
such as Exxon receive a smaller portion of output from wells
governed by production-sharing contracts in countries like
Nigeria. In Africa, which accounts for more than one-fifth of
Exxon&#8217;s global crude supply, the company&#8217;s output tumbled 24
percent during the quarter, the biggest decline anywhere in the
world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, Exxon&#8217;s crude output dropped 16 percent,
according to a company statement. U.S. oil production from Exxon
wells declined by 5.8 percent. The company boosted crude output
in Asia by 7.3 percent to 806,000 barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding the impacts of higher crude prices, asset sales
and quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Exxon&#8217;s output was unchanged from a year earlier,
David Rosenthal, the company&#8217;s vice president of investor
relations, said during a conference call with analysts
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Producer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that basis, Exxon may be able to meet its full-year
production forecast, he said during the call. In March, at the
company&#8217;s annual presentation to the investment community at the
New York Stock Exchange, Tillerson forecast production growth of
as much as 4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a growth rate would translate into full-year average
daily output equivalent to 4.625 million barrels, compared with
4.447 in 2010, based on Bloomberg calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon pumps about 3 percent of the world&#8217;s oil, producing
more than OPEC members such as Kuwait and Algeria, according to
International Energy Agency figures. The company&#8217;s $396 billion
market valuation exceeds the economic output of all but 22
nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is outperforming its biggest rivals, advancing 12
percent since the end of last year. PetroChina Co. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), the second- and third-largest oil companies by
market value, have increased 2.2 percent and 10 percent,
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon abandoned a well in the Turkish sector of the Black
Sea during the third quarter that failed to find oil or gas,
Rosenthal said yesterday. The dry hole followed recent
exploration failures by the company in Brazil, where Exxon is
attempting to sell a 25 percent stake in an offshore prospect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconventional Prospects &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson is spending as much as $37 billion this year to
search for crude, erect gas-liquefaction plants and expand
refineries and chemical plants. The company spent $38 billion in
the past 16 months acquiring shale-rock formations and the
expertise to crack them as part of Tillerson&#8217;s move into so-
called unconventional prospects that require intensive drilling
techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon also is counting on production increases from mega-
projects such as the Kearl oil-sands development in Canada, the
West Qurna oilfield in Iraq and Sakhalin-1, an offshore oil and
gas project in Russia&#8217;s Far East, said Douglas Ober, whose $1.6
billion under management includes Exxon shares at Adams Express
Co (ADX) and Petroleum  Resources Corp. (PEO) in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Pipeline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are probably going to fall a little short&#8221; of the
production target this year, said Ober, whose holdings include
1.6 million Exxon shares. &#8220;That said, they&#8217;ve got a bunch of
projects coming on stream in the next couple of years that will
add a lot to output. To expect them to keep having new projects
come online constantly is unrealistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s output during the current quarter probably will get
a boost as the European winter begins and rising furnace use
increases demand for gas from Exxon-run fields in countries such
as the Netherlands, Morningstar&#8217;s Good said. European wells
account for 25 percent of the company&#8217;s worldwide gas
production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matthew Leising" date="Oct 27, 2011  4:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-27/corzine-copying-goldman-sachs-at-mf-sends-stock-down-54-as-bet-backfires.html"><headline>Corzine Copying Goldman at MF Sends Stock Down as Bet Fails</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Jon Corzine, who won the top job at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. by leading the firm&#8217;s fixed-income
unit, now says he&#8217;s responsible for trading decisions that have
almost wiped out the stock-market value of his futures
brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Corzine became chairman and chief executive officer
of New York-based MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) in March 2010, he&#8217;s
increased the firm&#8217;s risk and used its own money to trade,
including investments in European sovereign debt that have
tumbled in value. This week, the firm reported its biggest
quarterly loss ever, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service cut its rating to
one level above junk, shares plummeted 61 percent and 6.25
percent bonds issued in August fell into distressed levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On a personal note, our positions and the judgment about
risk-mediation steps are my personal responsibility and a prime
focus of my attention,&#8221; the 64-year-old former New Jersey
Democratic governor and U.S. senator said Oct. 25 on an earnings
conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global, the former brokerage unit of London-based Man
Group Plc (EMG) that went public in July 2007, is seeking a buyer for
its futures brokerage subsidiary and is looking to strike a deal
within days, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has been contacting large banks already in the
futures business, said the people, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the talks are private. Under the plan being
discussed, its holding company and other businesses wouldn&#8217;t be
included in the sale, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Deterioration &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings cut the rankings of MF Global to BB+, the
highest junk status, from BBB today, citing the challenges of
earning profits from interest in the current &#8220;low interest rate
environment.&#8221; The Federal Reserve target on overnight loans has
been between zero and 0.25 percent since late 2008. The ratings
company also noted MF Global&#8217;s increased proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These increased risk taking activities have resulted in
sizeable concentrated positions relative to the firm&#8217;s capital
base, leaving MF vulnerable to potential credit deterioration
and/or significant margin calls,&#8221; Fitch wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global is getting advice from Evercore Partners Inc. as
it seeks buyers for the brokerage unit and examines other
options, the people said. Market perceptions may leave the firm
in the same kind of position faced by banks during the financial
crisis in 2007 and 2008, when credit dried up, said Fifth Third
Asset Management&#8217;s Mitchell Stapley in Grand Rapids, Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson From 2008 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the one lesson you take away from the 2008
experience,&#8221; said Stapley, chief fixed-income officer for Fifth
Third, which manages $22 billion. &#8220;When sentiment turns on any
financial firm that&#8217;s dependent on external sources of funding,
as really any financial firm is, and if the markets lose
confidence in them and you can begin to see sources of funding
dry up, the pressures on a firm escalate so quickly, so
dramatically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, whose holdings individually and through a trust
total 441,960 shares priced at $1.43 each, declined to be
interviewed, said Diana DeSocio, an MF Global spokeswoman. The
company, which provides execution and clearing services for
exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives and foreign-
exchange products, doesn&#8217;t comment on stock or bond price
movements, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Have to Act&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have to act pretty quickly,&#8221; Peter Kovalski, a
money manager who owns about 25,000 MF Global shares at Alpine
Woods Capital Investors LLC in Purchase, New York, said in a
telephone interview. His firm manages about $6 billion. &#8220;They
have to focus on the immediate problems, they shouldn&#8217;t be
focusing on the long-term strategic plans at this time. They
need to be focusing on short-term survivability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Illinois-born son of a farmer and schoolteacher,
Corzine graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign in 1969, served in the Marine Corps Reserve and
received his master&#8217;s degree in business administration from the
University of Chicago in 1973. He was recruited by Goldman Sachs
in 1975 as a trainee on the government bond desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, with Corzine as co-head of fixed-income, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s pretax income fell by more than 80 percent as the
company lost money on wrong-way interest rate bets, according to
William Cohan&#8217;s history of the investment bank, &#8220;Money and
Power,&#8221; published this year by Doubleday. Corzine resisted
then-Chairman Stephen Friedman&#8217;s calls to scale back risk-
taking, according to the book. Still, Corzine rose to chairman
that year when Friedman departed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia Positions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years later, Corzine, as co-CEO, pushed traders to
keep risky positions after Russia announced a devaluation of the
ruble and defaulted on some of its foreign debt, while co-CEO
Henry Paulson pushed to exit the holdings, according to Cohan.
The firm had almost $1 billion in trading losses in the second
half of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left Goldman Sachs in 1999 with an estimated $400
million as the firm went public. Corzine was elected to the
Senate the following year and became governor in 2006. He was
defeated in the November 2009 election by Republican Chris Christie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine was recommended for the position at MF Global by
former Goldman Sachs banker Christopher Flowers, the chairman
and CEO of JC Flowers  Co. At the same time he took the job,
Corzine became an operating partner of Flowers&#8217;s buyout firm,
which in 2008 bought as much as $300 million of preferred stock
in the firm at a conversion price of $12.50 a share. JC Flowers
controls one of the eight board seats at MF Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors Cheer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine received a $1.5 million signing bonus and is paid
an annual salary in the same amount. He is set to receive a
retention bonus of $1.5 million if he&#8217;s at the firm as of March
31, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arrival on March 23, 2010, was cheered by investors who
drove MF Global shares up 10 percent the next day to $8.08. The
shares rose as high as $9.76 in April 2010 as Corzine said that
the firm&#8217;s move toward trading directly with clients was
becoming more certain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the quarter that ended in June, MF Global revenue from
trading with the firm&#8217;s own money and from taking the other side
of client trades, both Corzine initiatives, rose to 42 percent
of sales, from 23 percent a year earlier, the company said at
the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We understand trading has attendant risks,&#8221; Corzine said
on a July 28 conference call with analysts. The focus is on
&#8220;reducing dependence on one line of business,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine began adding sovereign debt about a year ago,
according to a company presentation. The positions accounted for
16 percent and 12 percent of net revenue in the quarters ended
in March and June, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repurchase Agreements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global, which has a market value of $235.8 million,
holds $6.3 billion of sovereign debt from Italy, Spain, Belgium,
Portugal and Ireland that it&#8217;s using in repurchase agreement
trades with customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a regulatory filing last month, MF Global said the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority required the firm to
boost capital in its U.S. unit because of the repurchase
transactions. On Oct. 24, Moody&#8217;s cited the European exposure as
a reason it cut MF Global&#8217;s credit ratings to Baa3 from Baa2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repurchase transactions are financed to maturity and
don&#8217;t need to be re-funded on an ongoing basis, MF spokeswoman
DeSocio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global increased its repurchase agreements 12.9 percent
to $16.6 billion as of June 30, the company said in a regulatory
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stake Declines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government bonds such as those MF Global has been betting
on have fallen in value this year on concern that European
leaders will fail to contain a crisis of confidence that&#8217;s
pushing Greece toward default. MF Global&#8217;s largest holding is
$3.2 billion in Italian debt. All of the firm&#8217;s European
exposure matures by December 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy&#8217;s 6.52 percent notes due in December 2012 have
dropped to 101.7 cents from 108 cents on the dollar at the end
of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The European sovereign debt would suggest there&#8217;s been a
change in the risk appetite,&#8221; said Patrick O&#8217;Shaughnessy, an
analyst with Raymond James  Associates Inc. in Chicago. The
Moody&#8217;s &#8220;downgrade made the threat real that Corzine wouldn&#8217;t
be able to make good the transition he promised,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since MF Global reported its worst-ever quarterly results,
losing $191.6 million in the three months ended in September,
its stock price reached an all-time intraday low of $1.07
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Corzine bought 52,760 shares valued at $295,949.
As of yesterday, the stock had declined to $89,692. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distressed Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global&#8217;s $325 million of 6.25 percent bonds due August
2016 reached distressed levels on Oct. 25, according to Trace,
Finra&#8217;s bond-price reporting system. The debentures, which
traded as low as 44.5 cents on the dollar yesterday, rebounded
to 61 cents to yield 19 percent, or 17.9 percentage points over
Treasuries. Spreads of more than 10 percentage points are
considered distressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Its bonds are trading at a small fraction of face value,
so I&#8217;m not really sure it can recover,&#8221; said Darrell Duffie, a
finance professor at Stanford University and a member of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s Financial Advisory
Roundtable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Oct 27, 2011  4:10 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-27/exxon-third-quarter-profit-exceeds-10-billion-on-surge-in-crude-oil-price.html"><headline>Exxon Mobil Third-Quarter Profit Tops $10 Billion on Crude Oil Price Surge</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, said net income exceeded $10
billion for a third consecutive quarter as rallying crude prices
more than made up for the biggest production decline in three
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural-gas production fell 3.8 percent to the
equivalent of 4.28 million barrels of crude a day, the largest
decline since the third quarter of 2008, according to Bloomberg
data. The drop was smaller than the double-digit production
shortfalls reported earlier this week by rivals such as BP Plc,
ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp. (HES) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter profit rose to $10.33 billion, or $2.13 a
share, from $7.35 billion, or $1.44, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said today in a Business Wire statement. The
per-share result was in line with the average estimate of 19
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 32 percent to $125
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These guys keep pushing the oil out and selling it like
it&#8217;s going out of style,&#8221; Douglas Ober, who manages $1.6
billion at Adams Express Co. and Petroleum  Resources Corp. in
Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$10 Billion Streak &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time Exxon&#8217;s quarterly profits exceeded $10
billion for three consecutive periods was 2008, when Brent oil
touched an all-time record of $147.50 a barrel and the company
reaped $45.22 billion in full-year net income. So far this year,
Exxon shares have risen 12 percent, poised for the best annual
performance since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 41 percent profit increase was the second-largest
among major international oil companies that have announced
third-quarter results. Only Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the world&#8217;s
third-largest energy company by market value behind Exxon and
PetroChina Co., boasted a larger jump, by doubling net income to
$7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-controlled PetroChina lifted third-quarter profit by
7.8 percent. BP Plc, owner of the Macondo well that erupted last
year and fouled the Gulf of Mexico with millions of barrels of
crude, posted a 3.6 percent decline in net income.
ConocoPhillips (COP), based in Houston, said third-quarter profit fell
14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the largest international oil companies,
Chevron Corp. and France&#8217;s Total SA are scheduled to announce
results tomorrow, followed by Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo
Brasileiro next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s oil, jumped 46 percent during the July-through-September
period to average $112.09 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson plans to spend
as much as $37 billion this year to find untapped oil and gas
reserves, construct gas-export terminals and expand refineries
and chemical plants. In August, Tillerson signed a $3.2 billion
agreement with Russia&#8217;s state-controlled OAO Rosneft to drill
wells in the Black Sea and offshore Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange, Moscow-based Rosneft will be allowed to invest
in some deep-water Gulf of Mexico and onshore Texas prospects,
David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, said
today during a conference call with analysts. Exxon won&#8217;t swap
any assets with Rosneft, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlining Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosneft deal was Exxon&#8217;s biggest transaction since its
$34.9 billion acquisition last year of XTO Energy, a Fort Worth,
Texas-based natural-gas producer. Tillerson is using XTO&#8217;s
expertise in cracking open dense, gas-rich shale rock to access
previously-impenetrable geologic formations in Poland and
elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares rose 1 percent to $81.88 at the closing of
trading in New York. The stock has 14 buy recommendations from
analysts, 11 holds and two sells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s crude output fell 7.1 percent to 2.25 million
barrels a day, led by declines in Africa, the U.S. and Europe,
according to the statement. The company raised gas output in
Europe and the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well in the Turkish sector of the Black Sea that failed
to discover oil or gas has been plugged and abandoned, Exxon&#8217;s
Rosenthal said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to begin drilling for oil in the Romanian
sector of the Black Sea next year and the Russian sector in
2014, Rosenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the company today increased its
estimate for the size of the column of oil-soaked rock
discovered in the Hadrian prospect to 1,000 feet (305 meters)
from a previous 750-foot estimate. The figure was revised after
additional drilling, Rosenthal said. In June, when the discovery
was announced, Exxon said the field probably holds the
equivalent of 700 million barrels of crude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said a
bankruptcy judge must handle its $8.6 billion lawsuit against
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) because the case involves &#8220;classic&#8221;
bankruptcy claims and related common-law claims that don&#8217;t
require a higher-court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman sued New York-based JPMorgan last year, saying the
bank extracted assets that fatally weakened the firm before its
2008 collapse. JPMorgan said it took the collateral under a
federal law enacted to safeguard banks lending to faltering
companies. It asked a district judge to decide the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exit from bankruptcy courts became common after a
Supreme Court ruling in the Anna Nicole Smith case described
limits to the powers of bankruptcy judges. JPMorgan, HSBC
Holdings Plc, UniCredit SpA and hundreds of individuals have
asked district judges to handle suits brought by the liquidator
of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s effort to move the Lehman case is based on a
&#8220;mischaracterization&#8221; of the claims and the Supreme Court
ruling, the bankrupt firm said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s interpretation &#8220;is so overbroad as to require a
radical alteration of the division of labor between bankruptcy
courts and district courts,&#8221; it said yesterday in the filing in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, the largest
U.S. bank, declined to comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank&#8217;s Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, has sued
Lehman back, alleging it defrauded its lender into making a
loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Lehman is fighting JPMorgan in bankruptcy court
over a $6 billion payment demand filed by the bank. JPMorgan
wants payment in full, &#8220;while other creditors receive cents on
the dollar,&#8221; Lehman said in yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan yesterday joined a group of banks including
Citigroup Inc. asking a district judge to take a $2 billion
lawsuit by the former Thornburg Mortgage Inc. out of bankruptcy
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 11-cv-06760, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elizabeth Amon" date="Oct 27, 2011  8:52 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-27/ex-goldman-director-gupta-cantor-altria-terra-in-court-news.html"><headline>Ex-Goldman Director Rajat Gupta, Cantor in Court News</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The insider-trading prosecution of
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director Rajat Gupta is built on
circumstantial evidence that may be less persuasive than the
wiretaps that sealed the fate of his friend Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the case against the Galleon Group LLC co-founder
and hedge fund tycoon, which included his own words in calls
with leakers, prosecutors will seek to convict Gupta based on
the timing of his phone calls and the Rajaratnam trades that
immediately followed, said Peter Henning, a law professor at
Wayne State University in Detroit. Wiretaps likely to be used at
Gupta&#8217;s trial involve Rajaratnam boasting of a source he doesn&#8217;t
name. The government said that source is Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors &#8220;don&#8217;t have the wiretaps, the smoking gun
evidence,&#8221; Henning said in an interview following Gupta&#8217;s
surrender to the FBI yesterday in Manhattan. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call
it a weak case, but there are some challenges that weren&#8217;t
featured in the Rajaratnam case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 62, who previously led McKinsey  Co., became the
highest-ranking executive to be charged in a four-year probe by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation that led to a nationwide
crackdown on insider trading. Yesterday, prosecutors unsealed a
six-count indictment accusing him of leaking inside information
to his business partner Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, was sentenced on Oct. 13 to 11 years in
prison, the longest term for insider trading in U.S. history,
following his conviction in May. If convicted, Gupta faces up to
20 years in prison on each of five securities fraud counts and
as long as five years on a conspiracy charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also served on the board of Procter  Gamble
Co. (PG), the world&#8217;s largest consumer-products company, pleaded not
guilty yesterday in an appearance in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government&#8217;s allegations are totally baseless,&#8221;
defense attorney Gary Naftalis said in a statement. &#8220;Mr. Gupta
is innocent of any of these charges and that he has always acted
with honesty and integrity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s indictment cites at least three instances in which
he allegedly leaked tips to Rajaratnam. He&#8217;s accused of telling
Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)&#8217;s $5 billion investment
in Goldman Sachs in September 2008, about the bank&#8217;s unexpected
fourth-quarter loss that year, and about PG&#8217;s poor performance
in late 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a related lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the agency said Gupta tipped Rajaratnam about
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s second-quarter profit in 2008. The regulator
puts Rajaratnam&#8217;s profit from the entire insider scheme at more
than $23 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government said that Gupta benefitted in financial and
non-financial ways from the alleged conspiracy. Some such
benefit must be proven in a case against a tipper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, and SEC v. Gupta,
11-cv-07566, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BNY Mellon Sued by Funds Over Foreign Exchange Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the world&#8217;s largest custody
bank, was sued by pension funds in California over allegations
that it overcharged for foreign-exchange transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state False Claims Act lawsuit, filed in 2009, was
unsealed yesterday in state court in Alameda County, California,
the law firm Cotchett Pitre  McCarthy LLP said in an e-mailed
statement. The firm represents employee retirement funds in Los
Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds in Los Angeles and other California counties
claim that BNY Mellon said it would use &#8220;best practices&#8221; when
executing foreign exchange transactions to give its clients the
highest price when in fact it used the least advantageous prices
and secretly profited from the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts&#8217;s Secretary of the Commonwealth William
Galvin yesterday filed an administrative complaint against the
bank over similar allegations following lawsuits brought by the
attorneys general of New York, Virginia and Florida and the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon used &#8220;a hidden scheme that rigged the pricing
of non-negotiated foreign-exchange transactions while maximizing
profits for the bank,&#8221; Galvin said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Treasurer Steven Grossman said in June that
New York-based BNY Mellon overcharged the state&#8217;s public pension
system by $30.5 million since 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, said the
Massachusetts complaint &#8220;recycles baseless allegations&#8221; and
the bank is confident it&#8217;s &#8220;right on the facts and on the
law.&#8221; Heine didn&#8217;t immediately return a voice-mail message left
after regular business hours yesterday seeking comment on the
California lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global Hunter&#8217;s Teevan Sues Ex-Employer Cantor Fitzgerald &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty Teevan, head of trading at Global Hunter Securities
LLC, sued his former employer, Cantor Fitzgerald LP, in a
contract dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teevan, who left Cantor in September 2010, filed a sealed
complaint in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington Oct. 25. He
accused the New York-based brokerage firm of a breach of
contract, according to documents submitted with the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Teevan asked the court to seal the complaint
because it includes Cantor&#8217;s partnership agreement, which
includes a confidentiality obligation, according to court
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teevan, who was hired by Ticonderoga Securities LLC in
March, joined Global Hunter in September with three other
Ticonderoga bankers. Ticonderoga had shut down its fixed-income
business in August, six months after starting the unit, as
trading volumes shrank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor doesn&#8217;t comment on litigation, spokesman Robert
Hubbell said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Teevan v. Cantor Fitzgerald LP, CA6976,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RightNow Shareholder Sues Over $1.5 Billion Oracle Purchase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A RightNow Technologies Inc. shareholder sued over the
software maker&#8217;s plan to sell itself to Oracle Corp. (ORCL) for $1.5
billion, calling the deal &#8220;fundamentally unfair.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed transaction stems from a flawed process that
lacked an open auction and includes deal protections that favor
Oracle, shareholder Sanjay Israni said in the complaint filed
Oct. 25 in Delaware Chancery Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Neither RightNow&#8217;s management, nor its board, has fully
explained why the company, or its current management, needs to
abandon their deliberately conceived internal growth strategies
for a short-term profit,&#8221; Israni said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed deal announced this week, RightNow
shareholders will get $43 a share, or 20 percent more than
Bozeman, Montana-based RightNow&#8217;s closing price on Oct. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition will help Oracle, based in Redwood City,
California, add software that helps companies serve customers
using call centers, the Internet and social networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israni seeks to represent all RightNow shareholders in his
request for a court order barring the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaia Zimmerman, a RightNow spokeswoman, declined by e-mail
to comment on the suit, saying the company hadn&#8217;t reviewed the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Israni v. RightNow Technologies Inc., CA6977,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drug Companies Hid Thalidomide Birth Defects, 13 People Allege &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grunenthal GmbH, a German drugmaker, and companies now part
of GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and Sanofi (SAN) were accused in a lawsuit of
hiding results of studies that would have revealed the extent of
birth defects caused by Thalidomide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen people born in the U.S. with birth defects from
1957 to 1962 sued the drugmakers and distributors Oct. 25 in a
Pennsylvania state court in Philadelphia, claiming the
businesses conspired to withhold the information to maximize
sales and protect themselves from liability. The drug was
prescribed then to combat morning sickness in early term
pregnancies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the defects, including missing and malformed limbs,
were known in Europe, they couldn&#8217;t have happened in the U.S.,
the companies allegedly told Congress, because the drug was
available only on a limited clinical-trial basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a carefully constructed lie sold to the public to
protect defendants from having to accept responsibility for what
they had done,&#8221; according to the 160-page complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claiming that concealment prevented them from knowing until
recently the true cause of their deformities, the plaintiffs are
seeking compensatory and punitive damages from the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi-Aventis US LLC, part of Paris-based Sanofi, and
Grunenthal, based in Aaschen, Germany, are accused of
fraudulently claiming the relationship between Thalidomide and
birth defects wasn&#8217;t known until November 1961 while the risks
were knowable as early as 1955. Now part of Sanofi, Richardson-Merrell Inc., was a North American distributor of Thalidomide,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Cox, a U.S. spokesman for Sanofi, had no immediate
comment on the lawsuit. Frank Schoenrock, a spokesman for
Grunenthal, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the company said it would pay 50 million euros
($69.3 million) to people injured by the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, Kline  French, now part of Brentford, U.K.-based
GlaxoSmithKline, allegedly knew of the defects as early as 1958. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Anne Rhyne, a U.S. spokeswoman for the company in
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, didn&#8217;t immediately reply
to a voice-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Yeatts v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 003316,
Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, Court of Common Pleas, Trial
Division (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rakoff Asks Madoff Trustee to Explain Reason for &#8216;Clawbacks&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff told the trustee liquidating
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm to explain why investor James Greiff
shouldn&#8217;t keep money he says he took from the Ponzi scheme &#8220;in
good faith.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee, Irving Picard, has sued about 5,000 investors
who, he conceded, didn&#8217;t know of the fraud, according to Helen
Chaitman, a lawyer for Greiff. Picard has said he did so because
it&#8217;s &#8220;equitable&#8221; to take back fictitious profits to pay
investors who lost money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These arguments implicate the questions about how to
integrate the securities and bankruptcy laws,&#8221; Rakoff wrote in
an order filed in Manhattan federal court yesterday. Under
securities law, some withdrawals from a brokerage firm may be
protected from so-called clawbacks, the judge has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said in the order that he took the case out of
bankruptcy court to decide such issues. How he rules could
affect other investors like Greiff. Rakoff said this month that
he might take over 30 Picard suits related to one filed against
a different investor, Gerald Blumenthal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, a profit sharing plan, a revocable trust and a
money-management firm all filed arguments yesterday on why their
cases should be handled by a district judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruling last month on Picard&#8217;s $1 billion lawsuit against
the owners of the New York Mets, Rakoff cut the trustee&#8217;s
potential claims by two-thirds, saying he was only entitled to
try to claw back withdrawals made in the two years before
Madoff&#8217;s 2008 bankruptcy. Picard has asked him if he can appeal
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Greiff, 11-cv-03775, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New York Working With Delaware on Criminal Foreclosure Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is working with
his Delaware counterpart, Beau Biden, to investigate what he
called possible &#8220;criminal acts&#8221; by financial institutions tied
to the foreclosure crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a man-made crisis -- it was created by
regulatory neglect and greed,&#8221; Schneiderman said last night in
a TV interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Beau Biden, who is the attorney general of Delaware, and
I thought we really needed to dig in a little bit deeper,&#8221;
Schneiderman told MSNBC&#8217;s Rachel Maddow. &#8220;We&#8217;re also looking at
the conduct of individual institutions and individuals to see if
there were misrepresentations made, to see if there was any
fraud committed, to see if criminal acts were also a part of
this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman has been investigating mortgage practices of
banks as state and federal officials negotiate a settlement with
lenders over foreclosure and mortgage-servicing conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 50 state attorneys general last year announced they
were investigating bank foreclosure after disclosures that
faulty documents were being used to seize homes. Negotiations
with banks including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) haven&#8217;t produced a settlement more than a year since the
investigation began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, and Kristin Lemkau, a
spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, declined to comment on
Schneiderman&#8217;s remarks. Joe Rogalsky, a spokesman for Biden,
declined to comment immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman and Biden have said any settlement with the
banks shouldn&#8217;t provide liability releases to the companies for
matters that haven&#8217;t been fully investigated, including the
packaging of loans into securities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Altria, Reynolds American Begin Trial of 600 Smoking Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A West Virginia jury began hearing a case intended to
resolve more than 600 smoking-related personal-injury cases
against the biggest U.S. cigarette makers, including Altria
Group Inc. (MO)&#8217;s Philip Morris unit and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (RAI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jurors in state court in Wheeling heard the start of
opening statements in a two-phase trial. In the first phase,
which began yesterday, the jury is being asked to determine
general liability questions and the availability of punitive
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is about the corporations&#8217; responsibility,&#8221;
Kenneth McClain, a lawyer for the smokers, said in court. &#8220;They
were actively keeping from the public the information that they
had.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, which was originally consolidated for trial
purposes in 2000, was moved to Wheeling from Charleston, West
Virginia, after Circuit Judge Arthur Recht was unable to find
enough jurors qualified to hear the case there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jurors will be asked to determine questions related to
the companies&#8217; liability, including whether they marketed a
defective product. If jurors find for the plaintiffs, they will
also determine whether any of the defendants engaged in conduct
that can support an award of punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies have claimed the two-phase plan is unworkable
and violates their right to a fair trial. West Virginia&#8217;s
Supreme Court, ruling on a question certified for appeal by
Recht, found in 2005 that the bifurcated trial plan doesn&#8217;t
violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s 14th
Amendment, clearing the way for the claims to go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recht told jurors they will be asked to determine whether
cigarettes are defective products, whether the companies failed
to warn about the dangers of smoking, broke express warranties
and fraudulently concealed information from smokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors will also be asked to decide whether the cigarette
makers &#8220;acted in a willful, wanton and reckless manner,&#8221;
permitting the award of punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Tobacco Litigation (Individual Personal
Injury Cases), 00-C-5000, West Virginia Circuit Court, Ohio
County (Wheeling). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Kirch Meeting Not Unusual, Jentzsch Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2002 meeting of Kirch Group creditor banks called by
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) wasn&#8217;t unusual and didn&#8217;t yield any results,
said Stefan Jentzsch, then chief risk officer at HVB Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks met to discuss how to handle 800 million euros
($1.1 billion) in funds Kirch was presumed to need through the
end of that year, Jentzsch said during testimony at a Munich
appeals court yesterday. The meeting took place on Feb. 14,
2002, and also discussed whether to restructure Leo Kirch&#8217;s firm
to tackle the liquidity crisis, the banker said, undermining a
claim there was a conspiracy to bring down Kirch Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you ask what to do with a group&#8217;s liquidity crisis,
you also ask what to do with a group&#8217;s holdings,&#8221; Jentzsch
said. &#8220;If you massively sell units, the liquidity situation
changes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was scheduled 10 days after former Deutsche
Bank Chief Executive Officer Rolf Breuer said on Bloomberg TV
&#8220;everything that you can read and hear&#8221; is that &#8220;the
financial sector isn&#8217;t prepared to provide further&#8221; loans or
equity to Kirch. Within months, the media group filed for
bankruptcy. Kirch sued Deutsche Bank and Breuer seeking about
3.3 billion euros in suits claiming the bank plotted his
company&#8217;s demise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank and Breuer have long denied the allegations
in the lawsuits, which continued after Kirch&#8217;s July death, and
said Bayerische Landesbank asked Deutsche Bank to call the
meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits claim Deutsche Bank invited the so-called pool
banks including HVB, Commerzbank AG (CBK), BayernLB and DZ Bank AG, to
the meeting to talk them into breaking up the media firm. The
move blocked refinancing efforts, according to the lawsuits.
Kirch had his own meeting with pool banks scheduled the same
day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AB InBev Wins Back &#8216;Bud&#8217; Name in Austria After Court Decision &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) won back the rights to use the name
&#8220;Bud&#8221; on beer in Austria after a local court lifted an
injunction that had given Budejovicky Budvar NP the sole
entitlement to the name in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Viennese commercial court in a decision signed Oct. 19
decided to lift the injunction that prevented Anheuser-Busch
from selling beer under the name American Bud in Austria since
1999. Austria&#8217;s Supreme Court already ruled against Budvar in
August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not only do these positive rulings set a favorable
precedent, they also open up the Austrian market to AB InBev&#8217;s
use of the Bud trademark in Austria,&#8221; Leuven, Belgium-based AB
InBev said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a century-old dispute between Budvar
and AB InBev, the world&#8217;s largest brewer. The clash over the
Austrian rights made it twice to the EU court. The protections
at issue, so-called geographical indications, have been the
subject of trademark cases around the world involving French
champagnes, Italian cheeses and other products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Austrian rulings follow a 2009 decision by the European
Union&#8217;s highest court that clarified the conditions under which
Budvar&#8217;s right in the country could be maintained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petr Samec, a spokesman for Budvar, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budvar claims it owns the rights to &#8220;Bud&#8221; because its
beer comes from Ceske Budejovice, or Budweis in German. The
brewer argued that Bud has been a national geographical
indication since 1975 in the Czech Republic and this protection
was extended by a bilateral agreement to Austria in 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Terra President Gets 15 Years Prison for Teleco Bribes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terra Telecommunications Corp.&#8217;s former president, Joel
Esquenazi, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in a
scheme to bribe officials at state-owned telecommunications
company Haiti Teleco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentence issued Oct. 25 is the longest in a case
involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Justice
Department said in a statement. The former executive vice
president of Miami-based Terra, Carlos Rodriguez, 55, of Davie,
Florida, was sentenced to seven years in prison, according to
the statement. Esquenazi and Rodriguez were also ordered to
forfeit $3.09 million, the Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esquenazi, 52, of Miami, and Rodriguez laundered money and
authorized bribes from November 2001 through March 2005 to
successive directors of international relations at Haiti Teleco,
the sole provider of land-line telephone service in Haiti,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bribes were used to obtain advantages from Haitian
officials for Terra, including preferred telecommunications
rates, reductions in minutes for which payments were owed, and
the continuance of Terra&#8217;s telecommunications connection with
Haiti, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Rosen, a lawyer representing Esquenazi, didn&#8217;t
return a call after regular business hours Oct. 25 seeking
comments about the sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez&#8217;s lawyer, Arturo Hernandez, said in a phone
interview he is &#8220;gratified&#8221; that Rodriquez wasn&#8217;t immediately
sent to prison, giving him a chance to file a motion for a bond
while his conviction is appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez said the government&#8217;s case suffered from
&#8220;scant&#8221; evidence. The appeal will be based in part on an
argument that Haiti&#8217;s former Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive
issued a statement defining Haiti Teleco as a private company,
and as such, not subject to the prohibitions of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, Hernandez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Esquenazi, 09-21010, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks were cut to
&#8220;underweight&#8221; in the regional research portfolio of JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Turkish banks were lowered to &#8220;equal-weight&#8221;
at Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new central bank policy to change interest rates on a
daily basis &#8220;introduces significant uncertainty and
volatility&#8221; and &#8220;is negative for the stock market overall and
may hurt the bank sector in particular,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts
including David Aserkoff said in an e-mailed report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the &#8220;uncertainty and volatility in interest rate
policy,&#8221; Aserkoff said, &#8220;we cannot see investors having enough
comfort and security to get long Turkish stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main ISE National 100 share index gained 1.5 percent
56,319.92 at 11:07 a.m. in Istanbul. Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN),
the biggest listed bank, surged 3.6 percent to 6.36 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s banks were also cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;overweight&#8221; in Morgan Stanley&#8217;s emerging markets portfolio, a
report by analysts Magdalena Stoklosa, Samuel Goodacre and
Tevfik Aksoy said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said yesterday he was
withholding funding for banks at the 5.75 percent benchmark one-
week rate, forcing lenders to pay as much as 12.5 percent
through overnight borrowing. The policy allows the bank to
switch between the rates and gives it flexibility enjoyed by
&#8220;no other bank in the world,&#8221; Basci said, as he moves to
strengthen the lira and control inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank re-introduced the one-week repo lending
today, offering banks as much as 8 billion liras.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it now &#8220;strongly&#8221; prefers Russian stocks to
Turkish stocks. The Turkish central bank&#8217;s policy will affect
banks especially, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect that high and volatile rates could bring 2012
earnings forecasts significantly lower,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;We
worry that foreign outflows on the back of the reversal in
monetary policy will drive underperformance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) directors reached within the company&#8217;s ranks and on Oct.
25 named 30-year-veteran Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty chief
executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice was vintage IBM, which has had only nine CEOs in
its 100-year history; all but one were longtime insiders. Yet in
an era when the technology industry&#8217;s pecking order is often
upended by companies only a few months old, IBM has survived by
remembering it is only one mistake away from irrelevance,
Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its Oct. 31 issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has required discarding businesses it once dominated
-- think personal computers -- and even transforming itself from
a hardware maker into the No. 1 technology services company.
Rometty says that even with IBM&#8217;s deep pockets and $100 billion
in 2010 sales, she plans to keep pressing her management team to
take more risks and embrace change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in the inevitable, or in thinking that
things have to and will turn out in a certain way,&#8221; says
Rometty, who takes over as CEO from Sam Palmisano in January.
&#8220;Whatever business you&#8217;re in, it&#8217;s going to commoditize over
time, so you have to keep moving it to a higher value and
change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty&#8217;s biggest immediate challenge is boosting growth
at Armonk, New York-based IBM. Revenue, which climbed 4&#160;percent
last year, essentially has been flat for six years. She and
plenty of other IBM executives remember the company&#8217;s near-death
experience in the 1990s, says Nicholas Donofrio, the former
executive vice president for innovation and technology who was
running the mainframe business at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were making great things but they weren&#8217;t things that
people wanted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;d rendered ourselves irrelevant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses Mount &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As losses of $16 billion piled up between 1991 and 1993,
former American Express and RJR Nabisco executive Lou Gerstner
was recruited to implement dramatic changes, including firing
35,000 workers to cut costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old IBM, which sold large and costly mainframes, gave
way to a new services-oriented business that aims to help
customers manage their technology. The company&#8217;s services
business now includes PwC, the technology consulting business
IBM acquired in 2002 for $3.9 billion. Rometty made her name
integrating PwC&#8217;s fractious consultants into the IBM fold. Today
that unit and its fellow services businesses employ more than
half IBM&#8217;s 427,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similarly difficult transformation has taken place in
hardware. IBM sold its PC business almost seven years ago. Palo
Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), by contrast, is just
now mulling its future in that increasingly low-margin business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on Services &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the company emphasizes services, where it logged
32&#160;percent gross margins last year. The company&#8217;s software
business, which accounts for 20 percent of revenue, had margins
of 88&#160;percent in the third quarter of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM in the past decade has become less hierarchical,
allowing tech ideas to rise up within the huge operation. The
company&#8217;s successful Smarter Planet initiative, intended to
introduce more intelligence into systems such as power grids, is
said to have originated in one of IBM&#8217;s &#8220;jams.&#8221; Those are the
company&#8217;s online brainstorming sessions, where all employees are
welcome. And even while based almost 3,000 miles from Silicon
Valley, IBM pumps out more patents than any other technology
company. It invested $6&#160;billion in research and development last
year. That&#8217;s 6&#160;percent of revenue, compared with $3 billion, or
2.4&#160;percent, at Hewlett-Packard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They encourage people to be experimenting,&#8221; says Rosabeth Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor who has written
about the company. &#8220;Their size could be a disadvantage if it
means bureaucracy, but it&#8217;s an advantage because they have lots
of people looking outside to see what&#8217;s the best and latest and
bringing it in to IBM.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December&#8217;s Brainstorm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every December top executives gather in the company&#8217;s oak-
paneled boardroom for the Global Technology Outlook. They debate
what ideas to chase, what projects to fund, and what companies
to consider buying. The areas IBM is focusing on now --
analytics, cloud computing, and emerging markets (from which it
expects to derive 30&#160;percent of revenue by 2015) -- are the
result of strategies mapped out years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has propped up its earnings per share by buying back
stock and reducing its number of outstanding shares. To trim
costs, it has moved tens of thousands of U.S. jobs to developing
countries, especially India. Eventually, however, Rometty will
have to find ways to reenergize the top line, something that
will likely push IBM outside its comfort zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such challenges are hallmarks of Rometty&#8217;s career at IBM;
she&#8217;s done everything from systems engineering to leading the
global sales force. Still, she says she knows it won&#8217;t be easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I learned to always take on things I&#8217;ve never done
before,&#8221; Rometty says. &#8220;Growth and comfort do not coexist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s El Segundo refinery
in California is conducting planned maintenance that may result
in flaring through tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery may flare gases until 10 a.m. local time
tomorrow, according to a South Coast Air Quality Management
District filing. The notice &#8220;relates to some planned work at
the facility,&#8221; Rod Spackman, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This scheduled work will not have any effect on our
ability to deliver products to our customers in this region,&#8221;
said Spackman, who is in El Segundo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 279,000-barrel-a-day plant, California&#8217;s largest oil
refinery by capacity, was scheduled to shut the fluid catalytic
cracking unit, used to make gasoline and other products, for
repairs this weekend, a person with direct knowledge of the work
said Oct 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Oct 28, 2011  4:19 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-28/chevron-says-net-income-rises-on-crude-oil-prices-refinery-sale.html"><headline>Chevron Profit More Than Doubles on Refinery Sale, Oil Price</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) reported its biggest
quarterly profit in three years, outperforming other major oil
companies, as rising crude prices and proceeds from the sale of
a refinery made up for a slump in production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income more than doubled to $7.83
billion, or $3.92 a share, from $3.77 billion, or $1.87, a year
earlier, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a
statement today. Excluding a gain from the sale of a Welsh
refinery, the per-share result was 22 cents more than the
average of 19 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron quit the European oil-refining market in August
when it sold the U.K. refinery and related assets to Valero
Energy Corp. (VLO), a transaction that accounted for $500 million of
third-quarter results. Production fell to the equivalent of 2.6
million barrels of oil a day, from 2.74 million for the same
period last year. Sales rose 30 percent to $64.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are benefiting from higher crude prices and
strategic asset sales,&#8221; Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire
Advisory  Research Inc., a Chicago-based risk-management
consultant to the energy industry. &#8220;I&#8217;d expect production to
bounce back in the near future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural-gas production was less than the 2.63
million barrels a day forecast by Paul Cheng, a New York-based
analyst at Barclays Plc. Two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico,
maintenance work at oil installations and less production from
some overseas joint ventures hurt output, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron posted the largest year-on-year third-quarter
profit increase among major international oil producers that
have announced results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc&#8217;s 100 percent gain was the second-
largest, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp., which reported a 41
percent increase, and Total SA, which boosted profit by 13
percent. PetroChina Co. said net income rose 7.8 percent, while
BP Plc and ConocoPhillips saw profit decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron is the strongest of the majors right now,&#8221; said
Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis
who rates the shares a &#8220;buy.&#8221; &#8220;Even with production coming in
a little lower than my expectations, they offset that with
pretty strong refining results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was paid an average of $103 for each barrel of
crude produced outside the U.S. during the quarter, up 47
percent from $70 a year earlier, the company said. International
oil prices soared as growing demand bumped up against supply
constraints in Libya. Chevron gets 74 percent of its crude
outside the U.S., according to an Aug. 4 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose less than 1 percent to close at $109.64 in New
York. The shares have gained 20 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from oil and gas sales climbed 74 percent to $6.2
billion, the company said. Refining profits more than tripled to
$1.99 billion from $565 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proceeds from the sale of the Pembroke refinery in
Wales accounted for 22 cents a share in profit, Youngberg said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd.,
an Australian hedge fund, filed a new lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over the sale of securities known as Timberwolf
and Point Pleasant after a similar complaint was dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, accuses
New York-based Goldman Sachs of &#8220;knowingly making materially
false and misleading statements and omissions&#8221; in connection
with the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within weeks after BYAFM entered into these transactions,
they precipitously declined in value, as defendants knew and
intended they would,&#8221; Basis Capital said in the complaint. &#8220;As
a result, BYAFM lost more than $67 million plus consequential
damages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital over the securities
was dismissed this year by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan, who ruled the Australian fund couldn&#8217;t use U.S.
securities laws to pursue its claims against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones&#8217;s ruling followed a decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court last year in Morrison v. National Australia Bank. In that
decision, the high court said U.S. securities laws don&#8217;t apply
to the claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S. securities on
foreign exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Misled &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, said the U.S. bank acted appropriately and Basis Capital
wasn&#8217;t misled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Basis and Goldman Sachs relied on the same data on the
underlying mortgages and both were well aware of the prevailing
global market conditions,&#8221; Naylor said in a phone interview
today. &#8220;Goldman Sachs was also an investor in Timberwolf
securities and lost several hundred million dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit filed yesterday relates to Point Pleasant, a
collateralized debt obligation based on subprime residential
home mortgages, and two credit default swaps that referenced
securities from a similar CDO known as Timberwolf, Basis Capital
said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis accuses Goldman Sachs of marketing new CDO
investments in early 2007, after the company had already
determined that the value of securities in that market &#8220;would
likely go into sharp decline in the near future,&#8221; and used the
new CDOs as a vehicle to short the market, the lawsuit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Capital said Goldman was formalizing its Timberwolf
deal with the fund during the same week that a Goldman Sachs
executive sent an e-mail describing the Timberwolf investment as
&#8220;one shi--y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Key Part&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Point Pleasant and Timberwolf offerings were a key
part of this Goldman strategy, and provided a vehicle for
Goldman to unload its toxic inventory and to profit from the
decline in value of the very securities it was recommending that
its clients purchase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Capital is seeking to recover the $67 million and
$1 billion in punitive damages, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master), 652996/2011,
New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, added M. Michele Burns as an
independent director, expanding its board to 12 members and
adding a third woman to the board for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burns, 53, was chairman and chief executive officer of
Mercer, a unit of Marsh  McLennan Cos., until earlier this
month, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a statement today.
She was recently named to plan and design a new retirement
policy center for Marsh  McLennan, Goldman Sachs said. Her
election was effective yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, has been seeking
new directors since H. Lee Scott, the former Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) CEO, left Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board earlier this year and Brown
University President Ruth Simmons stepped off the board in May
2010. Goldman Sachs, which reported its second quarterly loss in
12 years as a public company this month, named Barnard College
President Debora L. Spar to the board in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burns and Spar join Lois D. Juliber, the former Colgate-
Palmolive Co. vice chairman who has served on the Goldman Sachs
board since March 2004, in making women represent one quarter of
the board&#8217;s members. Rival banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. each have two female
directors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basis Capital, an Australian hedge
fund, said one of its funds filed a new lawsuit in state court
in New York against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over the sale of
securities known as Timberwolf and Point Pleasant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing couldn&#8217;t immediately be confirmed from court
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha
Fund in federal court in Manhattan was dismissed earlier this
year. U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones ruled the Australian
fund couldn&#8217;t use U.S. securities laws to pursue its claims
against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier complaint says the fund was forced into
insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities created by
Goldman Sachs, in what one Goldman Sachs executive described
internally as a &#8220;shi--y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain committed to holding Goldman to account,&#8221;
Basis Capital director Stuart Fowler said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, said the U.S. bank acted appropriately and Basis Capital
wasn&#8217;t misled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Basis and Goldman Sachs relied on the same data on the
underlying mortgages and both were well aware of the prevailing
global market conditions,&#8221; Naylor said by phone yesterday.
&#8220;Goldman Sachs was also an investor in Timberwolf securities
and lost several hundred million dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s $285 Million SEC Settlement Questioned by Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s $285 million settlement with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission was questioned by a federal
judge who asked both sides to justify the accord as fair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who in 2009 rejected a $33
million settlement between the SEC and Bank of America Corp. (BAC),
set a hearing on the matter for Nov. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank, agreed this month
to pay the money to resolve SEC claim that the New York-based
company misled investors in a $1 billion collateralized debt
obligation linked to risky mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why should the court impose a judgment in a case in which
the SEC alleges a serious securities fraud but the defendant
neither admits nor denies wrongdoing?&#8221; Rakoff wrote in the
first of nine questions he ordered the parties to address in the
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, declined
to comment on Rakoff&#8217;s order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2009, Rakoff rejected Bank of America&#8217;s
settlement with the SEC over claims it misled investors about
Merrill Lynch  Co. bonuses, saying the deal suggested &#8220;a
rather cynical relationship between the parties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his five-page order yesterday, Rakoff told the parties
to address whether the public has an interest in determining if
the SEC claims against Citigroup are true and how the amount of
loss to victims and the proposed judgment against the bank were
calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Citigroup settlement, announced Oct. 19, both sides
agreed to resolve claims that Citigroup structured and sold the
collateralized debt obligations in 2007 without telling
investors it was betting the underlying assets, about half of
which it had helped select, would decline in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 11-cv-7387, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Family May Keep $82 Million Under Ruling Limitation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s family would keep about $82 million of
&#8220;other investors&#8217; money&#8221; under a ruling that limited a
bankruptcy trustee to claiming from the owners of the New York
Mets only two years of withdrawals from the Ponzi scheme,
according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confidence man&#8217;s family took out $141 million in the
six years before Madoff&#8217;s firm went bankrupt in 2008, of which
less than $59 million was taken in the two years before the
bankruptcy, trustee Irving Picard said in a filing. Many other
investors are trying to hang onto &#8220;stolen&#8221; money that belongs
to customers who took losses in the fraud, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But the trustee is a fiduciary of all customers and, as
such, must make every effort to obtain redress for all the
customers of BLMIS who fell victim to Madoff&#8217;s fraud,&#8221; he said
in the filing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan yesterday,
referring to the Madoff firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard wrote about the Madoff family in court papers filed
after U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff told him to explain why
another investor, James Greiff, shouldn&#8217;t keep money he says he
took &#8220;in good faith&#8221; from the Ponzi scheme. Rakoff&#8217;s Madoff
caseload includes Picard&#8217;s suits against the Mets owners and
Greiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These arguments implicate the questions about how to
integrate the securities and bankruptcy laws,&#8221; Rakoff wrote in
an order. Under securities law, some withdrawals from a
brokerage firm may be protected from clawbacks, he has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hiding behind the veil of &#8216;innocent investor,&#8217; Greiff
aims to keep money he now knows was stolen from other
customers,&#8221; Picard told Rakoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a public disgrace,&#8221; Helen Chaitman, a lawyer for
Greiff, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Picard owes a fiduciary duty to Mr.
Greiff under the Securities Investor Protection Act. Yet, he
attacks an innocent victim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Greiff, 11-cv-03775, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Must Give BP Data or Lose Spill Claims, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana must quickly turn over all documents BP Plc (BP/) has
requested or face stiff fines and possible dismissal of the
state&#8217;s claims for environmental and economic losses from the
2010 oil spill, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Louisiana fails to meet strict new deadlines, the
earliest of which is Nov. 3, the state will be fined $2,500 a
day, U.S. Magistrate Sally Shushan said in an order yesterday in
New Orleans federal court. That fine rises to $5,000 a day after
seven days and to $10,000 a day after 14 days, if Louisiana
continues to delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the end of 21 days of non-compliance, the court will
consider, either on its own motion or the motion of any party,
whether the claims of Louisiana in this MDL shall be dismissed
in whole or in part for failure to prosecute,&#8221; Shushan said in
a five-page order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shushan is assisting U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of
New Orleans, who presides over more than 350 spill-related
lawsuits that have been consolidated into a multidistrict
litigation proceeding for pretrial processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana must produce documents related to the first phase
of the spill trial, to determine liability and which companies
must pay for damages suffered by thousands of coastal businesses
and property owners from the spill. On Oct. 12, after the judge
had granted Louisiana one extension to the document production
deadline, the state&#8217;s lawyers told Shushan they would need 14 to
16 more weeks to complete that task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the court appreciates that Louisiana is required to
expend public funds to produce the documents, it is necessary
that its document production be completed so that this MDL
proceeding may progress as scheduled,&#8221; Shushan said. BP must be
given the state&#8217;s documents with enough time to be &#8220;adequately
prepared&#8221; for depositions scheduled to begin Nov. 14, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Larkins, spokeswoman for Louisiana Attorney General
James &#8220;Buddy&#8221; Caldwell, declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Says Bankruptcy Judge Must Keep JPMorgan Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said a bankruptcy judge must
handle its $8.6 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
because the case involves &#8220;classic&#8221; bankruptcy claims and
related common-law claims that don&#8217;t require a higher-court
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman sued New York-based JPMorgan last year, saying the
bank extracted assets that fatally weakened the firm before its
2008 collapse. JPMorgan said it took the collateral under a
federal law enacted to safeguard banks lending to faltering
companies. It asked a district judge to decide the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exit from bankruptcy courts became common after a
Supreme Court ruling in the Anna Nicole Smith case described
limits to the powers of bankruptcy judges. JPMorgan, HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA), UniCredit SpA and hundreds of individuals have
asked district judges to handle suits brought by the liquidator
of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s effort to move the Lehman case is based on a
&#8220;mischaracterization&#8221; of the claims and the Supreme Court
ruling, the bankrupt firm said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s interpretation &#8220;is so overbroad as to require a
radical alteration of the division of labor between bankruptcy
courts and district courts,&#8221; it said yesterday in the filing in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, the largest
U.S. bank, declined to comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Court case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 11-cv-06760, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Workers Limit Gender Bias Suit to California Stores &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for women who originally sued Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)
for sex discrimination on behalf of 1 million co-workers
nationwide amended the lawsuit yesterday, limiting it to gender-
bias claims by California workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing comes four months after the U.S. Supreme Court
in June barred the case as a class action covering all U.S.
stores, saying the women failed to prove the world&#8217;s largest
retailer had a nationwide policy that led to gender
discrimination. The Supreme Court sent the suit back to federal
court in San Francisco, where it was first filed in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new filing alleges that Wal-Mart blocked women in
California from promotions and paid them less in management and
hourly positions than men doing comparable work. Lawyers for the
women said they amended the suit to respond to the Supreme
Court&#8217;s rejection of the nationwide class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the
action, but only ruled that the class as certified could not
proceed,&#8221; they said in yesterday&#8217;s filing. &#8220;It did not
preclude prosecution of a class that was consistent with its
newly announced guidelines and standards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amended lawsuit was filed by five current or former
company employees on behalf of all women working in California
Wal-Mart and Sam&#8217;s Club stores from December 1998 to the
present. At least 95,000 current and former female Wal-Mart
workers may be covered by the new complaint, said Brad Seligman,
an attorney for the employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new filing won&#8217;t answer the Supreme Court&#8217;s concerns,
said attorney Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who represents
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Supreme Court rejected these very same class action
theories when it reversed the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers&#8217; last effort
in June,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. &#8220;The plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers do
not come close to meeting the standards for obtaining class
certification and their arguments still rely on the same
incorrect and discredited theories that the Supreme Court
repudiated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California action is the first of &#8220;an armada of
cases&#8221; to be filed against Wal-Mart on behalf of female
employees in individual states or regions, said attorney Joseph
Sellers, who also represents the women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California lawsuit is Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
01-cv-02252, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). The Supreme Court case is Wal-Mart
v. Dukes, 10-00277, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage Registry MERS Sued by Delaware Attorney General &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merscorp Inc., the operator of a national mortgage registry
used by banks, was sued by Delaware&#8217;s attorney general for
allegedly using deceptive practices that hide information from
borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MERS database, which tracks ownership interests in
mortgages, impeded the ability of homeowners to fight
foreclosures and obscures its data, Delaware Attorney General
Beau Biden said in a complaint filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MERS engaged and continues to engage in a range of
deceptive trade practices that sow confusion among consumers,
investors and other stakeholders in the mortgage finance system,
damage the integrity of Delaware&#8217;s land records, and lead to
unlawful foreclosure practices,&#8221; Biden said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MERS tracks servicing rights and ownership interests in
mortgage loans on its electronic registry, allowing banks to buy
and sell loans without recording transfers with individual
counties. MERS acts as the lender&#8217;s nominee, remaining the
mortgagee of record as long as the note promising repayment is
owned by a MERS member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Merscorp, said the
allegations in the suit have no merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MERS&#8217;s business practices are transparent,&#8221; she said in
a phone interview. &#8220;There is no confusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Merscorp has cooperated in good faith with the Delaware
attorney general&#8217;s office and complied with their requests for
information under a subpoena issued earlier this year,&#8221; Smith
said. &#8220;The lawsuit they filed was unexpected, and we disagree
with the allegations made in their complaint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of Delaware v. MERSCORP Inc., CA6987,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Innospec Ex-CEOs Charged Over Alleged Bribes in Indonesia &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former chief executive officers of Innospec Ltd. were
charged with trying to bribe officials of the Indonesia
government to win contracts to supply the fuel additive
tetraethyl lead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Kerrison, 67, of Surrey, and Paul Jennings, 54, of
Cheshire, were charged yesterday with conspiracy to corrupt at a
London criminal court. Kerrison was CEO of the company under its
previous name, Octel Corp., according to the Serious Fraud
Office, which is prosecuting the case. The charges cover a six-
year period, from 2002 until 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings is also accused of conspiring to bribe Iraqi
government officials to secure contracts to supply products
including tetraethyl lead, and for the officials to give poor
reviews to a competing product manufactured by the Ethyl Corp.
subsidiary of Richmond, Virginia-based NewMarket Corp. (NEU) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerrison, who worked for Innospec until early 2005, has
been cooperating with the SFO, he said in a statement sent by
his spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a matter of great regret that they have not
listened to the substantial points made by him,&#8221; spokesman Andy
Wigmore said in the e-mailed statement. &#8220;He will be vigorously
defending the allegation that he directed, managed or was
involved in bribery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings&#8217;s lawyer, Angus McBride, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a request for comment. Both men were released on bail
and are scheduled to appear at a higher criminal court on Jan.

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Trustee Sues Somers Dublin Seeking $86.4 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s defunct firm sued
Somers Dublin Ltd., an Irish affiliate of HSBC Holdings Plc,
seeking $86.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard said he aims to recover &#8220;customer
property&#8221; from companies that invested with Fairfield Sentry
Ltd., a so-called feeder fund that placed money in Madoff&#8217;s
Ponzi scheme. Picard demanded the return of any funds received
from investments with Fairfield, according to the lawsuit filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Securities Services (Ireland) Ltd. owns Somers Dublin,
which has offices in Dublin, according to the complaint. HSBC
Holdings, based in London, is Europe&#8217;s biggest bank. Somers
Nominees (Far East) Ltd., a Bermudan company, was also named in
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somers Dublin officials couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for
comment on the lawsuit after business hours in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfield is in liquidation in the British Virgin Islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Somers Dublin Ltd., 11-02784, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chelsea Owner Abramovich to Take Stand in Billionaire Battle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football
Club, had to watch from the other side of the courtroom as his
former business partner Boris Berezovsky called him a
&#8220;gangster&#8221; who wasn&#8217;t smart enough to succeed on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next stage of a London trial pitting two of the
world&#8217;s richest men against each other, Abramovich will take the
witness stand to defend himself. His testimony is scheduled to
begin Nov. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exiled Russian businessman Berezovsky said he was
intimidated by Abramovich into selling his stakes in state-owned
companies for less than they were worth. He is seeking $6.8
billion in damages, including interest, in the trial that began
earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky, who built Russia&#8217;s largest car dealership
LogoVaz in the 1990s, was cross-examined for seven days, more
than 30 hours of court time, before stepping down from the
witness box Oct. 17. In tense exchanges with Abramovich&#8217;s lawyer
Jonathan Sumption, he was accused of money laundering and lying
to support his case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You are prepared to say anything in a document put before
the English courts, whatever you think suits your case, whether
it is true or not,&#8221; said Sumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abramovich, who is 53rd on Forbes&#8217; list of the world&#8217;s
richest people and rarely speaks in public, will probably have
to spend at least as long as Berezovsky did on the stand, Max
Hastings, a member of Berezovsky&#8217;s legal team, said in a phone
interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karyl Nairn, a lawyer representing Abramovich, didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men present contrasting versions of the events
which turned them from friends and allies into enemies.
Berezovsky claims Abramovich told him the Russian state would
seize his shares in OAO Sibneft and United Co. Rusal unless he
sold them in 2001 and 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abramovich said Berezovsky&#8217;s role was as a political power
broker and that he had no actual stake in either company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Wins Approval of $13.5 Million Investor Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, won court
approval of a $13.5 million settlement of shareholder claims
over the sale of its former Student Loan Corp. (STU) unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord, which provided an extra $2.50 a share to
Student Loan investors, was &#8220;an excellent result,&#8221; Delaware
Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster said before approving the
settlement yesterday at a hearing in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors sued Student Loan in September 2010, alleging
they were getting shortchanged in the $600 million sale to
Discover Financial Services. (DFS) Laster declined to block the deal
last year, saying shareholders could seek damages later in a
trial. The Student Loan unit was one of at least 21 Citigroup
businesses put up for sale by Chief Executive Officer Vikram
Pandit following the bank&#8217;s $45 billion bailout in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup is &#8220;pleased the settlement has received the
court&#8217;s approval,&#8221; Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based bank, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student Loan, based in Stamford, Connecticut, agreed to the
$30-a-share bid by Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover in
September 2010. The offer was 40 percent more than the trading
price of the Citigroup unit&#8217;s shares at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeover made Discover the third-largest U.S. provider
of private student loans, behind SLM Corp. (SLM) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
The sale to Discover also involved the acquisition of some loan
portfolios by Citigroup and SLM, Laster said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student Loan investors argued that directors didn&#8217;t shop
around enough for the best price for the Citigroup unit and
failed to make proper disclosures about the deal. Student Loan
executives later disclosed more information about the fees paid
to bankers advising them on the deal, Laster said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Primary Global Executive Fleishman Seeks New U.S. Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Primary Global Research LLC executive James
Fleishman, convicted of two counts of conspiracy in September as
part of a U.S. crackdown on insider trading, is asking for the
charges to be dismissed or for a new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman was convicted Sept. 20 by a federal jury in
Manhattan of helping pass confidential information to fund
managers as part of an insider-trading scheme. Prosecutors said
Fleishman obtained and passed confidential data from technology
company employees who were moonlighting as consultants for
Mountain View, California-based Primary Global. The secret tips
were given to fund managers who paid Primary Global fees for
consultation calls, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman&#8217;s lawyer, Ethan Balogh, said in court papers
filed Oct. 26 that prosecutors failed to establish that any acts
to further the conspiracy occurred in New York. Balogh also
argued that Fleishman was improperly told that the only way he
would be allowed to testify in his own defense was if he turned
over to prosecutors diaries during a four-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimony about a June 2009 meeting in Manhattan between
Fleishman and Karl Motey, an independent consultant who was
cooperating with the government and wearing a body wire, failed
to establish that Fleishman committed any wrongdoing during that
meeting, Balogh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government failed to present sufficient evidence of
venue in the Southern District of New York,&#8221; Balogh said in
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan
couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-cr-32, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Property prices in China&#8217;s major
cities may decline 15 percent to 20 percent during the next 12
months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analyst Wang Yi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the declines will be in the first half of next
year, with Chinese property prices not recovering until the
second half of 2013, Wang said. Chinese property inventories may
rise to a 17-month high by the end of the first half of next
year, Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government won&#8217;t relax its policies to control land
prices in the next three to six months, Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s inflation has been
&#8220;basically controlled,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) economist
Song Yu said at a briefing in Beijing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reduction of reserve requirements for banks or of
interest rates is unlikely, Song said. Property tightening will
be maintained and the yuan&#8217;s appreciation will slow, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s economy may grow 8.6 percent next year with
inflation of 3.1 percent, Song said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is winning
higher ratings from analysts than Apple Inc. (AAPL), the iPad maker
that doubled since its low last year, after the European debt
crisis battered the U.S. bank&#8217;s shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies are among 15 in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
1500 Composite where &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendations made up 85 percent
of analyst ratings and there were no &#8220;sells,&#8221; data compiled by
Bloomberg Rankings as of Oct. 24 show. Stocks with fewer than 15
analysts covering them were excluded. For JPMorgan, the total
was 89.5 percent, compared with 87.5 percent at Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares are lagging behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index by 15 percentage points this year after investors sold
banks amid concern the European crisis would prompt losses.
Following its decline, no other financial institution in the
U.S. has more support from analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be beaten up,&#8221; Jeff Harte, a Chicago-based
financial analyst at Sandler O&#8217;Neill  Partners LP, said in a
telephone interview on Oct. 26. During the last financial crisis
in 2008, JPMorgan &#8220;capitalized on others&#8217; weakness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, topped Bank of America Corp.
as the biggest U.S. lender by assets as of Sept. 30 and posted
more trading revenue than any other Wall Street firm for the
fourth straight quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was profitable every quarter during 2007 and
2008 as the collapse of the subprime mortgage market prompted
$2.1 trillion in writedowns and losses at banks, brokerages and
other financial firms worldwide. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon bought Bear Stearns Cos. and the banking unit of
Washington Mutual Inc. amid the turmoil three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has retreated 13 percent since Dec. 31, while the
SP 500 posted a gain of 2.1 percent, turning positive for the
year yesterday for the first time since Aug. 3. The stock, which
had 34 &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings and four &#8220;holds&#8221; as of Oct. 24, is
beating its peers. The diversified financials group in the SP
500 has slumped 20 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan tends to be run more conservatively, which is
probably why it&#8217;s liked by its analysts,&#8221; Craig Hodges,
president of Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management Inc., who
oversees about $700 million, said in an Oct. 26 phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides JPMorgan and Apple, the 15 companies include Google
Inc. (GOOG) and Halliburton Co. (HAL), according to Bloomberg data. The most-
favored stocks in the SP 500 beat the entire index since the
last bear market ended 2 1/2 years ago, the data show. They
returned 144 percent on average since March 9, 2009, versus 90
percent for the SP 500. Since the index peaked this year in
April, the 15 stocks have lagged behind, falling 3 percentage
points more than the measure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob Gillette, who resigned as chief
executive officer of First Solar Inc. (FSLR) this week after boosting
production capacity during a slump, collected $29.9 million for
his initial 15 months on the job and may be eligible for an $8.9
million severance package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest maker of thin-film solar panels
rewarded Gillette while its shares dropped 60 percent from the
day he started in October 2009 through Oct. 24, the day before
he stepped down. Gillette&#8217;s compensation is at least 19 percent
more than what Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson earned over the
same period, when the U.S. energy company&#8217;s shares gained 54
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gillette&#8217;s pay, described in regulatory filings for 2009
and 2010, also included a $5 million signing bonus to lure him
from Honeywell International Inc. (HON) First Solar received $3.07
billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. government to support
projects using its technology, which is a rival to silicon-based
solar cells made by Chinese companies led by Suntech Power
Holdings Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gillette&#8217;s compensation was unusually front-loaded, so
when it came time to throw him out he had them on the hook for a
lot of money,&#8221; Graef Crystal, a compensation expert and
Bloomberg News consultant based in Las Vegas, said in an
interview. &#8220;This wasn&#8217;t pay for performance, it was pay for
future performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) sold its stake in 10 Virginia buildings to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), according to a statement. The price wasn&#8217;t
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday Properties remains an owner and the operator of the
3 million square feet of building space in Rosslyn, Virginia,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashish Gupta, a senior vice president of Lehman&#8217;s real
estate group, said in the statement that the company made a
&#8220;strategic capital infusion&#8221; in the portfolio last year. That
investment &#8220;vastly improved the liquidity of our ownership
interest, and ultimately delivered a sizeable return to our
creditors,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008 with
$613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;

U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Berkowitz, suffering from
redemptions after loading the Fairholme Fund with financial
stocks, sold his stakes in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) while keeping Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairholme held no Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley shares as
of Aug. 31, according to a Form N-Q filed Oct. 28 with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Miami-based mutual fund
held 6.26 million Goldman Sachs shares and 34.8 million Morgan
Stanley shares with a combined market value of $1.72 billion as
of May 31, equaling almost 11 percent of net assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkowitz, whose fund fell 21 percent this year through
last week, raised his Bank of America stake to 81.9 million
shares as of Aug. 31 from 77.3 million as of May 31. He pared
his Citigroup stake almost 2 percent to 20.8 million shares. The
stocks have fallen about 48 percent and 33 percent in 2011,
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Selling the investment banks and keeping the commercial
banks is probably a statement of where they believe the bigger
upside is going to be,&#8221; said Bruce Siegel, an executive vice
president at First Long Island Investors LLC, a Jericho, New
York, firm that invests with Fairholme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkowitz, named domestic stock fund manager of the decade
in 2010 by Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. (MORN), has been betting
heavily on financial stocks since that year began, buying shares
in American International Group Inc. (AIG) and Regions Financial Corp. (RF)
as well as Goldman, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. The stocks
have been dragged down by investor concern over the debt crisis
in Europe and a potential relapse into recession in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$4.7 Billion Redeemed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairholme is lagging behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
in 2011 after beating the U.S. benchmark in the previous seven
years. The SP 500 returned 3.9 percent through last week,
including reinvested dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the quarter ended Aug. 31, the fund&#8217;s net assets
shrank to $10.9 billion from $15.9 billion. Investors pulled a
net $4.7 billion from Fairholme&#8217;s flagship fund through the end
of September, forcing Berkowitz to raise cash by selling stocks
he would otherwise have hung onto, said Kevin McDevitt, a
Morningstar analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he would have sold these under normal
conditions,&#8221; McDevitt said in a telephone interview, referring
to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The Fairholme Fund (FAIRX) kept
Bank of America because &#8220;BofA is a high-conviction position for
Berkowitz.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkowitz, 53, didn&#8217;t immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment. The price of financial stocks such as Bank of
America and Goldman Sachs already reflected poor results,
providing a &#8220;huge margin of safety&#8221; for investors, he said in
a June interview with Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), owner of the ABC

its older TV shows to Amazon&#8217;s Prime streaming video service,
the world&#8217;s biggest Internet retailer said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will license more than 800 episodes of such shows
as ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Lost&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; and &#8220;Phineas and
Ferb&#8221; from its Disney Channel. The titles will be available
for the holidays, Amazon&#8217;s director of video content
acquisition, said in the statement. The service will have
almost 13,000 episodes by early next year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly licensed Disney content will be available on
more than 300 devices, including Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire, the
company said. The movies are only available to consumers who
pay $79 a year for Amazon&#8217;s Prime delivery service. Amazon
didn&#8217;t give terms for the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also extended its agreement with Netflix to add
older movies and TV shows for that service as well, according

will be made available to Netflix 30 days after the final
episode of each season airs, according to that statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, plans to hire staff and be &#8220;physically
present&#8221; in West and central Africa&#8217;s French-speaking nations,
regional General Manager Simon Ouattara said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the Redmond, Washington-based company has
placed employees in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Guinea, Benin and
Republic of Congo and plans to be present in all 17 Francophone
nations in the region, as well as Cape Verde and Sierra Leone,
Ouattara said in an interview in Abidjan, Ivory Coast&#8217;s
commercial capital, yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants to &#8220;support our partners better by placing
the managers closer to them,&#8221; Victoria N&#8217;dee Uwadoka, marketing
manager for the region, wrote in an e-mailed response to
questions. &#8220;Our interest is basically to increase the business
opportunities for Microsoft and also for our partners,&#8221; she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouattara said Microsoft wants to take advantage of
investments other companies are making in the West African
nation, which is seeking to lure investment and boost growth
following a violent post-election crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a mass of initiatives and projects in the
country at the moment, and a lot of companies are equipping
themselves again in software,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivory Coast&#8217;s economy may contract 5.8 percent this year
after the crisis that was sparked by ex-leader Laurent Gbagbo&#8217;s
refusal to cede power to Alassane Ouattara after a November
election. Businesses shut their doors, banks closed their
branches and cocoa exports were largely halted in the world&#8217;s
biggest producer of the chocolate ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, Gbagbo was captured in Abidjan and a month later,
Ouattara sworn in as leader. The economy may expand 8.5 percent
next year as cocoa exports and gold mining increases along with
spending on electricity and roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft currently has offices in Senegal and Cameroon and
staff in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said the company&#8217;s
Ouattara, who is not related to the president. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s purchases of
Treasury securities in Brazil, where benchmark yields averaged
almost 12 percent this month, helped push the bank&#8217;s holdings in
South America&#8217;s biggest economy 40 percent higher in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assets at JPMorgan&#8217;s Brazilian unit jumped to 22.5 billion
reais ($12.6 billion) as of Aug. 31 from 16.2 billion on June
30, Claudio Berquo, chief executive officer of the business,
said in an interview in Sao Paulo. About 4 percent is company
loans and most of the rest is Treasury securities, according to
the unit&#8217;s chief financial officer, Cristiano Almeida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy of keeping its benchmark
interest rate near zero percent in the U.S. is pushing
investments offshore, said Richard Bove, a bank analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC. Brazil&#8217;s real-denominated bonds
returned 14 percent in the past year, compared with the 7
percent average return in local currency terms on JPMorgan&#8217;s
government bond index for emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are having a wonderful year in Brazil, better than
planned,&#8221; Berquo, 50, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond purchases by the New York-based bank contributed to a
46 percent jump in earnings from Brazil in the first eight
months of 2011, to 94.5 million reais, even after the bank
boosted expenses to continue investing in the country, according
to Almeida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. have also
targeted Brazil for a bigger share of their investments. New
York-based Goldman Sachs said earlier this year that Brazil was
one of three countries, along with China and India, where most
of its hiring efforts have been concentrated. Citigroup, also
based in New York, added more than 340 employees in Brazil in
the month of March alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. banks have got to find growth somewhere, and they&#8217;re
not going to find it in the United States if the economy is
going to lope along at the current level,&#8221; said Bove, whose
company is based in Lutz, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans to Brazilian companies represent a small percentage
of JPMorgan&#8217;s assets in the country because the bank has only
just started offering credit denominated in reais, Berquo said.
Dollar loans remain the majority of JPMorgan&#8217;s lending to
companies in the country, and those assets, which Berquo
declined to quantify, are booked in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian unit had 952.9 million reais of loans
outstanding as of Sept. 11, about twice as much as the level in
December 2009, he said, adding that the bank&#8217;s goal is to lend
to the top 300 Brazilian firms with annual revenue above 1
billion reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room to Grow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are already doing business with half of these
companies, but we still have a lot of room to grow,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will crimp the amount of credit
international banks are willing to lend Brazilian companies and
banks, Berquo said. &#8220;A lot of banks will cut credit to
Brazilian clients and the spreads are going to go up,&#8221; and that
trend may be an opportunity for JPMorgan to gain market share,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of that effort, JPMorgan moved about 923 million
reais in capital into Brazil in September, and &#8220;we will bring
in as much as needed,&#8221; Berquo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the 23rd largest bank by capital in Brazil as
of June 30, with 1.7 billion reais, according to central bank
figures. Itau Unibanco Holding SA, the biggest, had 67.2 billion
reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and Gas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to finance the biggest oil and gas projects, the
infrastructure projects, we want to be a big credit bank in
Brazil,&#8221; Berquo said, adding that trade finance and export-
prepayment loans are also being targeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But we are also planning to start participating in the
local bond markets, which are open right now and more attractive
than international markets,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired Ricardo Leoni from Santander to head fixed
income in Brazil, and plans to bring on more people after the
end of the bonus season in February, Berquo said. JPMorgan has
more than doubled its headcount, to 750 employees from 339,
since Berquo came back from New York to head the Brazilian
operation at the end of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is also expanding in asset-management for larger
companies and institutional investors and has 40 people devoted
to the business so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan bought Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the
wealth-management company founded by former Brazilian central
bank Governor Arminio Fraga, for an undisclosed amount. The bank
also has a private-equity arm, One Equity Partners, to invest
JPMorgan&#8217;s own money. That business in Brazil is run by Veronica
Serra, the daughter of Jose Serra, who ran for the presidency
last year against Dilma Rousseff and lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will keep growing in the asset-management business, in
private and corporate banking,&#8221; Berquo said, adding that the
plan is to reach 1,000 employees by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) got 24
subpoenas from bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. as part of
a probe into derivatives claims against the defunct firm that
were as much as $22 billion, according to a person at Lehman who
declined to be named. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management LP was told to deliver
documents needed for the investigation to Lehman&#8217;s law firm,
Jones Day in New York, by Nov. 28 at 5 p.m., according to a
court filing. Other subpoenas mostly went to funds, including
the Goldman Sachs SMC Credit Opportunities 2008 Fund LP, the
Goldman Sachs Quantitative Commodities Master Fund LLC and the
Goldman Sachs Mortgage Credit Opportunities Offshore Fund LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which has set a Nov. 4 deadline for votes on a
$65 billion liquidation plan, is winnowing down claims against
it from as much as $1 trillion to about $370 billion. It said in
June that derivatives claims filed by 30 institutions including
Goldman Sachs might be cut to $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank AG,
Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Barclays Plc and Credit
Suisse Group AG filed derivatives claims ranging from at least
$900 million to almost $3 billion against Lehman&#8217;s special
financing unit, based on claim records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the subpoenas. Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman
spokeswoman, said she couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the probe
the company is conducting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman sold its stake in 10 Virginia buildings to Goldman
Sachs for an undisclosed price, the defunct firm said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008, listing assets of $639 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects number of index members in eighth paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of top-seller Lipitor to help cushion
tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic versions reach
the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor, which is Pfizer&#8217;s biggest product, loses U.S.
patent protection on Nov. 30. The New York-based company is
looking for ways to replace its $10.7 billion in annual revenue
as cheaper copies drive down prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace,&#8221; Read said today on a conference
call discussing third-quarter earnings. A nonprescription
version of Lipitor wouldn&#8217;t be available until at least 2013
because of the regulatory process to get it approved, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no definitive evidence we can do it,&#8221; Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of Lipitor&#8217;s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said
yesterday in a report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the
top spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Rapid&#8217; Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be &#8220;very rapid.&#8221; Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. &#8220;We believe it would be economically
important, but you have to look in the context of some of the
larger OTC brands,&#8221; he said. The company&#8217;s Advil and Centrum
nonprescription drugs generate $175 million to $250 million each
per quarter, Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said in the
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer increased 1.3 percent to $19.50 at 3:10 p.m. New
York time, while the other 29 companies in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average index fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divesting Units &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor&#8217;s
prescription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) for $16.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reported third-quarter earnings today that beat the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by 6 cents
a share, as increased sales overseas and favorable exchange
rates helped boost revenue. Profit excluding one-time items was
62 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income increased more than fourfold to $3.74 billion,
or 48 cents a share, from a year earlier when the company had
charges related to an acquisition and asbestos litigation,
Pfizer said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Linda Sandler, David McLaughlin and Tiffany Kary" date="Nov 01, 2011  2:31 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-01/jpmorgan-seeks-lien-on-all-mf-global-assets-to-cover-debt-and-credit-lines.html"><headline>JPMorgan Seeks Lien on All MF Global Assets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) seeks a lien on
all of MF Global Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s assets and may have a lien on
its operating account balance of $26.6 million, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global, which filed for bankruptcy with assets of $41
billion, has five operating accounts, all with JPMorgan. The
bank may have a lien on the entire balance because of so-called
setoff rights related to a credit line to MF Global where it
acts and agent and lender, the New York-based bank said in a
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan asserts, and the debtors admit, that &#8216;by virtue
of such setoff rights, such funds may be subject to liens in
favor of&#8217;&#8221; JPMorgan, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders move to protect themselves after a bankruptcy
filing. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, made the statement in
an objection filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today
to a cash management plan proposed by the company. Limits should
be placed on the company&#8217;s use of cash, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan holds less than $80 million of the MF Global&#8217;s
debt, said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank and acts as an agent to lenders for a $1.2 billion
credit line to MF Global Holdings and a $300 million credit line
to its broker-dealer unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect Collateral &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan seeks the on all of MF Global&#8217;s assets to protect
its collateral, including proceeds of potential lawsuits, as
well as reimbursement for its own legal fees in the bankruptcy,
it said in the filing. The bank also asked Bankruptcy Court
judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan to limit intercompany transfers
and order the company to deliver it a budget and full list of
its assets. MF Global has asked to have until Jan. 30 to report
a full list of its assets and debts. Glenn will hold a hearing
today beginning at 3 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although JPMorgan is hopeful the debtors will be able to
generate meaningful recoveries for creditors, no one, including
the debtors, can predict whether, when and to what extent this
may actually occur,&#8221; lawyers from Simpson, Thacher  Bartlett
LLP wrote, representing the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it won&#8217;t allow its collateral to backstop
payment of the administrative expenses for MF Global&#8217;s
bankruptcy.  MF Global asked for a carve-out for some of its
professionals of $4 million, which would apply if a
reorganization fails and there aren&#8217;t enough assets to pay for
the costs of liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Recovery Prediction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global&#8217;s request should be limited because the firm has
&#8220;no reliable basis for predicting the extent to which creditors
may expect to see a recovery here,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a filing
today in bankruptcy court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a real risk that every dollar of cash collateral
spent as the debtors propose will be potentially lost&#8221; if the
request is granted, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy
yesterday, after failing to find a buyer over the weekend. The
New York-based futures broker suffered a ratings downgrade and
loss of customers after revealing it had investments related to
$6.3 billion in European sovereign debt, leading to the filing.
Regulators are investigating hundreds of millions of dollars
that may be missing from its client accounts, two people have
told Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global drew almost all of a $1.2 billion credit line
that was amended last year to give it more liquidity, and its
broker-dealer unit has borrowed about $210 million of a $300
million secured credit line. JPMorgan Chase is the agent to
lenders who supplied credit for both loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF), 11-bk-
15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, separated responsibility for its capital markets
business into two groups, naming new heads for equity and debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy O&#8217;Brien and Jim Casey will become co-heads of global
debt capital markets, a team combining debt capital markets and
leveraged finance, investment-banking chief Jeff Urwin said in
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. The two previously ran
syndicated and leveraged finance in North America together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viswas Raghavan, formerly head of international capital
markets, will become global head of equity capital markets as
the bank combines its regional teams, according to the New York-
based lender. Raghavan will remain based in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clients in all regions are facing similar issues and
increasingly are seeking access to capital outside their home
markets,&#8221; Urwin said. &#8220;Investors want to broaden the
geographic reach of their investments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien and Casey are succeeding Therese Esperdy, who ran
global debt capital markets and is leaving to become co-head of
Asia Pacific investment banking with Todd Marin, who previously
ran the group alone, according to an Oct. 24 internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg. Esperdy and Marin will run JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank throughout Asia Pacific, except Japan, said the
memo from Urwin and Gaby Abdelnour, chairman and chief executive
officer for Asia Pacific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best-Paid Bank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the most profitable U.S. bank, was the world&#8217;s
best-paid investment bank in 2010 in the Bloomberg 20 ranking of
advisers, with total fees of $4.14 billion. The bank also led
the field in fees from bond and equity issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, JPMorgan ranks No. 1 among underwriters
in high-yield and high-grade debt and No. 2 behind Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in U.S. leveraged loans, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien took the lead in pulling together a $20 billion,
unsecured loan to Dallas-based ATT Inc. in March-- one of the
largest unsecured corporate loans ever. The financing package
helped the bank land the deal advising the telecommunications
company&#8217;s $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG&#8217;s wireless
unit, T-Mobile USA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest

use, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was testing a $3 fee in Georgia and northern
Wisconsin, according to the person, who asked for anonymity
because the bank&#8217;s decision hasn&#8217;t been made public yet. The New

that was being tested in Georgia, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

chosen as a top currency fundamentals analyst in an annual
survey by J-Money, a Japanese financial magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki, who moved up from third place last year, was
followed in the ranking by Osamu Takashima, chief currency
strategist at Citigroup Inc. (C) in Tokyo. Minori Uchida, a senior
analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., and Atsushi Kobayashi, head of foreign-exchange sales at BNP Paribas in
Tokyo, were tied for third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J-Money, previously known as the Japanese version of the
Euromoney magazine, based the ranking on an August survey of 797
institutional investors in the Tokyo foreign-exchange market.
The ranking was published in its Autumn 2011 edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top financial firms in terms of currency trading were
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, No. 1 for a sixth-straight year,

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), the U.S. coal
producer that paid C$5.3 billion ($5.2 billion) for Western Coal

quarter profit that was lower than analysts&#8217; estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income will be $120 million to $150 million, or $1.91
to $2.39 a share, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in
a statement today. That compares with the $2.64-a-share average
of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of hard-coking coal, which is used by steelmakers,
will be 2.1 million to 2.3 million tons in the quarter.
Production will be 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons, Walter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income fell 44 percent to $76.2 million,

&lt;p&gt;The following stocks were active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek AS (CCOLA) , the bottler of Coca-Cola

&lt;p&gt;Goldas Kuyumculuk Sanayi Ithalat  Ticaret AS (GOLDS TI), a
jewelry producer, gained 3.2 percent to 64 kurus, rising for the

surged 5.5 percent to 3.08 liras, its biggest increase since
Sept. 20. Vakifbank reported third-quarter earnings of 316.1
million liras, 41 percent higher than last year and exceeding
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) kept its rank as
the best-performing energy company, while PetroChina Co. beat
Total SA (FP) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) to become the first and only
Asian company in the top five, according to a list published by
energy pricing service Platts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Platts Top 250 Global Energy Company Rankings reflect a
firm&#8217;s financial performance in fiscal 2010 in asset worth,
revenue, profit and return on invested capital, the energy news
and pricing arm of McGraw Hill Cos. said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR), the energy explorer being acquired by
Vedanta Resources Plc (VED), was the fastest-growing Asian company on
the list, according to Platts. The firm was placed 120 in the
overall ranking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from PetroChina, China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. (600028),
known as Sinopec, was the only other Asian company to rank in
the global top 10, the pricing service said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s BP Plc (BP/), Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), the Brazilian
state-controlled oil company, and EON AG, Germany&#8217;s largest
utility, lost their places in the top 10. BP&#8217;s ranking fell to
118 from second, while EON went to 13th from sixth and Petrobras
slipped to 12th from fourth, according to Platts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) paid
bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. about $438 million for
the defunct firm&#8217;s stake in 10 Virginia buildings, according to
a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which has said it expects enough votes by Nov. 4
to back a $65 billion liquidation plan, has been buttressing its
real estate to prepare for more sales. Last year it said it
would spend as much as $262.5 million to pay mortgages on the 10
office buildings it owns with partners in Rosslyn, Virginia, a
suburb of Washington. Lehman&#8217;s share of the investment was
$206 million and its partners&#8217; share was $56.5 million, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s filing disclosing the price followed an Oct. 31
statement that New York-based Goldman Sachs was the buyer of
Lehman&#8217;s stake. Lehman, also based in New York, may receive
another $10 million for the properties and other sums through
2015, it said in the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ),

&lt;p&gt;Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou&#8217;s decision to hold a referendum on Europe&#8217;s rescue
package may hurt the euro if voters reject the plan, according
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This referendum is potentially a game changer for the
euro,&#8221; said John Normand, the global head of currency strategy
in London at JPMorgan. &#8220;If, through the referendum, the Greek
public rejects the EU-IMF package, it raises the risk of
disorderly debt restructuring. That would be extremely negative
for the euro.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papandreou will fly to France today to face European
leaders surprised by his decision to put the bailout plan to the
nation and call a confidence vote in parliament. His grip on
power weakened after a lawmaker from his socialist Pasok party
defected, leaving him with 152 deputies in the 300-seat chamber.
The government said the vote would be held &#8220;as soon as&#8221;
possible. The referendum question has not been officially
announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normand said if the question is whether Greece should
remain in the euro area, the referendum should be approved. A
question whether the public supports austerity measures may get
a no vote. JPMorgan suggests investors sell the euro against
the yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one knows exactly what question will be posed, but
there is a risk that a no vote to austerity measures will be
viewed by currency markets as a vote against the euro,&#8221; said
Normand in a phone interview. &#8220;If Greece were to default on
the debt it owes European governments, the likelihood of EMU
exit rises substantially.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan forecasts that the euro will weaken to 104 yen by
the end of this year and to 102 yen by the end of March, from
107 yen today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of Lipitor, its top-selling drug, to help
cushion tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic
versions reach the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor loses U.S. patent protection on Nov. 30. The New
York-based company is looking for ways to replace its $10.7
billion in annual revenue as cheaper copies drive down prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace,&#8221; Read said yesterday in a
conference call discussing third-quarter earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nonprescription version of Lipitor wouldn&#8217;t be available
until at least 2013 because of the regulatory process needed to
get it approved, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no definitive evidence we can do it,&#8221; Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of Lipitor&#8217;s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said in
an Oct. 31 report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the top
spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be &#8220;very rapid.&#8221; Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe it would be economically important, but you
have to look in the context of some of the larger OTC brands,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor&#8217;s
prescription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD Loses Bid for Immediate Halt to S3 Patent Case Against Apple &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) failed to persuade a U.S. judge
to halt a patent dispute S3 Graphics Co. has against Apple Inc. (AAPL)
at the U.S. International Trade Commission, according to a
filing with the trade agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD, a maker of chips for Apple computers, sued S3 last
month, claiming it owned the patents that S3 has asserted
against Apple. In an Oct. 28 filing with the ITC, S3 said the
federal judge denied a request for an immediate halt to the ITC
case. The commission is scheduled to release its final decision
on Nov. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil suit is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. v. S3
Graphics Co., 11-cv-965, U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Devices

&lt;p&gt;Piramal Healthcare Settles Patent Litigation With Baxter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piramal Critical Care Inc., a unit of India&#8217;s Piramal
Healthcare Ltd. (PIHC), settled patent litigation related to Baxter
Healthcare Corp.&#8217;s Suprane inhaled anesthetic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piramal didn&#8217;t disclose terms of the settlement in a
statement. Baxter filed the suit in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware, in 2009, accusing Minrad International Inc. of Orchard
Park, New York, of infringing patent 5,617,906. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baxter, based in Deerfield, Illinois, sued shortly after
Piramal said it would acquire Minrad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. Minrad Inc., 1:09-

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; Draws Competing Trademark Applications &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two competing applications have now been filed to register
&#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; as a trademark, according to the most
recent listings in database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group lists itself as &#8220;Occupy Wall Street,&#8221; and uses
a New York City address. According to its website, Occupy Wall
Street  is a &#8220;leaderless resistance movement with people of
many colors, genders and political persuasions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other applicant, Fer-Eng Investments LLC, lists an
address in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Vincent Ferraro of Fer-
Eng told Cable News Network that his company had no affiliation
with the movement and simply filed the application as a business
proposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both applications were filed Oct. 24. The California
applicant said the mark would be used mainly for clothing and
accessories such as T-shirts, backpacks and hats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York applicant seeks to register the mark for a
broader range of uses, including newsletters, periodicals, and
photo, audio, video and press &#8220;educational and entertaining
materials relating to Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement
in general.&#8221;  That application also seeks to register the mark
for clothing items such as t-shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application from the California company doesn&#8217;t list an
attorney. The New York application was submitted on Occupy Wall
Street&#8217;s behalf by Wylie Stecklow, a New York attorney who does
criminal defense, immigration and plaintiffs personal injury
work, according to his website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hello Dolly&#8217; Set Design Infringed, Copyright Holder Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holder of copyright to stage sets designed by the late
Oliver Smith sued a New Orleans costume and fabric shop for
copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, who died in 1994, was known for his innovative set
design for American Ballet Theater productions such as
&#8220;Rodeo,&#8221; &#8220;Fancy Free,&#8221; and &#8220;Swan Lake.&#8221; He also designed
the Broadway productions of &#8220;Hello Dolly,&#8221; &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;
and &#8220;Auntie Mame.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosaria Sinisi of Brooklyn, New York, is the inheritor of
the Smith copyrights, according to the complaint filed in
federal court in New Orleans. For a fee, she licenses the
copyrights for use in productions in the U.S, and abroad, she
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadway Bound Costumes Inc. of New Orleans bought a set
for a production of &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221; from a licensee, and used it
for a production of the musical at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux
Carre, in New Orleans&#8217; French Quarter in 2003 and has since
rented the set to productions in New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinisi claims that the New Orleans company never had the
right to use the design in any performance or to rent the set to
others using this design. She also accused Broadway Bound of
modifying the design without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the company&#8217;s actions, Sinisi said she&#8217;s
harmed and claims she will continue to sustain &#8220;substantial,
immediate and irreparable injury&#8221; without intervention by the
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked the court to bar further infringement of her
copyright, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinisi is represented by Jennifer Stierman Edwards and R.
Vaughn Cimini of Cimini  Associates of Metairie, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sinisi v. Broadway Bound Costumes Inc., 2:11-
cv-02625-ILRL-ALC, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Infringement Notices Under New Law Hit New Zealand ISPS &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first infringement notices have been received by
Internet service providers under New Zealand&#8217;s newest copyright
regime, the New Zealand Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, all notices were sent by the Recording Industry
Association of New Zealand, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the first batch of infringement notices were
related to unauthorized downloading of music by Rihanna, Lady
Gaga and the British musician Taio Cruz, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, teenage children of the Internet subscribers
did the unauthorized downloading, which meant that the
infringement notices are likely to be an unpleasant surprise to
recipients, the Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan Funeral Homes Become Music Copyright Enforcement Targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of growing efforts toward copyright enforcement,
nine infringement suits were filed against Taiwan funeral homes
in connection with the pre-recorded music they use at funerals,
the Voice of America reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funeral homes say they shouldn&#8217;t have to pay the $30
per service demanded by the music studios, according to VOA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music is based on Buddhist chants and not protected by
copyright, VOA reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five Taiwan music-collection management societies may
also begin demanding payment for live performances of music at
some funerals, according to VOA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manga Creator Says Copyright Change Will Damage His Industry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Akamatsu, creator of the &#8220;Negima&#8221; and &#8220;Love  Hina&#8221;
series of the Japanese comics known as &#8220;manga,&#8221; warned that
changes in Japan&#8217;s copyright law could destroy derivative self-
published works and diminish the entire Japanese comics
industry, AnimeNation reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is presently involved in regional trade-agreement
discussions involving nine other nations, aimed at making
copyright laws more uniform, according to AnimeNation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Japan joins the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement
under discussion, a formal complaint from the content owner
would no longer be required to trigger infringement prosecution,
AnimeNation reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamatsu, who operates the j-comi.jp website, posts, with
permission of the creators, derivative self-published works
alongside the originals, according to AnimeNation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuziveedu Seeds Pvt. picked five
banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and IDFC Capital Ltd.
to manage an initial share sale that may raise up to 8 billion
rupees ($162 million), said people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in the southern Indian state of Andhra
Pradesh, also selected Enam Securities Pvt., JM Financial Ltd.
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for the offering, which is expected to
take place in the first half of 2012, the people said. They
asked not to be named because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuziveedu is preparing a share sale after proceeds raised
in IPOs so far in 2011 tumbled to about a fifth of the level of
the same period last year, according to Bloomberg data. The
benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index has fallen 14 percent this
year amid a global rout in equities and expectations that
India&#8217;s economic growth will slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuziveedu Seeds Chairman M. Prabhakar Rao couldn&#8217;t be
reached at his office and didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-
mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, the world&#8217;s third-largest producer of cotton
seed, had revenue of more than 6 billion rupees last year,
according to its website. Nuziveedu is a unit of NSL Group,
which also owns businesses that produce sugar, textiles and

Street  is a &#8220;leaderless resistance movement with people of
many colors, genders and political persuasions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other applicant, Fer-Eng Investments LLC, lists an
address in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Vincent Ferraro of Fer-
Eng told Cable News Network that his company had no affiliation
with the movement and simply filed the application as a business
proposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both applications were filed Oct. 24. The California
applicant said the mark would be used mainly for clothing and
accessories such as T-shirts, backpacks and hats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York applicant seeks to register the mark for a
broader range of uses, including newsletters, periodicals, and
photo, audio, video and press &#8220;educational and entertaining
materials relating to Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement
in general.&#8221;  That application also seeks to register the mark
for clothing items such as t-shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application from the California company doesn&#8217;t list an
attorney. The New York application was submitted on Occupy Wall
Street&#8217;s behalf by Wylie Stecklow, a New York attorney who does
criminal defense, immigration and plaintiffs personal injury
work, according to his website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hello Dolly&#8217; Set Design Infringed, Copyright Holder Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holder of copyright to stage sets designed by the late
Oliver Smith sued a New Orleans costume and fabric shop for
copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, who died in 1994, was known for his innovative set
design for American Ballet Theater productions such as
&#8220;Rodeo,&#8221; &#8220;Fancy Free,&#8221; and &#8220;Swan Lake.&#8221; He also designed
the Broadway productions of &#8220;Hello Dolly,&#8221; &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;
and &#8220;Auntie Mame.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosaria Sinisi of Brooklyn, New York, is the inheritor of
the Smith copyrights, according to the complaint filed in
federal court in New Orleans. For a fee, she licenses the
copyrights for use in productions in the U.S, and abroad, she
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadway Bound Costumes Inc. of New Orleans bought a set
for a production of &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221; from a licensee, and used it
for a production of the musical at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux
Carre, in New Orleans&#8217; French Quarter in 2003 and has since
rented the set to productions in New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinisi claims that the New Orleans company never had the
right to use the design in any performance or to rent the set to
others using this design. She also accused Broadway Bound of
modifying the design without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the company&#8217;s actions, Sinisi said she&#8217;s
harmed and claims she will continue to sustain &#8220;substantial,
immediate and irreparable injury&#8221; without intervention by the
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked the court to bar further infringement of her
copyright, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinisi is represented by Jennifer Stierman Edwards and R.
Vaughn Cimini of Cimini  Associates of Metairie, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sinisi v. Broadway Bound Costumes Inc., 2:11-
cv-02625-ILRL-ALC, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Infringement Notices Under New Law Hit New Zealand ISPS &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first infringement notices have been received by
Internet service providers under New Zealand&#8217;s newest copyright
regime, the New Zealand Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, all notices were sent by the Recording Industry
Association of New Zealand, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the first batch of infringement notices were
related to unauthorized downloading of music by Rihanna, Lady
Gaga and the British musician Taio Cruz, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, teenage children of the Internet subscribers
did the unauthorized downloading, which meant that the
infringement notices are likely to be an unpleasant surprise to
recipients, the Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan Funeral Homes Become Music Copyright Enforcement Targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of growing efforts toward copyright enforcement,
nine infringement suits were filed against Taiwan funeral homes
in connection with the pre-recorded music they use at funerals,
the Voice of America reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funeral homes say they shouldn&#8217;t have to pay the $30
per service demanded by the music studios, according to VOA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music is based on Buddhist chants and not protected by
copyright, VOA reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five Taiwan music-collection management societies may
also begin demanding payment for live performances of music at
some funerals, according to VOA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manga Creator Says Copyright Change Will Damage His Industry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Akamatsu, creator of the &#8220;Negima&#8221; and &#8220;Love  Hina&#8221;
series of the Japanese comics known as &#8220;manga,&#8221; warned that
changes in Japan&#8217;s copyright law could destroy derivative self-
published works and diminish the entire Japanese comics
industry, AnimeNation reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is presently involved in regional trade-agreement
discussions involving nine other nations, aimed at making
copyright laws more uniform, according to AnimeNation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Japan joins the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement
under discussion, a formal complaint from the content owner
would no longer be required to trigger infringement prosecution,
AnimeNation reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamatsu, who operates the j-comi.jp website, posts, with
permission of the creators, derivative self-published works
alongside the originals, according to AnimeNation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Robert Langreth and Duane D. Stanford" date="Nov 02, 2011 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-02/fatty-foods-addictive-as-cocaine-in-growing-body-of-science.html"><headline>Fatty Foods Addictive as Cocaine in Growing Body of Science</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Cupcakes may be addictive, just like
cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of medical research at leading universities
and government laboratories suggests that processed foods and
sugary drinks made by the likes of PepsiCo Inc. and Kraft Foods
Inc. (KFT) aren&#8217;t simply unhealthy. They can hijack the brain in ways
that resemble addictions to cocaine, nicotine and other drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The data is so overwhelming the field has to accept it,&#8221;
said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse. &#8220;We are finding tremendous overlap between drugs in the
brain and food in the brain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that food may be addictive was barely on
scientists&#8217; radar a decade ago. Now the field is heating up. Lab
studies have found sugary drinks and fatty foods can produce
addictive behavior in animals. Brain scans of obese people and
compulsive eaters, meanwhile, reveal disturbances in brain
reward circuits similar to those experienced by drug abusers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight scientific studies and papers on food
addiction have been published this year, according to a National
Library of Medicine database. As the evidence expands, the
science of addiction could become a game changer for the $1
trillion food and beverage industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If fatty foods and snacks and drinks sweetened with sugar
and high fructose corn syrup are proven to be addictive, food
companies may face the most drawn-out consumer safety battle
since the anti-smoking movement took on the tobacco industry a
generation ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fun-for-You&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This could change the legal landscape,&#8221; said Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University&#8217;s Rudd Center for Food
Policy  Obesity and a proponent of anti-obesity regulation.
&#8220;People knew for a long time cigarettes were killing people,
but it was only later they learned about nicotine and the
intentional manipulation of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food company executives and lobbyists are quick to counter
that nothing has been proven, that nothing is wrong with what
PepsiCo Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi calls &#8220;fun-for-
you&#8221; foods, if eaten in moderation. In fact, the companies say
they&#8217;re making big strides toward offering consumers a wide
range of healthier snacking options. Nooyi, for one, is as well
known for calling attention to PepsiCo&#8217;s progress offering
healthier fare as she is for driving sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), PepsiCo, Northfield, Illinois-based Kraft
and Kellogg Co. of Battle Creek, Michigan, declined to grant
interviews with their scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one disputes that obesity is a fast growing global
problem. In the U.S., a third of adults and 17 percent of teens
and children are obese, and those numbers are increasing. Across
the globe, from Latin America, to Europe to Pacific Island
nations, obesity rates are also climbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost to Society &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to society is enormous. A 2009 study of 900,000
people, published in The Lancet, found that moderate obesity
reduces life expectancy by two to four years, while severe
obesity shortens life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Obesity
has been shown to boost the risk of heart disease, diabetes,
some cancers, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and stroke, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The costs of
treating illness associated with obesity were estimated at $147
billion in 2008, according to a 2009 study in Health Affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugars and fats, of course, have always been present in the
human diet and our bodies are programmed to crave them. What has
changed is modern processing that creates food with concentrated
levels of sugars, unhealthy fats and refined flour, without
redeeming levels of fiber or nutrients, obesity experts said.
Consumption of large quantities of those processed foods may be
changing the way the brain is wired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Lot Like Addiction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those changes look a lot like addiction to some experts.
Addiction &#8220;is a loaded term, but there are aspects of the
modern diet that can elicit behavior that resembles addiction,&#8221;
said David Ludwig, a Harvard researcher and director of the New
Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Children&#8217;s
Hospital Boston. Highly processed foods may cause rapid spikes
and declines in blood sugar, increasing cravings, his research
has found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education, diets and drugs to treat obesity have proven
largely ineffective and the new science of obesity may explain
why, proponents say. Constant stimulation with tasty, calorie-
laden foods may desensitize the brain&#8217;s circuitry, leading
people to consume greater quantities of junk food to maintain a
constant state of pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one 2010 study, scientists at Scripps Research Institute
in Jupiter, Florida, fed rats an array of fatty and sugary
products including Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) bacon, Sara Lee Corp. (SLE)
pound cake, The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE) cheesecake and Pillsbury
Co. Creamy Supreme cake frosting. The study measured activity in
regions of the brain involved in registering reward and pleasure
through electrodes implanted in the rats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binge-Eating Rats &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rats that had access to these foods for one hour a day
started binge eating, even when more nutritious food was
available all day long. Other groups of rats that had access to
the sweets and fatty foods for 18 to 23 hours per day became
obese, Paul Kenny, the Scripps scientist heading the study wrote
in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The results produced the
same brain pattern that occurs with escalating intake of
cocaine, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To see food do the same thing was mind-boggling,&#8221; Kenny
later said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are finding that damage to the brain&#8217;s reward
centers may occur when people eat excessive quantities of food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet Rewards &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one 2010 study conducted by researchers at the
University of Texas in Austin and the Oregon Research Institute,
a nonprofit group that studies human behavior, 26 overweight
young women were given magnetic resonance imaging scans as they
got sips of a milkshake made with Haagen-Dazs ice cream and
Hershey Co. (HSY)&#8217;s chocolate syrup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same women got repeat MRI scans six months later. Those
who had gained weight showed reduced activity in the striatum, a
region of the brain that registers reward, when they sipped
milkshakes the second time, according to the study results,
published last year in the Journal of Neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A career of overeating causes blunted reward receipt, and
this is exactly what you see with chronic drug abuse,&#8221; said
Eric Stice, a researcher at the Oregon Research Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying food addiction have had to overcome
skepticism, even from their peers. In the late 1990s, NIDA&#8217;s
Volkow, then a drug addiction researcher at Brookhaven National
Laboratory on Long Island, applied for a National Institutes of
Health grant to scan obese people to see whether their brain
reward centers were affected. Her grant proposal was turned
down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding Evidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get it funded,&#8221; she said in an interview.
&#8220;The response was, there is no evidence that food produces
addictive-like behaviors in the brain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volkow, working with Brookhaven researcher Gene-Jack Wang,
cobbled together funding from another government agency to
conduct a study using a brain scanning device capable of
measuring chemical activity inside the body using radioactive
tracers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to map dopamine receptor levels in
the brains of 10 obese volunteers. Dopamine is a chemical
produced in the brain that signals reward. Natural boosters of
dopamine include exercise and sexual activity, but drugs such as
cocaine and heroin also stimulate the chemical in large
quantities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In drug abusers, brain receptors that receive the dopamine
signal may become unresponsive with increased drug usage,
causing drug abusers to steadily increase their dosage in search
of the same high. The Brookhaven study found that the obese
people also had lowered levels of dopamine receptors compared
with a lean control group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addicted to Sugar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year, psychologists at Princeton University began
studying whether lab rats could become addicted to a 10 percent
solution of sugar water, about the same percentage of sugar
contained in most soft drinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An occasional drink caused no problems for the lab animals.
Yet the researchers found dramatic effects when the rats were
allowed to drink sugar-water every day. Over time they drank
&#8220;more and more and more&#8221; while eating less of their usual
diet, said Nicole Avena, who began the work as a graduate
student at Princeton and is now a neuroscientist at the
University of Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animals also showed withdrawal symptoms, including
anxiety, shakes and tremors, when the effect of the sugar was
blocked with a drug. The scientists, moreover, were able to
determine changes in the levels of dopamine in the brain,
similar to those seen in animals on addictive drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar Behavior &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We consistently found that the changes we were observing
in the rats binging on sugar were like what we would see if the
animals were addicted to drugs,&#8221; said Avena, who for years
worked closely with the late Princeton psychologist, Bartley
Hoebel, who died this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the animals didn&#8217;t become obese on sugar water alone,
they became overweight when Avena and her colleagues offered
them water sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 French experiment stunned researchers when it showed
that rats prefer water sweetened with saccharine or sugar to
hits of cocaine -- exactly the opposite of what existing dogma
would have suggested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a big surprise,&#8221; said Serge Ahmed, a
neuroscientist who led the research for the French National
Research Council at the University of Bordeaux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale&#8217;s Brownell helped organize one of the first
conferences on food addiction in 2007. Since then, a prot&#233;g&#233;,
Ashley Gearhardt, devised a 25-question survey to help
researchers spot people with eating habits that resemble
addictive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictures of Milkshakes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and her colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging to
examine brain activity of women scoring high on the survey.
Pictures of milkshakes lit up the same brain regions that become
hyperactive in alcoholics anticipating a drink, according to
results published in the Archives of General Psychiatry in
April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food addiction research may reinvigorate the search for
effective obesity drugs, said Mark Gold, who chairs the
psychiatry department at the University of Florida in
Gainesville. Gold said the treatments he is working on seek to
alter food preferences without suppressing overall appetite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing Treatments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are trying to develop treatments that interfere with
pathological food preferences,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s say you are
addicted to ice cream, you might come up with a treatment that
blocked your interest in ice cream, but doesn&#8217;t affect your
interest in meat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In related work, Shire Plc (SHP), a Dublin-based drugmaker, is
testing its Vyvanse hyperactivity drug in patients with binge-
eating problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is convinced. Swansea University psychologist
David Benton recently published a 16-page rebuttal to sugar
addiction studies. The paper, partly funded by the World Sugar
Research Organization, which includes Atlanta-based Coca-Cola,
the world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker, argues that food doesn&#8217;t
produce the same kind of intense dopamine release seen with
drugs and that blocking certain brain receptors doesn&#8217;t produce
withdrawal symptoms in binge-eaters as it does in drug abusers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry Response &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#8217;s still unknown is whether the science of food
addition has begun to change the thinking among food and
beverage companies, which are, after all, primarily in the
business of selling the Doritos, Twinkies and other fare people
crave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 80 percent of Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo&#8217;s
marketing budget, for instance, is directed toward pushing salty
snacks and sodas. Although companies are quick to point to their
healthier offerings, their top executives are constantly called
upon to reassure investors those sales of snack foods and sodas
are showing steady growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to see profit growth and revenue growth,&#8221; said
Tim Hoyle, director of research at Haverford Trust Co. in
Radnor, Pennsylvania, an investor in PepsiCo, the world&#8217;s
largest snack-food maker. &#8220;The health foods are good for
headlines but when it gets down to it, the growth drivers are
the comfort foods, the Tostitos and the Pepsi-Cola.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little wonder that the food industry is pushing hard on the
idea that the best way to get a handle on obesity is through
voluntary measures and by offering healthier choices. The same
tactic worked for awhile, decades ago, for the tobacco industry,
which deflected attention from the health risks and addictive
nature of cigarettes with &#8220;low tar and nicotine&#8221; marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food industry lobbyists don&#8217;t buy that argument -- or even
the idea that food addiction may exist. Said Richard Adamson, a
pharmacologist and consultant for the American Beverage
Association: &#8220;I have never heard of anyone robbing a bank to
get money to buy a candy bar or ice cream or pop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Thom Weidlich" date="Nov 02, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-02/visa-mastercard-seek-fee-suit-dismissal-over-payment-issue.html"><headline>Visa, MasterCard Seek Fee Suit Dismissal Over Payment Issue</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world&#8217;s biggest payment networks, will try to persuade a federal
judge to dismiss multibillion-dollar lawsuits accusing them of
price fixing because the merchants suing don&#8217;t directly pay the
fees at issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard will also argue before U.S. District
Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, today that the
behavior alleged is covered under an earlier settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will also try to convince the judge that they and
banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. and
Citigroup Inc. (C) can&#8217;t be accused of a conspiracy because the
payment-card operators are now public companies, which set the
fees themselves, rather than joint ventures of the banks. The
fees on credit cards, which average about 2 percent of the
purchase price, add up to $40 billion a year for retailers, not
including debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you consider the damages, when you consider the
banks are under significant regulatory scrutiny now and their
profitability has gone down, this is quite a substantial
litigation,&#8221; Matthew L. Cantor, a lawyer at Constantine
Cannon LLP in New York who has represented merchants and
payment-card issuer Discover Financial Services in antitrust
litigation, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants such as D&#8217;Agostino Supermarkets Inc. in
Larchmont, New York, and Collective Brands Inc.&#8217;s Payless
ShoeSource in Topeka, Kansas, accuse Visa, MasterCard and the
biggest U.S. banks of violating antitrust laws by illegally
inflating swipe fees, or interchange, charged to merchants on
payment-card purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Individual Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merchants estimate damages in the case &#8220;will range in
the tens of billions of dollars,&#8221; according to their complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a class action, individual suits before the
judge include those filed by Publix Super Markets Inc. (PUSH), the
Lakeland, Florida-based supermarket chain; Rite Aid Corp. (RAD), the
Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based drugstore chain; and Englewood,
Colorado-based Liberty Interactive Corp. (LINTA)&#8217;s QVC, the home-shopping channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard and the banks argued in court papers that
the cases have to be tossed because the merchants have no
standing to bring them: They don&#8217;t directly pay the interchange
fees -- the merchants&#8217; banks pay them to the cardholders&#8217; banks,
which in turn seek payment from the merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The undisputed evidence shows that plaintiffs do not pay
directly the interchange fees they assert were illegally set,&#8221;
the defendants wrote in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court decision that said
indirect buyers can&#8217;t claim they were injured by an antitrust
violation. Courts have refused to apply the 1977 case when the
direct purchaser is a co-conspirator, as the merchants&#8217; banks
are, the plaintiffs argue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Real Merits&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants are making what we think are not well-founded arguments, like the scope of the release and the
standing issue, that don&#8217;t address the real merits of the
case,&#8221; K. Craig Wildfang, a partner at Robins, Kaplan, Miller 
Ciresi LLP in Minneapolis and a lawyer for the merchants, said
in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits threaten a revenue source for banks that U.S.
lawmakers left untouched in passing the Dodd-Frank Act last
year. Congress opted to cap only debit-card interchange fees,
which typically had cost merchants about half of what they pay
to accept credit cards. The debit caps may cut annual revenue at
the biggest banks by $8 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg Government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants say the fee hurts consumers because they lead to
higher prices for products and services. A judgment or
settlement could result in a rate reduction, they claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary Judgment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides have asked Gleeson for summary judgment in their
favor now that discovery, or information-gathering, is done.
They say a trial isn&#8217;t needed, at least on most counts, because
there are no facts in dispute for a jury to decide. Gleeson is
scheduled to hear arguments on those motions today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation, dating back to 2005, has produced more than
82 million pages of documents and sworn testimony from almost
500 witnesses, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits contain allegations that the networks&#8217; rules,
including those prohibiting merchants from steering customers to
cheaper forms of payment, violate U.S. competition law. Last
year, Visa and MasterCard settled with the U.S. government on
such anti-steering allegations. New York-based American Express
Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by purchases, is fighting
that suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Proof Points&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We welcome the opportunity to present arguments on
motions seeking dismissal of the litigation and will offer
strong proof points demonstrating our practices serve to benefit
consumers and enhance competition,&#8221; James Issokson, a spokesman
for Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wednesday&#8217;s hearing is simply the next step in the
litigation process,&#8221; Denise Dunckel, a spokeswoman for San
Francisco-based Visa, said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217; claims against a centralized system for setting
interchange rates are without merit and overlook the fact that
interchange has been upheld as legal in every direct challenge
made in U.S. courts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Lubin Rossi, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan; Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America; and Emily Collins, a spokeswoman
for New York-based Citigroup, declined to comment. The three
banks are the biggest in the U.S. by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Realities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Semeraro, a professor at San Diego-based Thomas
Jefferson School of Law, who has written on interchange fees,
said in a phone interview that the merchants will likely win on
the standing argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s so much in the case law that says what matters is
the economic realities and not the form,&#8221; Semeraco said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Simkovic, an associate professor at Seton Hall
University School of Law in Newark, New Jersey, said the appeals
court covering Brooklyn has taken a narrow view of the co-conspirator exception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants have some pretty strong arguments there
and they might be able to win on that basis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
merchants are focusing on the cash flow, but contractually
that&#8217;s not how it works. Contractually, everything goes through
the intermediary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Visa and MasterCard settled a separate antitrust
class action, called In re Visa Check, for $3 billion. That
case, which Gleeson presided over, targeted debit-card rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of that settlement, the merchants can&#8217;t sue over
conduct occurring before 2004. Visa and MasterCard argue that
release covers their current rules, which date from before 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Changes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rather than negotiate additional changes to the existing
rules in the Visa Check settlement, plaintiffs negotiated &#8216;the
largest antitrust settlement in history,&#8217;&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merchants argue they are alleging new antitrust
injuries that came after the rules were reauthorized and new fee
rates established. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each time a new interchange fee is set or charged, a new
price-fixing agreement occurs,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants also argue the banks no longer control the
payment networks now that they are publicly traded, and don&#8217;t
control the rate of the interchange fees. MasterCard conducted
an initial public offering in May 2006, Visa in March 2008.
Before that, they were joint ventures owned by the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merchants argue that, even after the IPOs, the banks
continue to control rules and interchange rates in a way that
restrains competition or at least threatens anticompetitive
effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Entities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Far from disavowing the goals of their conspiracy, bank
defendants merely set up new entities to continue to administer
those conspiracies and ensure that they continued to profit from
their activities,&#8221; the merchants wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merchants are also seeking to have the IPOs unwound,
contending they lessen competition. Gleeson previously dismissed
that argument, though he allowed the merchants to re-file it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants accuse MasterCard of committing a &#8220;fraudulent
conveyance&#8221; when, in its IPO, it eliminated the ability to
assess the banks for litigation costs and got nothing in return
for it. The merchants say that move hurts their ability to
recover any judgment in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Visa, MasterCard and the banks reached an
agreement about how they would divvy up a global judgment or
settlement involving all the defendants, according to regulatory
filings. Visa would pay two-thirds and MasterCard one-third.
MasterCard&#8217;s agreements with its banks limit its portion to 36
percent of that, with banks picking up the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-1720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther
Duflo&#8217;s &#8220;Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to
Fight Global Poverty&#8221; won the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs
Business Book of the Year Award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banerjee and Duflo, MIT economists and co-founders of the
Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, overcame competition from
Barry Eichengreen&#8217;s &#8220;Exorbitant Privilege,&#8221; Daniel Yergin&#8217;s
&#8220;The Quest&#8221; and other finalists to claim the award of 30,000
pounds ($48,000) during a dinner last night at the Wallace
Collection in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &#8220;Poor Economics&#8221; (PublicAffairs), Banerjee and Duflo
use randomized control trials of the type used to assess new
drugs to study the behavior of poor people and the best ways to
alleviate poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing topics from health to education, the authors
build a shrewd yet sympathetic portrait of a problem as complex
as those individuals who make up the all-too-often stereotyped
poor. They shed light on seemingly irrational behavior, such as
the Moroccan farmer who finds money to buy a television when he
can&#8217;t afford food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, they argue that aid can work, as long as what
they call &#8220;the three I&#8217;s: ignorance, ideology, and inertia&#8221;
are banished from policy making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors didn&#8217;t think they were writing a business book,
Banerjee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing Boundaries &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s particularly wonderful about winning this award is
that these ideas, that in some ways come from a very different
world -- the world we live in, which is a world of poverty and
policy -- resonate with people who are from the world of
business,&#8221; Banerjee said after the ceremony. &#8220;That these ideas
have managed to cross that boundary -- it&#8217;s really very
rewarding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably absent from the award&#8217;s shortlist were titles
addressing the financial crisis. Last year, books on the subject
were so prevalent that Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), recused himself from judging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the five other finalists received a prize of 10,000
pounds ($16,000). They included Eichengreen&#8217;s primer on the
dollar&#8217;s role as the dominant international currency (from
Oxford University Press) and Yergin&#8217;s epic study of the evolving
energy business (Penguin Press/Allen Lane). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Finalists &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other finalists were &#8220;Triumph of the City&#8221; by Edward Glaeser (Penguin Press/Macmillan), the Harvard professor&#8217;s
affirmation of the enduring economic and environmental benefits
of urban living; Margaret Heffernan&#8217;s &#8220;Willful Blindness&#8221;
(Walker/Simon  Schuster), an examination of why humans are
prone to ignoring the obvious and why that&#8217;s particularly
dangerous in today&#8217;s world; and Richard Rumelt&#8217;s &#8220;Good
Strategy/Bad Strategy&#8221; (Crown Business/Profile), which debunks
buzzwords, visions and motivational slogans in favor of specific
and coherent responses to challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meredith Whitney, the bank analyst
who predicted &#8220;hundreds of billions of dollars&#8221; of municipal
defaults, downgraded Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) to
&#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; an employee of her firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meredith Whitney Advisory Group cut the two companies
today, Marc Lombardo, a research analyst, said in a phone
interview. The research firm has a five-tier rating system, with
&#8220;buy&#8221; at the top, followed by &#8220;outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney had &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on Visa and MasterCard since
she started coverage in March 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. She called Visa her &#8220;single best buy&#8221; during an
interview with Bloomberg Radio on May 4, 2010. The stock had
climbed 3.5 percent since then through yesterday, compared with
a 5.5 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard, the world&#8217;s biggest payments networks,
plunged last year after U.S. lawmakers approved caps on debit-
card transaction fees as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The shares
rebounded this year as consumers worldwide continued to shift to
plastic from cash and checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard advanced 1.7 percent to $363.75 at 1:37 p.m. in
New York after surging 60 percent in 2011 through yesterday, the
top performance in the 75-company SP 500 Information Technology
Index. Visa, the index&#8217;s fifth-biggest gainer, climbed 1.9
percent to $93.19 after advancing 30 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Issokson, a spokesman for Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard, and Erica Harvill of San Francisco-based Visa,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney became a celebrity during the financial crisis
after she correctly predicted that Citigroup Inc. would cut its
dividend. Her call last year that there would be a wave of state
and local government bond defaults has so far proved unfounded.
Defaults totaled $1.13 billion in 2011, compared with $4.25
billion for all of 2010, Bank of America Corp. said in a Sept.
23 research note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon was targeted by protesters during a keynote
speech in Seattle last night, with activists picketing and
chanting &#8220;banks got bailed out, we got sold out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 participants weathered pouring rain and
temperatures in the 40s to air frustrations as Dimon, 55,
addressed the University of Washington Foster School of
Business&#8217; annual business leadership dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three protesters said they were hit with pepper
spray as they tried to block entrances to a Sheraton hotel,
where the dinner was closed to the public. Activists held signs
that called for Dimon&#8217;s arrest and compared his hourly wage,
which they calculated at around $10,000, with about $23 for an
average worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re bringing to the surface the pent up
disappointment, anger, frustration and fear that the American
people has with the direction that the economy and country has
taken over the last decade,&#8221; said John Taylor, president and
CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a
Washington-based non-profit group that represents affordable
housing charities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the Seattle demonstrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occupy Wall Street activists have repeatedly targeted Dimon
as they protest income disparity, the influence of money on
politics and the use of taxpayer funds to rescue banks in 2008.
They marched from Wall Street in downtown New York to his home
on the upper East Side on Oct. 11. The route also included
demonstrations outside homes of News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch,
billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson and Republican donor
David Koch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoided Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who runs the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,
saw his institution through the recession without posting a
quarterly loss. He has said that JPMorgan, which took $25
billion in money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, did so
only to encourage other banks to participate and shore up the
financial system, not because it needed the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston, San Francisco, Washington and London are among
cities where rallies have been held to protest banks and their
executives. People are focusing lenders&#8217; role in creating the
housing crisis and the impact it had on the economy and
unemployment, said Taylor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not Jamie personally, it&#8217;s the institutions
themselves and what they are doing or not doing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Do the Right Thing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1,200 people signed an online petition last year
urging Syracuse University in New York to rescind Dimon&#8217;s
invitation as the commencement speaker. Dimon presented the
address, telling students to have the courage to speak the
truth, even when it&#8217;s unpopular. He told graduates to &#8220;do the
right thing, not the easy thing&#8221; and not to become someone
else&#8217;s &#8220;lapdog or sycophant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a dozen graduates protested in silence by
removing their caps and gowns during his speech. While Dimon
urged graduates to hold him and other CEOs accountable for their
actions, he warned against indiscriminately judging all
executives based on the failings of a few as &#8220;another form of
prejudice and ignorance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s okay for us at times to blame and be dissatisfied
with others and hold them responsible, but it&#8217;s not okay to
oversimplify and paint everyone with the same brush,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It should not be acceptable to denigrate entire groups, not
all companies, not all CEOs, not all politicians, not all media,
not all students.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) agreed to pay $3
billion to settle U.S. criminal and civil investigations into
whether the company marketed drugs for unapproved uses and other
matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations over the terms are ongoing and will be
completed next year, the London-based company said in a
statement yesterday. The cost is covered by existing legal
provisions and will be paid from the company&#8217;s cash resources,
Glaxo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential settlement brings Glaxo closer to putting
years of legal probes behind it. The company set aside 2.2
billion pounds ($3.5 billion) in the fourth quarter in
anticipation of reaching an agreement on the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a significant step toward resolving difficult,
longstanding matters which do not reflect the company that we
are today,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty said in the
statement. &#8220;In recent years, we have fundamentally changed our
procedures for compliance, marketing and selling in the U.S. to
ensure that we operate with high standards of integrity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This news essentially draws a line under a 10-year legal
saga,&#8221; Gbola Amusa, an analyst at UBS AG (UBSN) in London, said in an
e-mail. The company still has about 1 billion pounds in extra
provisions set aside, he said. &#8220;This removes significant
uncertainty on ongoing legal issues,&#8221; said Amusa, who
recommends buying Glaxo shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors began an investigation in Colorado in
2004, later taken over by the U.S. attorney in Massachusetts,
into whether Glaxo promoted drugs for unapproved uses, and into
ways Glaxo potentially influenced doctors. The probe concerns
nine of the company&#8217;s best-selling products from 1997 to 2004,
Glaxo said in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint Allowed to Pursue Legal Challenge to ATT-T-Mobile Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) can sue ATT Inc. over its proposed
purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc., a federal judge ruled, saying the
fact that the companies are competitors doesn&#8217;t bar a private
antitrust lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle in Washington said
yesterday that the suit by Sprint, and another by Cellular South
Inc. to block the $39 billion deal, can proceed. Still, the
judge dismissed several claims, limiting the cases to Sprint&#8217;s
allegations regarding access to mobile devices and Cellular
South&#8217;s complaints involving roaming fees as well as devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where private plaintiffs have successfully pleaded
antitrust injury, the fact that they are defendants&#8217; competitors
is no bar,&#8221; Huvelle said in her ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint and Cellular South will now be able to
&#8220;supplement&#8221; the Justice Department&#8217;s lawsuit to stop the
deal, Andrew Gavil, a law professor at Howard University in
Washington, said in an e-mail. While the government will try to
prove how the merger would harm consumers, the companies will
attack the way the transaction might diminish competition in the
wireless telephone industry, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is an important victory for Sprint and Cellular
South,&#8221; Gavil said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT argued that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint can&#8217;t
challenge the purchase under antitrust law because it&#8217;s a
competitor rather than a consumer. It also contended that
Sprint&#8217;s claims that the acquisition would hurt its business are
unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular South Inc., based in Ridgeland, Mississippi, filed
a similar lawsuit that ATT also asked Huvelle to dismiss. The
company changed its name to C Spire in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huvelle scheduled a hearing on the cases for Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the limited, minor claims they have left are
entirely without merit,&#8221; Wayne Watts, ATT&#8217;s senior executive
vice president and general counsel, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint and Cellular South issued statements saying they
were &#8220;pleased&#8221; that the judge allowed them to &#8220;continue
fighting&#8221; the proposed merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s case is U.S. v. ATT Inc. (T), 11-01560;
Sprint&#8217;s case is Sprint Nextel Corp. v. ATT Inc., 11-01600; and
Cellular South&#8217;s case is Cellular South Inc. v. ATT Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard Put Potential Fee Settlement at $4 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the world&#8217;s biggest payment
networks, put any potential settlement of price-fixing
litigation by merchants at about $4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard &#8220;extrapolated an estimate of a reasonably
possible loss of at least $500 million if there is a negotiated
settlement with all plaintiffs,&#8221; MasterCard Chief Executive
Officer Ajaypal S. Banga said on an earnings conference call
with investors yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Visa, MasterCard and the banks being sued by
merchants over swipe fees, or interchange, agreed that Visa
would be responsible for two-thirds of any settlement and
MasterCard would be responsible for about one-eighth. Visa said
in regulatory filings it has a litigation escrow account with
$2.7 billion in cash available. Those figures put a potential
settlement at $4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard, the banks and the merchants yesterday
argued before U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New
York, on why he should rule in their favor without the need of a
trial in the antitrust litigation, begun in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banga didn&#8217;t say that any settlement was imminent, either
in the class action or in suits brought by individual merchants
including Publix Super Markets Inc. (PUSH), the Lakeland, Florida-based
supermarket chain, and Rite Aid Corp. (RAD), the Camp Hill,
Pennsylvania-based drugstore chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we&#8217;ve made substantial progress with the individual
merchant plaintiffs, there has not been similar progress with
the class plaintiffs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At this time, it is not
possible to put an upper limit on this loss due to the
significantly higher demands by the class plaintiffs, which are
unacceptable to MasterCard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard argued they and banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C)
can&#8217;t be accused of a conspiracy because the merchants don&#8217;t
directly pay the interchange fees on payment-card purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also argued that the accusations are covered by a
settlement in previous litigation and that the payment-card
operators are now public companies, which set the fees
themselves, rather than joint ventures of the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants such as D&#8217;Agostino Supermarkets Inc. in
Larchmont, New York, and Collective Brands Inc. (PSS)&#8217;s Payless
ShoeSource in Topeka, Kansas, accuse Visa, MasterCard and the
banks in a class-action suit of violating antitrust laws with
the inflated swipe fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-1720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Claimant Says Zuckerberg Deleted E-Mails After Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ceglia, the New York man claiming half of Facebook
Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s holdings, asked a judge to
sanction Zuckerberg for allegedly destroying e-mail messages
related to their dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia said in filings Nov. 1 in federal court in Buffalo,
New York, that Zuckerberg deleted e-mails from his Harvard
University account after Ceglia filed the lawsuit and after
Zuckerberg received a so-called litigation hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his lawsuit, filed in June 2010, Ceglia claims he and
Zuckerberg signed a contract in 2003 making them partners at the
start of Palo Alto, California-based Facebook. The company has
called Ceglia&#8217;s claim a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia has said he communicated with Zuckerberg in 2003 and
2004 using Internet-based e-mail accounts. Ceglia claims he cut
and pasted their correspondence into word processing documents,
which he printed and saved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These filings by Ceglia and his latest lawyer are truly
delusional,&#8221; Orin Snyder, a lawyer for Zuckerberg and Facebook,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;These are the desperate acts of
a man whose fraudulent lawsuit has now been fully exposed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his request for sanctions Nov. 1, Ceglia seeks an order
prohibiting Facebook or Zuckerberg from disputing the
authenticity of his e-mails. Ceglia hired a new lawyer this
month, his fourth lead counsel since filing the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 1:10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, MortgageIT Suit Should Go Forward, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany&#8217;s biggest bank, and its
MortgageIT unit should be required to defend the $1 billion suit
by the government claiming they lied as part of a &#8220;massive
fraud&#8221; to qualify thousands of risky mortgages for a federal
insurance program, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. claims Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank and
MortgageIT falsely certified that they properly assessed the
default risk of borrowers, qualifying loans for insurance by the
Housing and Urban Development Department&#8217;s Federal Housing
Administration, according to a complaint filed May 3 in
Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This misconduct -- which MortgageIT began as early as
1999 and which Deutsche Bank continued and exacerbated after
acquiring MortgageIT in 2007 -- resulted in a wave of defaults
and more than $368 million in FHA insurance losses on loans that
never should have been originated in the first place,&#8221; the U.S.
said in a brief yesterday opposing the defendants&#8217; request to
dismiss the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. sued under the False Claims Act, which permits it
to seek triple damages and penalties of more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Deutsche Bank AG, 11-cv-2976, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynegy Asks Judge to Dismiss Avenue Investments Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynegy Inc. (DYN), the third-largest independent U.S. power
producer, asked a New York judge to dismiss a lawsuit by Avenue
Investments LP that claims the company stole assets from
bondholders in a restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bondholders led by Avenue sued Houston-based Dynegy in New
York State Supreme Court on Sept. 21, seeking to undo the
company&#8217;s restructuring, which Avenue said improperly removed
coal-fired power plants from the reach of bondholders and
transferred them to stockholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynegy asked Justice Bernard Fried in Manhattan to dismiss
the complaint in court documents filed on Oct. 31, saying that
New York is the wrong jurisdiction and that the Avenue
bondholders don&#8217;t have standing to sue, to pursue so-called
fraudulent conveyance claims or to bring derivative claims for
breach of fiduciary duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This lawsuit was plainly designed to interfere with
Dynegy&#8217;s exchange offer by communicating to participants that
plaintiffs would challenge the exchange after the fact,&#8221; Dynegy
said in the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynegy said July 10 that it would restructure to avoid
violating an earnings-to-interest covenant in its loan
agreement. The company created two units, one owning eight
natural gas-fired power generation facilities and another owning
a group of six coal-fired facilities, both of which would be
&#8220;bankruptcy remote,&#8221; insulating them if affiliates become
insolvent, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Avenue Investments LP v. Dynegy Inc.,
652599/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dahdaleh Gets $16 Million Bail Overturned, No Electronic Tag &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British investor Victor Dahdaleh won a ruling overturning a
10 million-pound ($16 million) bail requirement to be released
pending a trial on bribery charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahdaleh, 68, also doesn&#8217;t have to wear an electronic tag
after a judge at a London criminal court struck down several
bail conditions yesterday, said David Jones, a spokesman for the
Serious Fraud Office, which is prosecuting the case. Dahdaleh,
the owner of Dadco Group, is accused of paying bribes to a
Bahraini royal and the former chief executive officer of
Aluminium Bahrain BSC (ALBH) to win contracts for Alcoa Inc. (AA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge refused Dahdaleh&#8217;s request to travel outside of
England and Wales, Jones said. Dahdaleh must report to a police
station in the Belgravia neighborhood of London twice a week and
must spend nights at his home there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of his friends must still adhere to pledges to pay
1.4 million pounds if Dahdaleh fails to return to court, Jones
said. Philip Martin Cutts, the chief executive officer of Credit
Suisse Group AG&#8217;s U.K. private bank, and BP Plc executive Thomas
Prescott are among those that made the assurances at a hearing
earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahdaleh was charged Oct. 24 with six counts of making
corrupt payments, two counts of money laundering, and one charge
of conspiracy to corrupt. He is accused paying bribes to
officials of the smelting company Aluminium Bahrain, known as
Alba, including Sheikh Isa Bin Ali al-Khalifa, the former oil
minister of Bahrain and former chairman of the board of
directors, and Bruce Hall, the former chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahdaleh&#8217;s lawyer, Arnondo Chakrabarti, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany Charges Olympus Managers With Breach-of-Trust &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg prosecutors have charged three former managers of
an Olympus Corp. (7733) unit in Europe with breach of trust, spokesman
Wilhelm Moellers said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The managers, one Italian and two German nationals, were
charged in March in connection with four payments totaling
640,000 euros ($883,000) made between July and October 2003
where no services appeared to have been rendered, Moellers said
in a telephone interview. Two of the managers allegedly
authorized the payments, while a third is allegedly related to a
Swiss company that was the beneficiary of the payments, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court now has to decide whether to open the case,&#8221;
he said, adding that no hearing date has been set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franziska Jorke, an Olympus Europa Holding GmbH spokeswoman
in Hamburg, declined to comment on the identity of the managers
or on the details of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus, the world&#8217;s largest maker of endoscopes, has been
in a war of words with fired president Michael C. Woodford over
advisory fees paid in takeovers. On Nov. 1, the Tokyo-based
company said it selected former prosecutors to investigate past
acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In 2008, following an audit by the tax authorities, a
transaction was subjected to an internal audit,&#8221; Jorke said in
an e-mail. &#8220;Having consulted our external legal advisers,
Olympus submitted details of this transaction to the Office of
the Public Prosecutor. The management of Olympus Europa Holding
had no knowledge of the transaction in question prior to the
internal audit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Witness in Azeri Bribery Case Faces New Laundering Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Swiss lawyer who was the U.S. government&#8217;s star witness
in the 2009 bribery trial of American businessman Frederic
Bourke faces new allegations that he orchestrated a $1 billion
money-laundering scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer, Hans Bodmer, pleaded guilty to money laundering
and testified for U.S. prosecutors at Bourke&#8217;s trial for paying
bribes in an oil deal in Azerbaijan. Bodmer said he told Bourke,
an investor in the 1998 oil deal, about the bribery plot he
helped organize. Bourke was convicted. Bodmer returned to his
Zurich law practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York judge on Nov. 10 will hear arguments on Bourke&#8217;s
claim that Bodmer lied at the trial. Meanwhile, Bodmer is facing
new laundering allegations. In August, Russian billionaire Oleg
Deripaska filed a legal complaint in Switzerland accusing him
and others of masterminding a scheme last year to loot OJSC MMC
Norilsk Nickel (GMKN), a nickel producer in which Deripaska invests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under the pivotal involvement of Hans Bodmer, a complex
structure was created&#8221; to siphon funds out of Norilsk Nickel,
Deripaska&#8217;s complaint says. &#8220;The accused parties extracted the
assets of Norilsk  Nickel unlawfully and to their own advantage,
an amount of approximately $1 billion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bourke&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Tigar, declined to say whether he
would cite the new allegations in his bid to win a new trial for
his client. As he challenges his conviction in an appeals court,
Bourke has also returned to the trial judge to claim that
prosecutors knew Bodmer lied in his testimony. Prosecutors say
there&#8217;s no evidence Bodmer lied when he tied Bourke to the
bribery scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodmer&#8217;s lawyer, Saul Pilchen, didn&#8217;t have an immediate
comment on the Swiss case. Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bourke case is U.S. v. Bourke, 05-cr-00518, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian City Sues Bawag for $35 Million on Swiss Franc Swap &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linz, Austria&#8217;s third-biggest city, sued Bawag PSK Bank
over a 195 million Swiss franc ($221 million) swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bawag didn&#8217;t inform Linz about the potential risks of the
2007 swap, which was used to secure a franc bond, according a
copy of the suit posted on Linz&#8217;s website. The city is seeking
30.64 million francs in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disputes over swap agreements, typically used by municipal
agencies to lower interest payments, have spread through Europe
with lawsuits in Germany, Italy and the U.K. Deutsche Bank AG in
March lost a case over swaps in the first ruling by Germany&#8217;s
highest court concerning sales of the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bawag &#8220;overstepped all legal boundaries that need to be
observed when entering into a contract with a municipality,&#8221;
Mayor Franz Dobusch told reporters in Linz yesterday, according
to Austria Press Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabine Hacker, a spokeswoman for the bank, didn&#8217;t
immediately answer a call after business hours yesterday. Bawag,
which is controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP, in March
said that it &#8220;vehemently&#8221; rejected Linz&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linz&#8217;s former finance director Werner Penn, who resigned in
March, entered into the bond without getting the necessary
approval from city agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city has formed a special committee to investigate the
swap. Austrian Central Bank Governor Ewald Nowotny, who headed
Bawag when the swap was entered into, will address the committee
on Nov. 23, according to the committee&#8217;s chairwoman Ursula
Roschger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly Hid Zyprexa&#8217;s Diabetes Risks, Student Died, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) didn&#8217;t properly warn a patient who took its
Zyprexa antipsychotic medication of diabetes risks and the young
man died, a lawyer for his family told a jury in the first case
to go to trial over the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cody Tadai, a 20-year-old college student, took Zyprexa to
battle mental illness without either him, or his doctor, being
properly advised about the drug&#8217;s link to diabetes, Ronald
Makarem, a Los Angeles-based lawyer, said in closing arguments
in the trial of a lawsuit filed by members of Tadai&#8217;s family.
They contend the student died of diabetes-related ailments in
March 2007 and that the drugmaker put profits ahead of the
safety of Zyprexa users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They chose money over safety,&#8221; Makarem told jurors in
state court in Los Angeles yesterday. A verdict on behalf of
Tadai&#8217;s family would remind Lilly executives to ensure &#8220;safety
comes first and money second,&#8221; he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indianapolis-based Lilly, which lost patent protection on
Zyprexa last month, has paid about $2.9 billion to resolve
government and individual claims over its marketing of the
antipsychotic drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly agreed in 2009 to pay $1.42 billion to settle federal
prosecutors&#8217; allegations that it illegally marketed Zyprexa for
unapproved uses. The drugmaker also agreed to pay more than $260
million to resolve similar state claims. The company also has
agreed to pay more than $1.2 billion to settle about 31,000
suits by former users of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefanie Prodouz, a Lilly spokeswoman, declined to comment
yesterday on why the drugmaker decided to make the Tadai
family&#8217;s Zyprexa suit the first to go to trial after more than
eight years of litigation over the medication. The drug was
Lilly&#8217;s top seller last year, racking up more than $5 billion in
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker still faces about 40 Zyprexa suits that
include claims from about 110 former users of the drug, Lilly
executives said in an Oct. 28 U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cody Tadai v. Eli Lilly  Co., BC 379020,
California Superior Court (Los Angeles County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Milan Mayors Tell Court of Bank Swap Fees, Adviser Roles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Milan Mayor Gabriele Albertini told a court
yesterday he knew banks would charge the city for arranging a
2005 financing package that included swaps, though he didn&#8217;t
know the amount of the commissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I took it for granted that banks were charging a fee,&#8221;
Albertini said under questioning from a defense lawyer for the
banks at a trial in Milan yesterday. &#8220;Banks aren&#8217;t doing
charity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms charged a &#8220;symbolic&#8221; 168,000 euros ($231,000)
for arranging a 1.7 billion-euro bond sale, and he knew the city
would pay other commissions, Albertini said. He added that he
didn&#8217;t know how they would be paid or how much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Dublin-
based Depfa Bank Plc face charges of mis-selling swaps to the
municipal government of Italy&#8217;s commercial capital, derivatives
that adjusted payments on the 2005 bond offering. Prosecutor
Alfredo Robledo said the banks earned 101 million euros in
hidden fees and misled Milan by telling the city it could save
about 55 million euros with the bond sale and a series of swaps.
The banks deny the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milan is seeking damages in the trial and sued the banks in
civil courts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Said to Be Assigned to Massachusetts Medical Prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager sentenced to 11
years in prison for insider trading, was assigned to a federal
prison medical center in Massachusetts, according to a person
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, was ordered by U.S. District Judge Richard
Holwell to report to prison on Dec. 5. At Rajaratanam&#8217;s request,
Holwell, who handed down the sentence on Oct. 13 in Manhattan
federal court, recommended the Galleon Group LLC co-founder do
his time at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North
Carolina, where convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff is
serving a 150-year sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who says he has health problems including
diabetes and will likely need dialysis and an eventual kidney
transplant, was instead assigned to Federal Medical Center
Devens, according to the person familiar with the matter. Devens
is located on the decommissioned Fort Devens military base in
Ayer, Massachusetts, 39 miles (63 kilometers) west of Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Dowd, Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyer, declined to comment on the
prison assignment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Ross, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman, also declined to
comment, citing a policy not to disclose prison assignments
before the prisoner is in custody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devens houses male inmates who need specialized or long-
term medical or mental health care, according to the Bureau of
Prisons website. It is designated as an administrative facility,
which means it has inmates from different security
classifications - from white collar criminals like Rajaratnam to
mobsters and sex offenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the medical center, Devens includes a
minimum security prison camp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devens inmates often leave the facility to see outside
specialists and to have tests and medical procedures not
available in the medical center, according to Sandra Howard,
M.D., clinical director at Devens, who submitted an affidavit in
Rajaratnam&#8217;s case in September at the request of the government.
The facility has regular onsite specialists in cardiology,
nephrology, endocrinology, surgery, neurology and pulmonology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devens provides dialysis to about 85 inmates, with the
capacity for as many as 125, Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is the central figure in what U.S. investigators
called the largest hedge fund insider-trading case in U.S.
history. The probe, which leveraged the widespread use of FBI
wiretaps for the first time in such an inquiry, led to
convictions of more than two dozen people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the hedge fund manager made more than $72
million by using illegal tips to trade in stocks of companies
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Intel Corp., Google Inc.,
ATI Technologies Inc. and Clearwire Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Investors Lose Bid to Recoup Lehman-Related Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 213 investors in Singapore lost a bid to recoup
S$18 million ($14 million) of losses tied to Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), with an appeal court upholding a lower court
ruling that dismissed their claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS Bank Ltd., which sold credit default swaps linked to
Lehman, had inconsistencies in the investment&#8217;s prospectus and
pricing statement, the investors claimed. They sought to have
the contracts annulled and their investments returned. DBS Bank,
a Singapore-based unit of DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS), Southeast
Asia&#8217;s biggest bank, had declared the investments were worthless
after Lehman collapsed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment structure was artificial and complex, the
three-judge panel of the appeal court said in yesterday&#8217;s
ruling. The formula for calculating the payouts in the event of
a default is consistently stated across several documents and,
as a result, the investors claim must fail, the judges said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A person who signs a contract which is set in a language
he is not familiar with or whose terms he may not understand is
nonetheless bound by the terms of that contract,&#8221; the judges
said in the ruling. &#8220;The principle of caveat emptor applies
equally to literates and illiterates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Soon Kok Tiang v. DBS Bank Ltd. CA6/2011,
Singapore Court of Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John R. Opel, who led International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) in the 1980s as it introduced its first
personal computer, has died. He was 86. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died yesterday, IBM said, without citing a cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As CEO from January 1981 through January 1985, Opel led IBM
into a new era as it put a long-running antitrust investigation
behind it and dived into competition with Apple Computer Inc.
and others in the home-computer market. The first IBM personal
computer, or IBM PC, was introduced in August 1981. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He challenged people&#8217;s assumptions,&#8221; Nicholas Donofrio,
a former senior vice president at IBM, said of Opel in a
statement released by the company. &#8220;He was always pushing the
edge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust case that ended during Opel&#8217;s tenure had been
filed in 1969 in the final days of Lyndon B. Johnson&#8217;s
presidency. It accused IBM of anti-competitive practices in the
field of &#8220;general purpose digital computers&#8221; and aimed to
split the Armonk, New York-based company. The case hung over IBM
for 13 years, until the Justice Department dropped it in January
1982. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Big Is Bountiful&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opel made the cover of Time magazine on July 11, 1983, for
a story titled, &#8220;The Colossus That Works: Big Is Bountiful at
IBM.&#8221; The company&#8217;s earnings of $4.4 billion on sales of $34.4
billion made it the most profitable U.S. industrial company in
1982, according to Time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Opel&#8217;s direction, IBM &#8220;has been acting like its
brashest competitors -- entering new markets, chasing the latest
technology, trimming organizational fat and selling more
aggressively than ever,&#8221; Time said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares returned 117 percent during Opel&#8217;s four-year
tenure as chief, more than five times that of the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company bought a minority stake in chipmaker Intel
Corp. (INTC) during Opel&#8217;s time as CEO and reorganized its sales force
so that a single representative could sell a wide range of
products, the New York Times reported in 1984. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opel told Time he was bullish on the future for information
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have yet to hear somebody say they could not use more
information,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hence the demand for information
processing, though perhaps not infinite, is enormous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started in Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Roberts Opel was born on Jan. 5, 1925, in Kansas City,
Missouri, and was raised in Jefferson City. He graduated from
Westminster College in Fulton before earning his master&#8217;s degree
in business administration from the University of Chicago in
1949. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joined IBM as a sales representative in Jefferson City
and was promoted to management posts through the 1950s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas J. Watson Jr., IBM&#8217;s CEO from 1956 to 1971,
&#8220;summoned Opel from the hinterlands&#8221; to be his executive
assistant in 1959, and Opel learned management at Watson&#8217;s side,
IBM said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966 he became a vice president and was appointed to the
management committee the following year. He was named vice
president of corporate finance and planning in 1968, senior vice
president in 1969, group executive of the Data Processing
Product Group in 1972 and president in 1974. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took over as CEO and chairman of the management
committee on Jan. 1, 1981, succeeding Frank T. Cary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ceding the CEO role to John F. Akers in 1985, Opel
remained as chairman through May 1986 and as a member of IBM&#8217;s
board and chairman of its executive committee until 1993. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Inc., the bankrupt
futures brokerage, has located $658.8 million in customer funds
in a custodial account at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), according to two
people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The account contained a total of $2.2 billion as of Oct.
31, including both the firm&#8217;s own money and customer funds,
according to one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $593 million of MF customer funds remain unaccounted
for, according to another person with knowledge of regulatory
probes into the firm&#8217;s collapse. That amount has decreased from
the shortfall of $633 million the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission cited Nov. 2, the person said. People familiar with
deliberations inside MF said earlier today that they believed
the money located at JPMorgan included the missing customer
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan does not have &#8220;any information&#8221; about whether
the account balances are &#8220;related in any way to the &#8216;missing&#8217;
customer funds,&#8221; Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the
New York-based lender, said in response to questions from 
Bloomberg News. &#8220;What we can  confirm is that the accounts and
their balances have been and continue to be wholly transparent
to MF Global&#8221; and the trustee appointed to locate customer 
assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Corzine, the former co-chief executive officer of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., quit as chairman and CEO of New York-
based MF Global, the firm said today in an e-mailed statement.
Corzine, 64, who was paid more than $4 million since joining the
firm 20 months ago, won&#8217;t seek severance pay, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine&#8217;s resignation came four days after the bankruptcy
filing as the company&#8217;s bets on European sovereign debt rattled
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC has been investigating the missing funds. The
regulator sent a subpoena seeking information about the money to
MF Global&#8217;s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a person
briefed on the matter said yesterday, asking not to be named
because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global received a statement today from JPMorgan that
showed the funds in the account, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, an MF Global spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said its traders lost money on 16 days in
the third quarter as turmoil in Europe roiled bond and equity
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank had 177 days of positive trading revenue in the
first nine months, including five days in which the gains
exceeded $200 million, according to a regulatory filing today by
New York-based JPMorgan. The biggest U.S. lenders have leaned on
trading operations this year to boost profit as results at
consumer-related businesses sagged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s nine-month perfect trading record ended in the
second quarter with two days of losses, as concern rose that
Greece would default on its debt and U.S. lawmakers would fail
to raise the debt ceiling. In all, JPMorgan&#8217;s traders lost money
on 26 days during the past seven quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading revenue averaged $76 million a day during the first
nine months. Revenue at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment-banking unit,
which houses the trading desks, fell 13 percent from the second
quarter to $6.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jim Brunsden and Rebecca Christie" date="Nov 04, 2011  2:07 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-04/deutsche-bank-bnp-goldman-sachs-among-banks-facing-extra-capital-buffer.html"><headline>Deutsche Bank, BNP Among 29 Banks Facing FSB Capital Buffer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), BNP Paribas (BNP) SA and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are among banks that must hold
additional capital buffers ranging from 1 to 2.5 percentage
points under plans approved today by the Group of 20 nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 29 lenders may have to meet the requirements,
according to a provisional list published by the Financial
Stability Board. The measures were agreed on by regulators to
prevent any so-called systemically important financial
institution from failing and roiling the global economy. The
list doesn&#8217;t specify the exact surcharges banks may face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemically important banks need &#8220;higher capital
requirements which will reflect the cost of their possible
failure,&#8221; Mario Draghi, the FSB&#8217;s chairman, told reporters in
Cannes, France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank watchdogs have clashed with some lenders including
HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Citigroup Inc. (C) and BNP over the plans, with
the banks warning they could cause them to cut lending or
support to international trade. The Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, which drafted the surcharge plans, in September
rejected calls to scrap additional capital buffers, instead
agreeing to changes to how it calculates them. The measures were
published today after approval by Group of 20 leaders in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura, Lloyds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. and Spain&#8217;s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA), which were both included in a list of 25 SIFIs
published by Morgan Stanley analyst Huw van Steenis in June,
escaped the FSB&#8217;s list. Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), which Steenis
didn&#8217;t expect to make the regulator&#8217;s list, did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The list in general is not a big surprise, if you look at
who are the world&#8217;s top 30 banks,&#8221; Irving Henry, a director at
the British Bankers&#8217; Association, said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s
interesting that there is no Standard Chartered, although this
may be because it&#8217;s not big in the U.K.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s also surprising that there is no Nomura,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surcharges will be applied on top of an overhaul of
bank-capital requirements that international regulators agreed
on last year. Those changes, known as Basel III, will more than
triple the core reserves that lenders must hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional buffers mean lenders may face core capital
requirements of as much as 9.5 percent of assets, weighted on
risk. At least four banks face the top surcharge of 2.5 percent,
according to provisional data published today by the Basel
Committee, which didn&#8217;t specify any individual lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are among eight U.S. banks on
the list. David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, and Howard Opinsky, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment. Jeanmarie McFadden, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley (MS),
which is included, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale (GLE) SA and Credit Agricole Groupe are also
among four French lenders included on the list. Deutsche Bank
and Commerzbank AG are the two German lenders, while four U.K.
banks, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc face the surcharges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armin Niedermeier, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said the
company&#8217;s inclusion on the list was expected. Reiner Rossmann, a
spokesman for Frankfurt-based Commerzbank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list was dominated by European and U.S. banks, which
was expected, Richard Reid, research director for the
International Centre for Financial Regulation, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Percent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some banks in the European Union already face requirements
to hold 9 percent in core reserves, after sovereign-debt
writedowns, under plans adopted by EU regulators in response to
the Greek financial crisis. Banks will need to raise 106 billion
euros ($145.9 billion) in fresh capital to meet the rules, the
European Banking Authority estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of what banks can count as capital to meet
the Basel surcharges is stricter than that used by the EU, which
allows lenders to use some contingent convertible instruments to
meet the 9 percent threshold. The extra requirements are
calculated against banks&#8217; interconnectedness, size, complexity,
global reach, and the ability of other firms to take functions
if they fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Asian banks, including the Bank of China and
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) in Japan, also face the
additional capital requirements from the Basel Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismembered &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am a bit surprised to see Bank of China, but maybe we
are so Euro-American centric that we don&#8217;t recognize how big
other banks are,&#8221; Henry said. &#8220;I was also surprised to see
Dexia because it&#8217;s being dismembered.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra capital requirements will be phased in from 2016
through 2018. They will have to be met with core Tier 1 capital,
a definition of banks&#8217; reserves which includes mainly ordinary
shares and retained earnings. Banks that can&#8217;t meet the rules
face restrictions on dividends and bonus payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surcharge plans were approved by the G-20 in tandem
with measures to ensure the orderly winding down of failed banks
and to shield taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures &#8220;are aimed at reducing moral hazard so we can
deal with failures of large institutions without, hopefully,
having market disruption and without having to use public
money,&#8221; Draghi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans also include requiring systemically important
lenders to draw up so called living wills, showing how they
could be wound down should they fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING Groep NV (INGA)&#8217;s inclusion one of the 29 banks was &#8220;in
line&#8221; with expectations, said Carolien van der Giessen, a
spokeswoman for the bank. Wells Fargo  Co., Citigroup,
Unicredit Spa (UCG), and Santander, which were all also on the list,
declined to comment. UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
representatives couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower Ratios &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From the European perspective, we also had BBVA, Intesa
and possibly Standard Chartered on our list,&#8221; said Andrew Stimpson, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette  Woods Inc. in London.
&#8220;The question is whether it really matters given that the
national regulators are unlikely to allow banks to operate with
lower capital ratios given that they are systemically important
regionally and in Europe if not globally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of surcharge banks will be updated each November,
using fresh data. The banks that will initially face the extra
requirements will be those contained in the version of the list
published in November 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the omissions&#8221; from the list &#8220;reflect that the
method for calculating the surcharges is too focused on size
rather than interconnectedness,&#8221; Henry said. &#8220;The list should,
or ought to, change as Euro-American banks evolve and big
players rise from the emerging markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in the future could face surcharges of up to 3.5
percentage points if they grow bigger or more systemically
important, the FSB said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amit Rajpal, manager of global
financial funds for London-based asset manager Marshall Wace
LLP, comments on banking stocks in China and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajpal spoke in an interview with Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
Susan Li in Hong Kong today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the outlook for European banks: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current policy setting in Europe is likely to force
the southern European economies into a depression, not just a
recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The austerity that&#8217;s been imported there without any
currency flexibility, without any restructuring of debt load is
going to create a vicious combination, both for the sovereign as
well as for the banking system. Quite a few banks in Europe and
in southern Europe especially could be zeroed out from an equity
standpoint. They would have to be nationalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We&#8217;re potentially heading for a banking crisis in
southern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;For those economies, yes, implying Greece, Portugal,
potentially Italy and Spain, for those economies, it&#8217;s likely to
be much worse than 2008.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the outlook for China banking stocks: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;I&#8217;m actually very constructive on the Chinese banks. And
I see a 40 to 50 percent upside over the next six months or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The issue with the Chinese banks is that they&#8217;re policy-
driven. They underperform when policy is tightening. They start
to outperform when policy begins to ease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;By the end of this year, inflation will have dropped off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The Chinese authorities have won the property battle.
Property prices are no longer going up exponentially. And on top
of that you are seeing a slowing economy in the western world,
as we just discussed, which will force the Chinese policy makers
to start easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;These banks have priced in a hard landing already. So you
don&#8217;t have that hard landing, and they are trading at five to
six times forward earnings. They could actually head back to
eight to nine times forward earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Lastly, I&#8217;ve not seen any banking system face a credit
crisis when it&#8217;s so liquid. It&#8217;s always a lack of which exposes
the credit problem. That&#8217;s what happened in the subprime crisis.
That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening in Europe right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The Chinese banks are the most liquid banks on the
planet.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
