<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer wasn''t awarded his full bonus for fiscal
2011, citing lower-than-expected sales of phones based on the
company''s software and a drop in revenue in its Windows unit. </p>
<p>Ballmer, 55, received $1.38 million in pay, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That
included a bonus equal to 100 percent of his base salary, half
of the maximum he could have been awarded. Still, the board
noted in the filing that it regards Ballmer as underpaid. </p>
<p>While directors praised Ballmer for the company''s operating
income, progress on the next version of Windows and partnerships
with Facebook Inc. and Nokia Oyj, they voiced concerns about
lower sales of Windows software and the need to be quicker to
adapt the software to work on new devices. Ballmer has come
under fire from some investors, including Greenlight Capital
Inc. President David Einhorn, who used a May speech to call on
Microsoft''s board to replace him. </p>
<p>He deserves this bonus, said Kim Caughey Forrest, an
analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc. She said she''s
encouraged by the newest version of Windows, unveiled last
month. I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it''s a
pretty big light. They came a huge way for me. </p>
<p>At the same time, Ballmer didn''t deserve the maximum amount
because he and the board aren''t returning enough cash to
shareholders, said Caughey Forrest, whose firm manages about
$1.1 billion, including Microsoft shares. </p>
<p>Windows Revenue </p>
<p>The popularity of tablets such as Apple Inc.''s iPad
contributed to the decline in Windows revenue in fiscal 2011,
which ended June 30. Some shareholders may balk at Ballmer''s 100
percent bonus because they think the new Windows isn''t coming
fast enough, Caughey Forrest said. </p>
<p>You could posit Windows 8 and the whole reaction to the
phenomenon of tablets and mobile devices is a few years too
late, she said. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s board lauded Ballmer for making progress on the
company''s Bing search engine and Azure cloud software; the
successful release of the Kinect gaming device; the introduction
of the Office 365 Internet-based versions of its productivity
software; work toward the acquisition of Skype Technologies SA;
and a strong financial year. </p>
<p>Ballmer, who owns almost 4 percent of the company''s
outstanding shares, doesn''t get stock compensation at his own
request, the filing said. </p>
<p>For fiscal 2010, Ballmer also received 100 percent of a
maximum 200 percent bonus, with the board citing concerns about
new devices and a loss of market share in phone software. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, began extracting crude from a southern
California field using steam produced by a 29-megawatt solar-
thermal power plant. </p>
<p>BrightSource Energy Inc.''s system uses mirrors to focus
sunlight on a boiler at Chevron''s Coalinga, California, enhanced
oil recovery project, the solar company said in a statement
after extraction began today. </p>
<p>Solar-thermal technology companies such as BrightSource are
targeting industrial users in the oil-recovery and food-
processing industries as customers as well as power generation. </p>
<p>Mining and metals processing are also very promising,
especially in remote areas where power can also be generated
along with heat, Charlie Ricker, BrightSource senior vice
president of business development, said today in an interview. </p>
<p>The company is exploring the possibility of more plants
with Chevron and others, Ricker said. </p>
<p>This technology has the potential to augment gas-powered
steam generation and may provide an additional resource in areas
of the world where natural gas is expensive or not readily
available, Chevron Technology Ventures President Desmond King
said today in a company statement. The project produces about
the same amount of steam as one gas-fired steam generator,
Chevron said. </p>
<p>7,644 Mirrors </p>
<p>The Coalinga plant consists of 3,822 mirror systems, or
heliostats, each with two 10-foot (3-meter) by 7-foot mirrors
mounted on a 6-foot steel pole focusing light on a 327-foot
solar tower. Steam created by the heat is fed into the oil
reservoir, making it easier to bring to the surface. The system
began generating steam in August, Kristin Hunter, a spokeswoman
for Oakland, California-based BrightSource, said today in an e-
mail. </p>
<p>Areva SA''s Areva Solar, Seville, Spain-based Abengoa SA,
Erlangen, Germany-based Solar Millennium AG (S2M) and Burbank,
California-based eSolar Inc. are competing with BrightSource
with their own solar-thermal technology. </p>
<p>Glasspoint Solar Inc., based in Fremont, California, makes
solar steam generators for the oil and gas industry using
mirrored troughs inside of glasshouse enclosures to protect the
mirrors. </p>
<p>$16.3 Billion Market </p>
<p>Enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, fits very well with solar
temperatures, Glasspoint Vice President John O''Donnell, said
today in an interview. </p>
<p>Some 32 percent of California''s industrial and commercial
gas use is for EOR as its use grows in the U.S. and all over the
world, O''Donnell said. The state produces about 40% of its oil
using EOR and in a few years that will grow to 60%, he said. </p>
<p>The company can produce heat for EOR for about $3 per
million British thermal units, compared with about $4 for a
comparable natural-gas plant in the U.S. and between $10 to $12
for other conventional solar thermal technologies, O''Donnell
said. We are the only ones below natural gas right now in the
U.S. </p>
<p>According to BCC Research, the global market for enhanced-
oil-recovery technologies was $4.7 billion in 2009 and is
expected to grow at a 5-year compound annual rate of 28 percent,
reaching $16.3 billion in 2014, BrightSource said in its
statement. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. oil company. </p>

<p>General Maritime Corp. (GMR)''s bonds
plunged to the lowest level since at least August 2010 as the
U.S. oil-tanker owner is pressured by low freight rates and a
surplus of ships. </p>
<p>The company''s $300 million of 12 percent bonds maturing in
November 2017 tumbled 6.75 cents to 30 cents on the dollar as of
8:17 a.m. in New York, with yields soaring to 48.4 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities, issued
in November 2009, have tumbled from 96.5 cents on the dollar at
the start of the year. </p>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service cut New York-based General
Maritime''s credit grade to Caa3 last month citing the increasing
likelihood of a restructuring of credit facility terms or of the
debt capital structure because of weak sector fundamentals.
The company''s overreliance on its cash balance, which was
almost $59 million as of June 30, may cause it to fall out of
compliance with a minimum liquidity covenant,  Moody''s analysts
said in the Sept. 1 note. </p>
<p>The company is likely to have a difficult time achieving
positive operating cash flow, which could threaten its ability
to make cash interest payments, the Moody''s analysts wrote.
Weak freight rates will also pressure the market value of tanker
vessels, cutting another source of liquidity, they wrote. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s derivatives holdings
may have been misread by markets and investors, prompting the
bank to plunge more than 10 percent on Sept. 30, a Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) analyst wrote in a report. </p>
<p>Concern about Morgan Stanley appears to be driven by
confusion over a U.S. government report that said the company
had $1.78 trillion of outstanding notional value of derivatives
in the second quarter, Wells Fargo''s Matthew Burnell wrote Sept.
30. In reality, so-called netting agreements outlined in the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency report mean Morgan
Stanley''s derivatives positions totaled $457 million, according
to Burnell. </p>
<p>Net credit exposure is well below its peer group,
Burnell, who has a market perform rating on Morgan Stanley
shares, told clients. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 1 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $13.50 at 11
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading, after
climbing as much as 4 percent earlier today. The stock has
dropped 50 percent this year before today. </p>
<p>The cost of buying credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley,
which offer investors protection against a default by the New
York-based bank, rose to a mid-price of 515 basis points as of
10:28 a.m., according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The
price of insurance on Morgan Stanley is higher than Italian
banks Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) and UniCredit SpA (UCG) and means investors
have to pay $515,000 a year for every $10 million of debt they
are protecting, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>U.S. Aid </p>
<p>The firm, which owns the world''s biggest retail brokerage,
was the largest recipient of emergency loans from the Federal
Reserve during the financial crisis and also benefited from
capital provided by Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., now the biggest shareholder, and the U.S. Treasury, which
it repaid with interest less than a year later. </p>
<p>The largest Wall Street firms will start reporting third-
quarter results this month showing how they performed in a
market grappling with fallout from Standard  Poor''s downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating and concern Greece would default.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley warned investors in
September trading revenue may suffer. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive a suit against wireless-phone manufacturers and retailers
filed by customers who said the devices may cause illnesses,
including brain cancer. </p>
<p>The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said regulations issued by the Federal
Communications Commission preclude suits under state laws by
phone consumers. Most lower courts to consider the issue have
reached similar conclusions. </p>
<p>The suit before the justices, filed in Pennsylvania state
court, named more than a dozen companies and trade associations
as defendants. Those sued included Nokia Inc.; units of ATT
Inc. (T) and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.; and Verizon Wireless,
a joint venture between Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Vodafone
Group Plc. (VOD) </p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Stephen Breyer didn''t take part in today''s decision not to hear the
appeal. Both owned shares of Nokia as of Dec. 31, according
their most recent financial-disclosure report. </p>
<p>The appeal centered on the legal impact of the FCC
standards that govern radio frequency emissions and require pre-
authorization of phones sold or leased in the country. The
Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said those
rules, first adopted in 1996, preempt any additional
requirements under state law, including those imposed through
lawsuits. </p>
<p>The Obama administration joined the mobile-phone industry
in urging the Supreme Court to reject the appeal without a
hearing. </p>
<p>The case is Farina v. Nokia, 10-1064. </p>

<p>Iowa native Justin Bruch marveled at
the opportunity when Morgan Stanley (MS) called in late 2007 to
recruit him for an unusual assignment. </p>
<p>The New York bank, flush with $7.5 billion in fiscal 2006
profit -- the biggest in its history -- was going to be farming
11 parcels on the steppes of Ukraine. The commodities team
wanted Bruch, a redhead with meaty hands who''d been farming all
his life, to manage one of them. </p>
<p>Bruch saw a chance to dig into some famous dirt, Bloomberg
Markets magazine reports in its November issue. The former
Soviet republic has 30 percent of the world''s black soil, earth
so fertile Adolf Hitler had Nazi troops cart some back to
Germany during World War II. Wheat, corn, rapeseed and
sunflowers thrive there. </p>
<p>It''s like the prairie land that was broken in the Midwest
100 years ago, says Bruch, 34, who grew up on his family''s
2,500-acre (1,012-hectare) corn and soybean farm. The soil and
potential for crops that Ukraine has is the best in the world. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was primed for the investment. It was then
the second-largest U.S. securities firm by market value, after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive Officer John Mack was
pushing managers to take more risks. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s

the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, after earlier dropping to the
lowest level since December 2008. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley rebounded in the last half-hour of trading,
rising $1.54 to $14.01 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange

percent over the two previous days as concern intensified that
Europe''s debt crisis will infect U.S. bank balance sheets. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on New York-based Morgan Stanley fell
13 basis points to 570 basis points as of 4:01 p.m. in New York,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The contracts

October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

<p>Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. said it''s firmly
committed to its strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley.
Japan''s biggest banking group, which is the U.S. firm''s largest
common shareholder, repeated its commitment in a statement
yesterday in response to recent market volatility. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53,

<p>There has been an enormous amount of confusion and

<p>This is just pure gravy for Disney, said Wade Holden,
an analyst with the consulting firm SNL Kagan in Monterey,
California. Disney puts their films back in their vault, and

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley led gains in the cost to protect the debt of the biggest
U.S. banks as concern intensified that Europe''s sovereign
financial crisis will infect lender balance sheets. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased
48.9 basis points to 444.5 basis points at 9:50 a.m. in New
York, according to data provider CMA. Contracts on Morgan
Stanley, the New York-based owner of the world''s largest retail
brokerage, climbed 40.7 to 623.4 and those on Citigroup Inc. (C)
added 30.6 to 382, the data show. </p>
<p>Investor confidence in the creditworthiness of the banks
fell as Europe''s finance chiefs considered technical
revisions for a second Greek bailout, Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said today. The cost to protect
U.S. company debt rose for the third day to the highest since
May 2009 as Goldman Sachs cut its global growth forecasts and
predicted recessions in Germany and France. </p>
<p>When you get stuff blowing out a couple of hundred basis
points in the span of two days, it causes a lot of people to
seize up, said Michael Donelan, who oversees $4 billion of
bonds at Ryan Labs Inc. If you see equities continue to be
under pressure, it just leads to a further contagion-type
spreading to credit spreads, credit-default spreads, cash bonds
you name it everything''s interlinked. </p>

investors use to hedge against losses or speculate on
creditworthiness, added 1.4 basis points to a mid-price of 151.5

are worsening and the global economic recovery is faltering. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index slid as much as 2.2 percent
today to 1,074.77. The measure pared declines and was down 0.1
percent to 1,098.15 at 11:11 a.m. in New York after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank is ready

<p>Five-year credit-default swaps tied to Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. (BAC)''s senior debt climbed 27.9

<p>Credit swaps on Morgan Stanley are up from 305 basis points

month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.
They reached as high as the equivalent of 1,300 basis points on
Oct. 10, 2008, CMA data show. It now costs $623,400 annually for

<p>What you''ve got right now is bear raiders making a bet

<p>That will lead to funding problems and all the capital

is that it requires a number of leaps of faith, and those would
be that central banks are not going to support their commercial
banks and too large to fail is going to be ignored. And I don''t
think that''s going to be true. </p>
<p>Special Relationship'' </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. said yesterday it''s
firmly committed to its long-term strategic alliance with
Morgan Stanley (MS), reiterating its commitment to the firm in
response to recent market volatility. </p>
<p>The special relationship we have formed remains core to
our global business strategy, the Tokyo-based bank said in the
statement. Mitsubishi UFJ invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley
in October 2008 as the firm''s stock price collapsed after
Lehman''s bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is planning more acquisitions to fuel growth in its $22.5
billion software business, Senior Vice President Steve Mills
said in an interview. </p>
<p>IBM, which last week surpassed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become
the world''s second-most valuable technology company, after Apple
Inc. (AAPL), may spend $100 million to $300 million on targets, the
Armonk, New York-based company said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano has said he''s seeking
$20 billion in additional annual revenue by 2015. The company
aims to double or triple the pace of sales growth at companies
it acquires and looks for deals that will add to earnings within
two or three years, Mills said. </p>
<p>Everything''s got to fit, he said. No spurious, off-
to-the-side, unrelated things. </p>
<p>IBM generated $99.9 billion in sales last year. Software,
which had gross margins of 86.9 percent last year, is key to
IBM''s growth plans. </p>
<p>The company has made almost 50 software acquisitions since
2006 in such areas as data analysis, e-commerce, supply-chain
management and computer security, Mills said. More than half of
those have been in business-data analysis, where IBM says it has
spent $14 billion. The company expects those business-analytics
products to yield $16 billion in sales by 2015. </p>
<p>Hell of a Job'' </p>
<p>They''ve done a hell of a job, said Joel Achramowicz, an
analyst at Blaylock Robert Van LLC, an investment bank in
Oakland, California. IBM is making the right acquisitions at
the right time. </p>
<p>The company today said it agreed to buy closely held Q1
Labs, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based provider of security
intelligence software, for undisclosed terms. It also created a
new security systems division, to target the $94 billion market
for security software and services. </p>
<p>IBM fell $1.30 to $171.99 at 9:38 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had gained 18 percent
this year before today. </p>
<p>The company is unlikely to make large acquisitions, worth
$10 billion or more, Achramowicz said. He said he dropped
coverage of IBM in April partly because of the company''s
unwillingness to take on a very large deal. </p>
<p>That''s one of the reasons we got kind of bored with the
stock, he said. There are some big software companies out
there, which could augment IBM''s position. </p>
<p>In terms of the existing business, IBM''s done about
everything it can to maximize their operating model, he said. </p>
<p>SPSS, Cognos </p>
<p>Mills said the company looks for deals that can augment
products it already owns. For example, the statistical-analysis
software company SPSS Inc., which IBM bought in 2009 for about
$1.2 billion, complements the company''s 2007 acquisition of
Cognos Inc., whose software creates executive dashboards for
quickly perusing business data. </p>
<p>SPSS lends Cognos more robust statistics capabilities, and
Cognos helps SPSS users visually depict their data, he said.
That''s accelerated SPPS''s growth since IBM bought it, Mills
said. </p>
<p>When you do that, you know you''re going to get a lift,
he said. </p>

<p>Commodity prices may advance 20
percent over the next year as growth in emerging markets offsets
the impact of the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and a slowdown
in developed economies, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>The bank reiterated an overweight recommendation on
commodities over the next 12 months, while remaining neutral
in the near term, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a
report today. Oil and copper forecasts for 2012 were reduced. </p>
<p>Commodities in the three months to Sept. 30 had the worst
quarter since 2008 on concern that there may be another global
recession as the European debt crisis escalated. The world
economy will probably expand 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with
an earlier prediction of 4.2 percent, Goldman''s economists Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson wrote in an Oct. 3 report. </p>
<p>With recent GDP revisions by our economists falling
hardest on Europe but emerging market growth expectations still
relatively solid, we continue to believe that demand growth in
2012 will be sufficient to tighten major commodity markets,
Currie wrote. We now see a flatter upward trajectory for
commodity prices. </p>
<p>Brent oil traded in London may average $120 per barrel next
year, down from an earlier call of $130, Goldman said. The
bank''s 2012 estimate for three-month copper on the London Metal
Exchange was lowered to $9,200 per metric ton from $10,790. </p>
<p>Cutting Calls </p>
<p>Goldman joins BNP Paribas SA and Commerzbank AG in cutting
calls for the metal that some investors see as a barometer for
economic activity. The bank also trimmed the 12-month target for
copper to $9,500 per ton from $11,000, while zinc''s target was
reduced to $2,400 per ton from $2,700. </p>
<p>Sentiment regarding the economic outlook and the European
sovereign-debt problems are likely to remain poor in the near
term, presenting further downside risk to prices as well as our
forecasts, Currie wrote. Still, the lower prices should lure
buyers from China, the world''s largest copper consumer, back
into the market, he wrote. </p>
<p>Copper for three-month delivery declined for a fifth day in
London, falling as much as 4 percent to $6,712 per ton, before
trading at $6,935 at 2:58 p.m. in Singapore. Brent crude, which
sank 11 percent last month, traded at $101.36 per barrel. </p>
<p>No Recession </p>
<p>Barclays Capital also said the world economy may avoid a
recession as emerging markets expand, which should limit further
losses for commodities, according to a report today from
analysts including Kevin Norrish. </p>
<p>A steep rise in production costs over the past few years,
plus a much greater degree of supply risk due to geopolitical
and weather shocks, all suggest there should be a much greater
degree of fundamentals-driven price resilience in many commodity
markets, Norrish wrote. </p>
<p>Weather disappointments should keep risks for soybeans
skewed to the upside, according to the Goldman report, which
expects them to trade at $13 per bushel in 12 months. The
November-delivery contract last traded at $11.70 per bushel. </p>
<p>As soybean demand has become more sensitive to consumption
in China, the commodity should be more resilient to a slowdown
in developed markets as long as Chinese income growth remains
robust, Currie wrote. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said it may raise as
much as 385 billion yen ($5 billion) by selling uridashi bonds
to Japanese investors sometime in the next two years. </p>
<p>The New York-based firm can sell bonds anytime between Oct.
12 this year and Oct. 11, 2013, according to a shelf
registration filed to Japan''s Finance Ministry today. Uridashi
bonds are debt issued outside of Japan for sale mainly to
Japanese retail investors. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank is turning to Japanese individuals for
funding at a time when its share price is falling and the cost
of insuring its bonds is surging amid concern that Europe''s debt
crisis will infect the global banking system. Market volatility
prompted Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306), the biggest
shareholder, to issue a statement yesterday saying it is
firmly committed to their alliance. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s biggest retail
brokerage, sold uridashi bonds in Japan at least twice in the
past three months, raising 46.5 billion yen in August and 51.5
billion yen in September as part of a 200 billion yen program
announced in April. Natsuo Nishio, a Tokyo-based spokesman,
declined to comment on the timing for any additional sale. </p>
<p>Sales of yen-denominated uridashi bonds declined 25 percent
to 120.9 billion yen in August from a year ago, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Relies on Debt </p>
<p>Shares of Morgan Stanley have fallen 54 percent this year
amid speculation that Europe''s debt crisis will erode trading
income and damage balance sheets of U.S. banks. Morgan Stanley
relies on debt markets for funding because it has relatively low
deposits. The bank got less than 10 percent of its funding from
depositors as of June 30, compared with JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
which got more than half from retail deposits, SEC filings show. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley in
October 2008 as the U.S. firm''s stock price collapsed after the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The banks agreed in
April to convert $7.8 billion of preferred shares into common
stock and completed the conversion in June, making the Japanese
lender Morgan Stanley''s largest common shareholder with a 22.4
percent stake. </p>
<p>Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ asserted its support for Morgan
Stanley yesterday as the cost to protect the U.S. firm''s debt
surged to the highest level since the weeks after Lehman
collapsed. Contracts on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the world''s
largest retail brokerage, soared 92 basis points to a mid-price
of 583 basis points yesterday in New York, the highest since
October 2008, according to London-based data provider CMA. </p>
<p>The largest Wall Street firms will start reporting third-
quarter results this month showing how they performed in a
market grappling with fallout from Standard  Poor''s downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating and concern Greece would default.
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley warned investors in September
trading revenue may suffer. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
global growth forecast for this year and next, predicting
recessions in Germany and France as the European economy stalls
and the risk of a contraction in the U.S. grows. </p>
<p>The world economy will probably expand 3.8 percent this
year and 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with earlier predictions
of 3.9 percent for 2011 and 4.2 percent for next year, Goldman
Sachs economists Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson wrote in an Oct.
3 report. The company lowered its forecast for earnings growth
in Asia excluding Japan in a separate report today. </p>
<p>Europe''s worsening sovereign debt woes and the threat of a
U.S. recession have roiled global stock markets, erasing about
$13 trillion from equities since May. The debt crisis has
infected the European banking system, making financial
institutions wary of lending to each other and pushing overnight
deposits with the European Central Bank last week to the highest
in more than a year. </p>
<p>The further deterioration in the economic and financial
situation in the Euro area has led us to downgrade our global
GDP forecast significantly, the economists said. Over the
next few quarters, we now expect a mild recession in Germany and
France, and a deeper downturn in the Euro periphery. </p>
<p>Euro Region </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs predicts the Euro region will expand 0.1
percent in 2012, down from an earlier forecast of 1.3 percent.
It expects growth of 1.6 percent for this year. Goldman also
lowered its end-2011 forecast for the euro to $1.38 per dollar
from an earlier projection for it to trade at $1.40. </p>
<p>The ECB has been forced to purchase sovereign bonds to
prevent the crisis from spreading to larger euro nations, and is
providing banks with unlimited liquidity for up to six months
against eligible collateral as governments struggle to restore
investor confidence in the 17-member region. </p>
<p>The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to ease its
liquidity policies further this month as a result of an increase
in financial risk, Hatzius and Wilson said. The ECB will also
probably cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1
percent by December, they said. </p>
<p>The increase in spillovers from the Euro area, primarily
via tighter financial conditions, is the primary reason why we
have also downgraded our forecasts for the U.S. further, the
economists said. We now see the risk of a renewed U.S.
recession at around 40 percent. </p>
<p>Flagging U.S. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy will expand 1.7 percent this year and 1.4
percent in 2012, Goldman Sachs predicts. It had earlier
estimated a 2 percent growth rate for the world''s largest
economy next year. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve announced last month that it would
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries, a so-called Operation Twist, in an
effort to further reduce borrowing costs and strengthen the
flagging U.S. economy. </p>
<p>We expect additional easing of monetary policy beyond the
Operation Twist'' announced recently, although this may not come
until sometime in the first half of 2012, Hatzius and Wilson
said. In addition, the market''s focus on changes in the Fed''s
guidance on future policies -- including a greater emphasis on
the employment part of the dual mandate'' and/or a temporarily
higher inflation target -- is likely to intensify. </p>
<p>Downside Risk'' </p>
<p>Asia excluding Japan stocks faces a downside risk of 10
percent to 15 percent, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Timothy Moe
wrote in a report today. </p>
<p>Earnings per share may grow 10 percent this year and
increase 7 percent next year, lower than an earlier prediction
of 11 percent growth for both years, according to the analysts.
They also cut their 12-month forecast for the MSCI Asia Pacific
excluding Japan Index to 480 from 530. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs analysts also lowered their forecasts for 2011
and 2012 oil prices. Crude prices will end this year at $112.50
a barrel, compared with a previous estimate of $119.50. It will
be $122.50 a barrel at the end of 2012, compared with an earlier
forecast of $138.50, according to the report. </p>
<p>The oil market continues to destock as prices anticipate
a potential crisis, the economists said. If the crisis does
not occur, the oil market risks running into pressing supply
constraints, requiring sharply higher prices than we currently
forecast to force demand in line with supplies. </p>

<p>General Atlantic LLC, the U.S.
private equity firm that manages $17 billion, is studying four
acquisitions in India of as much as $200 million each, according
to Ranjit Pandit, its head of investments in the country. </p>
<p>The planned deals are in the Internet, logistics, financial
and infrastructure industries and will be in the $100 million
to $200 million range, Pandit said in an interview in Mumbai
yesterday. </p>
<p>General Atlantic, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, plans to
step up investment in India after a stock market rout reduced
valuations. The firm, which has typically spent about $50
million to $75 million per deal, will also look at acquisitions
of privately held companies, said Pandit. </p>
<p>We are looking at actively pushing a lot of money into
India, said Pandit. We are looking to do fewer transactions
but bigger transactions. He called deal sizes of $100 million
to $200 million the sweet spot for General Atlantic. </p>
<p>India''s private-equity market heated up this year as the
stocks slump shuttered the market for public equity and loans
got pricier, prompting companies to look for other sources of
capital. Private-equity firms have announced $5.52 billion of
deals in the country so far this year, up from $3.79 billion for
all of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>General Atlantic has invested about $900 million in India
since 2002. It owns stakes worth a combined $1.7 billion in
eight Indian companies, according to Pandit. </p>
<p>Deals Closing </p>
<p>Pandit said he expects two of the four deals the firm is
working on in the country will close this year, while the other
two will likely be completed in early 2012. The executive said
he may also consider deals of as much as $400 million in the
South Asian nation. </p>
<p>General Atlantic paid about $90 million for about 3.7
percent stake in IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB), a privately owned lender
based in Mumbai. The stock is down 4.1 percent so far in 2011,
the third-best performance among 14 companies on the BSE Bankex
Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The private-equity firm''s total investment in IndusInd Bank
may reach  $100 million to $200 million, according to Pandit. </p>
<p>Pandit said General Atlantic may sell stakes in information
technology companies, without naming any of them. The firm owns
shares in companies including Genpact Ltd. (G), Hexaware
Technologies Ltd. (HEXW) and Infotech Enterprises Ltd. (INFTC) General Atlantic
hasn''t decided whether to sell the holdings in public markets or
to other companies, said Pandit. </p>
<p>If we look at our information technology portfolio in
India, without commenting on any specific company, it''s a group
of companies which we held for some time, Pandit said. We
may be reaching a point of diminishing return from them. </p>
<p>He said Hexaware has a lot of options and General
Atlantic will look at all those options, without elaborating. </p>
<p>General Atlantic, founded in 1980, is setting up a
Singapore office, and is considering investing in Vietnam,
Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan, Pandit said. Abhay Havaldar, who
has been with the firm since 2002, will lead the Singapore
office, he said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. will offer television
service to Xbox Live users through a partnership with Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), a bid to use TV
programming to attract more customers to its game console. </p>
<p>The Xbox service will offer content from almost 40
television and entertainment companies, Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft said today in a statement. In addition to
Verizon and Comcast, the partners include ATT Inc., Time Warner
Inc.''s HBO, Sony Corp.''s Crackle and the BBC. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer wants to lure more
families and casual gamers to the Xbox by making it an
entertainment center, challenging TV services from Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and Google Inc. (GOOG) Today''s announcement furthers a move started in
2008, when Microsoft added Netflix Inc.''s video streaming and
the music service Last.fm. </p>
<p>The vision of the Xbox back in 2001 was that it would be
an entertainment hub, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at
Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Until they launched Netflix
on Xbox Live, it really wasn''t that. Today we go from Netflix
and Last.fm to 40 vendors. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 55 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $25.89 today on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 7.2 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Network Stations </p>
<p>The Xbox, first released a decade ago, accounted for 48
percent of all current-generation consoles in the U.S. between
2005 and June of this year, according to Microsoft data. Xbox
Live, an Internet service with free and paid versions, already
has more than 35 million members. </p>
<p>Microsoft didn''t announce any deals with U.S. network TV
stations, though Comcast and other partners are quite likely
to add that kind of content in the future, said Ross Honey,
general manager of content acquisition for Microsoft''s
Interactive Entertainment business. Some network TV content can
already be viewed on Xbox using the Hulu LLC service. </p>
<p>Other partners announced today include Lovefilm in the
U.K., a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc.; Spain''s Telefonica SA (TEF);
and Mexico''s Grupo Televisa SA. </p>
<p>Microsoft also plans an application for its Windows Phone
mobile software that will turn phones into an enhanced remote
control for the Xbox service. Users will be able to search for
programs and then set them to play on the Xbox, as well as view
additional information about the program, Honey said. </p>
<p>Apple, Google </p>
<p>The company intends to offer apps that work with the Xbox
TV service for Apple''s iOS software as well, Pachter said,
citing a Microsoft analyst briefing yesterday. Honey declined to
comment on those plans, except to say that Microsoft has been
expanding some products to both iOS and Google''s Android. </p>
<p>Some programming will require customers to be subscribers
to Microsoft''s Xbox Live pay service. Other content, such as the
BBC and other public television, will work with the free version
of Xbox Live, Honey said. </p>
<p>Customers won''t have to know which channel or provider
offers the show or movie they want. Instead they can say or type
the name of the program and Xbox''s Bing search service will
return all options for viewing it, including ones the customer
doesn''t currently subscribe to, Honey said. </p>
<p>TV service efforts by companies such as Apple and Google
have gotten little traction with customers. Apple Chief
Executive Officer Tim Cook has said that his company''s Apple TV
product remains a hobby business. In April, Logitech
International SA cut the price of its Google TV device, citing
slow initial sales. </p>
<p>Microsoft has some advantages over those companies, Pachter
said. It already has a big presence in customers'' living rooms:
A total of 55 million Xbox 360 machines have been sold
worldwide. The company also can draw on its search engine, its
Kinect motion-and-voice sensor technology and the new content
agreements. </p>
<p>Each of those guys has a strength, but nobody has
hardware already in the living room, with voice command that
works,'' he said. Microsoft has a big advantage. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) isn''t anywhere close
to making an offer for Yahoo! Inc. and senior executives of the

familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Microsoft does plan to review Yahoo''s financial
information, due to be circulated as soon as this week, said one
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
deliberations are private. Yahoo doesn''t regard Microsoft as a
serious bidder, said a person familiar with Yahoo''s thinking. </p>
<p>Yahoo shares surged 10 percent today after Reuters reported
that Microsoft may make an offer. Yahoo is fielding inquiries
from potential buyers after ousting Chief Executive Office Carol Bartz and starting a review of its strategic options last month.
Yahoo rose $1.46 to $15.92 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading, the biggest gain since October 2008. </p>
<p>Yahoo turned down a $47.5 billion offer from Microsoft in
2008, rankling investors. The two companies later forged a 10-
year agreement to outsource Yahoo''s search engine to Microsoft,
diminishing the chance of a full acquisition. Since then, Yahoo
has struggled to invigorate sales growth and beat back
competition from Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. </p>
<p>Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman at Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo, and Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Multiple Parties'' </p>
<p>Yahoo, the biggest U.S. Web portal, said in a September
memo to employees that its advisers have fielded inquiries from
multiple parties interested in unspecified options. Last
week, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma said he''s
very interested in buying Yahoo, which owns about 40 percent
of his company. </p>
<p>The private-equity firm Silver Lake also has discussed a
possible bid for Yahoo, part of a deal that may include Alibaba
and Russia''s Digital Sky Technologies, people with direct
knowledge of the matter have told Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The Silver Lake group contacted Yahoo and its advisers in
recent weeks to inform them of a possible offer, said one
person, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. The discussions are still at an early stage and it''s
not certain that the group will agree to make a bid, the people
said. </p>
<p>Before Yahoo''s stock surge today, the shares had declined
13 percent this year. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
biggest oil company, is offering for sale a 25 percent stake in
an offshore Brazilian oil prospect after drilling two wells that
failed to strike crude. </p>
<p>The prospect, known as Block BM-S-22 in the Santos Basin,
may hold as much as 1.5 billion barrels of recoverable crude,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in an offering document on
Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)''s oilfield-marketing website. One of Exxon''s
partners on the project, Hess Corp. (HES), last year wrote down the
value of two of the three wells already drilled at the prospect
after they came up dry. </p>
<p>The block lies beneath a layer of salt below the sea floor
in the same region that yielded discoveries such as Tupi, a 6.5
billion-barrel field now known as Lula, Exxon said in the
offering document. </p>
<p>Exxon owns 40 percent of the prospect and is the operator
of the project. Hess of New York holds a 40 percent stake, and
Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) owns the rest. Hess
expensed its share of costs for the Exxon-drilled Sabia-1 and
Azulo wells during the fourth quarter of 2010, Gregory Hill,
Hess'' executive vice president of worldwide exploration, said
during a Jan. 26 conference call with analysts. </p>
<p>Agreement </p>
<p>Exxon and partners Hess and Petrobras, as the Brazilian oil
company is known, agreed to seek a fourth co-venturer for
the project, Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for Exxon''s exploration
unit, said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>We remain interested in future opportunities in Brazil,
McGinn said in the e-mail. </p>
<p>In the offering document, Exxon said an investor must fund
the drilling of one well in the prospect in exchange for the 25
percent stake. The site has already received drilling permits
from the Brazilian government, Exxon said. A data room is being
set up in Houston for prospective buyers. </p>
<p>This opportunity should appeal to companies looking to
gain access to the significant pre-salt play in Brazil, Exxon
said in the offering document. </p>

<p>Protesters assembling today outside a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) building in New Jersey were met by
almost as many security guards and police officers as Occupy
Wall Street demonstrators sought to single out the bank. </p>
<p>About 50 people gathered at a Goldman Sachs building
surrounded by metal barricades in Jersey City, where 30 to 40
officers and guards were waiting. The investment bank''s
employees watched from windows as the crowd chanted We are the
99 percent before breaking into discussion groups. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has too many people in government, and too
much influence, said Pat Meany, 53, who arrived on his bicycle
and wore clothes painted with fluorescent colors and peace
symbols. It seems like they''re looking out for America''s rich.
It''s not for the good of all Americans. </p>
<p>In Trenton, about three dozen protesters were initially
outnumbered by members of the media for a simultaneous gathering
at the World War II memorial across from the Statehouse. The
crowd grew to about 75 people within an hour as participants
took turns to speak about corporate greed, the influence of
money on politics, war and the environment. </p>
<p>There is no reason why this country should be the way it
is, said Heath Weaver, 46, of Toms River, a self-employed
videographer who came to the Trenton event with a sleeping bag.
Instead of people coming together we''ve been fighting against

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger will take on the added role of chairman next
year at the theme-park and entertainment company, part of a plan
to appoint a new CEO in 2015. </p>
<p>Iger, 60, will succeed John E. Pepper at the annual meeting
in March, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a
statement. Pepper, 73, a former chairman and CEO of Procter 
Gamble Co., has led the board since 2007. </p>
<p>Disney didn''t name a successor for Iger, who oversaw the
acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel in the past five years and will
become executive chairman in 2015. The company will combine the
top roles for the first time since 2004, when CEO Michael Eisner
was stripped of the chairmanship after a failed proxy fight
waged by Roy Disney, Walt''s nephew. The company wanted to keep
Iger and have a smooth transition, Pepper said. </p>
<p>I''m totally surprised that they would do this again,
said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware''s
John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. Why stick
your head in a blender? An executive just shouldn''t be in charge
of the board that monitors him. </p>
<p>Two of Disney''s top executives, Tom Staggs and Jay Rasulo,
swapped roles at the end of 2009, with Chief Financial Officer
Staggs assuming the job of parks chief and Rasulo becoming CFO,
in a move designed to bolster the experience of both men. </p>
<p>Race to the Top? </p>
<p>Iger set up a race between the two by having them switch
jobs that ought to help him make that decision, said David Joyce, a Miller Tabak  Co. analyst in New York who recommends
buying Disney shares. They are both 20-year veterans at the
company and have strong operational backgrounds. </p>
<p>Disney''s largest business is media networks, led by Anne Sweeney and George Bodenheimer, co-chairmen. The division, which
includes ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channel, had $17.2 billion in
fiscal 2010 sales and contributed two-thirds of Disney''s $7.6
billion in operating income. </p>
<p>Disney fell 33 cents to $31.70 at the close in New York and
has declined 15 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company also extended Iger''s contract through 2016 and
is increasing his salary to $2.5 million annually from $2
million now. The new agreement includes a $12 million annual
cash bonus target, as well as options and restricted stock
valued at $15.5 million, Disney said. His current agreement ends
in 2013. </p>
<p>Strong Performer'' </p>
<p>Iger has made some forward thinking moves that have made
the company a strong performer, Joyce said in an interview.
He was the first to embrace digital technology and positioned
the company well with the Pixar and Marvel acquisitions. </p>
<p>The bonus is based on performance yardsticks that include
operating income, return on capital, after-tax free cash flow
and earnings per share, the company said. The stock awards will
be based on total shareholder return and earnings per share,
relative to the SP 500. </p>
<p>In the announcement, Disney said total shareholder return
under Iger is five times higher than the SP 500 index since he
took over as CEO. </p>
<p>The board is delighted that the company has been able to
secure the longer-term continuation of Bob''s unique blend of
experience and leadership skills, Pepper said. Iger will
continue to serve the long-term interests of shareholders. </p>
<p>As part of the transition, Disney will appoint an
independent lead director when Iger becomes chairman, according
to the statement. </p>
<p>Iger was named president of Disney in 2000 and succeeded
Eisner as CEO in October 2005. He led the $8.06 billion purchase
of the Pixar animation studio in 2006 and the $4.2 billion
acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2010. He previously
headed Disney''s ABC television unit. </p>

Harrington and Christine Harper" date="Oct 07, 2011  4:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-07/morgan-stanley-credit-swaps-plunge-for-fourth-day-phoenix-says.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Credit Risk Plunges for Fourth Day, Swaps Show</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>The cost to protect Morgan Stanley (MS)
bonds against losses dropped for the fourth day as concern eased
that its balance sheet will be impaired by Europe''s sovereign
debt crisis and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analysts said investors
should wager on the bank''s creditworthiness. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley fell 43 basis points
to 431 basis points as of 3:49 p.m. in New York, according to
prices from London-based data provider CMA. The five-year
contracts have declined from 650 basis points on Oct. 4, the
highest since October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Creditor confidence in New York-based Morgan Stanley is
rebounding after crumbling for two straight weeks amid
speculation the firm faced losses tied to Europe''s fiscal
imbalances that has sent borrowing costs on governments from
Greece to Italy to records and triggered drops in the stocks of
the region''s lenders, led by French banks. </p>
<p>We believe concerns regarding its European swap and loan
exposures appear overdone, as the firm signaled its net
exposures to France and the periphery are modest if not
immaterial, Goldman Sachs analysts and strategists including
John Marshall , Louise Pitt and Daniel Harris said in a note
today. </p>
<p>The analysts recommended investors sell protection with
one-year contracts tied to Morgan Stanley debt that were quoted
at about 640 basis points. That''s equivalent to about $640,000
on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>The surge in credit swaps doesn''t reflect actual credit
fundamentals for a bank a with a $182 billion global liquidity
pool at the end of the second quarter, they said. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. </p>
<p>Cross-Border Exposure </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had about $28 billion of cross-border
exposure to French banks at the end of June before accounting
for offsetting hedges and collateral, according to a filing with
the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Cross-border outstandings include cash deposits,
receivables, loans and securities, as well as short-term
collateralized loans of securities or cash known as repurchase
agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. </p>
<p>While Morgan Stanley hasn''t updated those figures, the
total risk to France and the country''s lenders is less than $2
billion when collateral and hedges are included, Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York estimated in a
Sept. 23 note to clients. The bank''s current exposure to the
nation and its banks is zero after hedges and collateral, a
person close to the firm said Sept. 30. </p>
<p>Relative to Peers </p>
<p>Disclosures by the company when it announces third-quarter
earnings this month are likely to calm fears, causing credit
swaps to narrow relative to peers, the Goldman Sachs strategists
said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s credit swaps through yesterday were
trading 164 basis points wider than the average of the six-
biggest U.S. banks, according to prices from London-based data
provider CMA. The gap reached 226 basis points at the close of
trading on Oct. 3, the widest since October 2008. </p>
<p>Swaps on other banks also decreased today. Contracts on
Citigroup Inc. (C) fell 10 basis points to a mid-price of 290 basis
points, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) dropped 5 to 394 and swaps on
Goldman Sachs declined 19 to 355, CMA prices show. </p>
<p>A benchmark gauge of U.S. company credit risk snapped three
days of declines as Fitch Ratings downgraded Spain and Italy,
overshadowing positive jobs data in the U.S. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index , which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.7 basis point to a mid-
price of 139.6 basis points as of 3:58 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. The measure
had earlier declined as much as 2.6. </p>
<p>Payrolls Data </p>
<p>The swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has dropped
from 150.1 on Oct. 3 as investor speculation grew that Europe''s
leaders are progressing in stemming the debt crisis. </p>
<p>September''s payrolls data is a light in the middle of the
tunnel for the credit markets, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. It''s not enough to ease investor anxiety
permanently, but it should provide a catalyst for some relief to
these wider spreads. </p>
<p>Payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised 57,000
increase the prior month that was more than originally
estimated, Labor Department data showed today in Washington. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is trying to

bonds backed by the team''s future television revenue, newsletter
Asset-Backed Alert reported, without saying where it got the

<p>The sale, which Goldman Sachs bankers proposed to the team
this week, could raise between $75 million and $100 million, the

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) shares are likely to
rally when the firm reports earnings this month as management
eases concern that profit will be hurt by risks linked to
European sovereign debt, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is likely to provide more details on its
sovereign risk and improved liquidity, helping shares to rally
to 70 percent of tangible book value from their current 57
percent, analysts at New York-based Goldman Sachs wrote in a
note today. They recommended investors buy $16 October calls and
sell short-dated credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, which
is also based in New York. </p>
<p>Investors'' concerns that the firm has large European swap
exposures are overdone, analysts and strategists including
John Marshall and Louise Pitt said in the note. They made the
recommendation even as they said third-quarter earnings are
likely to be weak. Goldman Sachs left its neutral rating
unchanged. </p>
<p>The risk/reward balance of MS shares at current levels
appear tempting, the analysts said, referring to the company
by its stock ticker. MS should be able to ride out the current
market duress assuming global macroeconomic indicators do not
materially decay. Moreover, concerns regarding its European swap
and loan exposures appear unwarranted, as the firm has signaled
its net exposures to France and the periphery are modest if not
immaterial. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 80 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $14.38 at
12:40 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares gained 22 percent the three days through yesterday, the
largest three-day climb since May 2009. That rally left the
shares down 44 percent this year. An increase to 70 percent of
tangible book value would imply a jump to $18.63. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the
world''s biggest retail brokerage, fell 54 basis points to 420 as
of 11:07 a.m. in New York, according to broker Phoenix Partners
Group. The five-year contracts have declined from 650 basis
points on Oct. 4, the highest since October 2008, the month
after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won European Union
approval to buy Skype Technologies SA in an $8.5 billion deal
adding the world''s most popular Web-calling service to the
biggest software maker. </p>
<p>The deal won''t harm competition in the region, partly
because of the presence of rivals such as Google Inc., the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>The investigation found that the parties'' activities

said. However, the commission considers that there are no

<p>ExxonMobil Corp. said it''s responding
to an oil sheen observed Oct. 7 near its Billings, Montana,
refinery, about 15 miles from an Exxon pipeline spill in July. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil has no pipelines or similar oil containing
equipment in close proximity to the leak, said Rachael Moore,
a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based company, in an e-mail
today. The company has no reason to believe its facilities
were the source of the oil, she said. </p>
<p>A spill response team from the refinery laid boom to limit
potential environmental damage, and the small amount of oil
is contained in a side channel of the river, Moore said. </p>
<p>The company is investigating the source of the sheen, she
said. Moore declined to provide an estimate of how much oil is
in the sheen. </p>
<p>On July 1, Exxon''s Silvertip pipeline in Montana ruptured,
spilling as much as 1,000 barrels of crude into the Yellowstone
River. The cleanup effort, which is being led by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, has involved more than 600
people and is expected to cost the company an estimated $42.6
million, Exxon has said. </p>

<p>Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)''s chairman and chief executive officer, canceled a
planned appearance tomorrow at Barnard College, whose president
joined the company''s board four months ago. </p>
<p>Mr. Blankfein''s office informed us that he would be
unable to deliver his lecture as planned, due to an unavoidable
scheduling conflict, Kathryn Kolbert, director of Barnard''s
Athena Center for Leadership Studies, said in an e-mailed
statement. We expect that his talk will be rescheduled for a
future date. </p>
<p>The Power Talk with Blankfein was cancelled because he
must be in Washington D.C. that evening, the Athena Center
said on its website. </p>
<p>Debora L. Spar, president of the women-only liberal-arts
school, joined Goldman Sachs''s board at a meeting in London on
June 16, her 48th birthday. Blankfein, 57, and his wife Laura, a
Barnard College alumna and former trustee, donated $50,000 to
the New York-based college in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31,
2010, their nonprofit foundation''s federal tax filings show. </p>
<p>Students at Columbia University, across the street from
Barnard, had organized a week-long protest against Blankfein
called School the Squid, which included discussions about
corporate greed and power abuse, the student-run Columbia Daily
Spectator reported on its website today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before it converted to a bank in
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., set a pay record in 2007 when it awarded
Blankfein a $67.9 million bonus. </p>
<p>A 2009 article by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone magazine
labeled the company a great vampire squid wrapped around the
face of humanity. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C)
led U.S. banks higher in New York trading after European leaders
pledged to deliver a plan to stem the debt crisis that has led
to concerns about global lenders'' balance sheets. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley climbed $1.05, or 7.4 percent, to $15.29 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, bringing
its increase during the last week to 23 percent. Citigroup
jumped 7.6 percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) rose 6.4 percent,
helping to lead the 81-company Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials
Index to a 5.1 percent gain. </p>
<p>The SP 500 has rebounded about 9 percent from a 13-month
low on Oct. 3 amid optimism that European leaders will succeed
in taming the debt crisis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday they will
deliver a plan to recapitalize European banks and address the
Greek debt crisis by the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit. </p>
<p>Every company in the SP Financials Index climbed today.
The index has declined 22 percent this year. Morgan Stanley,
based in New York, is down 44 percent this year. Bank of
America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has dropped 53
percent, while New York-based Citigroup lost 44 percent. </p>
<p>Merkel said European leaders will do everything
necessary to ensure that banks have enough capital. Belgium
also said today it will buy part of Dexia SA and provide
security for depositors as part of a plan to rescue the lender. </p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said last week
that U.S. financial firms have strengthened and there is
absolutely no chance of another collapse like Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services company, rose to a
record, surpassing the mark set in July. </p>
<p>IBM rose 2.3 percent to $186.62 at the close in New York,
giving it a market value of $222.9 billion. The price topped the
$185.21 it reached July 19. </p>
<p>It''s attractive as a safer, less volatile investment in
tech in very turbulent times, said Ed Maguire, an analyst at
Credit Agricole Securities USA in New York who rates the shares

<p>IBM, which went public in 1915, has gained 27 percent this

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), trying to reverse
disappointing sales for its Windows Phone, is counting on
Samsung Electronics Co. and other manufacturing partners to step
up retailer incentives and boost in-store promotions. </p>
<p>Both Samsung and HTC Corp. have committed to increasing
marketing budgets for the phones, said Andy Lees, president of
Microsoft''s mobile unit, in an interview. While manufacturers
will determine how the money is spent, some of it will probably
go toward spurring retail staff to tout Windows Phone models, he
said. New handsets with the new Windows Phone 7.5 will go on
sale in the coming weeks, Lees said. </p>
<p>Since the release of the previous version last October, the
Windows Phone has missed the company''s sales expectations, and
Microsoft has continued to lose ground to Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone
and devices based on Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android. Microsoft needs to
do a better job of marketing the new software, which is much
improved, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. </p>
<p>From a technical perspective, it really does put them on
par with the other competitors, but a lot of times Microsoft
gets it right with the technology and then fumbles the marketing
message, he said. Mobile-phone retailers haven''t cooperated in
the past, Gartenberg said. If you went to a store they showed
you anything other than a Windows Phone. If you asked for a
Windows Phone, they tried to talk you out of it. </p>
<p>Retail Rules </p>
<p>Microsoft is especially reliant on the carriers'' retail
salespeople in the U.S., where more than 80 percent of phones
are sold by stores owned by mobile operators, Lees said. In
other countries, a larger percentage of handsets are sold by the
phone makers themselves. He didn''t specify what form the
incentives might take. </p>
<p>Windows Phone 7.5, also known as Mango, was released last
month to existing Windows handset customers. In addition to more
aggressive marketing, Microsoft''s partnership with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)
will help sales, Lees said. Nokia announced earlier this year
that it would base its handsets on Windows Phone software, a bid
to reinvigorate its smartphone strategy. Nokia directly or
indirectly controls more than 6,000 stores, Lees said. </p>
<p>Gartner forecasts that Microsoft will become the No. 2
smartphone operating system in 2015, with market share of 20
percent. That would vault it past Apple''s iOS, with Android
remaining in the top spot. Achim Berg, head of Windows Phone
marketing, said at a September conference in Berlin that the 20
percent share may be a conservative estimate. </p>
<p>First Quarter </p>
<p>Next year, Microsoft will account for 11 percent of the
market, up from 5.6 percent this year, Gartner said in an April
report. Lees declined to forecast numbers himself, except to say
he expects market share to rise starting in the first quarter of
2012. </p>
<p>Manufacturers plan to produce a Windows phone that uses the
high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution, or
LTE, in the not-too-distant future, Lees said. That will
make mobile carriers more eager to promote the Windows Phone. </p>
<p>Cheaper models also will be produced, giving a boost to the
operating system, Lees said. While handset makers and the
carriers determine prices and subsidies, consumers should see
Windows Phone devices for less than $100 in the U.S., he said. </p>
<p>The stars are really starting to align for us, Lees
said. </p>
<p>The new software, which better integrates apps, search and
phone features, received positive reviews from AllThingsD,
Gizmodo and Bloomberg''s Rich Jaroslovsky. </p>
<p>Movies, Maps </p>
<p>Search for a movie, and the phone brings up a synopsis,
running time, showings nearby, and lets you buy tickets. It also
lists apps related to movies. It has indoor maps so you can find
the parking lot at the mall where the theater is located. A
local app gives you nearby restaurants and if you''ve downloaded
OpenTable, there''s a reserve button right there. </p>
<p>The search key brings up the option to scan book or album
covers for product matches. It will also scan foreign language
text to translate a French restaurant menu. The software can
listen to a piece of music and identify it. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 2.6 percent to $26.94 at close in New York.
The stock has dropped 3.5 percent this year. </p>

<p>The cost to protect against losses
on Morgan Stanley (MS) debt dropped to the lowest in almost three
weeks after European leaders pledged this week to ensure the
region''s banks have enough capital to withstand the sovereign
debt crisis. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley bonds fell 41.7
basis points from Oct. 7 to 392.9 basis points, the lowest since
Sept. 21, according to data provider CMA. The New York-based
bank''s contracts have declined from 582.7 on Oct. 3, the highest
since October 2008. Bond markets in the U.S. were closed
yesterday for the Columbus Day holiday. A benchmark gauge of
U.S. corporate credit risk tumbled to the lowest in three weeks. </p>
<p>The drop in swaps prices signals that investors are
regaining some confidence in the banking system since German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Oct. 9 that the region''s leaders
will do everything necessary to ensure that European banks
are capitalized after meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Morgan Stanley''s swaps had led a surge in contracts on
U.S. banks amid concerns that an escalating crisis in Europe
would trigger losses globally. </p>
<p>We have valuations in the market now that reflect the
binary outcomes we''re facing as investors: whether we''re going
to see a blowup in Europe or whether we''re going to see an
austerity program in the U.S. or whether were going to somehow
keep on keeping on with gridlock in Washington and the euro zone
keeping together, Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of
Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, which manages $17
billion, said in a webcast today. </p>
<p>Markit CDX Index </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 4 basis points from
Oct. 7 to a mid-price of 135.3 basis points, according to Markit
Group Ltd. The index has fallen from 150.1 basis points on Oct.
3, the highest since May 2009. In London, the Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose
0.8 for the day to 179.1. </p>
<p>Both indexes typically decrease as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said third-quarter profit rose as proceeds
from a refinery sale and the strengthening U.S. dollar more than
offset slowing oil demand. </p>
<p>Chevron''s net income in the period that ended Sept. 30 was
comparable with second-quarter results, when the company
reported a profit of $7.73 billion, exceeding the $3.77 billion
earned during the third quarter of 2010. Chevron announced
selected third-quarter results in a statement distributed via
Business Wire. The company, based in San Ramon, California, is
scheduled to release full third-quarter results on Oct. 28. </p>
<p>Chevron sold a U.K. oil refinery and related storage
terminals and marketing assets in Ireland to Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)
in August for $1.73 billion as part of Chief Executive Officer
John Watson''s effort to shed lower-profit fuel-making units. The
company said today that it recorded a $500 million third-quarter
gain from the sale. </p>
<p>Chevron''s oil and natural-gas production during July and
August fell 5 percent from the full third-quarter of 2010 to the
equivalent of 2.6 million barrels a day, the company said. The
declines stemmed from a pipeline incident in Thailand and repair
work to installations in the Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan and the
U.K. </p>
<p>A U.K. tax increase on oil and gas production prompted
Chevron to take a $150 million catch-up charge during the
third quarter and will cost an additional $40 million during the
current period, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. of Irving, Texas, is the largest U.S. oil

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the top-ranked
fixed-income research firm on Wall Street, upgraded its
recommendation on high-grade corporate debt to neutral as
the assets attract more money from investors. </p>
<p>The bank, which cut the debt to underweight on June 15,
said valuations are more attractive than low-yielding U.S.
Treasuries, especially after the Federal Reserve''s Operation
Twist program announced last month, analysts led by Eric Beinstein wrote in a note today. Inflows to the asset class,
high cash balances and solid corporate credit fundamentals
also fueled the outlook shift, according to the note. </p>
<p>Year-end tends to be when investors review their asset
allocations, and we believe HG U.S. corporate bonds will be
deemed about the best asset class to own heading into the low
growth and potentially recessionary environment of 2012,
analysts from the New York-based bank wrote. </p>
<p>Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury have fallen to
about 2.1 percent from 2.97 percent four months ago as Europe''s
sovereign debt crisis worsens and after the Fed decided to
replace short-term Treasuries in its $1.65 trillion portfolio
with long-term bonds in a policy known as Operation Twist.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have increased to
4.13 percent from 3.72 percent on June 15, increasing the allure
of such securities. </p>
<p>The analysts, ranked No. 1 investment-grade strategists in
Institutional Investor magazine''s annual poll, didn''t assign an
overweight recommendation to high-grade corporate debt,
citing growth slowdowns in the U.S. and Europe that will lead to
heightened event risk, according to the note. They also
cited the lack of a solution to the European debt crisis, asset
sales by European banks and limited allocations to financial
debt versus non-financial. </p>
<p>A neutral recommendation at JPMorgan means the position
is expected to perform in line with benchmarks over the next
three months, according to today''s note. </p>
<p>Investment-grade bonds are rated Baa3 or higher by Moody''s
Investors Service and BBB- and above by Standard  Poor''s. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM), the biggest U.S.
automaker, is looking at India, Association of Southeast Asian
Nations member states and Africa as sites for expanding
production to tap growing demand in emerging markets. </p>
<p>If there were two areas that I thought were open to
additional investment, those would be India and the ASEAN
area, Tim Lee, GM''s president of international operations,
said in an interview in Dubai. </p>
<p>India''s economy, the third-largest in Asia after China''s
and Japan''s, is forecast to grow 7.8 percent in 2011 and 7.5
percent next year, the International Monetary Fund said in
September. India will probably in the long term become Detroit-
based GM''s third-biggest market after the U.S. and China, Lee
said. The company builds vehicles in India in a joint venture
with Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp. </p>
<p>There is a need to look at more production facilities,
but this is yet to be done, Lee said in the interview
yesterday. </p>
<p>The U.S. automaker increased sales in India by 17 percent
in September to 10,112 vehicles, with growth propelled by the
diesel-powered Chevrolet Beat small car, GM said on Oct. 3. The
automaker has estimated that it accounted for 3.4 percent of
India''s car market in the first nine months of this year. </p>
<p>We expect to grow our share dramatically in India over
the next 12 to 18 months, Lee said. </p>
<p>The executive, who was recently on a visit to Cairo and is
headed to Johannesburg, said Africa is an emerging growth area
that would likely support some additional capacity. </p>
<p>South Africa, where GM builds vehicles in Port Elizabeth,
and Egypt, where it has a plant in the Cairo suburb of Maadi,
account for 70 percent of the U.S. company''s sales in Africa,
the manufacturer said on Nov. 22, when it announced a
reorganization of operations in the region. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stock analysts
took top honors in Institutional Investor magazine''s rating of
the best U.S. financial researchers for the second consecutive
year, winning by the narrowest margin of any firm since 2002. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, had 40
top-ranked analysts in the survey, edging out Barclays Plc (BARC) and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC)''s Merrill Lynch, which tied for second
place with 39 each, the publication said today in a statement.
The number of top analysts at Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) rose to 25 from
18, the largest increase, as Germany''s biggest lender climbed to
eighth place from ninth last year. </p>
<p>Institutional Investor''s 40th annual All-America Research
Team ranking tallied ratings from 3,500 fund managers and
analysts at more than 1,000 investment firms overseeing $10.7
trillion of U.S. equities. New York-based JPMorgan, Barclays and
Bank of America held the top spots even as fewer of their
analysts made the cut. </p>
<p>The competition is fierce, Thomas Johnson, the
magazine''s research editor, said in the statement. In a period
of unprecedented economic uncertainty, from sovereign debt
crises in Europe and political unrest in the Middle East to
gridlock in Washington, it''s not surprising that investors would
flock to banks with global platforms. </p>
<p>UBS Gains </p>
<p>JPMorgan had 46 analysts on the list in 2010 to capture the
top ranking for the first time, snapping a two-year winning
streak for Barclays Capital, the brokerage arm of London-based
Barclays, which placed second with 43 analysts. Barclays owns
the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which
ranked No. 1 in each of the previous five years. Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America ranked third in 2010. </p>
<p>UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland''s biggest bank, climbed to tie Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) in fourth place with 43 analysts, up from fifth
last year. New York-based Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. was the
only firm in the top 10 to fall, slipping to ninth place from
sixth with 22 analysts, down from 25 last year. </p>
<p>Winners include John Pitzer, who covers technology for
Zurich-based Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan''s Steven Alexopoulos,
who took the top spot for Banks/Midcap analysts. </p>

     The following firms ranked highest in the survey:

<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world''s biggest payment networks, were sued by a trade group
representing operators of automated teller machines over claims
the firms fix prices and suppress competition among ATM
networks. </p>
<p>The group, in a lawsuit filed today in federal court in
Washington, accused Visa and MasterCard of antitrust violations
for restricting independent ATM operators from charging varying
prices for customers using alternative networks such as STAR,
Shazam Inc. or TransFund. Under a uniform agreement, the
operators can''t charge less for transactions over a network that
competes with Visa and MasterCard, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is the latest assault on the firms, which are
grappling with the effects of new Federal Reserve rules that
reduced the fees charged to merchants for debit-card purchases.
Visa and MasterCard processed cash transactions totaling at
least $547 billion in the U.S. last year, including withdrawals
from ATMs, according to company filings. </p>
<p>The ATM restraints prevent ATM operators from offering
their customers a discount or benefit for completing a
transaction over a network that is less costly to the ATM
operator, the group contended in its complaint. Consumers
cannot be rewarded for using a lower cost and more efficient
network. </p>
<p>Trade Group </p>
<p>The allegations were made by the National ATM Council Inc.,
a trade group based in Jacksonville, Florida, and 13 operators
of ATMs in nine states. The plaintiffs, who are asking to
represent the 350 non-bank ATM operators nationwide, are seeking
triple damages. </p>
<p>James Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard, based in
Purchase, New York, declined to comment, saying the company
hadn''t been served with the suit. Will Valentine, a spokesman
for San Francisco-based Visa, declined to comment on the filing. </p>
<p>The ATM operators claim that the overwhelming majority
of so-called PIN debit cards used for ATM transactions are
branded by Visa or MasterCard. In order to accept one of these
cards, an ATM operator must have access to the Visa and
MasterCard networks. Independent or non-bank operators must be
sponsored by a financial institution that is a member of the
Visa and MasterCard networks. </p>
<p>Service Fee </p>
<p>Visa, MasterCard and their member banks require the service
fee for any transaction at an ATM to be no less than the
amount charged at that ATM or terminal for a Visa or MasterCard
transaction, even for transactions that don''t use the
companies'' networks, the lawsuit alleges. </p>
<p>By restricting their ability to attract customers to
lower cost ATM services through lower prices, the ATM restraints
put a competitive straightjacket on ATM operators, the lawsuit
claims. </p>
<p>Visa climbed 66 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $91.17 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. MasterCard fell 0.5
percent to $327.99. </p>
<p>The case is National ATM Council v. Visa Inc. (V), 11-1803,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley may consider dropping their status as bank holding
companies to avoid expenses tied to the Volcker rule, said David Hilder, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP. </p>
<p>The rule in its current form would impose costs on lenders
and drive capital to non-bank market makers, causing the two New
York-based firms to consider whether to stop being banks, Hilder
said in a note yesterday, when four regulatory agencies issued a
298-page draft of the rule for public comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the biggest U.S.
securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks. </p>
<p>The regulators have proposed a massive new compliance
burden on banks to prove that their market-making activities are
just that, and not proprietary trading in disguise, wrote
Hilder, who''s based in New York. If these regulations are
adopted in anything close to their proposed form, there will be
large additional costs imposed on banks as market-makers that
will not apply to market-makers not owned by banks. </p>
<p>David Konrad, a bank analyst at KBW Inc., said Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) are unlikely to change their status as
bank holding companies to dodge the Volcker restrictions. </p>
<p>Protecting Deposits'' </p>
<p>If they tried to do that, Congress would amend the rule
to say systemically important banks rather than bank holding
companies, Konrad said in a phone interview. This is part
protecting deposits, but also part too-big-to-fail. I don''t
think there''s any interest from the investment banks in doing
that, and I don''t think it would serve that purpose. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said
Jan. 21, 2010, the same day President Barack Obama announced his
support for the Volcker rule, that it was unrealistic to
imagine the firm won''t be a federally supervised bank. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley made modest profits
from pure proprietary trading, which is why they willingly shut
down those desks, David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities,
wrote in a note today. The rule''s draft indicates regulators
won''t interfere with customer flow trading, he wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs may be hurt by provisions that limit
investments in hedge funds and private equity, Trone wrote. Had
those restrictions been in place in recent years, they would
have cost the firm about $700 million, or 9 percent, of annual
earnings, he wrote. </p>
<p>Crown Jewel'' Businesses </p>
<p>The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, was
included in last year''s regulatory overhaul to rein in risky
trading that helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The central
bank, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency worked with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on the draft issued yesterday. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley climbed 45 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $15.84
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Goldman Sachs
advanced 2.5 percent to $99.11. </p>
<p>Increased regulation and capital rules may mean the largest
banks have to split off some crown jewel businesses, said
Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University''s Stern
School of Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. </p>
<p>You have to ask which parts of the business are they
simply not going to be able to continue to do or maintain the
talented people who do it because those guys would have better
options if they left the firm and went to a hedge fund, Smith
said. You don''t want to be left with the third team running
your expensive market-making trading desk. </p>
<p>It''s too soon to say whether banks affected by the rule
would have to break up to remain competitive and the costs of
the proposal are likely to shift some business to smaller
players, Glenn Schorr, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst, wrote in
a note today. Companies and investors are likely to push back
during the comment period to dial back some parts of the
rule, he wrote. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Morgan
Stanley''s Mark Lake declined to comment. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O''Neill said conventional quantitative easing may
not be enough for the U.S. and U.K. economies and more
targeted policies are needed to boost confidence and growth. </p>
<p>It''s not obvious to me that conventional QE in the U.K.
or the U.S. has got that much bang for its buck, O''Neill said
in an interview with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television''s
The Pulse program in London today. More imaginative QE or
forms of specific targeted easing, probably involving more
infrastructure or doing something to get bank funding spreads
down, would be more likely to get a stronger result. </p>
<p>His comments were echoed by former Bank of England policy
maker Sushil Wadhwani, who said today that global central banks
need to do more creative forms of monetary policy to prevent
the global economy slipping into a recession. </p>
<p>The Bank of England restarted asset purchases last week,
its first expansion of policy since 2009, citing risks to the
recovery from the euro-area debt crisis, while data today showed
the unemployment rate rose to the highest since 1996 in the
quarter through August. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve
announced last month an operation to replace $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries,
aiming to reduce borrowing costs and spur the recovery. </p>
<p>Less Impact </p>
<p>The Bank of England''s new stimulus will have less effect
this time than it did last time, former Bank of England policy
maker Charles Goodhart said on Bloomberg Television''s Last
Word with Andrea Catherwood today. The real problem isn''t
the level of official interest rates, but it''s the difficulties
the banks have in getting funding and the spreads the banks
charge. </p>
<p>He said there is a very strong case for trying to
provide more assistance to small businesses and first-time home
buyers. Referring to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne''s credit-easing proposal, he said more innovative
ways to help boost credit are necessary. </p>
<p>Wadhwani, founder of Wadhwani Asset Management LLP, said
global policy makers need to do three things if they are to
prevent a relapse, </p>
<p>First, they need to get firms better access to credit,
he said in an e-mailed note co-written with Michael Dicks.
Second, they need to help boost demand. And, third, they need
to deal with the euro crisis. </p>
<p>Direct Approach </p>
<p>Wadhwani recommended U.K. authorities take a more direct
approach to boosting demand by issuing every adult a voucher
that can be spent in the next three months. That is surely a
more effective form of quantitative easing than the central
bank buying gilts, he said. </p>
<p>He also said the U.K. and the U.S. can''t play the
innocent bystander and plead with Europe to sort out its mess. </p>
<p>Better surely to recognize both the global scale of the
problem and the political constraints that are currently
limiting European policy makers'' room for manoeuvre, and act in
accordance, he said. </p>
<p>The U.K. unemployment data also showed that jobless claims
rose 17,500 in September, a seventh straight increase. Prime
Minister David Cameron said the figures were very
disappointing, adding that the government won''t abandon its
budget-reduction plan. </p>
<p>I think it would be a dangerous thing to rule out the
U.K. economy deteriorating further given what the evidence is
showing, O''Neill said. It might be because of the fiscal
tightening that is coming home to roost. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may say profit
slid 10 percent in the third quarter, the biggest drop in more
than two years, as Europe''s credit crisis and the U.S. debt-
ceiling debate spoiled optimism for an economic recovery. </p>
<p>Tomorrow''s report from the New York-based bank will
probably show earnings of $3.96 billion, according to the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That
compares with $4.42 billion a year earlier and $5.43 billion in
the three months ended June 30. </p>
<p>Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s
investment bank, braced investors last month for a 30 percent
drop in trading revenue from the second quarter, when the
company generated $5.5 billion from that business. He said fees
from investment banking would tumble almost 50 percent to $1
billion. About $2 trillion in corporate bond issues came to
market in the first half before volume plummeted to about $550
billion in the third quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>We expect another challenging quarter for the universal
bank group, Frederick Cannon and David Konrad, analysts at
Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc. in New York, wrote in an Oct. 10
research note. Declining markets and elevated volatility is
expected not only to slow investment-banking and trading
revenues but also to cause negative marks in investments. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the first of the major U.S. banks to report
third-quarter earnings, will be a barometer for the rest of the
industry and the broader U.S. economy, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Reserve Releases </p>
<p>CEO Jamie Dimon, 55, led the bank to a record $17.4 billion
in net income last year, the most of any U.S. bank. Earnings
were buoyed by the release of $7 billion in reserves back into
income as the U.S. economy improved, a benefit that may have
continued in the third quarter and helped soften the blow,
Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
wrote in an Oct. 7 research note. </p>
<p>At the same time, legal costs to settle lawsuits and other
claims against the company''s soured mortgage book will continue
to erode earnings, the analysts said. </p>
<p>The bank, whose $2.25 trillion in assets as of June 30
makes it second to Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), is the safe play for investors in the sector,
Cannon and Konrad said. </p>
<p>Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia and analyst with FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia, instead recommends that investors either
stay on the sidelines or place their bets on better
capitalized banks such as Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. and U.S. Bancorp, he said in an Oct. 10
research note. </p>
<p>Citigroup, Wells Fargo </p>
<p>New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S.
lender, may report a profit of $2.5 billion when it releases
results on Oct. 17, and Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco,
will probably say it earned $3.87 billion when it announces
results the same day, the survey of analysts shows. Bank of
America may report a profit of $2.69 billion on Oct. 18 while
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) may say it earned $45.3 million. </p>
<p>Slowing economic growth and heightened worries about
European sovereign debt have weighed on bank stocks all year.
None of the 24 members of the KBW Bank Index has posted a gain
in 2011, and the worst performer, Bank of America, is down 52
percent through yesterday. A jump in borrowing costs at some
banks, including New York-based Morgan Stanley, subsided last
week as investors became more optimistic that European Union
policy makers would solve the sovereign debt and banking crisis. </p>
<p>Political Incompetence'' </p>
<p>American and EU politicians reached the limit of their
incompetence many months ago, Christopher Whalen, founder of
Institutional Risk Analytics, said in a research note yesterday.
We see the lack of business volumes and political uncertainty
going into 2012 as far more troubling trends in terms of non-
interest revenue sources for all financials. </p>
<p>Frederic Janbon, the global head of fixed-income at Paris-
based BNP Paribas SA, said in an interview that financial
markets have become almost as dysfunctional and illiquid as
they were in 2008. </p>
<p>The market is very difficult to trade and highly
sensitive to political news, Janbon said. Political risk has
moved to the forefront of people''s minds when looking at the
U.S. and Europe. Since July, anticipation of global economic
slowdown has fundamentally changed this situation. Anxiety has
now spread to all credit products. </p>
<p>Loan growth in the U.S. remains stagnant and net interest
margins, which measure the profit margin on lending, continue to
decline. Bank loans and leases fell $2.1 billion to $6.829
trillion from August 2010 through Sept. 28, according to Federal
Reserve data. </p>
<p>Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$2.09 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a U.S. producer
of steelmaking coal, jumped 13 percent in New York after the
U.K.''s Independent reported that Anglo American Plc (AAL) and BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) may bid for the company. </p>
<p>The potential bidder may be advised by JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the London-based newspaper said,
without citing anyone. Brazil''s Vale SA (VALE3) and Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA may also may bid, the newspaper said. The shares
rose to $75.22, the biggest gain in five weeks. </p>
<p>Walter investor Audley Capital Advisors LLP said in July
that the Birmingham, Alabama-based company should explore a sale
because it lacked the leadership to take advantage of an
unprecedented market opportunity after coal prices jumped.
Walter appointed Walter J. Scheller III as Chief Executive
Officer on Sept. 12. He replaced interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard
and followed Keith Calder, who resigned as CEO in June after
telling the board he had differing opinions concerning
management philosophy. </p>
<p>Demand from steelmakers in China and flood-related supply
disruptions in Australia have driven prices for coal to record
highs. Low-volatility coking coal traded at $270 a ton,
Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy Publishing said in a report
last week. </p>
<p>Emily Blyth, a spokeswoman for London-based Anglo, declined
to comment, as did Ruban Yogarajah, a spokesman for Melbourne-
based BHP, and Paul Blalock, a spokesman for Walter. </p>
<p>Coal MA </p>
<p>Vale doesn''t respond to market rumors, an official at the
company''s press office who asked not to be named citing Vale
policy, said in a telephone interview. No one at CSN returned
calls and e-mails seeking comment. </p>
<p>Buying Walter could allow Anglo to replace assets it might
lose in Chile, Dominic O''Kane, an analyst at Liberum Capital
Ltd. in London, said today in a note. Chilean copper producer
Codelco said yesterday it plans to exercise an option to buy as
much as 49 percent of Anglo''s unit in the South American
country. </p>
<p>There were $20.5 billion of takeover offers for coal miners
valued at $100 million or more announced in the first nine
months of 2011, compared with $10.4 billion in the year-earlier
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Alpha Natural Resources Inc. bought rival U.S. coal
producer Massey Energy Co. in June for $7.1 billion. Peabody
Energy Corp. and ArcelorMittal agreed in August to pay A$4.8
billion ($4.9 billion) for Australia''s Macarthur Coal Ltd.,
which like Walter produces metallurgical coal. </p>
<p>Walter acquired Vancouver-based Western Coal Corp. in April
for C$5.3 billion ($5.2 billion). Calder was the former CEO of
Western Coal. </p>
<p>Walter operates mines in Alabama, West Virginia, British
Columbia and Wales. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led
increases in the cost of protecting the debt of U.S. companies
on renewed concern that Europe''s fiscal crisis will continue to
derail the economic recovery and after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
reported a drop in profit. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs added 39 basis points
to 340 basis points, according to data provider CMA. Contracts
on JPMorgan climbed 8 to 142 and those tied to Morgan Stanley,
owner of the world''s largest retail brokerage, increased 29 to
387, the data show. </p>
<p>A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk rose from
the lowest level in three weeks after JPMorgan said revenue at
its investment-banking unit fell 13 percent from the second
quarter amid concern that Greece would default and the U.S.
economic recovery was stalling. That overshadowed a report that
applications for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S.
fell more than expected. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the biggest U.S. banks tend to
swing with market sentiment, acting as a bizarre bellwether,
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit group at DoubleLine
Capital LP, which has $17.5 billion in assets under management,
said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. I still don''t
get a sense that this is over yet in terms of the bank and
finance risk out there. </p>
<p>Contracts on Citigroup Inc. (C) increased 22 basis points to
250 basis points and contracts on General Electric Co. (GE)''s finance
arm General Electric Capital Corp. added 32 to 275. Those on San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) climbed 7 to 140.5. </p>
<p>Six Largest Banks </p>
<p>Even with today''s rise, contracts tied to the debt of the
six largest U.S. banks have decreased to 270 basis points from
360 basis points on Oct. 4, CMA data show, as European leaders
signaled progress in stemming the region''s debt crisis and
investor concern eased that bank balance sheets would be
infected by sovereign defaults. That''s equivalent to an average
of $270,000 to protect $10 million of debt for five years. </p>
<p>JPMorgan swaps have dropped from 185 and Morgan Stanley (MS)
credit swaps declined from 650 basis points during the period. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said third-quarter earnings fell to about $3.1
billion, or 73 cents a share, not including a 29 cents
accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on the same basis a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today. Net income was
$4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with the average per-
share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92 cents in a survey of
30 analysts by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Company Risk Gauge </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 132.6 basis points at 4:56 p.m. New York time,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, snapped two days of
declines after dropping from 150.1 on Oct. 3. </p>
<p>Investor confidence in company creditworthiness dropped
even as applications for unemployment insurance payments
decreased 1,000 in the week ended Oct. 8 to 404,000 Labor
Department figures showed. Economists forecast 405,000 claims,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 4.8 percent in New York
trading after the company reported that profit declined on a
slump in investment banking and trading. </p>
<p>JPMorgan dropped $1.60 to $31.60 at 4:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter earnings at the New York-
based lender fell to about $3.1 billion, or 73 cents a share,
not including a 29-cent accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on
the same basis a year earlier. </p>
<p>Revenue at the investment-banking unit slid 13 percent from
the second quarter as concern that Greece would default and U.S.
lawmakers would fail to raise the debt ceiling roiled markets.
The firm said the division will face similar market conditions
for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>There was a lot of noise in this number, said Paul Miller, a former examiner with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets. When you look
at the core number and back out the benefit of securities gains
and tax benefit, it''s starting to look like a mid-70 cent
number for earnings per share, he said. </p>
<p>Net income was $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared
with the average per-share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92
cents in a survey of 30 analysts by Bloomberg, the New York-
based company said today. </p>
<p>Underlying Business </p>
<p>The debt-valuation accounting gain does not relate to the
underlying operations of the company, Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, 55, said in a statement. Dimon said on a conference
call with journalists that the after-tax effect of the
accounting change was about 60 percent of the total gain for the
quarter. </p>
<p>Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), estimated
JPMorgan would post $350 million in gains from the change in
debt valuation. U.S. accounting rules require the adjustment
when the value of a company''s debt declines, under the theory
that a profit would be realized if it were repurchased at a
discount. </p>
<p>Third-quarter revenue declined 0.2 percent to $23.8 billion
from a year earlier. Fixed-income and equity-markets revenue
rose to $4.75 billion from $4.3 billion, driven by more than
$900 million in debt-valuation adjustments. </p>
<p>Jes Staley, CEO of JPMorgan''s investment bank, braced
investors last month for the drop in trading revenue from the
second quarter, when the company generated $5.5 billion from
that business. The investment bank''s staff dropped to 26,615 in
the third quarter from 27,716 in the second quarter, a decline
of 4 percent. </p>
<p>Deposit Growth </p>
<p>Total deposits surged 21 percent from a year earlier, to
$1.1 trillion. </p>
<p>The company''s credit-card division, which posted losses for
all of 2009, generated almost 20 percent of JPMorgan''s net
income for the quarter. The investment bank accounted for 38
percent. </p>
<p>Fewer consumers fell behind on their credit-card payments
in the third quarter. Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal
of future write-offs, fell to 2.9 percent from 4.6 percent in
the same quarter in 2010 and 3.0 percent in the second quarter.
Write-offs dropped to 4.7 percent from 8.9 percent the prior
year and 5.8 percent in the previous quarter. </p>
<p>The slower decline in delinquency rates explains why the
company reduced its loan-loss reserve by only $170 million,
Dimon said on a conference call with analysts. </p>
<p>Mixed Results </p>
<p>If you look at delinquencies, low rates, first-time
delinquent, all that kind of stuff, they''re kind of mixed. It
could very well improve again, but it''s flattened out, Dimon
said. </p>
<p>Brennan Hawken at UBS Investment Research in New York was
expecting a reserve release closer to $1 billion. </p>
<p>The worry is that they are seeing something in credit that
has caused them to stop releasing reserves, Hawken said in an
interview. That means there could be some trend going on that
has caused them to be cautious. </p>
<p>Retail banking, which includes home loans and checking
accounts, earned $1.16 billion, compared with $383 million
during the second quarter and $716 million a year earlier. The
division benefited from a $370 million reduction in loan-loss
provisions to $1.03 billion. </p>
<p>Net Interest Margin </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which has benefited from record low costs of
funding mortgages and other assets, faces a squeeze on its net
interest margin -- the difference between what it pays to borrow
money and what it gets for loans and on securities. </p>
<p>The bank''s margin narrowed to 2.66 percent from 2.72
percent the previous quarter and 3.01 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Trading overall in the third quarter is going to be
challenged amid dislocations both home and abroad, Jason Goldberg, a senior bank analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
said in an interview yesterday. During the quarter, you saw
both a slowdown in investment-banking activity and more
challenging trading conditions amid a spike in volatility fueled
by concerns in Europe. </p>
<p>Slowing economic growth and heightened concern about
European sovereign debt have weighed on bank stocks all year.
The KBW Bank Index (BKX) had dropped 28 percent this year, and the
worst performer, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), is down 53 percent. A
jump in borrowing costs at some banks, including New York-based
Morgan Stanley, subsided last week as investors became more
optimistic that European Union policy makers will find a
solution. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the first of the major U.S. lenders to report
third-quarter results. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, may report a
profit of $2.49 billion when it releases results on Oct. 17, and
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, will probably say it earned
$3.87 billion when it announces results the same day, the
surveys of analysts shows. Bank of America may report a profit
of $2.73 billion on Oct. 18. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) persuaded a
judge to throw out shareholders'' claims that the investment
bank''s compensation system improperly rewarded employees for
taking risks that hurt the firm''s stock price. </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock concluded
yesterday that Goldman Sachs''s board acted properly in setting
up a pay plan for the fifth-biggest U.S. bank. The judge
dismissed a consolidated investor lawsuit claiming the plan
wrongly awarded billions of dollars in bonuses to executives and
employees, including Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, even as the
firm''s market value declined by $50 billion since 1999. </p>
<p>Delaware law provides corporate directors and officers
with broad discretion to act as they find appropriate in the
conduct of corporate affairs and in the exercise of their
business judgment on behalf of the corporation, Glasscock
wrote in a 67-page opinion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007,
faced criticism from politicians and labor unions for its
compensation practices after getting taxpayer aid during the
financial crisis. </p>
<p>In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the New York-based company''s compensation pool in the first
six months of this year, according to its website. That was 9
percent less than in the same period in 2010 as revenue tumbled
11 percent. </p>
<p>Limited Value'' </p>
<p>The complaint fails to present facts that demonstrate
that the work done by Goldman''s 31,000 employees was of such
limited value to the corporation that no reasonable person in
the directors'' position would have approved their levels of
compensation, Glasscock said. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, the operator of Philadelphia''s bus and rail network
and a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argued that the firm''s board
should be held accountable for not properly overseeing the
compensation system and employees'' wrongful conduct. </p>
<p>Septa''s lawyers said in court filings that Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year, while the firm settled U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission claims that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>$550 Million Penalty </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million, the largest
penalty ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to
resolve claims that marketing materials about the investments
had incomplete information. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007 as the U.S.
housing market faltered, without disclosing that a hedge fund
helped pick the underlying securities and then bet against the
investment vehicles, the SEC said in the suit Goldman settled.
The bank didn''t admit wrongdoing as part of the accord. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the Delaware ruling. </p>
<p>Last month, a New York judge threw out another pension
fund''s suit that challenged Goldman Sachs''s compensation plan
for providing millions of dollars in bonuses to executives. </p>
<p>New York State Supreme Court Justice Bernard J. Fried
dismissed suits filed by the Security Police  Fire
Professionals of America Retirement Fund and investor Judith A.
Miller on Sept. 21, according to court dockets. </p>
<p>The Delaware case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Shareholder Litigation, CA5215, Delaware Chancery Court

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reduced its
investment-bank workforce by almost 4 percent in the third
quarter and cut employee compensation costs 28 percent as the 
division grappled with fallout from the European debt crisis. </p>
<p>The investment bank had 1,101 fewer employees at the end of
September than three months earlier and will continue to shrink
its staff of 26,615, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55,
told reporters on a conference call after releasing third-
quarter earnings today. </p>
<p>While the bank isn''t planning layoffs, we always trim our
sails, Dimon said. You''ll see the headcount coming down as
some of these systems get rolled off to reduce costs. The firm
will be squeezing a little bit here and squeezing a little bit
there to trim the workforce by about 1,000 additional people,
or maybe a little bit more in the next 18 months, he said. </p>
<p>Jes Staley, CEO of JPMorgan''s investment bank, braced
investors last month for a drop in third-quarter revenue as the
European debt crisis roiled markets, and the bank today said it
may face similar challenges in the year''s final months. A pay
reduction won''t likely drive out top performers amid such a
difficult environment, said Michael Holland, founder and
chairman of New York-based investment firm Holland  Co. </p>
<p>When things get better they will participate, Holland
said in an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg
Television''s InsideTrack. When things are crummy, as they
have been for the last number of quarters, they participate in
the downside as well. A number of the star performers who are
getting paid less will stick around, and I think it''s exactly
the right way to run the business. </p>
<p>Pay Per Employee </p>
<p>The investment bank generated a $1.64 billion profit in the
third quarter, compared with $2.06 billion in the prior three
months, according to figures posted today on the New York-based
company''s website. Revenue at the unit fell 13 percent from the
second quarter to $6.37 billion. </p>
<p>In the first three quarters, the unit set aside $7.71
billion, or 2 percent less than a year earlier, even as it
generated 10 percent more revenue. The expense, which includes
salaries, bonuses and benefits, was enough to give each of the
division''s employees $289,611. For the same period last year,
the unit set aside $7.88 billion to pay traders, dealmakers and
other personnel, or $298,866 for each of the 26,373 people on
staff as of Sept. 30, 2010. </p>
<p>Compensation costs fell to $1.85 billion in the third
quarter, compared with $2.56 billion in the second quarter.
Average compensation per employee dropped to $69,510 from
$92,510, the bank said. Companywide, staff expanded 3 percent to
256,663. </p>
<p>Less Revenue Spent </p>
<p>Staley set aside 35 percent of the division''s revenue for
pay in the first nine months, down from 37 percent in the same
period a year earlier, excluding a 2010 U.K. bonus tax,
according to today''s disclosure. </p>
<p>Fees from investment banking tumbled 46 percent to $1.04
billion in the third quarter, compared with the previous three
months. About $2 trillion in global corporate bond issues came
to market in the first half before volume plummeted to $553.3
billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don''t represent individual workers'' actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end. </p>
<p>The market-related businesses clearly experienced
pressure from the volatility, reduced volumes and mark-to-market
pressures amid the quarter''s market tumoil, Chief Financial
Officer Doug Braunstein told reporters on a conference call. </p>

<p>Alcatel-Lucent''s patent-infringement
jury award against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may be lowered to $26.3
million from $70 million, a federal judge said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff in San Diego said at a
hearing yesterday that she will review more legal arguments
before issuing a ruling. Huff said she agreed with the world''s
largest software maker that the jury''s July 29 award wasn''t
supported by evidence presented during a 10-day trial. </p>
<p>The judge said she disagreed with how an expert witness for
Alcatel-Lucent calculated damages and told lawyers $26.3 million
is a fair damages figure that is not excessive based on the
totality of the evidence. She asked attorneys on both sides to
file additional legal arguments on her finding by theend of the
month before she makes her decision final. </p>
<p>The infringed patent relates to technology used in
Microsoft''s Outlook program and two other applications.
Microsoft asked the judge to reduce the award to no more than $5
million. </p>
<p>Microsoft attorney Roger Denning told the judge that
Alcatel-Lucent''s formula for computing damages didn''t comply
with guidelines set by Huff and appellate court rulings. </p>
<p>Those went ignored, he said. Lucent put its head down
and bullied through with its $70 million figure ignoring the
guidance that was given. </p>
<p>Alcatel-Lucent''s lawyers argued there was more than
sufficient evidence to support the jury''s verdict and that the
verdict should be respected. </p>
<p>High'' Standard </p>
<p>If the court is going to take the judgment out of the
jury''s hands the standard is extraordinarily high, said
company attorney Luke Dauchot. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Alcatel-Lucent also asked Huff to award $38.3
million in prejudgment interest on top of the jury''s $70 million
award. Alcatel-Lucent, France''s largest maker of
telecommunications equipment, also has been awarded $450,479 in
trial costs. </p>
<p>The technology at issue, called the Day patent, was
described in court during the trial as involving a touch-screen
form entry. Microsoft argued the patent relates to a simple
date-picker function and has nothing to do with e-mail, the
most popular function on Outlook. Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent
described the technology as a tool that plays a central role
in the entire operation of Outlook. </p>
<p>Infringement </p>
<p>A different jury in San Diego in 2008 found that Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded
$358 million in damages. An appeals court, upholding the
infringement verdict, overturned the damages award, finding the
calculation lacked sufficient evidentiary support. The case was
sent back for retrial on damages only. </p>
<p>The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., 07-
cv-02000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(San Diego). </p>
<p>Alcatel-Lucent today rose as much as 11 percent to 2.31
euros in Paris trading after the Financial Times reported,
without saying how it got the information, that the company
agreed to sell its corporate call-center business. Alcatel-
Lucent spokesman Simon Poulter declined to comment. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), which rose to a record today, may keep climbing to $200
or more, according to analysts who are boosting their price
targets for the stock. </p>
<p>Eight of the 19 analysts with price targets surveyed by
Bloomberg estimate IBM will rise to at least $200, 7.1 percent
above yesterday''s close, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Three analysts increased their price targets to $200
or more this week, ahead of IBM''s Oct. 17 earnings announcement,
and Macquarie Capital began coverage with a $210 target today. </p>
<p>IBM''s high recurring revenue business model has
Goldilocks'' characteristics, allowing IBM to perform well in a
good or bad macro environment, said Louis Miscioscia, an
analyst for Collins Stewart, who raised his price target to $210
today and has a buy rating on the stock. </p>
<p>Under Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 60, IBM sold
off its personal computer business and focused on software and
services, helping lift per-share profit for more than 30
straight quarters. Now the world''s largest computer-services
provider, IBM has gained more than 80 percent since Palmisano
took over, including 30 percent this year. </p>
<p>Investors have been drawn by a very stable earnings
stream, said David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus  Co., who has
price target of $210 for IBM. If revenues start to come under
pressure for economic reasons, there are several levers at their
disposal that they can exercise to support earnings
expectations. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 2 percent to $190.53
at the close in New York. </p>

<p>Zijin Mining Group Co. has sold
bonds convertible into shares of Glencore International Plc, the
world''s largest publicly traded commodities supplier, according
to three people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The bonds were sold at 128.25 percent of face value, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
process was private. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managed the sale,
according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Zijin Mining, China''s biggest gold miner by market value,
acquired the bonds ahead of Glencore''s May initial public
offering, which ended its more than three decades as a closely
held partnership. Glencore, which sold $10 billion of shares in
the biggest IPO this year, has dropped 20 percent since going
public. </p>
<p>In December 2009 Glencore had sold $2.2 billion of
convertible 5 percent bonds, its first such offering, saying the
debt could be exchanged for shares in the event of an IPO. Zijin
Mining invested in those bonds together with BlackRock Inc. (BLK),
Government of Singapore Investment Corp. and First Reserve Corp. </p>
<p>Zijin was offering the $175 million of December 2014 bonds
at 128.25 percent to 130.25 percent of face value, plus accrued
interest, according to the term sheet. </p>
<p>First Reserve, a private equity firm, sold $800 million of
the bonds last month at $135,313.89 for each $100,000 of
principal amount, and used the proceeds to buy Glencore common
stock. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Morgan Stanley managed First
Reserve''s transaction. </p>
<p>A call made to the Zijin''s office outside of regular
business hours wasn''t answered. Simon Buerk, a spokesman for
Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Glencore dropped 3 percent to 422.5 pence at the close of
London trading, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 2.8
percent. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
No 2. U.S. mall owner, sold Faneuil Hall Marketplace, a shopping
and dining complex in Boston, for $140 million. </p>
<p>The transaction was one of three sales of non-core
assets completed in the last three months, the Chicago-based
company said in a statement today. General Growth also sold the
office and garage components of Westlake Center in Seattle for
$119 million and Riverside Plaza, a strip shopping center in
Provo, Utah, for $21 million. The buyers weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>We continue to execute our investment strategy of
focusing on our regional mall portfolio,Shobi Khan, General
Growth''s chief operating officer, said in the statement. These
recent dispositions strengthen our balance sheet. </p>
<p>The deals helped the company eliminate $95 million of
mortgage-related debt associated with the properties, according
to the statement. </p>
<p>General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, is the second biggest U.S. shopping mall owner after
Simon Property Group Inc. In August, General Growth said it
would spin off 30 malls to shareholders through a special
dividend and that they would be transferred to a new publicly
traded real estate investment trust, Rouse Properties Inc. </p>

<p>British consumers will spend 19.3
billion pounds ($30.5 billion) by 2021 on purchases using their
mobile phones as technology advances and more people have
smartphones, Barclays Corporate estimated. </p>
<p>The figure will rise from 1.3 billion pounds now,
encouraged by systems such as Near Field Communications and
faster mobile data transmission, Barclays Corporate, a unit of
London-based banking group Barclays Plc (BARC), said in a report. Food
and groceries are the biggest category, with mobile sales of
almost 300 million pounds this year, according to the report. </p>
<p>With little new shop space coming into play, the real
growth opportunities lie on the virtual high street, Richard
Lowe, Head of Retail and Wholesale at Barclays Corporate, said
in the statement. Those retailers which are prepared to invest
will be at a significant advantage to the competition. </p>
<p>Mobile commerce will grow by 55 percent over the next five
years, according to Barclays. It said just over half of shoppers
already use their mobiles at some stage of purchasing. </p>
<p>Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) and other wireless operators said in
June they had agreed to create a common platform for mobile
payment systems to speed up the development of additional
services in the U.K. </p>
<p>Vodafone, Telefonica SA (TEF), and Everything Everywhere, the
partnership between France Telecom SA (FTE) and Deutsche Telekom AG,
will form a joint venture to help banks and advertisers access
the service, which will let people buy items from groceries to
clothes with a swipe of their smartphone, they said at the time. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, reported third-
quarter sales that missed analysts'' estimates on slowing revenue
growth at its software, hardware and services businesses. </p>
<p>Sales climbed 7.8 percent to $26.2 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. Analysts predicted
$26.3 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is focusing on areas
such as business analytics, emerging markets and cloud computing
to boost sales amid sluggish economic expansion. The U.S.
economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter
following a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months, the
weakest performance in two years. </p>
<p>Because they didn''t beat, the stock''s going to trade
down; the expectation is pretty high for this name, said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, who has a buy rating on the stock. A slowdown in
hardware revenue growth is occurring sooner than I expected. </p>
<p>It was the second time in nine quarters that IBM missed
sales estimates. Hardware sales growth slowed to 4 percent from
17 percent in the second quarter. Sales growth at IBM''s services
business slowed to 8 percent from 10 percent, while revenue
expansion at its software unit decelerated to 13 percent from 17
percent. </p>
<p>Record Last Week </p>
<p>IBM fell as much as 4.1 percent to $179.02 in extended
trading after closing at $186.59 in New York today. It has risen
27 percent this year as of the close of regular trading. </p>
<p>The stock reached a record of $190.53 on Oct. 14, and at
least three analysts revised their price estimates to $200 a
share or higher. In September, IBM passed Microsoft in market
value based on closing prices for the first time since 1996
before the companies switched back. </p>
<p>This is a name that you''re expecting in this environment
to perform very strong, said Brad Zelnick, a Macquarie Capital
USA analyst who added coverage of IBM last week. Any
deceleration in signings or any significant drain on backlog is
going to send shares down. </p>
<p>Contract signings for services, which make up about 60
percent of IBM revenue, were $12.3 billion, compared with $14.3
billion in the second quarter. </p>
<p>Projects Software </p>
<p>The company projects software will make up half of total
profit in 2015. Analytics software, which helps businesses
predict trends, is expected to draw $16 billion in sales by
2015, while cloud computing will draw $7 billion. </p>
<p>Smarter Planet, Palmisano''s initiative to provide digital
monitoring of anything from roads to hospitals to make them more
efficient, will grow to a $10 billion business, the company has
said. </p>
<p>Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, climbed 19 percent last quarter. Sales from the regions
will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the company
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>Growth market performance was terrific across all
segments, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
call with analysts and investors. </p>
<p>It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth
in these markets, and it led revenue growth in all business
segments, Loughridge said. IBM opened up 80 new branches, he
said. </p>
<p>Footprint'' Important </p>
<p>They''re very ahead of where the big markets will be in a
few years, and it''s very important for them to have a footprint
there, Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities
USA, said in an interview. He has an outperform rating on
the shares. </p>
<p>Palmisano has said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions between 2010 and 2015. So far the company has spent
about $3 billion in acquisitions related to cloud computing,
said Steven Tomasco, an IBM spokesman. </p>
<p>Because of IBM''s global position and broad set of computer
services, it is about as close as you can get to a technology
index fund, Maguire said. They''re a bellwether for the rest
of the market. </p>
<p>Accenture Plc and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which compete with IBM in
selling services to technology companies, both benefited from
increased spending by business clients in their most recent
quarters. </p>

<p>The real estate investment trust''s share of the new loans
totals $483 million after adjusting for the company''s ownership
in the shopping malls, Chicago-based General Growth said today
in a statement. The refinancings lowered the interest rate to an
average 4.63 percent from 5.66 percent on the prior maturing
mortgages. </p>
<p>General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, has been refinancing debt to lower expenses and plans
to redevelop, expand and refurbish malls to boost growth. The
new loans meet the company''s financing plans for this year,
according to the statement. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) plans to build
a mining equipment plant in Texas and upgrade a factory in
Pennsylvania, adding 490 workers. </p>
<p>The projects are part of the GE transportation business''s
expansion into mining equipment as it branches out from
locomotives, which use similar technology, Lorenzo Simonelli,
the unit''s chief, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The expansion gives us more scale in mining, Simonelli
said. </p>
<p>Demand for such equipment is growing worldwide as emerging
markets seek more raw materials such as rare earths and copper
for infrastructure. Copper prices have more than doubled since
the end of 2008 as demand climbed in China, the world''s biggest
metals user. </p>
<p>The Texas plant, to be located near a Fort Worth locomotive
factory announced in May, will build motorized wheels for off-
highway vehicles, GE said in the statement. The $95 million site
will employ about 130 workers, GE Transportation said. </p>
<p>About 360 employees will be hired in Erie, Pennsylvania,
including 160 production workers to meet higher demand for
mining equipment, GE said. The company will invest about $136
million in upgrading the plant, which is more than 100 years
old, to boost capacity, add research and testing technology and
install a customer showcase center. </p>
<p>About $22 million of the Erie upgrades is related to mining
equipment production, GE said. Mining has also been a focus for
the Fairfield, Connecticut-based parent company''s energy
business, which has invested in oil-and-gas acquisitions. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, posted an 8.1 percent increase in third-
quarter profit after boosting global sales volumes and raising
retail pricing in North America. </p>
<p>Net income advanced to $2.22 billion, or 95 cents a share,
from $2.06 billion, or 88 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Excluding some items,
profit was $1.03 a share, topping the $1.02 average of 13
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has built new plants in
emerging markets and pushed more profitable package sizes
overseas, helping boost global case volume sales 5 percent in
the quarter. Coca-Cola also raised pricing 2 percent to
retailers in North America, its largest market. </p>
<p>They are still growing in terms of volume, and that''s
what you want to see, Chris Shanahan, a San Antonio-based
analyst at Frost  Sullivan, said today in a telephone
interview. They are able to maintain organic growth. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola fell 0.4 percent to $66.74 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 1.5 percent this year, while rival
PepsiCo Inc. has decreased 4.5 percent. </p>
<p>Third-quarter revenue rose 45 percent to $12.2 billion,
helped by the Coca-Cola''s purchase of its largest bottler last
year. The average estimate of 10 analysts was $12 billion. </p>
<p>International Sales </p>
<p>Sales volumes gained 7 percent in Latin America, 6 percent
in the company''s Eurasia and Africa region and 5 percent in
North American and its Pacific units. The gains were the result
of investments made throughout several years, Kent said today in
an interview. </p>
<p>You have to take a long-term approach to investments and
a shorter term approach to execution, said Kent, who last
month announced a plan to spend $3 billion in Russia in the next
five years to develop Coca-Cola''s brands. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola said today it plans to buy back as much as $3
billion of its shares this year, up from its previous target of
at least $2.5 billion. The company said today it has repurchased
$2.2 billion shares so far this year. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said today on a
conference call that the company''s commodity costs will jump
$800 million this year from 2010, more than the $700 million
Coca-Cola previously estimated. The increase is driven by higher
costs for corn syrup used as a sweetener and petroleum-based
plastic for bottles and packaging. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola said in July it would boost North American
pricing as much as 4 percent in the second half of the year to
offset higher commodity costs. </p>

<p>Because they didn''t beat, the stock''s going to trade
down; the expectation is pretty high for this name, said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, who has a buy rating on the stock. A slowdown in
hardware revenue growth is occurring sooner than I expected. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is focusing on areas
such as business analytics, emerging markets and cloud computing
to boost sales amid sluggish economic expansion. The U.S.
economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter
following a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months, the
weakest performance in two years. </p>
<p>Slowing Growth </p>
<p>Declines in Japan and the public sector weighed on the
performance of IBM''s services business, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. IBM has more exposure
to Japan than competitors, David Grossman, an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus in San Francisco, said in a note to investors. </p>
<p>Sales growth at IBM''s services unit slowed to 8 percent
from 10 percent in the second quarter, while revenue expansion
at its software unit decelerated to 13 percent from 17 percent.
Hardware sales growth slowed to 4 percent from 17 percent. </p>
<p>IBM shares have risen 22 percent this year. The stock
reached a record of $190.53 on Oct. 14, and at least three
analysts revised their price estimates to $200 a share or higher
that week. In September, IBM passed Microsoft Corp. in market
value based on closing prices for the first time since 1996
before the companies switched back. </p>
<p>This is a name that you''re expecting in this environment
to perform very strong, said Brad Zelnick, a Macquarie Capital
USA analyst who added coverage of IBM last week. Any
deceleration in signings or any significant drain on backlog is
going to send shares down. </p>
<p>Analysts at BMO Capital Markets and FBN Securities reduced
their ratings for IBM shares after the earnings report. </p>
<p>Backlog Shrinking </p>
<p>Contract signings for services, which make up about
60 percent of IBM revenue, were $12.3 billion, compared with
$11 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average estimated
$12.5 billion, UBS AG said in a note to investors. </p>
<p>Backlog, which measures expected future revenue
from contracts, shrank to $137 billion in the quarter from
$144 billion in the second quarter, largely because of changes
in currency exchange rates, Loughridge said. </p>
<p>Third-quarter net income rose 7 percent to $3.84 billion.
Profit on an operating basis rose to $3.28 a share, beating the
$3.22 average analyst estimate. </p>
<p>Operating earnings will climb to at least $13.35 a share
this year, up from a previous projection of at least $13.25, IBM
said. Analysts predicted $13.33 on average. </p>
<p>Bellwether'' </p>
<p>Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, climbed 19 percent last quarter. Sales from the regions
will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the company
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>Growth-market performance was terrific across all
segments, Loughridge said. </p>
<p>It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth
in these markets, and it led revenue growth in all business
segments, Loughridge said. IBM opened up 80 new branches, he
said. </p>
<p>They''re very ahead of where the big markets will be in a
few years, and it''s very important for them to have a footprint
there, Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities
USA, said in an interview. He has an outperform rating on
the shares. </p>
<p>Palmisano has said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions between 2010 and 2015. So far the company has spent
about $3 billion in acquisitions related to cloud computing,
said Steven Tomasco, an IBM spokesman. </p>
<p>Because of IBM''s global position and broad set of computer
services, it is about as close as you can get to a technology
index fund, Maguire said. They''re a bellwether for the rest
of the market. </p>
<p>Accenture Plc and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which compete with IBM in
selling services to technology companies, both benefited from
increased spending by business clients in their most recent
quarters. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rose 5.5
percent in New York trading as investors looked past a third-
quarter loss and focused on gains in trading revenue and
prospects for a rebound in underwriting and takeovers. </p>
<p>Revenue from trading stocks and bonds increased 16 percent
from the second quarter and the backlog of investment-banking
assignments climbed, Goldman Sachs said today. The third-quarter
loss, which was driven by markdowns on the value of the firm''s
own investments, was $393 million, or 84 cents a share, the New
York-based company said in a statement. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
57, has tied Goldman Sachs''s fortunes to trading, which
accounted for 62 percent of revenue in the first nine months of
2011. After reporting weaker second-quarter revenue than
competitors in that business, Goldman Sachs beat both Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) last quarter, excluding
accounting gains related to the decline of the banks'' own debt. </p>
<p>In the core business there are some encouraging signs,
said William Fitzpatrick, a Milwaukee-based financial-services
analyst at Manulife Asset Management, which manages $217 billion
and owns Goldman Sachs stock. It was the private-equity
business that weighed on results in the quarter. </p>
<p>The shares rose $5.35 to $102.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain in more than
two months, as the Standard  Poor''s 500 Financial Index climbed
5 percent. </p>
<p>Rough Patch'' </p>
<p>Trading wasn''t as bad as we all thought, and the bigger
losses came from writedowns in their investing and lending
unit, Thomas Brown, chief executive officer of Second Curve
Capital LLC, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television''s In
the Loop. I see Goldman as going through a rough patch in
the environment, but it''s environment-driven, not Goldman Sachs-
driven. </p>
<p>The third-quarter loss, which compared with a year-earlier
profit of $1.9 billion, was the second time that Goldman Sachs
failed to post a profit since it became a public company in
1999. In both cases the loss was caused by reductions in the
value of Goldman Sachs''s investments in companies, private-
equity funds and loans. </p>
<p>The firm, which said in July that it planned to cut about
1,000 jobs to reduce annual costs by $1.2 billion, said it
employed 34,200 people at the end of September, down 1,300 from
the end of June. </p>
<p>Litton Sale </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar told analysts on a
conference call today that about 500 of the job cuts in the
quarter related to the effort to cut costs. The other 800 came
from the sale of Litton Loan Servicing LP to Ocwen Financial
Corp., which more than offset the addition of personnel when the
firm gained control of its Australian joint venture, JBWere Ltd. </p>
<p>Investing and Lending, which includes Goldman Sachs''s
stakes in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (1398) Ltd. and other
companies, as well as holdings by the Special Situations Group
run by Jason M. Brown, reported negative revenue of $2.48
billion for the quarter. That compared with $1.8 billion in
revenue in the same period a year earlier. </p>
<p>About $1.05 billion of last quarter''s negative revenue was
attributed to a drop in the value of ICBC, China''s biggest
lender, and $1 billion was caused by losses on other equity
securities. The unit also booked $907 in negative revenue from
debt securities and loans, while gaining $477 from
investments in other entities. </p>
<p>Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., had
estimated the unit''s loss would be $1.67 billion, and predicted
the debt securities and loans segment would post $200 million in
revenue. </p>
<p>Mezzanine Debt </p>
<p>Most of the writedowns related to spread widening on senior
debt and so-called mezzanine debt, although the segment also
included some distressed loan losses, Viniar said on the call. </p>
<p>All of the Investing and Lending division''s losses were
unrealized, meaning they reflected markdowns in asset values and
not actual sales at lower values, Viniar said. He said that
division sold some assets at a profit during the period, which
helped to offset the writedowns. </p>
<p>There''s no reason to think it won''t rebound, Manulife''s
Fitzpatrick said of the Investing and Lending results. I think
it will remain a big part of the business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs expects Investing and Lending to produce a
return in excess of 10 percent over the long run, Viniar told
analysts. </p>
<p>In any quarter it can be extremely volatile and up or
down a lot more than that, he said. Our history has been a
lot better than a 10 percent return. </p>
<p>Book Value </p>
<p>Third-quarter revenue fell 60 percent to $3.59 billion from
$8.9 billion a year earlier and declined 51 percent from $7.28
billion in the second quarter. The company''s book value per
common share decreased to $131.09 from $131.44 at the end of the
second quarter. </p>
<p>Overall revenue from trading, run since February 2008 by
Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz, rose 16 percent to $4.06 billion from $3.52 billion
in the second quarter and was down 13 percent from $4.67 billion
in the third quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>The trading results included about $450 million of so-
called debt valuation adjustments, or DVAs, with about $300
million in fixed-income and about $150 million in equities
trading, Viniar said. U.S. accounting rules require that banks
book losses when the value of their debt rises and gains when it
declines on the theory that a loss, or profit, would be realized
if the bank were to repurchase the debt. </p>
<p>A Little Confused'' </p>
<p>Like most of its rivals, spreads on Goldman Sachs''s
corporate debt and credit-default swaps widened during the
quarter as investors became more cautious about risk from the
European sovereign debt crisis. Viniar said the wider spreads
make him a little confused because the firm believes it has
strong capital and liquidity. </p>
<p>It''s had minimal impact on our business so far, Viniar
said in response to a question on the call. It might affect us
versus some competitors who might have lower spreads, but we
also compete on execution as well and our execution tends to be
pretty good. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has about $5 billion in plain vanilla
debt maturing by the end of the year, Viniar said. We''ll
decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to replace it or
we want to wait for a better time. </p>
<p>Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities,
typically the firm''s biggest source of revenue, dropped 36
percent to $1.73 billion from $2.69 billion a year earlier and
increased from $1.6 billion in the second quarter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase </p>
<p>Excluding DVAs the business produced $1.43 billion, which
fell short of the $2.27 billion that Citigroup reported and the
$2.8 billion that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported on the same
basis. </p>
<p>The company''s average value-at-risk, a measure of the
amount of money the firm estimates it could lose in a single
day, was little changed during the quarter at $102 million
compared with $101 million in the prior period. Viniar told
analysts that the company''s value-at-risk, or VaR, climbed at
the end of the quarter as market volatility, one of the
ingredients of VaR, increased. Most of the rise took place in
the firm''s bets on interest rates, Viniar said. </p>
<p>I would expect, assuming we made no changes to positions
at all, that our VaR would be fairly significantly higher in the
fourth quarter than the third quarter, he said. </p>
<p>Equities trading revenue rose to $2.33 billion from $1.98
billion a year earlier and from $1.92 billion in the second
quarter. Excluding DVAs, Goldman Sachs''s $2.18 billion of
equities trading revenue beat Bank of America, Citigroup and
JPMorgan Chase. </p>
<p>Best Performer'' </p>
<p>They were the best performer of the four so far, said
David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in New York who
rates the stock outperform. </p>
<p>Investment banking, overseen globally by Richard J. Gnodde,
David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, generated $781 million of
revenue in the third quarter, down from $1.45 billion in the
second quarter and $1.16 billion in the third quarter of last
year. The company ranks No. 1 among advisers on global takeovers
announced this year and also has the top spot among managers of
global equity and equity-linked offerings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Investment banking''s relative contribution within the group
has grown this year. The business generated 15 percent of
Goldman Sachs''s revenue in the first nine months of the year, up
from 11 percent in the same period last year. </p>
<p>Compensation and Benefits </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits, Goldman Sachs''s biggest expense,
fell 59 percent to $1.58 billion in the third quarter from $3.83
billion in the same period last year. The amount set aside to
pay employees in the first nine months of the year fell 24
percent to $10 billion, or enough to pay each employee $292,836.
That compares with $13.1 billion in the first nine months of
2010, or enough to pay each of the firm''s 35,400 employees at
the time $370,700. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost $2.12 billion, or $4.97 per share, in
the fourth quarter of 2008 after markets plunged following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman Sachs
rebounded to record profit in 2009 as asset values climbed and
the company slashed pay. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
$10 billion to pay employees in this year''s first nine months,
down 24 percent from the same period last year as revenue slid
and the firm cut jobs. </p>
<p>The compensation expense, which includes salaries, bonuses,
stock awards and benefits, was equivalent to $292,836 for each
of the company''s 34,200 workers as of Sept. 30. A year earlier
Goldman Sachs employed 35,400 people, who shared about $13.1
billion, or $370,706 each, for the nine-month period. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is among firms that have been targeted by
lower Manhattan protests, called Occupy Wall Street, that seek
to call attention to the income disparity between the wealthiest
1 percent of the population and everyone else. Related
demonstrations took place on four continents over the weekend.
Sixty-seven percent of New York City voters support the
movement, according to a Quinnipiac University survey yesterday. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record for a
securities firm before converting to a bank in response to the
financial crisis, may cut compensation for the second year in a
row as declining markets sap trading revenue. After setting
aside 39 percent of revenue for compensation in 2010, the
company has allocated 44 percent of revenue for pay and benefits
so far this year. Revenue for this year''s first nine months fell
25 percent $22.8 billion. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported last week that it reduced its investment bank''s
workforce by almost 4 percent in the third quarter and cut
employee compensation costs 28 percent. The investment bank''s
compensation expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and
benefits, was enough to give each of the division''s employees
$289,611 for the nine-month period. </p>
<p>The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don''t represent individual workers'' actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
yesterday reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years, sold
$500 million of 50-year unsecured bonds in a transaction aimed
at individual investors. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sold the debt in increments of $25 at a yield
of 6.5 percent after doubling the size of the offering,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based firm
has the option to redeem the bonds at par after five years,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. </p>
<p>The transaction was the second Goldman Sachs has targeted
at individual investors, allowing the firm to diversify its
sources of capital while locking in attractive borrowing
costs, said James Leonard, a credit analyst at Morningstar Inc.
in Chicago. Goldman Sachs issued $1.3 billion of 6.125 percent
notes with a similar structure a year ago, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>It''s a great deal for Goldman, Leonard said in a
telephone interview. They''re sitting in a win-win situation,
because if interest rates stay low they can call them, but if
rates go up they''ve got 50 years of funding. </p>
<p>Leonard said he wouldn''t recommend individual investors buy
the notes because of the difficulty of valuing Goldman Sachs''s
option to redeem them after 2016. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s third-quarter loss of $393 million, or 84
cents per share, compared with a profit of $1.9 billion, or
$2.98, a year earlier, the company said yesterday in a
statement. </p>
<p>Credit Swaps Fall </p>
<p>The cost to protect Goldman Sachs''s debt for five years
using credit-default swaps fell 24 basis points to 321 basis
points, according to London-based data provider CMA. It reached
410 basis points on Oct. 4, the highest since October 2008. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses
on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline
as investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. </p>
<p>Confused and Disappointed'' </p>
<p>David Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial officer, told
analysts on a conference call yesterday that a widening of the
firm''s credit spreads over the last six weeks has had a
minimal impact on its business. He said the firm, which
yesterday reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years as a
public company, has about $5 billion of debt maturing by year
end and we''ll decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to
replace it or we want to wait for a better time. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs executives have been confused and
disappointed by the rising prices on the firm''s credit-default
swaps, Viniar said, which investors use to hedge against losses
on the company''s debt or to speculate on its creditworthiness. </p>
<p>Given how strong our capital is, our liquidity is, the
maturity of our funding, the balance sheet, we kind of scratch
our heads a little bit, Viniar said. But it really hasn''t
affected anything other than our emotions. We don''t like seeing
it but it hasn''t had a big effect. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell 1.5 percent to $100.79 in New York after
reaching $102.25 yesterday, the highest since Sept. 20. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, reported profit that beat analysts'' estimates
on a $3.4 billion accounting gain and higher revenue from stock
trading. </p>
<p>Net income was $2.2 billion, or $1.15 a share, compared
with $131 million, or a loss of 7 cents a share after preferred
dividends, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today
in a statement. Earnings beat the 30-cent average estimate of 25
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s 20 percent gain in year-over-year
equities-trading revenue was the biggest among the largest U.S.
banks, excluding the accounting benefit. Fixed-income fell 17
percent. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, is trying to
stem a 39 percent decline in the firm''s shares this year through
yesterday that left the stock trading at a level last seen
during the financial crisis in January 2009. </p>
<p>We saw more activity on the cash equities side,
particularly in electronic trading, and the derivatives business
continued to do well, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said
in an interview after earnings were released. The more
challenging part of the market was in the fixed-income market. </p>
<p>Excluding the $3.4 billion accounting gain, known as debt
valuation adjustments, or DVA, profit was 3 cents a share,
compared with estimates of a 9-cent loss from Citigroup Inc.
analyst Keith Horowitz and a 23-cent loss from Barclays
Capital''s Roger Freeman. </p>
<p>Share Performance </p>
<p>Shares of the company rose 1 cent to $16.64 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York, after surging 9.1 percent yesterday. </p>
<p>The DVA gain stems from declines in the value of the
company''s debt, under the theory that a profit would be realized
if the debt were repurchased at a discount. Citigroup and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. each booked more than $1.5 billion of such
gains as bank credit spreads widened in the quarter. </p>
<p>It is a bizarre accounting anomaly, Gorman said in an
interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television. Next
quarter, we may have $3.4 billion of negative adjustments. </p>
<p>Revenue at Morgan Stanley climbed 46 percent to $9.89
billion from $6.78 billion a year earlier. Book value per share
rose to $31.29 from $30.17 at the end of June. The firm''s return
on equity from continuing operations, a measure of how well it
reinvests earnings, was 14.5 percent. </p>
<p>Fixed Income </p>
<p>Trading revenue at five of the largest U.S. banks dropped
by a combined 32 percent from the second quarter and was less
than half that of the first quarter, excluding DVA. Morgan
Stanley is constantly reassessing whether the current
environment represents a cyclical or secular change, Gorman said
on the conference call. </p>
<p>Over the next several months, it will become clearer
which of the businesses that use a lot of balance sheet and take
on a lot of risk can be expected to generate the kind of return
that shareholders need, Gorman said in the Bloomberg
Television interview. </p>
<p>Third-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading,
which is run by Ken deRegt along with commodity trading co-heads
Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, was $3.88 billion. Excluding
DVA, fixed-income revenue was about $1.1 billion, down from $1.9
billion in the second quarter and $1.31 billion in the third
quarter of 2010. The figure compared with $2.8 billion at
JPMorgan, $2.27 billion at Citigroup and $1.43 billion at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Foreign Exchange </p>
<p>Interest-rates trading revenue increased from the second
quarter, and the firm saw share gains in foreign-exchange
trading, Porat said on a conference call with analysts. Credit
trading suffered from illiquidity in the corporate credit
and mortgage markets, she said. </p>
<p>Losses from hedges tied to monoline insurers reduced fixed-
income trading revenue by $284 million, Porat said. The bank
booked about $400 million of writedowns in corporate lending in
its revenue line labeled other sales and trading, said Mark Lake, a company spokesman. </p>
<p>In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley''s
third-quarter revenue was $1.96 billion. Excluding DVA, revenue
fell 26 percent from the second quarter to $1.34 billion. That
compared with $2.18 billion at Goldman Sachs and $289 million at
Citigroup. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $864 million in third-quarter
revenue from investment banking, which is overseen by Paul J. Taubman. That figure, down 14 percent from a year earlier,
included $413 million from financial advisory, $239 million from
equity underwriting and $212 million from debt underwriting. </p>
<p>Expense Control </p>
<p>Core trading and investment-banking revenue held up
better than our muted estimates while expense control was
good, Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy 
Investment Group Inc., said today in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Global wealth management, overseen by Greg Fleming, posted
pretax income of $362 million, up from $281 million in the third
quarter of 2010. It also had $15.5 billion in net new assets.
The division''s pretax profit margin rose to 11 percent from 10
percent in the first half. Gorman has said the unit should
eventually post a pretax profit margin of more than 20 percent. </p>
<p>Asset management reported a pretax loss of $117 million,
compared with profit of $279 million in the previous year''s
period. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits were unchanged from the year-
earlier quarter at $3.68 billion, or 37 percent of the firm''s
overall revenue. The ratio was lower than in the third quarter
of 2010, when the bank set aside 54 percent of revenue. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for annual savings
from an initiative to trim expenses to $1.4 billion, from $1
billion when the three-year project was announced in May. </p>
<p>Share Volatility </p>
<p>The firm''s shares fell 41 percent in the third quarter. The
stock dropped further in the first week of October to $11.58,
the lowest since December 2008. </p>
<p>The volatility prompted Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Morgan Stanley''s largest common shareholder, to release a
statement on Oct. 3 saying it''s firmly committed to its
strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley. Gorman sent a memo to
employees the same day, encouraging them to remain focused on
their jobs and clients instead of responding to the rumor of
the day. </p>
<p>There has been an enormous amount of confusion and
misinformation about Morgan Stanley and others in our peer
group, he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. In fragile markets, where fear triumphs over common
sense, these things are bound to happen. </p>
<p>The bank repurchased about $2 billion of its own bonds as
prices fell, Porat said. The gain on the buybacks was less than
$100 million, she said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley updated figures for risks linked to Europe
in a presentation on its website today, saying the five
countries at the center of Europe''s debt crisis totaled $2.11
billion in exposure including hedges against losses. The risks
linked to France were negative $286 million. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) raised compensation
at its investment banking division 8 percent to $5.74 billion
this year through September, even as the unit''s performance
suffered amid market turmoil. </p>
<p>The institutional-securities unit, which handles trading,
underwriting and merger advice, generated $12.4 billion in
revenue this year through September, excluding accounting gains
related to the drop in Morgan Stanley''s bonds and a loss in a
Japanese joint venture. That was down from $12.7 billion on a
comparable basis a year earlier. </p>
<p>The cost of salaries, bonuses and benefits for traders and
bankers in the unit amounted to 46 percent of that revenue, up
from 42 percent in the first nine months of 2010, according to
figures posted on the New York-based firm''s website. Without
adjusting for the Japanese loss and the so-called debt-valuation
adjustments, or DVAs, the ratio fell to 38 percent from 42
percent, the company said. </p>
<p>The firm is ensuring that we can appropriately compensate
those who are delivering returns for the franchise, while
balancing what we need to do to deliver returns for
shareholders, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a
conference call with analysts about the firm''s earnings today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s investment banking unit set aside 31
percent less in the third quarter than in the previous three
months, joining rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)''s investment bank in seeking to cut costs. </p>
<p>Brokerage Pay </p>
<p>Companywide compensation and benefits rose 6 percent to
$12.7 billion. That was enough to pay each of the firm''s 62,648
employees $202,608 for the nine months, up from the $190,681 it
set aside for each of the 62,864 employees at the end of
September of 2010, the bank''s figures show. The firm doesn''t
report how many people work in institutional securities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage division, which employed 17,291
financial advisers at the end of September, down from 18,119 a
year earlier, set aside $6.28 billion for pay in the nine
months, 7 percent higher than a year earlier. The unit''s
compensation cost, which is set by a fixed grid for many
employees, was 62 percent of its revenue for the nine months,
down from 63 percent last year. </p>
<p>There''s not a lot they can do on the wealth management
side because of some of the contracts, but the investment
banking side is proving to be a more flexible place for
controlling comp, Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC in New York, said today on Bloomberg Television''s
Inside Track. </p>
<p>Goldman, JPMorgan </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said yesterday it set aside $10 billion to
pay employees in this year''s first nine months, down 24 percent
from the same period last year as revenue slid 25 percent. That
was equivalent to $292,836 for each of the company''s 34,200
workers as of Sept. 30. A year earlier Goldman Sachs employed
35,400 people, who shared about $13.1 billion, or $370,706 each,
for the nine-month period. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported last
week that it reduced its investment bank''s workforce by almost 4
percent in the third quarter and cut employee compensation costs
28 percent. The investment bank''s compensation expense was
enough to give each of the division''s employees $289,611 for the
nine-month period. </p>
<p>The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don''t represent individual workers'' actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., one of two
Japanese joint ventures between the two banks and the one
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. controls, posted a loss in
the first quarter on wrong-way fixed-income bets that cost
Morgan Stanley $655 million. The firm said at the time it was
excluding the loss from pay decisions. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said risks tied to
five countries at the center of Europe''s debt crisis totaled
$2.11 billion including hedges against losses. The amount for
France is negative $286 million. </p>
<p>Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain represented
$5.69 billion in exposure before hedges, the New York-based firm
said today on its website. Morgan Stanley''s risks linked to
France were $1.53 billion before hedges. </p>
<p>Concern that Europe''s debt crisis would spark bank losses
contributed to a 41 percent tumble for Morgan Stanley''s shares
in the third quarter. Europe''s leaders are set to meet Oct. 23
to discuss how to stem the crisis. </p>
<p>The risks seems meaningfully lower than feared, Brennan
Hawken, an analyst at UBS AG, wrote today in a note to

<p>The exposures have been very well managed, Chief

<p>Gorman sent a memo to employees on Oct. 3 as the shares

to the rumor of the day. </p>
<p>There has been an enormous amount of confusion and
misinformation about Morgan Stanley and others in our peer

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), owner of the ESPN
sports channel and the world''s largest theme-park operator,
apologized to customers after demand for limited editions of its
princess dolls crashed the Disney Store website. </p>
<p>More than 1,200 Facebook users posted comments when the
company acknowledged yesterday that the site was extremely
busy and that it won''t allow such high volume to check out
simultaneously. </p>
<p>The furor erupted when the Burbank, California-based
company put the last five models in its Disney Princess Designer
Doll Collection for sale on its website yesterday for $59.50
each. All of the dolls -- the characters Tiana, Jasmine,
Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Pocahontas -- sold out the same
day, the company said. </p>
<p>DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! I think Disney should go back to the
meeting room on this one, Susan Herd Collier posted to
Disney''s Facebook page. </p>
<p>The company was contrite. </p>
<p>We acknowledge that this has been a poor experience for
many of you, and we are truly sorry for those of you who were
unable to purchase, Disney said yesterday in a statement on
the store''s Facebook page. </p>
<p>The Disney Princess Designer Doll collection made its debut
on Aug. 23, starting with the Cinderella model and a plan to
introduce one more character a week for a total of 10. Trouble
started when Snow White went on sale Sept. 19 and it sold out
the same day. The company said the doll was oversold and
blamed a system malfunction on its Disney Store blog. </p>
<p>Five More Dolls </p>
<p>We want you to know that we read your comments on
Facebook, saw your Tweets, and our Cast Members have told us
what they heard from our Guests who visited our stores, Jim
Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said in a Sept.
23 post on the store blog. </p>
<p>Disney said then it would release the five remaining dolls
all on the same day, starting Oct. 17 in its stores and
yesterday from its website. Customers were allowed to order only
one of each character, and even with that limit, demand led to
the website crash. </p>
<p>Disney spokesman Gary Foster said the company would have no

<p>Mobile telephones don''t raise the
chance of developing central nervous system cancers, according
to a study of Danish mobile-phone subscribers published today in
the British Medical Journal. </p>
<p>The study examined reports from Denmark''s centralized
cancer registry and subscriber records from mobile-phone
networks for 358,403 Danes aged at least 30 from 1990 to 2007.
It found no higher incidence of brain tumors or any other
cancers in the people studied. </p>
<p>We didn''t find a higher risk for people subscribing for a
mobile phone in the adult population, said Patrizia Frei, a
postdoctoral research fellow at the Swiss Tropical and Public
Health Institute in Basel, who led the study while at the
Institute of Cancer Epidemiology in Copenhagen, in an interview. </p>
<p>The research is the largest of its type and used data that
was already available, instead of retrospectively interviewing
phone subscribers whose recall could be selective or unreliable,
the scientists said. The findings may help clarify previous
research into the link between mobile phones and brain tumors,
which the authors said has been inconclusive and, in some cases,
criticized for being biased or prone to error. </p>
<p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of
the Geneva-based World Health Organization, said in June that
mobile phones may cause brain cancer. A month later, the
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection''s
committee on epidemiology undermined those findings, saying that
using the technology may not increase the risk of tumors after
reviewing studies from several countries. </p>
<p>Electromagnetic Fields </p>
<p>More than 5 billion mobile-phone subscriptions are held
worldwide, according to the International Telecommunication
Union. Concerns have arisen over whether exposing the brain to
radiofrequency electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones
leads to cancer. The IARC said the fields were possibly
carcinogenic, the same category as diesel fuel and chloroform. </p>
<p>A weakness in the Danish study was that it used data about
people who had a mobile-phone contract and excluded corporate
accounts. Some non-users of phones may have been counted among
the subscribers and some heavy users may not have been included
in the study population, wrote Anders Ahlbom, a professor at the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm in an accompanying editorial. </p>
<p>The absence of a trend in the incidence of brain tumors
in national statistics is reassuring, Ahlbom wrote.
Continued monitoring of health registers and prospective
cohorts is warranted. </p>
<p>The research was funded by the Danish Strategic Research
Council. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $14.5
million to settle a lawsuit brought by two whistle-blowers who
claimed the company improperly marketed its bladder-control drug
Detrol. </p>
<p>The whistle-blowers, former sales representatives David
Wetherholt and Marci Drimer, sued Pfizer in federal court in
Boston in 2006, claiming the company cheated Medicaid, the
state-administered, federal health-care program for low-income
people, by pushing Detrol for a prostate condition. The suit was
filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. and
multiple states. </p>
<p>Pfizer will pay $14.5 million to the U.S. government, 49
states and the District of Columbia, Thomas M. Greene, a lawyer
for the whistle-blowers, said today in a statement. The ex-
Pfizer employees will receive 27 percent of the federal portion
of the recovery, or about $3.3 million, he said. </p>
<p>The plan to market Detrol off-label to new patient
populations was hatched by a marketing team, not by research and
development, Greene said in an interview. Instead of asking,
Who will Detrol help?'' or even, How does Detrol work?'' the
question became, Who can we convince to buy Detrol?'' </p>
<p>Favorable Terms'' </p>
<p>Pfizer denied any wrongdoing. The New York-based company
settled the lawsuit on favorable terms, it said today in a
statement. </p>
<p>This settlement allows Pfizer to avoid the cost and
distraction of litigation and put this matter behind us, the
company said. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, paid $2.3 billion in
2009 to settle U.S. investigations into improper marketing of
its Bextra painkiller and other drugs. The Detrol claim was the
last of the False Claims Act cases connected to these suits, the
company said. </p>
<p>The U.S. declined to intervene, or join, the Detrol lawsuit
in 2009. The whistleblowers pursued the claim on their own after
that decision, Greene said. </p>
<p>The former Pfizer sales representatives claimed that the
company marketed Detrol, approved for treatment of overactive
bladder conditions, for an additional, unapproved, use, in
violation of federal regulations. </p>
<p>Pfizer encouraged prescriptions for patients who have an
impeded flow of urine caused by a condition called benign
prostatic hyperplasia, the whistle-blowers claimed. </p>
<p>Unlawful Conduct'' </p>
<p>Pfizer intentionally embarked on a course of unlawful
conduct that it knew would lead to the submission by physicians
and pharmacists of thousands of Medicaid claims for Detrol uses
that were not covered by Medicaid and for which the drug was
ineffective, the whistle-blowers said in their complaint. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was initially settled in January while the
conclusion of the case was delayed as the plaintiffs got
agreements from the states, according to court filings. </p>
<p>Wetherholt and Drimer also alleged Pfizer forced them out
after they complained about marketing practices. Greene declined
to comment on whether their claims of wrongful termination were
settled. </p>
<p>Wetherholt and Drimer will also receive an undetermined
amount from the $2.62 million portion of the settlement shared
by the states, Greene said. </p>
<p>They will receive a percentage of the state settlements
for those states with false claims acts, he said. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. ex. rel. Wetherholt v. Pfizer Inc.,
06-10204, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) disclosed $1.3
billion of new expenses tied to faulty mortgages and
foreclosures in its third quarter, pushing the bill for the five
biggest home lenders since 2007 to almost $69 billion. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, set aside $314
million for buying back defective loans and incurred $1 billion
in litigation costs caused mostly by mortgages, according to its
Oct. 13 report. That brought the New York-based bank''s total to
at least $17.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Cost are mounting as borrowers, investors and states accuse
banks of sloppy lending and improper foreclosures. The total may
top $120 billion because mortgage buyers such as Fannie Mae are
becoming more aggressive, said Paul Miller, the FBR Capital
Markets  Co. analyst, and claims are spreading to loans written
after banks said they reformed their practices. </p>
<p>This is still far from over, said Neil Barofsky, former
inspector general for the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program.
These numbers are very high to begin with, but this is now an
enormous overhang on the industry, and it''s well deserved.
Sooner or later the banks will pay the price for their
behavior. </p>
<p>During the housing boom, banks issued mortgages and bundled
them into securities sold to private investors and government-
backed enterprises. They usually offered representations and
warranties in which lenders promised to buy back the mortgages
or cover losses if the loans turned out to be based on
inaccurate or missing data on criteria such as the borrower''s
income, the property''s value or whether it would be used as a
primary residence. </p>
<p>Bad Loans </p>
<p>Regulators said banks abandoned their own lending standards
to approve unjustified loans, leading to record defaults and
foreclosures. Investors who owned the mortgages began scouring
the loans for defects and lodging claims, while homeowners and
state attorneys general alleged that banks based seizures on
missing or false documents. Litigation costs for JPMorgan alone
have come to more than $5 billion. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC), whose Countrywide unit was the
biggest lender during the housing bubble, had $1.18 billion in
third-quarter costs, according to its Oct. 18 report. That
included a $278 million provision for repurchases, $500 million
for litigation costs and $400 million for waivers and
assessments related to foreclosure problems. The total for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company since 2007 is now $40.3
billion, the most of any U.S. home lender. </p>
<p>Mortgage Servicing </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) added $390 million to its reserves for
repurchases in the third quarter, bringing its total to $5.48
billion. The San Francisco-based company, the biggest U.S. home
lender, also wrote down the value of its mortgage servicing
rights by $2.64 billion, in part because of expenses including
delinquency and foreclosure costs. </p>
<p>The writedown was excluded from Bloomberg''s tally because
the bank didn''t say how much of the decline was attributable to
extraordinary foreclosure costs, and Ancel Martinez, a Wells
Fargo spokesman, declined to elaborate. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) reported a $301 million provision for
repurchase demands, lifting the New York-based bank''s total to
$2.2 billion. </p>
<p>Thomas Kelly at JPMorgan, Shannon Bell at Citigroup and
Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to
comment. Ally Financial Inc., previously known as GMAC Inc., has
not reported its third-quarter data yet. As of the second
quarter, the Detroit-based lender had been hit with $3.28
billion in costs. Ally is 74 percent owned by the U.S.
government after being rescued from collapse in 2008. </p>
<p>Fannie and Freddie </p>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were also bailed out, say
they''re getting tougher in demanding repurchases, even for loans
that have not gone into default. Some guarantees offered by
banks oblige them to give refunds merely if the underwriting was
defective, even if the borrower is still paying. </p>
<p>Fannie Mae in particular seems to be getting more
aggressive, FBR''s Miller said. Bank of America said it had
$11.67 billion in outstanding claims and JPMorgan had $3.09
billion. </p>
<p>While most claims have been concentrated in the years
before the housing bubble burst, JPMorgan and Bank of America
reported that demands for repurchases on loans issued after 2008
had about tripled from the year earlier. Previously, the banks
had said they expected few claims those mortgages were faulty
because they had tightened their lending procedures after the
credit crisis. </p>
<p>Newer Loans </p>
<p>Wells Fargo said it had received a rising number of
repurchase demands from Fannie Mae for mortgages from 2006 to
2008 and that newer vintage demands continued to emerge. </p>
<p>On top of that, banks have been in negotiations with the
attorneys general of the 50 states to resolve litigation for
foreclosure abuses and errors. A settlement may cost about $20
billion. </p>
<p>Bloomberg''s tally was compiled from regulatory filings,
company statements and financial presentations by the nation''s
five biggest mortgage lenders. The data cover provisions and
expenses attributable to repurchases, foreclosure errors and
abuses, payments to reimburse investors for lost value on faulty
mortgages, legal settlements and litigation expenses. </p>
<p>The compilation also includes writedowns of assets, such as
mortgage servicing rights, when the company attributed the loss
in value to problems in mortgage underwriting or foreclosures
and the costs of remedies. </p>
<p>The tally would be higher if it included settlements with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading
investors in mortgage-related securities, such as collateralized
debt obligations. </p>
<p>The SEC announced Wednesday a $285 million settlement with
Citigroup. In July, 2010, the agency announced a $550 million
settlement with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan paid
$153.6 million in a similar case in June. SEC officials have
said more cases are likely. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
to raise a collateralized loan obligation with a target size of
$400 million to be managed by Ares Management LLC, according to
three people with knowledge of the deal. </p>
<p>The CLO may include a $254 million piece rated AAA by
Standard  Poor''s, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. Bank of America Corp.
priced a $410 million CLO for the Los Angeles-based investment
manager in January. </p>
<p>There have been more than $7.6 billion of CLOs backed by
widely syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, more than
double the $3.4 billion raised in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. At the peak of the market in 2007, $91.1
billion of that type of CLO was issued in the U.S., Morgan
Stanley data show. </p>
<p>The Ares fund may also consist of a $23 million slice rated
AA, a $40 million piece ranked A, a $21 million portion graded
BBB and an $18 million BB piece. There may also be $44 million
of equity, the people said. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs
spokesman, and Bill Mendel, an Ares spokesman, both declined to
comment. </p>
<p>CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. The SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, was sued by Israel-based MiniFrame Ltd. for
allegedly offering anticompetitive terms for multiserver
operating systems. </p>
<p>MiniFrame said Microsoft uses its monopoly on the client
operating-system market to interfere with potential partners and
customers. Before 2007, Microsoft didn''t include any
restrictions in its licenses that would prevent multiple users,
MiniFrame said in a complaint filed today in Manhattan federal
court. </p>
<p>MiniFrame alleges that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
is attempting to retain its monopoly on the server operating-
system market and the client operating-system market and is
attempting to monopolize the personal-computer sharing software
market and the multi-user software market. </p>
<p>Microsoft recognized the competitive threat which shared
PC systems posed and engaged in several anticompetitive
strategies in order to ensure that it will maintain or otherwise
have a monopoly for any multi-user market, whether it be the
server operating system market, the PC sharing software market,
or the combination of the two markets, MiniFrame said. </p>
<p>MiniFrame said there no technological reason multiple users
can''t access or use the same Windows Client Operating System at
the same time. </p>
<p>A Microsoft representative didn''t immediately return a
voice-mail message seeking comment about the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is MiniFrame v. Microsoft Corp. 11-CV-7419, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

There will need to be a lot of negative shocks going on to

<p>Morgan Stanley bought jet-fuel
cargoes at a reduced premium in Singapore, Asia''s biggest oil-
trading and refining center. Hin Leong Trading Pte extended its
purchases of fuel oil. </p>
<p>Light Distillates </p>
<p>Vitol Group bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON
gasoline from BP Plc in Singapore, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window.
The Geneva-based trader paid $118.50 a barrel to load between
Nov. 6 and Nov. 10. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a 25,000 metric-ton, open-
specification naphtha contract for second-half December from
Mabanaft BV at $884 a ton, the survey showed. </p>
<p>Naphtha''s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped $29.74 to $59.90 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time,
based on data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, is the narrowest so far this week. </p>
<p>Middle Distillates </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought two jet-fuel cargoes in Singapore,
according to the Bloomberg survey. Hin Leong and BP each sold
100,000 barrels at 10 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes, the
smallest premium in a week. The cargoes are for Nov. 4 to Nov.
8, the earliest loading period. </p>
<p>Jet fuel''s premium to gasoil, or diesel, fell 5 cents to
$2.80 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. Singapore time, based on data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. This regrade is
the narrowest so far this week, signaling it is less profitable
to produce aviation fuel over diesel. </p>
<p>Gasoil''s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 42 cents
to $16.71 a barrel, PVM said. This crack spread is the widest
since Oct. 7. </p>
<p>Fuel Oil </p>
<p>Hin Leong bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
fuel oil in Singapore, bringing its purchases so far this month
to at least 240,000 tons, according to the Bloomberg survey. The
closely held trader paid $9 a ton over quotes for first-half
November to Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Vitol, for loading from
Nov. 15 to Nov. 19. </p>
<p>Fuel oil''s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 43 cents to
$4.18 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data.
That''s the smallest gap in a week, indicating reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products. </p>
<p>The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade decreased 50 cents to $7 a ton, the lowest in a week, PVM
said. A narrowing viscosity spread shows bunker, or marine fuel,
has declined less than higher-quality fuel oil. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) expects production
costs of handsets using Windows Phone 7 software next year to
drop by more than half from when the platform was introduced. </p>
<p>Cooperation with parts makers including Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) will
allow phones using Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft''s mobile
operating system to be produced for less than $200, compared
with $400 when the software was released last year, Andy Lees,
head of the Windows Phone division, said in an interview in Hong
Kong today. The actual retail price will be determined by
operators, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft is competing with Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) to
gain a bigger share of the $207 billion mobile-phone market,
where it lags behind the Android and iOS platforms. The first
models using the latest version of Windows Phone 7, called
Mango, have already been shipped in Japan, with devices to be
available in China next year, Lees said. </p>
<p>Volume, volume, volume, is Microsoft''s main motivation
for helping vendors offer cheaper handsets, Lees said, declining
to identify phone makers. </p>
<p>Models using Mango to be introduced in the next few months
will require as little as $220 to produce, before the cost falls
further in 2012, Lees said. </p>
<p>We are supporting componentry that will allow us to go
below $200, he said, referring to handset production costs. </p>
<p>Lower prices will mean less royalty revenue per phone
because Microsoft offers tiered pricing, based on the
manufacturing cost of the handset, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft works exclusively with Qualcomm to develop chips
that power handsets using its system, allowing it to specify
technical details to ensure devices run more smoothly, the
executive said. </p>
<p>There is currently no plan to work with other semiconductor
makers for Windows Phone 7 devices, he said. </p>
<p>HTC Corp. (2498), Samsung Electronics Co. and ZTE Corp. (000063) are among
device makers that have already developed handsets using Windows
Phone 7. Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), which has agreed to develop phones with
Microsoft, will outline its plans for Windows phones next week,
Lees said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a
judge in New York state court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by
Allstate Insurance Co. over the alleged fraudulent sale of
residential mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer sued New York-based
Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Aug. 15 over the sale of more than $100 million worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
including the lost market value of the investments. </p>
<p>Allstate filed the lawsuit and seven similar complaints
against various issuers and underwriters of residential
mortgage-backed securities, using generalities and unsupported
assumptions to recoup investment losses on certificates it
bought in five offerings in 2006, Goldman Sachs said in court
documents filed today. </p>
<p>Despite its financial sophistication and expertise
(including in the housing market, where it is a leading
insurer), Allstate now suffers from buyer''s remorse and has sued
the counterparties with which it traded at arm''s length,
claiming in separate actions that each of the eight sellers of
RMBS misled it as to characteristics of the securities,
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. </p>
<p>Allstate has also sued lenders including JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp.''s Merrill
Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over residential
mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The investments, pools of home loans securitized into
bonds, were a central part of the housing bubble that helped
send the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The
housing market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and
investment banks as the market for the securities evaporated. </p>
<p>The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by
a pension fund that alleges the New York-based investment bank
had a conflict of interest in its role as adviser in the planned
$21 billion purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP) by Kinder Morgan Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder
Morgan, steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan, lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. </p>
<p>In addition to Goldman Sachs, the complaint also names
individual El Paso directors and Kinder Morgan. </p>
<p>While Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser on the
sale, Goldman''s presence tainted the entire process, lawyers
for the retirement fund said in the complaint. Goldman continued
to act as financial adviser on related matters in connection
with the transaction, the pension fund said in the complaint,
citing the companies'' joint press statement. </p>
<p>Fiduciary Duty </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is accused of aiding and abetting a breach of
fiduciary duty by El Paso directors. In addition to seeking
unspecified damages, the pension fund is asking a judge to order
the directors to give full and fair consideration to any
alternative offers for the company. </p>
<p>The retirement fund also faulted El Paso directors for
agreeing to an inadequate deal in light of the surge in demand
for pipelines, the pricing power Kinder Morgan will garner as a
result of the transaction and the premiums paid for past energy
deals. The board virtually eliminated the prospect of
a superior offer by agreeing to unreasonable deal protection
devices including a no-shop clause and a punitive $650 million
termination fee, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the lawsuit except to say that the bank''s
representatives on Kinder Morgan''s board recused themselves from
the deal process. </p>
<p>Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan,
said in an e-mail that the company doesn''t comment on pending
litigation. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, also
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Cash and Stock </p>
<p>El Paso, based in Houston, said Oct. 16 it would be bought
for cash and stock to create the largest natural-gas pipeline
network in the U.S. The company was sued earlier this week by a
shareholder over claims the deal undervalues it shares. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s private-equity arm was one of Richard
Kinder''s co-investors when he took his company private in 2007.
The firm remains one of the largest Kinder Morgan shareholders
and has two representatives on the board. </p>
<p>Richard Kinder kicked off the takeover talks in late August
when he approached El Paso''s Douglas Foshee, said Joe Hollier, a
Kinder Morgan spokesman. </p>
<p>That disrupted a previous plan by El Paso, announced in
May, to spin off its exploration and production assets to
shareholders. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s Steve Daniel had been advising El Paso on
the spinoff. For the talks with Kinder Morgan, El Paso instead
turned to a Morgan Stanley team. </p>
<p>The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, will sell its Saxon unit to Ocwen Financial
Corp. (OCN), exiting the mortgage-servicing business it bought before
the housing market collapsed. </p>
<p>Ocwen agreed to pay a base price of $59.3 million plus
about $1.4 billion for receivables outstanding, Morgan Stanley
said yesterday in a statement. The deal is expected to close in
2012''s first quarter and isn''t likely to have a material impact
on earnings, New York-based Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>Investment banks are selling mortgage servicers they bought
before the financial crisis as record defaults drive up costs
for billing, collections and foreclosures and make the units
less valuable. Ocwen last month completed the purchase of Litton
Loan Servicing LP from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for $263.7
million. </p>
<p>These transactions demonstrate yet again Ocwen''s strong
growth prospects as consolidation of private-label servicing
continues and demand increases for specialty servicing, Ocwen
Chairman William Erbey said in a separate statement.We remain
bullish on our growth prospects into 2012. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought Glen Allen, Virginia-based Saxon in
2006 for $706 million as the investment bank sought a mortgage
issuer and servicer to provide home loans that it packaged into
securities. Morgan Stanley took a $700 million writedown in the
fourth quarter of 2008 related to businesses it owned, with most
of the charge coming from Saxon. </p>
<p>Impact on Assets </p>
<p>The sale will reduce Morgan Stanley''s risk-weighted assets
as it attempts to meet capital standards set to start taking
effect in 2013. It will also reduce the firm''s headcount by
about 1,200, according to a person familiar with the unit. </p>
<p>Ocwen outbid Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)''s Nationstar
Mortgage Holdings Inc., according to another person with
knowledge of the talks, who declined to be identified because
the process wasn''t public. </p>
<p>Ocwen, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, acquires $26.6
billion in unpaid principal balances of mortgage servicing
rights, $10.9 billion of which Ocwen already subservices. The
deal also includes another $12.9 billion of loans that Saxon
services for Morgan Stanley and other firms. It gained about
$38.6 billion of unpaid principal balances with its purchase of
Litton, which Ocwen acquired by also agreeing to pay about
$337.4 million to retire some of Litton''s debt. </p>
<p>HomEq Purchase </p>
<p>Ocwen agreed in May 2010 to buy HomEq Servicing, a mortgage
servicer owned by London-based Barclays Plc, for about $1.3
billion in cash conditional on the value of certain assets at
completion, according to a statement from Barclays at the time.
Barclays also agreed to provide Ocwen with about $1 billion in
secured financing and offered assistance in raising more funds,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>In May, Saxon agreed to pay $2.35 million to resolve a
lawsuit alleging it improperly foreclosed on 17 U.S. military-
service members from 2006 to 2009. The foreclosures violated the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which was enacted to shield
deployed military personnel from financial stress, according to
the U.S. Justice Department. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley considered buying New Century Financial
Corp. (CYFL), the subprime mortgage lender that filed for bankruptcy in
April 2007, before acquiring Saxon, Chairman John Mack said in a
November 2010 interview released this year by the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission. </p>

approval last year of an agreement to seek buyers or liquidate

<p>Units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
were sued by Capmark Financial Group Inc., which accused them of
wrongly collecting $147 million five months before Capmark went
bankrupt. </p>
<p>While they were co-owners of Capmark in May 2009, a group
of Goldman units used their influence to help convince Capmark
to refinance $1.5 billion in unsecured debt owed to Goldman,
according to the lawsuit filed today in Manhattan federal court.
The refinancing allowed Goldman to collect $147 million,
including $7 million in cash, based on the new secured loan,
according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Despite these conflicts and close connections -- indeed,
as a result of the influence and insider status that its
multiple simultaneous roles created -- Goldman Sachs actively
and directly participated in internal meetings and discussions
that led to the secured credit facility, which gave it
preferential treatment as a creditor, Capmark claimed in the
lawsuit. </p>
<p>Capmark, the commercial lender once a part of the former
General Motors Corp., exited bankruptcy in September, co-owned
by lower-ranking creditors, some of whom had fought with Goldman
over the refinancing and the payments in bankruptcy court in
Delaware. </p>
<p>Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman, declined comment
on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>2006 Purchase </p>
<p>Capmark, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, became partly
owned by affiliates of New York-based Goldman Sachs when the
bank and a group of investors bought 78 percent of Capmark, then
called GMAC Commercial Mortgage, in 2006 for $1.5 billion in
cash and the repayment of $7.3 billion of debt. </p>
<p>The creditors committee also battled with Goldman Sachs
over how to handle so-called insider preference claims --
lawsuits sometimes brought against company insiders, including
equity holders, accused of wrongly taking money from the company
in the months before the bankruptcy filing. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs bring this action seeking avoidance and
recovery of all preferential payments made to defendant or for
defendants'' benefit under the pre-petition credit facilities,
Capmark said in the complaint filed today. </p>
<p>Last year, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi gave
Capmark permission to settle allegations that the entire
$1.5 billion refinancing was a fraud on creditors because it
wrongly boosted the repayment priority of Goldman Sachs and
other lenders. </p>
<p>Under that settlement, Capmark paid New York-based Goldman
Sachs and the other lenders about $835 million, less than the
full value of the loan. </p>
<p>Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
property values and a drop in lending. </p>
<p>The case is Capmark Financial Group Inc. v. Goldman Sachs,
11-CV-7511, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

go-between for the brokerage''s repurchase agreements with short-
term investors after the parent''s Sept. 15, 2008 bankruptcy,
failed to sell collateral securing the loans in a commercially
reasonable manner, it alleged in a filing where passages were
blacked out. </p>
<p>Lehman asked the judge to hold a hearing on the issue and
then cut the claims as he considered appropriate. </p>
<p>JPMorgan later agreed to let Lehman publish a mostly
uncensored version of its objection to the claims, the New York-
based bank said in a filing today. The information that is still
blacked out includes names and account numbers of JPMorgan''s
trading partners, phone numbers and certain e-mail addresses, it
said. </p>
<p>Potential Harm </p>
<p>The bankruptcy code provides courts with the power to
issue orders that will protect entitles from potential harm that
may result from the disclosure of certain confidential
information, it said in the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. </p>
<p>In the partially uncensored objection to JPMorgan''s claim,
Lehman gave details about the sale of collateral. On the morning
the Lehman brokerage went into liquidation, JPMorgan started to
sell the securities, calling the plan Project Tassimo, after
a coffee maker owned by a bank employee involved in the
transactions, it said. </p>
<p>The sale was handled without any limits or safeguards
ensuring a fair price, Lehman alleged. </p>
<p>Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the largest U.S. bank,
declined to comment on the allegations. Kimberly Macleod, a
Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Separately, JPMorgan is contesting an $8.6 billion lawsuit
by Lehman, saying it was protected by so-called safe harbor law
when it took collateral from the defunct firm in 2008. Congress
created the law to protect banks lending to faltering companies,
JPMorgan has said. </p>
<p>Fraud Allegations </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman''s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, sued Lehman
back, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the loan. </p>
<p>The brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc., is being separately
liquidated from its parent, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., after
going into liquidation four days after its parent. </p>
<p>The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-
13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>The European debt crisis and
government belt-tightening may cause the U.S. economy to slow in
early 2012 even as the risk of it faltering this year has waned,
said JPMorgan Chase  Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman. </p>
<p>As we are picking up some steam, we''re now obviously
facing a new set of drags, mostly emanating from Europe,
Kasman said today in a radio interview on Bloomberg
Surveillance with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. We also have
this uncertainty about where U.S. fiscal policy is heading. </p>
<p>Economic growth may slow to 1 percent early next year on
the back of Europe going into recession and on the back of
fiscal tightening in the U.S., New York-based Kasman said. The
slowdown may lead to a rise in the unemployment rate, which was
at 9.1 percent in September for a third month. </p>
<p>More immediately, Kasman said a waning of headwinds, which
included higher fuel prices and supply disruptions from Japan''s
natural disaster, has helped U.S. growth speed up after
proceeding at a 0.9 percent rate in the first half of this year,
the weakest pace since the recession ended in June 2009. </p>
<p>Gross domestic product expanded at about a 3 percent pace
from July to September, Kasman said. Economists project a 2.5
percent advance, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey ahead of the Commerce Department figures on Oct. 27. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s smoking cessation drug
Chantix doesn''t lead to more hospitalizations than nicotine
replacement therapies such Sanofi''s NicoDerm patches, two U.S.
studies suggest. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration said today it continues to
evaluate the risk of mood changes and other psychiatric events
linked to Chantix after releasing the results of two studies the
agency cautioned had limitations. Both lacked a large enough
sample size to detect rare adverse events or dismiss the
increased risk of episodes that don''t result in
hospitalizations, the FDA said in a safety announcement. </p>
<p>A boxed warning on Chantix, which works by blocking the
effects of nicotine on the brain, cautions patients they could
experience changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed
mood and suicidal thoughts or actions. New York-based Pfizer,
the world''s biggest drugmaker, is conducting a large clinical
trial of the drug to assess neuropsychiatric effects, with
results expected in 2017, the FDA said. </p>
<p>Chantix was approved in May 2006 and 21.8 million
prescriptions were dispensed July 2011, according to the agency. </p>
<p>We are reviewing this important information for smokers
provided by the FDA, MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for Pfizer
said in an e-mail. Given the significant public health risks
of smoking, Chantix is an important treatment option for adult
smokers to help patients stop smoking. </p>
<p>The FDA sponsored two observational studies with Chantix
conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the
Department of Defense. Both studies'' showed no statistically
significant difference in psychiatric hospitalizations. </p>
<p>The Veterans Affairs study included 14,131 Chantix users
and an equal number of nicotine replacement therapy users.
Sixteen Chantix-treated patients were hospitalized for
psychiatric reasons compared to 21 in the replacement therapy
group. </p>
<p>The Pentagon studied 11,978 Chantix users and an equal
number of replacement therapy patients. Patients on Chantix were
hospitalized 18 times for psychiatric reasons compared to 16
times among replacement therapy patients. </p>

<p>Justin Nunez, a former Columbia
University football player in his second year at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), earned the unofficial title of Wall Street''s best
athlete by winning a charity decathlon held at his alma mater. </p>
<p>Nunez, 27, finished atop a field of almost 100 traders,
bankers and financial advisers in the 10-event competition,
which benefits the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. Kyle VanFleet, a former Georgetown University fullback who
also works at Goldman Sachs, was runner-up in the competition
that took place over the weekend. </p>
<p>Nunez finished with 7,095 points -- 27 ahead of VanFleet
and 41 better than Brad Bagdis of Knight Capital Group -- to

<p>Swiss banks will likely settle a
sweeping U.S. probe of offshore tax evasion by paying billions
of dollars and handing over names of thousands of Americans who
have secret accounts, Bloomberg News'' David Voreacos, Klaus
Wille and Giles Broom report. </p>
<p>U.S. and Swiss officials are concluding negotiations on a
civil settlement amid U.S. criminal probes of 11 financial
institutions, including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), suspected of
helping American clients hide money from the Internal Revenue
Service, according to five people with knowledge of the talks
who declined to speak publicly because they are confidential. </p>
<p>Switzerland, the biggest haven for offshore wealth, wants
an end to new U.S. probes while preserving its decades-old
tradition of bank secrecy, the people said. The U.S. seeks data
on Americans who have dodged U.S. taxes and a pledge by Swiss
banks to stop helping such clients, according to the people. The
Swiss reached accords this year with Germany and the U.K. on
untaxed assets. </p>
<p>The Swiss would like to get out of this by paying money,
and they''ve done that with other countries, said tax attorney
H. David Rosenbloom of Caplin  Drysdale Chartered in
Washington, who isn''t involved in the talks. For the U.S.,
it''s not primarily a money question. It''s a matter of making
sure the laws apply fairly among taxpayers. </p>
<p>The Swiss government seeks to outline a final accord for
the Foreign Affairs Committee of its Parliament''s upper house on
Nov. 10, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
number of banks that will pay to resolve the U.S. negotiations
may extend beyond the 11 under criminal investigation, the
people said. </p>
<p>We are aiming for an all-encompassing solution that will
apply to all the banks, Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-
Schlumpf said in an Oct. 4 interview in the Swiss capital Bern.
We don''t want to be confronted with the same issues time and
again. </p>
<p>The Justice Department also may bring criminal charges or
civil enforcement actions against any of the 11 financial
institutions. They could avoid prosecution by separately paying
fines, admitting wrongdoing and disclosing data, the people
said. On Aug. 30, the Justice Department requested statistical
data from the 11 about their U.S. accounts, which the U.S. has
received and is analyzing, the people said. </p>
<p>The group of 11 also includes HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), the
biggest European bank, Basler Kantonalbank (BSKP), Wegelin  Co.,
Zuercher Kantonalbank, and Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), the people
said. Three Israeli banks -- Bank Leumi Le-Israel BM (LUMI), Bank
Hapoalim BM (POLI), and Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF) -- are on the list,
as well as Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG (LLB) and an asset
manager, NZB AG, according to the people. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Sued Over Role in El Paso''s $21 Billion Buyout </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by a pension fund that
alleges the New York-based investment bank had a conflict of
interest in its role as adviser in the planned $21 billion
purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP) by Kinder Morgan Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder
Morgan, steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan, lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed Oct. 20 in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. </p>
<p>In addition to Goldman Sachs, the complaint also names
individual El Paso directors and Kinder Morgan. </p>
<p>While Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser on the
sale, Goldman''s presence tainted the entire process, lawyers
for the retirement fund said in the complaint. Goldman continued
to act as financial adviser on related matters in connection
with the transaction, the pension fund said in the complaint,
citing the companies'' joint press statement. </p>
<p>Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment except to say that the bank''s representatives on
Kinder Morgan''s board recused themselves from the deal process. </p>
<p>Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan,
said in an e-mail that the company doesn''t comment on pending
litigation. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, also
declined to comment. </p>

System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Standard Bank Sues Saudi Billionaire Over $150 Million Debt </p>
<p>Standard Bank Plc sued Saudi billionaire Mohamed bin Issa
al Jaber for $150 million in a London court, saying loans made
to companies in his MBI International  Partners Inc. group
weren''t repaid. </p>
<p>The bank says al Jaber personally guaranteed three loans to
JJW Hotels  Resorts Ltd. and Ajwa for Food Industries Co. in
2008, according to court papers outlining its claim. </p>
<p>Al Jaber, Saudi Arabia''s third-richest man according to
Arabian Business, believes he has a claim against the bank over
a $96.5 million loss from unauthorized foreign-exchange trades,
his lawyer Catharine Otton-Goulder said Oct. 20 at a pre-trial
hearing. </p>
<p>He blames Standard Bank, a unit of Johannesburg-based
Standard Bank Group Ltd., for the trades from a personal account
he held with the company and says the loans were provided to
cover the foreign-exchange losses. </p>
<p>Janice Garraway, a spokeswoman for Standard Bank in London,
declined to comment on the case via e-mail Oct. 20. Gary Pegg,
an attorney for al Jaber, didn''t respond to an e-mail requesting

<p>Brigham Exploration Sued by Shareholders Over Statoil Deal </p>
<p>Brigham Exploration Co. (BEXP) was sued by shareholders contending
that Statoil ASA (STL)''s $4.4 billion buyout price is too low. </p>
<p>The offer price is a discount to the oil and gas producer''s
52-week high trading price, according to separate suits filed by
the same law firm on behalf of shareholders Robert Fioravanti
and Howard Weisberg. </p>
<p>The proposed transaction is the product of a flawed
process that involved no known open auction, Weisberg said
Oct. 20 in a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court. </p>
<p>Statoil said Oct. 17 that it would buy all of Brigham''s
shares for $36.50 each, a 20 percent premium to the company''s
Oct. 14 closing price. The deal is the seventh-largest takeover
announced this year in the oil and gas industry. </p>
<p>Statoil, Norway''s biggest oil company, is using Brigham to
expand into unconventional U.S. assets such as the Bakken shale
area in North Dakota. </p>
<p>The offer price reflects an inadequate premium given
Brigham''s strong growth prospects and is still below the 23
percent average premium for the industry this year, the
shareholders said. </p>
<p>The deal also includes preclusive protection devices
include a clause prohibiting Brigham from seeking a third-party
bid and a $136.5 million termination fee that discourages other
potential buyers, according to the complaints. </p>
<p>Weisberg and Fioravanti are seeking to represent all
Brigham shareholders in their request to bar the transaction. </p>
<p>Rob Roosa, a spokesman for Brigham Exploration, didn''t
return a phone call seeking comment. </p>

<p>ATT Seeks to Knock Out Government''s Ally in T-Mobile Hearing </p>
<p>ATT Inc. (T) will ask a federal judge to throw out Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)''s lawsuit to stop its purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., seeking a decision that would curb Sprint''s ability to
help the U.S. block the deal. </p>
<p>ATT will argue at a hearing today in Washington that
Sprint, as a competitor rather than a consumer, has no right
under antitrust law to bring the suit and that Sprint''s claims
the $39 billion deal would hurt its business are unfounded. </p>
<p>Should ATT persuade U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal
Huvelle to dismiss the case, Sprint''s advice on the Justice
Department''s suit would be limited by its restricted access to
confidential ATT information, said Thomas Horton, a law
professor at the University of South Dakota Law School and
former antitrust attorney in the department. </p>
<p>It will expedite the government''s case to have Sprint as
an official ally, said Horton, who spent about eight years in
the antitrust division. </p>
<p>Sprint told Huvelle on Oct. 12 that to prepare its case it
needed access to confidential data the Justice Department
collected from ATT during the U.S. probe of the proposed T-
Mobile merger. The company said it suffered from fundamental
unfairness because, as a competitor with relevant information,
ATT is allowed to subpoena Sprint documents in the government''s
antitrust case. </p>
<p>Huvelle, overseeing all the ATT cases, froze the document
exchanges while she weighs the motion to dismiss. </p>
<p>The government''s case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-01560;
Sprint''s case is Sprint Nextel Corp. v. ATT Inc., 11-01600; and
Cellular South''s case is Cellular South Inc. v. ATT Inc.,

<p>Goldman Sachs Asks New York Court to Dismiss Allstate Suit </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a judge in New York state
court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Allstate Insurance Co. over
the alleged fraudulent sale of residential mortgage-backed
securities. </p>
<p>The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer sued New York-based
Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Aug. 15 over the sale of more than $100 million worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
including the lost market value of the investments. </p>
<p>Allstate filed the lawsuit and seven similar complaints
against various issuers and underwriters of residential
mortgage-backed securities, using generalities and unsupported
assumptions to recoup investment losses on certificates it
bought in five offerings in 2006, Goldman Sachs said in court
documents filed Oct. 21. </p>
<p>Despite its financial sophistication and expertise
(including in the housing market, where it is a leading
insurer), Allstate now suffers from buyer''s remorse and has sued
the counterparties with which it traded at arm''s length,
claiming in separate actions that each of the eight sellers of
RMBS misled it as to characteristics of the securities,
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. </p>
<p>Allstate has also sued lenders including JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp. (BAC)''s Merrill
Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over residential
mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,
652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Andrew Madoff Seeks Appeal in Picard $198 Million Suit </p>
<p>Andrew Madoff, son of confidence man Bernard L. Madoff,
asked to appeal a bankruptcy judge''s ruling that allowed a $198
million lawsuit by the liquidator of his father''s firm to go
forward, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>Trustee Irving Picard last month won a court ruling
permitting him to pursue most claims in a 2009 lawsuit alleging
that the Madoffs treated the now-defunct firm, Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC, as their family piggy bank. U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland also dismissed some claims in
the case while allowing Picard to file a new complaint. </p>
<p>Andrew Madoff asked a U.S. District Court judge to allow an
appeal, according to Oct. 6 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York. In court papers filed in his own behalf and as
executor of his late brother''s estate, he said the judge''s
decision would result in a massive expansion of liability
for managers of banks and large corporations for the wrongs of
individual units. </p>
<p>Picard opposed Andrew Madoff''s request to appeal Oct. 20,
saying in his court papers that Lifland''s ruling was well-
reasoned and that he would seek to prove his claims at a
trial. </p>
<p>In his lawsuit, Picard said that Madoff family members --
including Bernard''s brother Peter Madoff, sons Andrew and Mark
Madoff and niece Shana Madoff Swanson, all of whom held senior
positions at Madoff Securities -- profited from the fraud. </p>
<p>Instead of preventing the crime, they took $198 million in
investor money from the New York-based money-management firm to
finance a business venture, pay for restaurants, vacations and
clothing and to buy cars, boats and vacation homes, he said. </p>
<p>Picard didn''t try to prove in his complaint that the family
engaged in any kind of securities fraud, dishonesty, or
deception, only that they were derelict in their duty and
misused company funds, he said in the Oct. 20th filing. </p>
<p>Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer for Andrew Madoff and Mark
Madoff''s estate, has said that the Madoff sons didn''t know of
their father''s scheme and that they contacted prosecutors after
their father told them of his fraud. Bernard Madoff is serving a
150-year prison term. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. Madoff, 09-1503, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Kimelman was sentenced a day before Raj Rajaratnam, the
founder of Galleon Group LLC, received an 11-year sentence for
insider trading. Kimelman''s lawyers include Michael Sommer. </p>
<p>The case is USA v. Goffer, 10-00056, U.S. District Court,

<p>Massmart Ruling Failed to Consider Economy, Jobs, Union Says </p>
<p>South African regulators who let Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) buy
control of Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) failed to take account of
negative effects on the economy or jobs, a lawyer for a union
seeking to dismantle the deal said. </p>
<p>The Competition Tribunal has reached a fundamentally
wrong conclusion in its conditional approval of the
acquisition, Paul Kennedy, senior counsel for the South African
Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union, told an appeal
court in Cape Town Oct. 21. Certainly this merger will benefit
the shareholders of the merged parties. It may have very
negative consequences. There is a danger of job losses. </p>
<p>The union is asking the Competition Appeal Court to
overturn the tribunal''s May 31 clearance of Wal-Mart''s purchase
of a 51 percent holding in Johannesburg-based Massmart, South
Africa''s biggest food and general-goods wholesaler. Approval was
subject to the companies promising to refrain from firing
workers for two years and set up a fund to assist local
suppliers and manufacturers. </p>
<p>Wal-Mart, the world''s largest retailer, paid 16.5 billion
rand ($2.05 billion) in June for the stake in Massmart. On June
26, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said it would create
15,000 jobs in South Africa within five years and spend about 60
billion rand more on food or fast-moving consumer goods in the
period, most of which would go to local suppliers. </p>
<p>Kennedy said there was a dearth of information about
what effect the takeover will have on imports and employment,
and that the companies failed to disclose sufficient information
to regulators. </p>
<p>Judge Dennis Davis, the court president, said that while he
had significant difficulty with evidence provided by the
companies, they can''t have information that goes outside the
confines of their business. </p>
<p>David Unterhalter, the retailers'' senior counsel, argued
that takeovers under South African law should be approved
provided they don''t significantly reduce competition. There''s no
onus on companies to prove a takeover is counter to the public
interest, he said. </p>
<p>The three-judge panel will take time to consider its
ruling, Davis said at the conclusion of the hearings Oct. 21,
without specifying a deadline. </p>
<p>Should the court decide against referring the decision back
to the tribunal, it may either uphold the approval of the
takeover or rule that it should have been rejected or subjected
to different conditions, the judge said Oct. 20. </p>

Workers Union v Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Massmart Holdings Ltd.,

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Hedge Fund CEO Brownstein Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading </p>
<p>Drew Bo Brownstein, the founder and chief executive
officer of Denver-based Big 5 Asset Management, pleaded guilty
to trading on inside information about a corporate merger. </p>
<p>Brownstein, 35, made more than $2.5 million in illegal
profits for his hedge fund and for relatives by trading on a tip
in advance of Apache Corp. (APA)''s $2.7 billion acquisition of Mariner
Energy Inc. (ME) in April 2010, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>I''ve severely disappointed my family, colleagues,
investors and friends, Brownstein told U.S. District Judge
Robert Patterson in Manhattan federal court Oct. 21. I''m truly
sorry. </p>
<p>The sentencing guideline is 37 to 46 months with the plea
agreement, the judge said. Brownstein, who pleaded guilty to one
count of securities fraud, will be sentenced on Dec. 20. He was
released on a $500,000 personal recognizance bond. </p>
<p>You had inside information about the fact that Mariner''s
stock would probably go up because it was about to be acquired
by another company, Patterson said to Brownstein. </p>
<p>The tip originated with H. Clayton Peterson of Denver, a
retired former Arthur Andersen partner who served on Mariner
Energy''s board of directors, prosecutors said. Peterson, who was
also a director of Re/Max International Inc. and Lone Pine
Resources Inc., pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in August. His son, Drew, a Denver financial adviser,
pleaded guilty to the same charges. </p>
<p>Clayton Peterson, who was appointed to Mariner''s board in

<p>Macklowe Wins Case Icahn Filed Over Aborted 2006 Reckson Bid </p>
<p>New York developer Harry Macklowe won a jury verdict that
his company doesn''t owe Carl Icahn''s Meadow Star LLC $60 million
for backing away from a 2006 bid to buy six New York skyscrapers
from Reckson Associates Realty Corp. </p>
<p>Macklowe''s attorney, Roger Netzer, said a unanimous jury
voted in favor of his client after two hours of deliberations in
a lawsuit filed in 2008 by Meadow Star, an affiliate of Icahn
Enterprises LP, in New York state court in Manhattan. A verdict
was entered Oct. 19 for Macklowe, according to court records. </p>
<p>Meadow Star alleged Macklowe company WH Rome Partners LLC
failed to put up its half of $1.2 billion to outbid SL Green
Realty Corp. (SLG) for the Reckson buildings, according to court
filings. SL Green paid $4.5 billion in cash and stock to buy all
of Reckson''s holdings. </p>
<p>A deal is a deal and Mr. Macklowe honored his obligations
under the language of the contract that these very sophisticated
parties had agreed to, Netzer said Oct. 22 in a telephone
interview. Herbert Beigel, an attorney who represented Icahn''s
company at trial, declined to comment about the verdict. </p>
<p>The aborted offer cost Icahn $60 million, according to his
complaint. Netzer said Macklowe''s half of the bid wasn''t
required unless certain conditions were met, including a signed
acquisition agreement with Reckson and a guarantee that the bid
wouldn''t exceed $1.2 billion. </p>
<p>The case is Meadow Star LLC v. Harry Macklowe and WH Rome
Partners LLC, 08-603165, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Abbott Said to Agree to Pay $1.3 Billion for Depakote Suits [bn:WBTKR=ABT:US]  </p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories (ABT) [] agreed to pay at least $1.3 billion to
settle claims by the U.S. government and 24 states alleging the
company illegally marketed its Depakote epilepsy drug, people
familiar with the accords said. </p>
<p>Abbott executives, federal prosecutors and state officials
reached a tentative agreement calling for the drugmaker to pay
about $800 million to resolve civil claims over Depakote and
about $500 million in criminal penalties for marketing the
epilepsy medicine for unapproved uses, said three people
familiar with the settlement who declined to be identified
because the agreement hasn''t been made public. Abbott said last
week it was reserving $1.5 billion to cover costs of the
potential settlement. </p>
<p>Settlement negotiations are ongoing, Scott Stoffel, a
spokesman for Abbott, said in a phone interview Oct. 21. He
declined to comment further. Charles Miller, a U.S. Justice
Department spokesman, had no comment on the settlement. </p>
<p>The Abbott Park, Illinois-based company said Oct. 19 that
it will split next year, with one company selling medical
products and the other prescription medicines. Powered by
Humira, an anti-inflammatory with $6.5 billion in annual sales,
the new drugmaker may attract a bid from Merck  Co., Roche
Holding AG or Bayer AG, said Jeffrey Holford, a Jefferies Group
Inc. analyst. </p>
<p>The settlement would be the third-largest illegal
pharmaceutical marketing accord in U.S. history, behind the $2.3
billion Pfizer paid in 2009 over the marketing of its Bextra
painkiller and other drugs and the $1.4 billion Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)
paid the same year over sales of its Zyprexa anti-psychotic
medicine. </p>

<p>News Corp. (NWSA) to Pay $4.8 Million to End Dowler Hacking Case </p>
<p>News Corp.''s U.K. unit agreed to pay 3 million pounds ($4.8
million) to settle claims that its News of the World tabloid
hacked the mobile-phone messages of a murdered schoolgirl in
2002, hampering a police investigation. </p>
<p>The deal -- the biggest payout by News Corp. since the
hacking scandal erupted -- includes a 2 million-pound payment to
the family of Milly Dowler and a 1 million-pound donation to
charity, London-based News International said Oct. 20. News
Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, 80, was personally involved in
the negotiations, a person familiar with the matter said last
month. </p>
<p>When I met with the Dowlers in July, I expressed how
deeply sorry I was for the hurt we had caused this family,
Murdoch said in the statement, which indicated he would
personally pay the 1 million-pound charitable donation. The
behavior that the News of the World exhibited towards the
Dowlers was abhorrent. </p>
<p>The settlement was confirmed by News Corp. the same day as
the New York-based company''s annual shareholder meeting in Los
Angeles. U.K. lawmaker Tom Watson, who is part of a government
probe of the scandal, said he would attend the meeting to speak
against the company''s management. The California Public
Employees'' Retirement System and other large investor groups
have also taken stances aimed at loosening Murdoch''s control,
citing concerns about how the phone-hacking issue was handled. </p>
<p>Reports in July that Dowler''s messages had been
intercepted, hampering a police search when she was still
missing, triggered a public outcry that led News Corp. to close
the 168-year-old tabloid and drop its 7.8 billion-pound bid for
full control of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) The hacking
was previously thought to be limited to celebrities, athletes,
royalty and other public figures. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services provider, added $7 billion
to its share-buyback plan to boost per-share earnings and
investor returns. </p>
<p>The addition brings the size of the repurchase program to
$12.2 billion, as IBM had $5.2 billion remaining of its previous
repurchase authorization, according to a statement from the
Armonk, New York-based company today. Last week, IBM said it had
bought back $11.5 billion of stock this year. </p>
<p>The buyback program, given their exceptional cash flow,
is one of the key elements of continuing to grow their
earnings per share, said Louis Miscioscia, a Collins Stewart
analyst in Boston, who has a buy rating on the stock. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is using buybacks as
he targets operating earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015,
up from $13.35 the company projects for this year. IBM has spent
more than $100 billion on dividends and buybacks since 2003, the
year Palmisano became the chairman. He has also increased
earnings by steering the company toward software and services. </p>
<p>The company has said it plans to spend $50 billion on
buybacks through 2015. In the third quarter, the reduction in
share count contributed 18 cents to earnings of $3.28 a share,
which beat analysts'' estimates. IBM ended the third quarter with
$11.3 billion in cash. </p>
<p>Dividend Increases </p>
<p>IBM also declared a quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share,
payable on Dec. 10. IBM has increased its dividend every year
for 16 years, bumping it to 75 cents in April. Since 2006, IBM
has bumped the dividend up by 10 cents each year, except for in
2009, when the increase was halved amid the recession. </p>
<p>IBM fell 1 percent to $180.36 at the close in New York. The
shares have climbed 23 percent this year. </p>
<p>The buyback extension is in line with IBM''s repurchase
strategy and was largely expected by investors, said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities in New York. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the
world''s largest brokerage, plans to adjust its compensation
structure to boost profitability, according to a person familiar
with the discussions. </p>
<p>The new pay policies are set to go into effect in 2012,
said the person, who declined to be identified because
compensation decisions aren''t public. The New York-based firm is
raising the minimum amount of revenue a broker must generate to
avoid pay cuts to $300,000 from $250,000, the person said. </p>
<p>The plan includes bonuses aimed at giving financial
advisers more incentives to bring in new clients and increase
lending to customers. The changes may bring down the division''s
compensation ratio as President Greg Fleming seeks to achieve
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman''s goal of a pretax profit
margin of more than 20 percent at the unit. </p>
<p>Greg Fleming is very focused on expense discipline,
expense management, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer
Ruth Porat said on a conference call last week. What he''s
focused on is reducing the lower productivity FAs and that
brings with it some incremental cost savings as well. </p>
<p>Compensation costs amounted to 62 percent of the global
wealth management division''s net revenue in the first nine
months of the year, down from 63 percent in the same period of
2010. </p>
<p>Brokers who produce less than $300,000 will receive a
payout of 20 percent of that revenue, instead of 32 percent or
34 percent, the person said. The average annualized revenue per
adviser in the third quarter was $747,000. The firm is also
changing the makeup and vesting schedule of bonuses for
employees who have been with the firm a minimum of five years. </p>
<p>Reuters reported the pay changes earlier today. </p>
<p>Advisers'' Bonuses </p>
<p>Financial advisers'' bonuses based on revenue production
will be reduced by 1 percentage point across the board, the
person said. Brokers can earn as much as $442,500 under new
bonuses that pay as much as 0.40 percentage point on new client
assets and 0.50 percentage point on new mortgages and other
loans sold to customers, according to the person. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought a controlling interest in the joint
venture two years ago and has the option to buy the business
outright from Citigroup Inc. over the next three years. The
division, which Fleming took over in January, had 17,291
advisers and $1.56 trillion in client assets as of Sept. 30. </p>
<p>The brokerage will operate with a mid-teens pretax
margin by the first half of 2013 irrespective of the market,
Fleming, 48, said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television
with Erik Schatzker. Rising equity markets and higher interest
rates may push the margin to 20 percent, he said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the
world''s largest brokerage, will operate with a mid-teens
pretax margin by the first half of 2013 irrespective of the
market, according to Greg Fleming, president of the business. </p>
<p>The brokerage can reach the 20 percent pretax profit-margin
target that Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman
has set for the unit, Fleming, 48, said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television with Erik Schatzker. The division had a 10
percent margin in the first nine months of this year. </p>
<p>Eventually we''ll have a higher SP and higher interest
rates, and that will be the final piece to put us at and over 20
percent, Fleming said. </p>
<p>Investors are looking for an increase in profitability at
the brokerage joint venture, which Morgan Stanley bought a
controlling interest in two years ago. It has the option to buy
the business outright from Citigroup Inc. over the next three
years. The division, which Fleming took over in January, had
17,291 advisers and $1.56 trillion in client assets as of
Sept. 30. </p>
<p>In a Basel 3 world, with the capital standards changing
on some of the trading businesses, these activities are even
more valuable, Fleming said. We don''t think the market today
appreciates the business mix that we have and the earnings power
that it will generate going forward, but we''re willing to be
patient and continue to stay at it and continue to drive higher
margins and better results, and ultimately the market will
reward that. </p>
<p>Fee-Based Accounts </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will increase revenue in part
by raising the amount of assets in its fee-based advisory
consulting accounts, Fleming said. The firm''s goal is to more
than double those assets to $1 trillion during the next five
years, from $465 billion as of Sept. 30. </p>
<p>Fleming said there are three revenue drivers and two
expense levers the brokerage can use to improve
profitability regardless of the market environment. Revenue from
deposits, lending and transaction and advisory services, along
with decreasing integration expenses and cost synergies, will
drive the margin improvement, according to a presentation by
Gorman in February. </p>
<p>A 100-point change in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index and a
50 basis-point change in the Fed Funds rate each would have
about a 1 percentage point effect on the brokerage''s pretax
profit margin, Gorman said in February. </p>

<p>China Isn''t Cutting Piracy Enough, Software Alliance Says </p>
<p>China isn''t reducing software piracy quickly enough and the
government should aim to cut illegal use by 10 percentage points
in the next two years, according to a trade group that tracks
counterfeiting. </p>
<p>The country will eventually surpass the U.S. to become the
industry''s largest source of piracy losses, Robert Holleyman,
chief executive officer of the Business Software Alliance, said
at a press conference in Beijing yesterday. He declined to
provide a more specific forecast. </p>
<p>In China, almost four out of five programs in use are
pirated, the alliance said in its annual report in May. The
$7.78 billion commercial value of software pirated in China last
year was second only to the $9.52 billion lost in the U.S., the
report said. </p>
<p>We are seeing progress, but it''s not progress at the pace
we would have liked to have seen or anticipated, Holleyman
told reporters. Virtually everyone agrees, piracy in China is
higher than it should be. </p>
<p>China isn''t currently on pace to achieve a 10 percent age-
point reduction over the next two years, Holleyman said. </p>
<p>Should that target be reached in four years, it would
result in creation of 250,000 industry jobs and generate $4
billion in tax revenue in China, Holleyman said. </p>
<p>The percentage of software in China that is pirated dropped
to 78 percent last year, from 79 percent in 2009 and 92 percent
in 2003, according to the May report. While the proportion of
stolen software has declined, its value has increased as the
Chinese software market expands, the report said. </p>
<p>Holleyman called on the country to update its copyright law
to provide for criminal offenses for piracy and said the country
wouldn''t see a significant decline in the practice unless it
takes that step. The group will ramp up lawsuits against
users of unlicensed software, he said, without giving details. </p>
<p>China has said it increased enforcement of intellectual
property rights. Last year, Chinese courts ruled on 48,051 cases
of intellectual property rights violations, a gain of 33 percent
from the previous year, Wang Shengjun, president of the Supreme
People''s Court, said in a report to the National People''s
Congress on March 11. </p>
<p>The value of pirated software worldwide rose 14 percent to
$58.8 billion in 2010, almost double the total in 2003,
according to the group. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD), maker of
Gulfstream business jets and Abrams tanks, said third-quarter
profit rose 2.5 percent as sales of aircraft and combat vehicles
increased. </p>
<p>Profit from continuing operations advanced to $665 million,
or $1.83 a share, from $649 million, or $1.70, the Falls Church,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
predicted $1.77 a share, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jay Johnson said today that he
forecasts full-year profit at the high end of the $7.15 to
$7.20 per share range. Analysts are forecasting $7.19 per share,
the average of 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>As we plan for 2012, the defense market is shrouded by
the uncertainty of Pentagon funding, Johnson said in an
earnings conference call. Congress has not yet approved a
Pentagon budget for fiscal year 2012, which started Oct. 1, and
a special congressional committee has been tasked with finding
ways to trim government spending by at least $1.2 trillion. </p>
<p>It''s clear that defense spending will be part of
addressing our nation''s economic problems, Johnson said. The
manner and degree to which cuts are made will dictate how they
impact our industry. </p>
<p>Looks Resilient'' </p>
<p>Total sales declined 2 percent to $7.85 billion. General
Dynamics had about $2.16 billion in cash on hand for the quarter
ending July 3. </p>
<p>This was another good operating performance from General
Dynamics, with margins offsetting some top-line weakness,
Robert Stallard, a New York-based analyst for RBC Capital
Markets, wrote in a note to clients today. Gulfstream backlog
continues to grow, and it looks like the G650 is still on
track. He has an outperform rating on the stock. </p>
<p>Sales at the Aerospace unit, the maker of Gulfstream jets,
rose 9.4 percent to $1.41 billion from $1.29 billion the year
before. Profit at the unit rose 9 percent to $217 million from
$199 million. </p>
<p>General Dynamics'' Gulfstream unit is adding new models as
demand for business jets starts to rebound, according to unit
President Larry Flynn. Gulfstream expects to boost deliveries
about 10 percent this year and more than 15 percent next year as
the long-range G650 enters service, Flynn said in a recent
interview. </p>
<p>G650 Certification </p>
<p>General Dynamics expects provisional certification for the
G650 in the next several weeks, Johnson said today. </p>
<p>For the G280 jet, the company anticipates Israeli
certification by the end of the year. U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration certification is expected to slip into the first
part of 2012, according to Johnson. </p>
<p>During the quarter the Aerospace unit received an order for
20 Gulfstream aircraft, worth $810 million, from Minsheng
Financial Leasing, a Chinese aviation leasing company. </p>
<p>Sales at the Combat Systems unit, which manufactures Abrams
tanks and Stryker vehicles, rose 3.4 percent to $2.14 billion. </p>
<p>Profit rose 2.6 percent to $319 million. General Dynamics
during the quarter was awarded $440 million for the technology
development phase of the U.S. Army''s new ground combat vehicle
program. </p>
<p>Stryker Contract </p>
<p>The Army also awarded General Dynamics $250 million to
produce 115 Stryker vehicles with a double V-shaped hull to
protect against roadside bombs, the company said in its earnings
statement today. </p>
<p>In addition, General Dynamics received an order from the
Canadian government to upgrade the Canadian Army''s fleet of LAV
III combat vehicles. The order was valued at $1.05 billion. </p>
<p>The Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology
units had a decline in revenue and reported an increase in
profit. </p>
<p>Revenue at the Marine Systems unit, which builds nuclear-
powered submarines and Navy destroyers, fell 4.6 percent to
$1.62 billion, while profit rose 2.4 percent to $173 million.
During the quarter, the unit received a $1.8 billion order from
the U.S. Navy for the engineering, design and construction of
two DDG-1000 destroyers, which are scheduled for delivery in
2015 and 2018. </p>
<p>Information unit sales fell 9.2 percent to $2.68 billion
and profit rose 1.3 percent to $310 million, the company said in
its statement today. </p>
<p>Two Acquisitions </p>
<p>Johnson has said that acquisitions are very important
to General Dynamics, both to expand its current portfolio and to
fill gaps. </p>
<p>General Dynamics on Sept. 30 completed the acquisition of
Vangent Holding Corp., the parent company of Vangent Inc., a
health-care information technology provider to the federal
government. The cash transaction was valued at about $960
million. </p>
<p>It announced on Sept. 21 that it had bought privately held,
400-employee Metro Machine Corp., an East Coast surface-ship
repair company that supports the Navy''s fleet in Norfolk,
Virginia. The government approved the deal on Oct. 19. General
Dynamics did not disclose the value of the cash transaction. </p>
<p>The company said it expects both acquisitions to be
accretive to the company''s earnings beginning in 2012. </p>
<p>General Dynamics fell $1.37, or 2.1 percent, to $63.89. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is among
firms that could gain by buying part or all of MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MF), said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale
Securities LLC. </p>
<p>Goldman could benefit from MF Global''s plight, Bove
said in a note today. One might argue that Goldman is over
capitalized and that it has too much liquidity. Buying some or
all of MF Global might create the opportunity to make a windfall
profit. </p>
<p>MF Global, run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jon Corzine, is exploring strategic options, including a potential
sale, after reporting its biggest quarterly loss ever and having
its credit ratings cut by Moody''s Investors Service, a person
with knowledge of the matter said today. </p>
<p>The firm needs to generate liquidity and find a partner
with excess capital and a sizable trading operation, Bove
said in a telephone interview. Goldman Sachs, which Corzine
helped run from 1994 to 1999, and Citigroup Inc., both based in
New York, would be logical buyers, he said. </p>
<p>David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos at Citigroup declined to comment. </p>
<p>Large deposit-taking banks may not want to buy MF Global
because they would have to set aside cash to back the futures
trades placed by the firm''s customers, said Allan Zavarro, the
former global head of futures trading for ABN Amro Bank NV.
Regulatory capital in the range of 6 percent to 10 percent of
client funds on deposit must be set aside by the broker or bank,
Zavarro said. </p>
<p>Capital Allocation </p>
<p>I''m not sure the big banks would want a big futures
position on their books now because they have to allocate
regulatory capital to it, he said in an Oct. 25 telephone
interview. As of Aug. 31, MF Global had $7.2 billion of customer
funds in segregated accounts, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. </p>
<p>In 2008, MF Global sold $300 million in preferred shares
and notes to the public and as much as $300 million in equity-
linked securities to buyout firm JC Flowers  Co. to help repay
a $1.05 billion bridge loan. </p>
<p>Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR), the investment bank founded by
former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, might also
show interest in a deal with MF Global, Bove said. The firm is
advising MF Global on the review of its business, said a person
with knowledge of the matter today. Evercore may be interested
in providing advisory clients with the ability to raise funds
through a fixed-income trading platform, Bove said. </p>
<p>It wouldn''t surprise me at all if Evercore jumped up as a
company that was going to acquire them, he said. Such a deal
might not resolve MF Global''s liquidity needs, he said. </p>
<p>Evercore would more likely be interested in fee-based, low-
capital-intensive businesses, said Warren Gardiner, an analyst
for Ticonderoga Securities LLC. </p>
<p>Dana Gorman, a spokesman for Evercore, declined to comment. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised holdings in the past year in the
London Metal Exchange, the 134-year old bourse that''s facing a
possible takeover. </p>
<p>Goldman increased its stake in LME Holdings Ltd. by 330,000
ordinary shares to 1.23 million shares as of Sept. 26, according
to filings with the U.K.''s Companies House. JPMorgan owned
800,000 shares compared with 550,000 shares a year earlier,
while ScotiaMocatta transferred 30,000 shares in the period to
leave the company with no shares, the filings show. </p>
<p>The LME, which handles 80 percent of global trade in metals
futures, told members last month that it would begin a process
that may lead to an acceptable offer for the company being
received. Any sale would take at least until the end of the
second quarter to complete, Martin Abbott, chief executive
officer, said earlier this month. The bourse operates London''s
last open-outcry transactions in which traders shout out orders. </p>
<p>The exchange issues two share classes. Ordinary shares
confer ownership and 330,000 of them traded at 4.925 pounds
($7.89) in July, according to data on the bourse''s website. B
shares exchanged hands at 85.425 pounds on Sept. 27. Neither
shares trade on an exchange. </p>

latest holdings. Sophie Bullock, Goldman''s spokeswoman, declined

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson may struggle to reach his full-year
production target after rallying oil prices reduced the
company''s take from wells in Africa and output slumped in the
U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>Exxon, the world''s largest company by market value, needs
to boost production in the current quarter to the equivalent of
5 million barrels a day to meet the 4 percent growth target for
2011 that Tillerson set forth during a March presentation to
analysts in New York. </p>
<p>The closest Exxon ever came to pumping that much crude and
natural gas was during the final three months of 2010, when
daily output reached 4.97 million barrels. Even with new wells
in Iraq and Russia adding to the company''s global production,
Tillerson may fall short of the mark, said Allen Good, an oil-
industry analyst at Morningstar Investment Services Inc. in
Chicago. </p>
<p>I''d be surprised if they hit that number, Good said
during a telephone interview. They''re having long-term trouble
growing oil volumes and I don''t see how they get to five
million barrels a day. </p>
<p>Exxon''s worldwide oil and gas production declined by 3.8
percent during the July-to-September period to the equivalent of
4.28 million barrels of crude a day, the Irving, Texas-based
company said yesterday in a statement. It was the lowest output
since the second quarter of last year and the largest decline
since 2008, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Production Agreements </p>
<p>When international crude prices rise, energy prospectors
such as Exxon receive a smaller portion of output from wells
governed by production-sharing contracts in countries like
Nigeria. In Africa, which accounts for more than one-fifth of
Exxon''s global crude supply, the company''s output tumbled 24
percent during the quarter, the biggest decline anywhere in the
world. </p>
<p>In Europe, Exxon''s crude output dropped 16 percent,
according to a company statement. U.S. oil production from Exxon
wells declined by 5.8 percent. The company boosted crude output
in Asia by 7.3 percent to 806,000 barrels a day. </p>
<p>Excluding the impacts of higher crude prices, asset sales
and quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Exxon''s output was unchanged from a year earlier,
David Rosenthal, the company''s vice president of investor
relations, said during a conference call with analysts
yesterday. </p>
<p>Major Producer </p>
<p>On that basis, Exxon may be able to meet its full-year
production forecast, he said during the call. In March, at the
company''s annual presentation to the investment community at the
New York Stock Exchange, Tillerson forecast production growth of
as much as 4 percent this year. </p>
<p>Such a growth rate would translate into full-year average
daily output equivalent to 4.625 million barrels, compared with
4.447 in 2010, based on Bloomberg calculations. </p>
<p>Exxon pumps about 3 percent of the world''s oil, producing
more than OPEC members such as Kuwait and Algeria, according to
International Energy Agency figures. The company''s $396 billion
market valuation exceeds the economic output of all but 22
nations. </p>
<p>Exxon is outperforming its biggest rivals, advancing 12
percent since the end of last year. PetroChina Co. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), the second- and third-largest oil companies by
market value, have increased 2.2 percent and 10 percent,
respectively. </p>
<p>Exxon abandoned a well in the Turkish sector of the Black
Sea during the third quarter that failed to find oil or gas,
Rosenthal said yesterday. The dry hole followed recent
exploration failures by the company in Brazil, where Exxon is
attempting to sell a 25 percent stake in an offshore prospect. </p>
<p>Unconventional Prospects </p>
<p>Tillerson is spending as much as $37 billion this year to
search for crude, erect gas-liquefaction plants and expand
refineries and chemical plants. The company spent $38 billion in
the past 16 months acquiring shale-rock formations and the
expertise to crack them as part of Tillerson''s move into so-
called unconventional prospects that require intensive drilling
techniques. </p>
<p>Exxon also is counting on production increases from mega-
projects such as the Kearl oil-sands development in Canada, the
West Qurna oilfield in Iraq and Sakhalin-1, an offshore oil and
gas project in Russia''s Far East, said Douglas Ober, whose $1.6
billion under management includes Exxon shares at Adams Express
Co (ADX) and Petroleum  Resources Corp. (PEO) in Baltimore. </p>
<p>Project Pipeline </p>
<p>They are probably going to fall a little short of the
production target this year, said Ober, whose holdings include
1.6 million Exxon shares. That said, they''ve got a bunch of
projects coming on stream in the next couple of years that will
add a lot to output. To expect them to keep having new projects
come online constantly is unrealistic. </p>
<p>Exxon''s output during the current quarter probably will get
a boost as the European winter begins and rising furnace use
increases demand for gas from Exxon-run fields in countries such
as the Netherlands, Morningstar''s Good said. European wells
account for 25 percent of the company''s worldwide gas
production. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest company by market value, said net income exceeded $10
billion for a third consecutive quarter as rallying crude prices
more than made up for the biggest production decline in three
years. </p>
<p>Oil and natural-gas production fell 3.8 percent to the
equivalent of 4.28 million barrels of crude a day, the largest
decline since the third quarter of 2008, according to Bloomberg
data. The drop was smaller than the double-digit production
shortfalls reported earlier this week by rivals such as BP Plc,
ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp. (HES) </p>
<p>Third-quarter profit rose to $10.33 billion, or $2.13 a
share, from $7.35 billion, or $1.44, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said today in a Business Wire statement. The
per-share result was in line with the average estimate of 19
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 32 percent to $125
billion. </p>
<p>These guys keep pushing the oil out and selling it like
it''s going out of style, Douglas Ober, who manages $1.6
billion at Adams Express Co. and Petroleum  Resources Corp. in
Baltimore. </p>
<p>$10 Billion Streak </p>
<p>The last time Exxon''s quarterly profits exceeded $10
billion for three consecutive periods was 2008, when Brent oil
touched an all-time record of $147.50 a barrel and the company
reaped $45.22 billion in full-year net income. So far this year,
Exxon shares have risen 12 percent, poised for the best annual
performance since 2007. </p>
<p>Exxon''s 41 percent profit increase was the second-largest
among major international oil companies that have announced
third-quarter results. Only Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the world''s
third-largest energy company by market value behind Exxon and
PetroChina Co., boasted a larger jump, by doubling net income to
$7 billion. </p>
<p>State-controlled PetroChina lifted third-quarter profit by
7.8 percent. BP Plc, owner of the Macondo well that erupted last
year and fouled the Gulf of Mexico with millions of barrels of
crude, posted a 3.6 percent decline in net income.
ConocoPhillips (COP), based in Houston, said third-quarter profit fell
14 percent. </p>
<p>Rounding out the largest international oil companies,
Chevron Corp. and France''s Total SA are scheduled to announce
results tomorrow, followed by Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo
Brasileiro next month. </p>
<p>Spending Plans </p>
<p>Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world''s oil, jumped 46 percent during the July-through-September
period to average $112.09 a barrel. </p>
<p>Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson plans to spend
as much as $37 billion this year to find untapped oil and gas
reserves, construct gas-export terminals and expand refineries
and chemical plants. In August, Tillerson signed a $3.2 billion
agreement with Russia''s state-controlled OAO Rosneft to drill
wells in the Black Sea and offshore Arctic. </p>
<p>In exchange, Moscow-based Rosneft will be allowed to invest
in some deep-water Gulf of Mexico and onshore Texas prospects,
David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, said
today during a conference call with analysts. Exxon won''t swap
any assets with Rosneft, he said. </p>
<p>Outlining Growth </p>
<p>The Rosneft deal was Exxon''s biggest transaction since its
$34.9 billion acquisition last year of XTO Energy, a Fort Worth,
Texas-based natural-gas producer. Tillerson is using XTO''s
expertise in cracking open dense, gas-rich shale rock to access
previously-impenetrable geologic formations in Poland and
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Exxon shares rose 1 percent to $81.88 at the closing of
trading in New York. The stock has 14 buy recommendations from
analysts, 11 holds and two sells. </p>
<p>Exxon''s crude output fell 7.1 percent to 2.25 million
barrels a day, led by declines in Africa, the U.S. and Europe,
according to the statement. The company raised gas output in
Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>A well in the Turkish sector of the Black Sea that failed
to discover oil or gas has been plugged and abandoned, Exxon''s
Rosenthal said today. </p>
<p>Exxon plans to begin drilling for oil in the Romanian
sector of the Black Sea next year and the Russian sector in
2014, Rosenthal said. </p>
<p>In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the company today increased its
estimate for the size of the column of oil-soaked rock
discovered in the Hadrian prospect to 1,000 feet (305 meters)
from a previous 750-foot estimate. The figure was revised after
additional drilling, Rosenthal said. In June, when the discovery
was announced, Exxon said the field probably holds the
equivalent of 700 million barrels of crude. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) reported its biggest
quarterly profit in three years, outperforming other major oil
companies, as rising crude prices and proceeds from the sale of
a refinery made up for a slump in production. </p>
<p>Third-quarter net income more than doubled to $7.83
billion, or $3.92 a share, from $3.77 billion, or $1.87, a year
earlier, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a
statement today. Excluding a gain from the sale of a Welsh
refinery, the per-share result was 22 cents more than the
average of 19 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chevron quit the European oil-refining market in August
when it sold the U.K. refinery and related assets to Valero
Energy Corp. (VLO), a transaction that accounted for $500 million of
third-quarter results. Production fell to the equivalent of 2.6
million barrels of oil a day, from 2.74 million for the same
period last year. Sales rose 30 percent to $64.4 billion. </p>
<p>They are benefiting from higher crude prices and
strategic asset sales, Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire
Advisory  Research Inc., a Chicago-based risk-management
consultant to the energy industry. I''d expect production to
bounce back in the near future. </p>
<p>Oil and natural-gas production was less than the 2.63
million barrels a day forecast by Paul Cheng, a New York-based
analyst at Barclays Plc. Two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico,
maintenance work at oil installations and less production from
some overseas joint ventures hurt output, the company said. </p>
<p>Chevron posted the largest year-on-year third-quarter
profit increase among major international oil producers that
have announced results. </p>
<p>Other Results </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc''s 100 percent gain was the second-
largest, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp., which reported a 41
percent increase, and Total SA, which boosted profit by 13
percent. PetroChina Co. said net income rose 7.8 percent, while
BP Plc and ConocoPhillips saw profit decline. </p>
<p>Chevron is the strongest of the majors right now, said
Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis
who rates the shares a buy. Even with production coming in
a little lower than my expectations, they offset that with
pretty strong refining results. </p>
<p>Chevron was paid an average of $103 for each barrel of
crude produced outside the U.S. during the quarter, up 47
percent from $70 a year earlier, the company said. International
oil prices soared as growing demand bumped up against supply
constraints in Libya. Chevron gets 74 percent of its crude
outside the U.S., according to an Aug. 4 regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Chevron rose less than 1 percent to close at $109.64 in New
York. The shares have gained 20 percent this year. </p>
<p>Profit from oil and gas sales climbed 74 percent to $6.2
billion, the company said. Refining profits more than tripled to
$1.99 billion from $565 million. </p>
<p>The proceeds from the sale of the Pembroke refinery in
Wales accounted for 22 cents a share in profit, Youngberg said. </p>

<p>Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd.,
an Australian hedge fund, filed a new lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over the sale of securities known as Timberwolf
and Point Pleasant after a similar complaint was dismissed. </p>
<p>The suit, filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan by Basis Capital''s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, accuses
New York-based Goldman Sachs of knowingly making materially
false and misleading statements and omissions in connection
with the securities. </p>
<p>Within weeks after BYAFM entered into these transactions,
they precipitously declined in value, as defendants knew and
intended they would, Basis Capital said in the complaint. As
a result, BYAFM lost more than $67 million plus consequential
damages. </p>
<p>A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital over the securities
was dismissed this year by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan, who ruled the Australian fund couldn''t use U.S.
securities laws to pursue its claims against Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Jones''s ruling followed a decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court last year in Morrison v. National Australia Bank. In that
decision, the high court said U.S. securities laws don''t apply
to the claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S. securities on
foreign exchanges. </p>
<p>Not Misled </p>
<p>Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, said the U.S. bank acted appropriately and Basis Capital
wasn''t misled. </p>
<p>Basis and Goldman Sachs relied on the same data on the
underlying mortgages and both were well aware of the prevailing
global market conditions, Naylor said in a phone interview
today. Goldman Sachs was also an investor in Timberwolf
securities and lost several hundred million dollars. </p>
<p>The suit filed yesterday relates to Point Pleasant, a
collateralized debt obligation based on subprime residential
home mortgages, and two credit default swaps that referenced
securities from a similar CDO known as Timberwolf, Basis Capital
said in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Basis accuses Goldman Sachs of marketing new CDO
investments in early 2007, after the company had already
determined that the value of securities in that market would
likely go into sharp decline in the near future, and used the
new CDOs as a vehicle to short the market, the lawsuit says. </p>
<p>Basis Capital said Goldman was formalizing its Timberwolf
deal with the fund during the same week that a Goldman Sachs
executive sent an e-mail describing the Timberwolf investment as
one shi--y deal. </p>
<p>Key Part'' </p>
<p>The Point Pleasant and Timberwolf offerings were a key
part of this Goldman strategy, and provided a vehicle for
Goldman to unload its toxic inventory and to profit from the
decline in value of the very securities it was recommending that
its clients purchase. </p>
<p>Basis Capital is seeking to recover the $67 million and
$1 billion in punitive damages, according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master), 652996/2011,
New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, added M. Michele Burns as an
independent director, expanding its board to 12 members and
adding a third woman to the board for the first time. </p>
<p>Burns, 53, was chairman and chief executive officer of
Mercer, a unit of Marsh  McLennan Cos., until earlier this
month, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a statement today.
She was recently named to plan and design a new retirement
policy center for Marsh  McLennan, Goldman Sachs said. Her
election was effective yesterday. </p>
<p>Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, has been seeking
new directors since H. Lee Scott, the former Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) CEO, left Goldman Sachs''s board earlier this year and Brown
University President Ruth Simmons stepped off the board in May
2010. Goldman Sachs, which reported its second quarterly loss in
12 years as a public company this month, named Barnard College
President Debora L. Spar to the board in June. </p>
<p>Burns and Spar join Lois D. Juliber, the former Colgate-
Palmolive Co. vice chairman who has served on the Goldman Sachs
board since March 2004, in making women represent one quarter of
the board''s members. Rival banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. each have two female
directors. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is winning
higher ratings from analysts than Apple Inc. (AAPL), the iPad maker
that doubled since its low last year, after the European debt
crisis battered the U.S. bank''s shares. </p>
<p>The two companies are among 15 in the Standard  Poor''s
1500 Composite where buy recommendations made up 85 percent
of analyst ratings and there were no sells, data compiled by
Bloomberg Rankings as of Oct. 24 show. Stocks with fewer than 15
analysts covering them were excluded. For JPMorgan, the total
was 89.5 percent, compared with 87.5 percent at Apple. </p>
<p>JPMorgan shares are lagging behind the Standard  Poor''s
500 Index by 15 percentage points this year after investors sold
banks amid concern the European crisis would prompt losses.
Following its decline, no other financial institution in the
U.S. has more support from analysts. </p>
<p>It shouldn''t be beaten up, Jeff Harte, a Chicago-based
financial analyst at Sandler O''Neill  Partners LP, said in a
telephone interview on Oct. 26. During the last financial crisis
in 2008, JPMorgan capitalized on others'' weakness. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, topped Bank of America Corp.
as the biggest U.S. lender by assets as of Sept. 30 and posted
more trading revenue than any other Wall Street firm for the
fourth straight quarter. </p>
<p>The company was profitable every quarter during 2007 and
2008 as the collapse of the subprime mortgage market prompted
$2.1 trillion in writedowns and losses at banks, brokerages and
other financial firms worldwide. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon bought Bear Stearns Cos. and the banking unit of
Washington Mutual Inc. amid the turmoil three years ago. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Drop </p>
<p>JPMorgan has retreated 13 percent since Dec. 31, while the
SP 500 posted a gain of 2.1 percent, turning positive for the
year yesterday for the first time since Aug. 3. The stock, which
had 34 buy ratings and four holds as of Oct. 24, is
beating its peers. The diversified financials group in the SP
500 has slumped 20 percent in 2011. </p>
<p>JPMorgan tends to be run more conservatively, which is
probably why it''s liked by its analysts, Craig Hodges,
president of Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management Inc., who
oversees about $700 million, said in an Oct. 26 phone interview. </p>
<p>Besides JPMorgan and Apple, the 15 companies include Google
Inc. (GOOG) and Halliburton Co. (HAL), according to Bloomberg data. The most-
favored stocks in the SP 500 beat the entire index since the
last bear market ended 2 1/2 years ago, the data show. They
returned 144 percent on average since March 9, 2009, versus 90
percent for the SP 500. Since the index peaked this year in
April, the 15 stocks have lagged behind, falling 3 percentage
points more than the measure. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, plans to hire staff and be physically
present in West and central Africa''s French-speaking nations,
regional General Manager Simon Ouattara said. </p>
<p>So far this year, the Redmond, Washington-based company has
placed employees in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Guinea, Benin and
Republic of Congo and plans to be present in all 17 Francophone
nations in the region, as well as Cape Verde and Sierra Leone,
Ouattara said in an interview in Abidjan, Ivory Coast''s
commercial capital, yesterday. </p>
<p>Microsoft wants to support our partners better by placing
the managers closer to them, Victoria N''dee Uwadoka, marketing
manager for the region, wrote in an e-mailed response to
questions. Our interest is basically to increase the business
opportunities for Microsoft and also for our partners, she
said. </p>
<p>Ouattara said Microsoft wants to take advantage of
investments other companies are making in the West African
nation, which is seeking to lure investment and boost growth
following a violent post-election crisis. </p>
<p>There is a mass of initiatives and projects in the
country at the moment, and a lot of companies are equipping
themselves again in software, he said. </p>
<p>Ivory Coast''s economy may contract 5.8 percent this year
after the crisis that was sparked by ex-leader Laurent Gbagbo''s
refusal to cede power to Alassane Ouattara after a November
election. Businesses shut their doors, banks closed their
branches and cocoa exports were largely halted in the world''s
biggest producer of the chocolate ingredient. </p>
<p>In April, Gbagbo was captured in Abidjan and a month later,
Ouattara sworn in as leader. The economy may expand 8.5 percent
next year as cocoa exports and gold mining increases along with
spending on electricity and roads. </p>
<p>Microsoft currently has offices in Senegal and Cameroon and
staff in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said the company''s
Ouattara, who is not related to the president. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s purchases of
Treasury securities in Brazil, where benchmark yields averaged
almost 12 percent this month, helped push the bank''s holdings in
South America''s biggest economy 40 percent higher in two months. </p>
<p>Assets at JPMorgan''s Brazilian unit jumped to 22.5 billion
reais ($12.6 billion) as of Aug. 31 from 16.2 billion on June
30, Claudio Berquo, chief executive officer of the business,
said in an interview in Sao Paulo. About 4 percent is company
loans and most of the rest is Treasury securities, according to
the unit''s chief financial officer, Cristiano Almeida. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve''s policy of keeping its benchmark
interest rate near zero percent in the U.S. is pushing
investments offshore, said Richard Bove, a bank analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC. Brazil''s real-denominated bonds
returned 14 percent in the past year, compared with the 7
percent average return in local currency terms on JPMorgan''s
government bond index for emerging markets. </p>
<p>We are having a wonderful year in Brazil, better than
planned, Berquo, 50, said. </p>
<p>Bond purchases by the New York-based bank contributed to a
46 percent jump in earnings from Brazil in the first eight
months of 2011, to 94.5 million reais, even after the bank
boosted expenses to continue investing in the country, according
to Almeida. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. have also
targeted Brazil for a bigger share of their investments. New
York-based Goldman Sachs said earlier this year that Brazil was
one of three countries, along with China and India, where most
of its hiring efforts have been concentrated. Citigroup, also
based in New York, added more than 340 employees in Brazil in
the month of March alone. </p>
<p>U.S. banks have got to find growth somewhere, and they''re
not going to find it in the United States if the economy is
going to lope along at the current level, said Bove, whose
company is based in Lutz, Florida. </p>
<p>Loans to Brazilian companies represent a small percentage
of JPMorgan''s assets in the country because the bank has only
just started offering credit denominated in reais, Berquo said.
Dollar loans remain the majority of JPMorgan''s lending to
companies in the country, and those assets, which Berquo
declined to quantify, are booked in New York. </p>
<p>The Brazilian unit had 952.9 million reais of loans
outstanding as of Sept. 11, about twice as much as the level in
December 2009, he said, adding that the bank''s goal is to lend
to the top 300 Brazilian firms with annual revenue above 1
billion reais. </p>
<p>Room to Grow </p>
<p>We are already doing business with half of these
companies, but we still have a lot of room to grow, he said. </p>
<p>Europe''s debt crisis will crimp the amount of credit
international banks are willing to lend Brazilian companies and
banks, Berquo said. A lot of banks will cut credit to
Brazilian clients and the spreads are going to go up, and that
trend may be an opportunity for JPMorgan to gain market share,
he said. </p>
<p>As part of that effort, JPMorgan moved about 923 million
reais in capital into Brazil in September, and we will bring
in as much as needed, Berquo said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the 23rd largest bank by capital in Brazil as
of June 30, with 1.7 billion reais, according to central bank
figures. Itau Unibanco Holding SA, the biggest, had 67.2 billion
reais. </p>
<p>Oil and Gas </p>
<p>We want to finance the biggest oil and gas projects, the
infrastructure projects, we want to be a big credit bank in
Brazil, Berquo said, adding that trade finance and export-
prepayment loans are also being targeted. </p>
<p>But we are also planning to start participating in the
local bond markets, which are open right now and more attractive
than international markets, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan hired Ricardo Leoni from Santander to head fixed
income in Brazil, and plans to bring on more people after the
end of the bonus season in February, Berquo said. JPMorgan has
more than doubled its headcount, to 750 employees from 339,
since Berquo came back from New York to head the Brazilian
operation at the end of 2009. </p>
<p>The bank is also expanding in asset-management for larger
companies and institutional investors and has 40 people devoted
to the business so far. </p>
<p>Last year, JPMorgan bought Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the
wealth-management company founded by former Brazilian central
bank Governor Arminio Fraga, for an undisclosed amount. The bank
also has a private-equity arm, One Equity Partners, to invest
JPMorgan''s own money. That business in Brazil is run by Veronica
Serra, the daughter of Jose Serra, who ran for the presidency
last year against Dilma Rousseff and lost. </p>
<p>We will keep growing in the asset-management business, in
private and corporate banking, Berquo said, adding that the
plan is to reach 1,000 employees by the end of 2014. </p>

<p>(Corrects number of index members in eighth paragraph.) </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of top-seller Lipitor to help cushion
tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic versions reach
the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. </p>
<p>Lipitor, which is Pfizer''s biggest product, loses U.S.
patent protection on Nov. 30. The New York-based company is
looking for ways to replace its $10.7 billion in annual revenue
as cheaper copies drive down prices. </p>
<p>There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace, Read said today on a conference
call discussing third-quarter earnings. A nonprescription
version of Lipitor wouldn''t be available until at least 2013
because of the regulatory process to get it approved, he said. </p>
<p>We have no definitive evidence we can do it, Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. </p>
<p>The loss of Lipitor''s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said
yesterday in a report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the
top spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. </p>
<p>Rapid'' Decline </p>
<p>Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be very rapid. Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. We believe it would be economically
important, but you have to look in the context of some of the
larger OTC brands, he said. The company''s Advil and Centrum
nonprescription drugs generate $175 million to $250 million each
per quarter, Chief Financial Officer Frank D''Amelio said in the
interview. </p>
<p>Pfizer increased 1.3 percent to $19.50 at 3:10 p.m. New
York time, while the other 29 companies in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average index fell. </p>
<p>Divesting Units </p>
<p>The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. </p>
<p>The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor''s
prescription. </p>
<p>Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) for $16.6 billion. </p>
<p>Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer reported third-quarter earnings today that beat the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by 6 cents
a share, as increased sales overseas and favorable exchange
rates helped boost revenue. Profit excluding one-time items was
62 cents a share. </p>
<p>Net income increased more than fourfold to $3.74 billion,
or 48 cents a share, from a year earlier when the company had
charges related to an acquisition and asbestos litigation,
Pfizer said in a statement. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) seeks a lien on
all of MF Global Holdings Ltd.''s assets and may have a lien on
its operating account balance of $26.6 million, the bank said. </p>
<p>MF Global, which filed for bankruptcy with assets of $41
billion, has five operating accounts, all with JPMorgan. The
bank may have a lien on the entire balance because of so-called
setoff rights related to a credit line to MF Global where it
acts and agent and lender, the New York-based bank said in a
filing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan asserts, and the debtors admit, that by virtue
of such setoff rights, such funds may be subject to liens in
favor of'' JPMorgan, it said. </p>
<p>Lenders move to protect themselves after a bankruptcy
filing. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, made the statement in
an objection filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today
to a cash management plan proposed by the company. Limits should
be placed on the company''s use of cash, it said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan holds less than $80 million of the MF Global''s
debt, said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank and acts as an agent to lenders for a $1.2 billion
credit line to MF Global Holdings and a $300 million credit line
to its broker-dealer unit. </p>
<p>Protect Collateral </p>
<p>JPMorgan seeks the on all of MF Global''s assets to protect
its collateral, including proceeds of potential lawsuits, as
well as reimbursement for its own legal fees in the bankruptcy,
it said in the filing. The bank also asked Bankruptcy Court
judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan to limit intercompany transfers
and order the company to deliver it a budget and full list of
its assets. MF Global has asked to have until Jan. 30 to report
a full list of its assets and debts. Glenn will hold a hearing
today beginning at 3 p.m. </p>
<p>Although JPMorgan is hopeful the debtors will be able to
generate meaningful recoveries for creditors, no one, including
the debtors, can predict whether, when and to what extent this
may actually occur, lawyers from Simpson, Thacher  Bartlett
LLP wrote, representing the bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said it won''t allow its collateral to backstop
payment of the administrative expenses for MF Global''s
bankruptcy.  MF Global asked for a carve-out for some of its
professionals of $4 million, which would apply if a
reorganization fails and there aren''t enough assets to pay for
the costs of liquidation. </p>
<p>No Recovery Prediction </p>
<p>MF Global''s request should be limited because the firm has
no reliable basis for predicting the extent to which creditors
may expect to see a recovery here, JPMorgan said in a filing
today in bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>There is a real risk that every dollar of cash collateral
spent as the debtors propose will be potentially lost if the
request is granted, the bank said. </p>
<p>MF Global filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy
yesterday, after failing to find a buyer over the weekend. The
New York-based futures broker suffered a ratings downgrade and
loss of customers after revealing it had investments related to
$6.3 billion in European sovereign debt, leading to the filing.
Regulators are investigating hundreds of millions of dollars
that may be missing from its client accounts, two people have
told Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>MF Global drew almost all of a $1.2 billion credit line
that was amended last year to give it more liquidity, and its
broker-dealer unit has borrowed about $210 million of a $300
million secured credit line. JPMorgan Chase is the agent to
lenders who supplied credit for both loans. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF), 11-bk-
15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, separated responsibility for its capital markets
business into two groups, naming new heads for equity and debt. </p>
<p>Andy O''Brien and Jim Casey will become co-heads of global
debt capital markets, a team combining debt capital markets and
leveraged finance, investment-banking chief Jeff Urwin said in
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. The two previously ran
syndicated and leveraged finance in North America together. </p>
<p>Viswas Raghavan, formerly head of international capital
markets, will become global head of equity capital markets as
the bank combines its regional teams, according to the New York-
based lender. Raghavan will remain based in London. </p>
<p>Clients in all regions are facing similar issues and
increasingly are seeking access to capital outside their home
markets, Urwin said. Investors want to broaden the
geographic reach of their investments. </p>
<p>O''Brien and Casey are succeeding Therese Esperdy, who ran
global debt capital markets and is leaving to become co-head of
Asia Pacific investment banking with Todd Marin, who previously
ran the group alone, according to an Oct. 24 internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg. Esperdy and Marin will run JPMorgan''s
investment bank throughout Asia Pacific, except Japan, said the
memo from Urwin and Gaby Abdelnour, chairman and chief executive
officer for Asia Pacific. </p>
<p>Best-Paid Bank </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the most profitable U.S. bank, was the world''s
best-paid investment bank in 2010 in the Bloomberg 20 ranking of
advisers, with total fees of $4.14 billion. The bank also led
the field in fees from bond and equity issues. </p>
<p>So far this year, JPMorgan ranks No. 1 among underwriters
in high-yield and high-grade debt and No. 2 behind Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in U.S. leveraged loans, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>O''Brien took the lead in pulling together a $20 billion,
unsecured loan to Dallas-based ATT Inc. in March-- one of the
largest unsecured corporate loans ever. The financing package
helped the bank land the deal advising the telecommunications
company''s $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG''s wireless
unit, T-Mobile USA. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) fell as much as 12
percent in New York trading, leading financial stocks lower on
concern a Greek referendum on Europe''s bailout plan will worsen
the region''s debt crisis. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley dropped $1.11, or 6.3 percent, to $16.53 at
10:37 a.m., the biggest decline in the 81-company Standard 
Poor''s 500 Financials Index, which slid 2.3 percent. Citigroup
Inc. (C) fell 4.3 percent and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) decreased 4.1
percent. </p>
<p>Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou plans to hold a
referendum after details of last week''s second bailout package
for Greece are approved. The move poses a threat to financial
stability in the euro region and increases the risk of a
disorderly default, Fitch Ratings said. </p>
<p>Macro uncertainty is certainly the word of the day,
Thomas Brown, chief executive officer of Second Curve Capital
LLC, said on Bloomberg Television''s In The Loop. There is
a lot of concern that the European solution is going to fall
apart and we''re going to have a global recession. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has dropped 14 percent in the past two
trading days. Shares of the New York-based firm rallied 27
percent during the previous two weeks as the firm reported
earnings that beat analysts'' estimates and said it had $2.1
billion of net exposure to the peripheral European countries. </p>
<p>MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) became the first U.S. bank to
collapse under the weight of the crisis, filing for bankruptcy
yesterday after a $6.3 billion bet on European debt. </p>
<p>Missing Funds </p>
<p>U.S. regulators are investigating whether hundreds of
millions of dollars are missing from client accounts at MF
Global, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The firm was ordered by the enforcement division of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to preserve records for the
review, one of the people said. </p>
<p>EU leaders carved out a second aid package for Greece at a
summit in Brussels last month after Papandreou scraped together
parliamentary approval for the second round of austerity
measures in four months. Greece will receive 130 billion euros
($180 billion) in public funds plus a 50 percent writedown on
Greek debt, following a fully taxpayer-funded package of 110
billion euros extended in May 2010. </p>

still compete with generic versions. </p>
<p>The loss of Lipitor''s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said in
an Oct. 31 report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the top
spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. </p>
<p>Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be very rapid. Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. </p>
<p>We believe it would be economically important, but you
have to look in the context of some of the larger OTC brands,
he said. </p>
<p>The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. </p>
<p>The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor''s
prescription. </p>
<p>Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. </p>
<p>Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. </p>

<p>Two competing applications have now been filed to register
Occupy Wall Street as a trademark, according to the most

<p>One group lists itself as Occupy Wall Street, and uses
a New York City address. According to its website, Occupy Wall

<p>Both applications were filed Oct. 24. The California
applicant said the mark would be used mainly for clothing and
accessories such as T-shirts, backpacks and hats. </p>
<p>The New York applicant seeks to register the mark for a
broader range of uses, including newsletters, periodicals, and
photo, audio, video and press educational and entertaining
materials relating to Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement
in general.  That application also seeks to register the mark
for clothing items such as t-shirts. </p>
<p>The application from the California company doesn''t list an

<p>Copyright </p>
<p>Hello Dolly'' Set Design Infringed, Copyright Holder Claims </p>
<p>The holder of copyright to stage sets designed by the late
Oliver Smith sued a New Orleans costume and fabric shop for
copyright infringement. </p>
<p>Smith, who died in 1994, was known for his innovative set
design for American Ballet Theater productions such as
Rodeo, Fancy Free, and Swan Lake. He also designed
the Broadway productions of Hello Dolly, West Side Story
and Auntie Mame. </p>
<p>Rosaria Sinisi of Brooklyn, New York, is the inheritor of
the Smith copyrights, according to the complaint filed in
federal court in New Orleans. For a fee, she licenses the
copyrights for use in productions in the U.S, and abroad, she
said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Broadway Bound Costumes Inc. of New Orleans bought a set
for a production of Hello Dolly from a licensee, and used it
for a production of the musical at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux
Carre, in New Orleans'' French Quarter in 2003 and has since
rented the set to productions in New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Sinisi claims that the New Orleans company never had the
right to use the design in any performance or to rent the set to
others using this design. She also accused Broadway Bound of
modifying the design without permission. </p>
<p>As a result of the company''s actions, Sinisi said she''s
harmed and claims she will continue to sustain substantial,
immediate and irreparable injury without intervention by the
court. </p>
<p>She asked the court to bar further infringement of her
copyright, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. </p>
<p>Sinisi is represented by Jennifer Stierman Edwards and R.
Vaughn Cimini of Cimini  Associates of Metairie, Louisiana. </p>
<p>The case is Sinisi v. Broadway Bound Costumes Inc., 2:11-

Louisiana (New Orleans). </p>
<p>First Infringement Notices Under New Law Hit New Zealand ISPS </p>

<p>To date, all notices were sent by the Recording Industry
Association of New Zealand, according to the newspaper. </p>
<p>Most of the first batch of infringement notices were
related to unauthorized downloading of music by Rihanna, Lady
Gaga and the British musician Taio Cruz, according to the
newspaper. </p>
<p>In many cases, teenage children of the Internet subscribers
did the unauthorized downloading, which meant that the
infringement notices are likely to be an unpleasant surprise to
recipients, the Herald reported. </p>
<p>Taiwan Funeral Homes Become Music Copyright Enforcement Targets </p>
<p>As part of growing efforts toward copyright enforcement,
nine infringement suits were filed against Taiwan funeral homes

<p>The funeral homes say they shouldn''t have to pay the $30

<p>The music is based on Buddhist chants and not protected by
copyright, VOA reported. </p>
<p>The five Taiwan music-collection management societies may
also begin demanding payment for live performances of music at
some funerals, according to VOA. </p>

<p>The New York Yankees will focus on
pitching, pitching, pitching as they seek to improve their
starting rotation and bullpen during the Major League Baseball
offseason, General Manager Brian Cashman said. </p>
<p>Cashman said hitting isn''t a concern for New York, which
had a major league best 222 regular-season home runs this year
while ranking second to the Boston Red Sox in runs scored and
runs batted in. By contrast, Yankees pitchers combined for a
3.73 earned run average to rank 11th of 30 major league teams. </p>
<p>As we enter the process this winter, I don''t anticipate a
bat being of need at all, Cashman told reporters on a
conference call yesterday. Our main focus and efforts are
going to be to continue to support and reinforce the pitching
rotation and bullpen. </p>
<p>Cashman''s comments probably rule out attempts by the
Yankees to sign first basemen Albert Pujols or Prince Fielder,
the top sluggers in this year''s free agency class. </p>
<p>Fielder ranked second in the majors during the regular
season with 120 runs batted in and was fifth with 38 home runs
for the Milwaukee Brewers, one more than Pujols had for the St.
Louis Cardinals. Curtis Granderson and Mark Teixeira of the
Yankees finished second and third in the majors with 41 and 39
home runs respectively. </p>
<p>Offense is not an issue that we''ll be focusing on,
Cashman said. It will be the pitching. I feel our offense is
very, very strong. </p>
<p>Free Agents </p>
<p>C.J. Wilson, Mark Buehrle and Hiroki Kuroda are leading
pitchers entering free agency. </p>
<p>Wilson finished the regular season with a 16-7 record and
2.94 ERA for the Texas Rangers, who lost the World Series in
seven games to the Cardinals. Buehrle went 13-9 with a 3.59 ERA
for the Chicago White Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers'' Kuroda
finished the year with a 13-16 mark and 3.07 ERA. </p>
<p>The Yankees two days ago agreed to an extension with All-
Star pitcher CC Sabathia that could keep him in pinstripes
through the 2017 season. Locking in Sabathia was a key part of
the team''s strategy, Cashman said. </p>
<p>He''s certainly the most important piece as we entered
this process, Cashman said. CC provides us a lot of
security. </p>
<p>While the Yankees re-signed Sabathia, they had eight
players become free agents, including starting pitchers Bartolo Colon and Freddy Garcia, and catcher Jorge Posada, who has been
with the team since 1995. Free agents are allowed to sign with
any team starting at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. </p>
<p>Burnett to Stay </p>
<p>A.J. Burnett will probably remain in the starting rotation
and New York is open to re-signing Colon and Garcia, Cashman
said. Burnett had a 5.15 ERA in the regular season this year to
rank 94th in the major leagues. </p>
<p>The Yankees, who had an opening day payroll of about $202
million that was the highest in baseball, won the American
League East this year with a 97-65 record and fell in the first
round of the playoffs to the Detroit Tigers. </p>
<p>Cashman yesterday signed a three-year contract extension.
The 44-year-old''s previous three-year, $6 million contract
expired two days ago. Financial terms of his new deal weren''t
disclosed. </p>
<p>Cashman joined the Yankees in 1986 as a 19-year-old intern.
He was 31, baseball''s youngest general manager at the time, when
he took over from Bob Watson in February 1998, two years after
the Yankees won their first title in 18 years. </p>
<p>In Cashman''s 14 seasons in the team''s front office, the
Yankees have won 11 AL East division titles and World Series
championships in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. </p>
<p>Cashman''s career winning percentage of .605 (1,369-895) is
the best of any major league general manager with at least five
seasons of experience since 1950. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of Lipitor, its top-selling drug, to help
cushion tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic
versions reach the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
said. </p>
<p>Lipitor loses U.S. patent protection on Nov. 30. The New
York-based company is looking for ways to replace its $10.7
billion in annual revenue as cheaper copies drive down prices. </p>
<p>There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace, Read said yesterday in a
conference call discussing third-quarter earnings. </p>
<p>A nonprescription version of Lipitor wouldn''t be available
until at least 2013 because of the regulatory process needed to
get it approved, he said. </p>
<p>We have no definitive evidence we can do it, Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world''s biggest payment networks, will try to persuade a federal
judge to dismiss multibillion-dollar lawsuits accusing them of
price fixing because the merchants suing don''t directly pay the
fees at issue. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard will also argue before U.S. District
Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, today that the
behavior alleged is covered under an earlier settlement. </p>
<p>They will also try to convince the judge that they and
banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. and
Citigroup Inc. (C) can''t be accused of a conspiracy because the
payment-card operators are now public companies, which set the
fees themselves, rather than joint ventures of the banks. The
fees on credit cards, which average about 2 percent of the
purchase price, add up to $40 billion a year for retailers, not
including debit cards. </p>
<p>When you consider the damages, when you consider the
banks are under significant regulatory scrutiny now and their
profitability has gone down, this is quite a substantial
litigation, Matthew L. Cantor, a lawyer at Constantine
Cannon LLP in New York who has represented merchants and
payment-card issuer Discover Financial Services in antitrust
litigation, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Merchants such as D''Agostino Supermarkets Inc. in
Larchmont, New York, and Collective Brands Inc.''s Payless
ShoeSource in Topeka, Kansas, accuse Visa, MasterCard and the
biggest U.S. banks of violating antitrust laws by illegally
inflating swipe fees, or interchange, charged to merchants on
payment-card purchases. </p>
<h2>Individual Suits </h2>
<p>The merchants estimate damages in the case will range in
the tens of billions of dollars, according to their complaint. </p>
<p>In addition to a class action, individual suits before the
judge include those filed by Publix Super Markets Inc. (PUSH), the
Lakeland, Florida-based supermarket chain; Rite Aid Corp. (RAD), the
Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based drugstore chain; and Englewood,
Colorado-based Liberty Interactive Corp. (LINTA)''s QVC, the home-shopping channel. </p>
<p>Visa, MasterCard and the banks argued in court papers that
the cases have to be tossed because the merchants have no
standing to bring them: They don''t directly pay the interchange
fees -- the merchants'' banks pay them to the cardholders'' banks,
which in turn seek payment from the merchants. </p>
<p>The undisputed evidence shows that plaintiffs do not pay
directly the interchange fees they assert were illegally set,
the defendants wrote in court papers. </p>
<p>They cite a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court decision that said
indirect buyers can''t claim they were injured by an antitrust
violation. Courts have refused to apply the 1977 case when the
direct purchaser is a co-conspirator, as the merchants'' banks
are, the plaintiffs argue. </p>
<h2>Real Merits'' </h2>
<p>The defendants are making what we think are not well-founded arguments, like the scope of the release and the
standing issue, that don''t address the real merits of the
case, K. Craig Wildfang, a partner at Robins, Kaplan, Miller 
Ciresi LLP in Minneapolis and a lawyer for the merchants, said
in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The lawsuits threaten a revenue source for banks that U.S.
lawmakers left untouched in passing the Dodd-Frank Act last
year. Congress opted to cap only debit-card interchange fees,
which typically had cost merchants about half of what they pay
to accept credit cards. The debit caps may cut annual revenue at
the biggest banks by $8 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg Government. </p>
<p>Merchants say the fee hurts consumers because they lead to
higher prices for products and services. A judgment or
settlement could result in a rate reduction, they claimed. </p>
<h2>Summary Judgment </h2>
<p>Both sides have asked Gleeson for summary judgment in their
favor now that discovery, or information-gathering, is done.
They say a trial isn''t needed, at least on most counts, because
there are no facts in dispute for a jury to decide. Gleeson is
scheduled to hear arguments on those motions today. </p>
<p>The litigation, dating back to 2005, has produced more than
82 million pages of documents and sworn testimony from almost
500 witnesses, according to court papers. </p>
<p>The lawsuits contain allegations that the networks'' rules,
including those prohibiting merchants from steering customers to
cheaper forms of payment, violate U.S. competition law. Last
year, Visa and MasterCard settled with the U.S. government on
such anti-steering allegations. New York-based American Express
Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by purchases, is fighting
that suit. </p>
<h2>Proof Points'' </h2>
<p>We welcome the opportunity to present arguments on
motions seeking dismissal of the litigation and will offer
strong proof points demonstrating our practices serve to benefit
consumers and enhance competition, James Issokson, a spokesman
for Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>Wednesday''s hearing is simply the next step in the
litigation process, Denise Dunckel, a spokeswoman for San
Francisco-based Visa, said in an e-mailed statement.
Plaintiffs'' claims against a centralized system for setting
interchange rates are without merit and overlook the fact that
interchange has been upheld as legal in every direct challenge
made in U.S. courts. </p>
<p>Laura Lubin Rossi, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan; Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America; and Emily Collins, a spokeswoman
for New York-based Citigroup, declined to comment. The three
banks are the biggest in the U.S. by assets. </p>
<h2>Economic Realities </h2>
<p>Steven Semeraro, a professor at San Diego-based Thomas
Jefferson School of Law, who has written on interchange fees,
said in a phone interview that the merchants will likely win on
the standing argument. </p>
<p>There''s so much in the case law that says what matters is
the economic realities and not the form, Semeraco said. </p>
<p>Michael Simkovic, an associate professor at Seton Hall
University School of Law in Newark, New Jersey, said the appeals
court covering Brooklyn has taken a narrow view of the co-conspirator exception. </p>
<p>The defendants have some pretty strong arguments there
and they might be able to win on that basis, he said. The
merchants are focusing on the cash flow, but contractually
that''s not how it works. Contractually, everything goes through
the intermediary. </p>
<p>In 2003, Visa and MasterCard settled a separate antitrust
class action, called In re Visa Check, for $3 billion. That
case, which Gleeson presided over, targeted debit-card rules. </p>
<p>As part of that settlement, the merchants can''t sue over
conduct occurring before 2004. Visa and MasterCard argue that
release covers their current rules, which date from before 2004. </p>
<h2>Additional Changes </h2>
<p>Rather than negotiate additional changes to the existing
rules in the Visa Check settlement, plaintiffs negotiated the
largest antitrust settlement in history,'' they wrote. </p>
<p>The merchants argue they are alleging new antitrust
injuries that came after the rules were reauthorized and new fee
rates established. </p>
<p>Each time a new interchange fee is set or charged, a new
price-fixing agreement occurs, they wrote. </p>
<p>The defendants also argue the banks no longer control the
payment networks now that they are publicly traded, and don''t
control the rate of the interchange fees. MasterCard conducted
an initial public offering in May 2006, Visa in March 2008.
Before that, they were joint ventures owned by the banks. </p>
<p>The merchants argue that, even after the IPOs, the banks
continue to control rules and interchange rates in a way that
restrains competition or at least threatens anticompetitive
effects. </p>
<h2>New Entities </h2>
<p>Far from disavowing the goals of their conspiracy, bank
defendants merely set up new entities to continue to administer
those conspiracies and ensure that they continued to profit from
their activities, the merchants wrote. </p>
<p>The merchants are also seeking to have the IPOs unwound,
contending they lessen competition. Gleeson previously dismissed
that argument, though he allowed the merchants to re-file it. </p>
<p>Merchants accuse MasterCard of committing a fraudulent
conveyance when, in its IPO, it eliminated the ability to
assess the banks for litigation costs and got nothing in return
for it. The merchants say that move hurts their ability to
recover any judgment in the case. </p>
<p>In February, Visa, MasterCard and the banks reached an
agreement about how they would divvy up a global judgment or
settlement involving all the defendants, according to regulatory
filings. Visa would pay two-thirds and MasterCard one-third.
MasterCard''s agreements with its banks limit its portion to 36
percent of that, with banks picking up the rest. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-1720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) won a narrowing of
claims in a lawsuit by Singapore investors who said the firm
induced them to buy synthetic collateralized debt obligations
that were designed to fail. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand on Oct. 31 granted the
firm''s request to throw out the claims of negligent
misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
aiding and abetting. Sand, in New York, allowed other claims of
fraud and breach of good covenant and good faith to continue. </p>
<p>Last year, a group of investors sued Morgan Stanley, the
sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, alleging it created
collateralized debt obligations -- a debt security usually
backed by bonds or corporate loans -- and failed to inform the
investors that it was a counter-party to the agreements. For
each dollar the investors lost, the bank gained a dollar, the
investors said. </p>
<p>Sand said the plaintiffs have pled what amounts to self-
dealing by Morgan Stanley, insofar as Morgan Stanley was betting
against, or shorting'' the synthetic CDOs that it had itself
created. The engineered frailty of the CDOs and Morgan Stanley''s
positions on both sides of the deal adequately alleges motive. </p>
<p>Place on Guard'' </p>
<p>The judge said that New York-based Morgan Stanley hasn''t
proffered evidence to suggest that investors were placed on
guard and concluded the plaintiffs have shown sufficient
evidence that they acted reasonably in relying upon the firm''s
statements. </p>
<p>Even a sophisticated investor armed with a bevy of
accountants, financial advisers, and lawyers could not have
known that Morgan Stanley would select inherently risky
underlying assets and short them, Sand said. </p>
<p>Several Morgan Stanley units created the scheme to redirect
funds into the bank''s own coffers, the investors including the
Singapore Government Staff Credit Cooperative Society Ltd. said
in the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Dandong v. Pinnacle Performance Limited, 10-
CV-8086, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Buyout firms circling Regions
Financial Corp. (RF)''s Morgan Keegan brokerage unit lowered bids by
at least $200 million after financing markets deteriorated and
MF Global Holdings Ltd. filed for bankruptcy, according to
people with direct knowledge of the process. </p>
<p>Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and Jeffrey Greenberg''s Aquiline
Capital Partners LLC submitted the highest offer at about $750
million, the people said, asking not to be named because the
talks are private. The group topped a joint bid from Carlyle
Group LP and Blackstone Group LP (BX), according to the people, who
said previous offers valued the unit at more than $1 billion. </p>
<p>A deal hasn''t been reached and talks could fall apart as
Regions is pushing both groups to raise their price, the people
said. Regions, based in Birmingham, Alabama, has been planning
to use proceeds from the sale to boost capital and pay back a
$3.5 billion U.S. bailout. Regions has indicated it plans to
collect a $250 million dividend from Morgan Keegan prior to any
sale, increasing proceeds from the business, the people said. </p>
<p>Evelyn Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Regions, declined to
comment on Morgan Keegan. Shares of the company rose 5 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $3.93 in New York trading at 1:39 p.m. They''ve
lost 44 percent this year. </p>
<p>Regions is among the biggest U.S. banks that have yet to
repay the Treasury Department rescue. The company said in June
it was exploring options for Morgan Keegan, which provides
brokerage and investment-banking services. Founded with five
workers in 1969, the unit has more than 300 offices and 4,400
employees across the Southeast and Midwest, including Texas,
Missouri, Ohio, the Carolinas and Florida. </p>
<p>Third-Quarter Profit </p>
<p>Morgan Keegan agreed to be sold to Regions in 2000 for
about $789 million. The unit, based in Memphis, Tennessee, had a
$26 million third-quarter profit, Regions said on Oct. 25. That
was up from $22 million a year earlier and a decrease from $60
million in the second quarter. </p>
<p>Regions Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, 54, told
investors in September that the Troubled Asset Relief Program
repayment would depend on achieving sustainable profitability
and an improvement in credit metrics, not just a successful
resolution of the review of Morgan Keegan. Regions, the 10th-
largest U.S. bank by deposits, has said it hired Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) to help examine options for the unit and find ways to
manage capital and increase shareholder value. </p>
<p>Stifel Financial Corp. (SF), a brokerage based in St. Louis,
also bid for Morgan Keegan and was rejected, people with
knowledge of the matter said last month. Among the reasons was a
concern that Morgan Keegan executives and brokers, some of whom
opposed selling to a competitor, might quit before the purchase
was completed and jeopardize the deal, they said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon was targeted by protesters during a keynote
speech in Seattle last night, with activists picketing and
chanting banks got bailed out, we got sold out. </p>
<p>More than 100 participants weathered pouring rain and
temperatures in the 40s to air frustrations as Dimon, 55,
addressed the University of Washington Foster School of
Business'' annual business leadership dinner. </p>
<p>At least three protesters said they were hit with pepper
spray as they tried to block entrances to a Sheraton hotel,
where the dinner was closed to the public. Activists held signs
that called for Dimon''s arrest and compared his hourly wage,
which they calculated at around $10,000, with about $23 for an
average worker. </p>
<p>They''re bringing to the surface the pent up
disappointment, anger, frustration and fear that the American
people has with the direction that the economy and country has
taken over the last decade, said John Taylor, president and
CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a
Washington-based non-profit group that represents affordable
housing charities. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the Seattle demonstrations. </p>
<p>Occupy Wall Street activists have repeatedly targeted Dimon
as they protest income disparity, the influence of money on
politics and the use of taxpayer funds to rescue banks in 2008.
They marched from Wall Street in downtown New York to his home
on the upper East Side on Oct. 11. The route also included
demonstrations outside homes of News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch,
billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson and Republican donor
David Koch. </p>
<p>Avoided Losses </p>
<p>Dimon, who runs the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,
saw his institution through the recession without posting a
quarterly loss. He has said that JPMorgan, which took $25
billion in money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, did so
only to encourage other banks to participate and shore up the
financial system, not because it needed the money. </p>
<p>Boston, San Francisco, Washington and London are among
cities where rallies have been held to protest banks and their
executives. People are focusing lenders'' role in creating the
housing crisis and the impact it had on the economy and
unemployment, said Taylor. </p>
<p>It''s not Jamie personally, it''s the institutions
themselves and what they are doing or not doing, he said. </p>
<p>Do the Right Thing'' </p>
<p>More than 1,200 people signed an online petition last year
urging Syracuse University in New York to rescind Dimon''s
invitation as the commencement speaker. Dimon presented the
address, telling students to have the courage to speak the
truth, even when it''s unpopular. He told graduates to do the
right thing, not the easy thing and not to become someone
else''s lapdog or sycophant. </p>
<p>Less than a dozen graduates protested in silence by
removing their caps and gowns during his speech. While Dimon
urged graduates to hold him and other CEOs accountable for their
actions, he warned against indiscriminately judging all
executives based on the failings of a few as another form of
prejudice and ignorance. </p>
<p>It''s okay for us at times to blame and be dissatisfied
with others and hold them responsible, but it''s not okay to
oversimplify and paint everyone with the same brush, he said.
It should not be acceptable to denigrate entire groups, not
all companies, not all CEOs, not all politicians, not all media,
not all students. </p>

<p>GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) agreed to pay $3
billion to settle U.S. criminal and civil investigations into
whether the company marketed drugs for unapproved uses and other
matters. </p>
<p>Negotiations over the terms are ongoing and will be
completed next year, the London-based company said in a
statement yesterday. The cost is covered by existing legal
provisions and will be paid from the company''s cash resources,
Glaxo said. </p>
<p>The potential settlement brings Glaxo closer to putting
years of legal probes behind it. The company set aside 2.2
billion pounds ($3.5 billion) in the fourth quarter in
anticipation of reaching an agreement on the cases. </p>
<p>This is a significant step toward resolving difficult,
longstanding matters which do not reflect the company that we
are today, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty said in the
statement. In recent years, we have fundamentally changed our
procedures for compliance, marketing and selling in the U.S. to
ensure that we operate with high standards of integrity. </p>
<p>This news essentially draws a line under a 10-year legal
saga, Gbola Amusa, an analyst at UBS AG (UBSN) in London, said in an
e-mail. The company still has about 1 billion pounds in extra
provisions set aside, he said. This removes significant
uncertainty on ongoing legal issues, said Amusa, who
recommends buying Glaxo shares. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors began an investigation in Colorado in
2004, later taken over by the U.S. attorney in Massachusetts,
into whether Glaxo promoted drugs for unapproved uses, and into
ways Glaxo potentially influenced doctors. The probe concerns
nine of the company''s best-selling products from 1997 to 2004,
Glaxo said in 2009. </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>Sprint Allowed to Pursue Legal Challenge to ATT-T-Mobile Deal </p>
<p>Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) can sue ATT Inc. over its proposed
purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc., a federal judge ruled, saying the
fact that the companies are competitors doesn''t bar a private
antitrust lawsuit. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle in Washington said
yesterday that the suit by Sprint, and another by Cellular South
Inc. to block the $39 billion deal, can proceed. Still, the
judge dismissed several claims, limiting the cases to Sprint''s
allegations regarding access to mobile devices and Cellular
South''s complaints involving roaming fees as well as devices. </p>
<p>Where private plaintiffs have successfully pleaded
antitrust injury, the fact that they are defendants'' competitors
is no bar, Huvelle said in her ruling. </p>
<p>Sprint and Cellular South will now be able to
supplement the Justice Department''s lawsuit to stop the
deal, Andrew Gavil, a law professor at Howard University in
Washington, said in an e-mail. While the government will try to
prove how the merger would harm consumers, the companies will
attack the way the transaction might diminish competition in the
wireless telephone industry, he said. </p>
<p>It is an important victory for Sprint and Cellular
South, Gavil said. </p>
<p>ATT argued that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint can''t
challenge the purchase under antitrust law because it''s a
competitor rather than a consumer. It also contended that
Sprint''s claims that the acquisition would hurt its business are
unfounded. </p>
<p>Cellular South Inc., based in Ridgeland, Mississippi, filed
a similar lawsuit that ATT also asked Huvelle to dismiss. The
company changed its name to C Spire in September. </p>
<p>Huvelle scheduled a hearing on the cases for Dec. 9. </p>
<p>We believe the limited, minor claims they have left are
entirely without merit, Wayne Watts, ATT''s senior executive
vice president and general counsel, said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>Sprint and Cellular South issued statements saying they
were pleased that the judge allowed them to continue
fighting the proposed merger. </p>
<p>Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment. </p>
<p>The government''s case is U.S. v. ATT Inc. (T), 11-01560;
Sprint''s case is Sprint Nextel Corp. v. ATT Inc., 11-01600; and

<p>Visa, MasterCard Put Potential Fee Settlement at $4 Billion </p>
<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the world''s biggest payment
networks, put any potential settlement of price-fixing
litigation by merchants at about $4 billion. </p>
<p>MasterCard extrapolated an estimate of a reasonably
possible loss of at least $500 million if there is a negotiated
settlement with all plaintiffs, MasterCard Chief Executive
Officer Ajaypal S. Banga said on an earnings conference call
with investors yesterday. </p>
<p>In February, Visa, MasterCard and the banks being sued by
merchants over swipe fees, or interchange, agreed that Visa
would be responsible for two-thirds of any settlement and
MasterCard would be responsible for about one-eighth. Visa said
in regulatory filings it has a litigation escrow account with
$2.7 billion in cash available. Those figures put a potential
settlement at $4 billion. </p>
<p>Visa, MasterCard, the banks and the merchants yesterday
argued before U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New
York, on why he should rule in their favor without the need of a
trial in the antitrust litigation, begun in 2005. </p>
<p>Banga didn''t say that any settlement was imminent, either
in the class action or in suits brought by individual merchants
including Publix Super Markets Inc. (PUSH), the Lakeland, Florida-based
supermarket chain, and Rite Aid Corp. (RAD), the Camp Hill,
Pennsylvania-based drugstore chain. </p>
<p>While we''ve made substantial progress with the individual
merchant plaintiffs, there has not been similar progress with
the class plaintiffs, he said. At this time, it is not
possible to put an upper limit on this loss due to the
significantly higher demands by the class plaintiffs, which are
unacceptable to MasterCard. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard argued they and banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C)
can''t be accused of a conspiracy because the merchants don''t
directly pay the interchange fees on payment-card purchases. </p>
<p>They also argued that the accusations are covered by a
settlement in previous litigation and that the payment-card
operators are now public companies, which set the fees
themselves, rather than joint ventures of the banks. </p>
<p>Merchants such as D''Agostino Supermarkets Inc. in
Larchmont, New York, and Collective Brands Inc. (PSS)''s Payless
ShoeSource in Topeka, Kansas, accuse Visa, MasterCard and the
banks in a class-action suit of violating antitrust laws with
the inflated swipe fees. </p>

<p>Facebook Claimant Says Zuckerberg Deleted E-Mails After Suit </p>
<p>Paul Ceglia, the New York man claiming half of Facebook
Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg''s holdings, asked a judge to
sanction Zuckerberg for allegedly destroying e-mail messages
related to their dispute. </p>
<p>Ceglia said in filings Nov. 1 in federal court in Buffalo,
New York, that Zuckerberg deleted e-mails from his Harvard
University account after Ceglia filed the lawsuit and after
Zuckerberg received a so-called litigation hold. </p>
<p>In his lawsuit, filed in June 2010, Ceglia claims he and
Zuckerberg signed a contract in 2003 making them partners at the
start of Palo Alto, California-based Facebook. The company has
called Ceglia''s claim a fraud. </p>
<p>Ceglia has said he communicated with Zuckerberg in 2003 and
2004 using Internet-based e-mail accounts. Ceglia claims he cut
and pasted their correspondence into word processing documents,
which he printed and saved. </p>
<p>These filings by Ceglia and his latest lawyer are truly
delusional, Orin Snyder, a lawyer for Zuckerberg and Facebook,
said in an e-mailed statement. These are the desperate acts of
a man whose fraudulent lawsuit has now been fully exposed. </p>
<p>In his request for sanctions Nov. 1, Ceglia seeks an order
prohibiting Facebook or Zuckerberg from disputing the
authenticity of his e-mails. Ceglia hired a new lawyer this
month, his fourth lead counsel since filing the lawsuit. </p>

<p>Deutsche Bank, MortgageIT Suit Should Go Forward, U.S. Says </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany''s biggest bank, and its
MortgageIT unit should be required to defend the $1 billion suit
by the government claiming they lied as part of a massive
fraud to qualify thousands of risky mortgages for a federal
insurance program, the U.S. said. </p>
<p>The U.S. claims Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank and
MortgageIT falsely certified that they properly assessed the
default risk of borrowers, qualifying loans for insurance by the
Housing and Urban Development Department''s Federal Housing
Administration, according to a complaint filed May 3 in
Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>This misconduct -- which MortgageIT began as early as
1999 and which Deutsche Bank continued and exacerbated after
acquiring MortgageIT in 2007 -- resulted in a wave of defaults
and more than $368 million in FHA insurance losses on loans that
never should have been originated in the first place, the U.S.
said in a brief yesterday opposing the defendants'' request to
dismiss the suit. </p>
<p>The U.S. sued under the False Claims Act, which permits it
to seek triple damages and penalties of more than $1 billion. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Deutsche Bank AG, 11-cv-2976, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Dynegy Asks Judge to Dismiss Avenue Investments Lawsuit </p>
<p>Dynegy Inc. (DYN), the third-largest independent U.S. power
producer, asked a New York judge to dismiss a lawsuit by Avenue
Investments LP that claims the company stole assets from
bondholders in a restructuring. </p>
<p>Bondholders led by Avenue sued Houston-based Dynegy in New
York State Supreme Court on Sept. 21, seeking to undo the
company''s restructuring, which Avenue said improperly removed
coal-fired power plants from the reach of bondholders and
transferred them to stockholders. </p>
<p>Dynegy asked Justice Bernard Fried in Manhattan to dismiss
the complaint in court documents filed on Oct. 31, saying that
New York is the wrong jurisdiction and that the Avenue
bondholders don''t have standing to sue, to pursue so-called
fraudulent conveyance claims or to bring derivative claims for
breach of fiduciary duty. </p>
<p>This lawsuit was plainly designed to interfere with
Dynegy''s exchange offer by communicating to participants that
plaintiffs would challenge the exchange after the fact, Dynegy
said in the court documents. </p>
<p>Dynegy said July 10 that it would restructure to avoid
violating an earnings-to-interest covenant in its loan
agreement. The company created two units, one owning eight
natural gas-fired power generation facilities and another owning
a group of six coal-fired facilities, both of which would be
bankruptcy remote, insulating them if affiliates become
insolvent, according to a statement. </p>

<p>Dahdaleh Gets $16 Million Bail Overturned, No Electronic Tag </p>
<p>British investor Victor Dahdaleh won a ruling overturning a
10 million-pound ($16 million) bail requirement to be released
pending a trial on bribery charges. </p>
<p>Dahdaleh, 68, also doesn''t have to wear an electronic tag
after a judge at a London criminal court struck down several
bail conditions yesterday, said David Jones, a spokesman for the
Serious Fraud Office, which is prosecuting the case. Dahdaleh,
the owner of Dadco Group, is accused of paying bribes to a
Bahraini royal and the former chief executive officer of
Aluminium Bahrain BSC (ALBH) to win contracts for Alcoa Inc. (AA) </p>
<p>The judge refused Dahdaleh''s request to travel outside of
England and Wales, Jones said. Dahdaleh must report to a police
station in the Belgravia neighborhood of London twice a week and
must spend nights at his home there. </p>
<p>Several of his friends must still adhere to pledges to pay
1.4 million pounds if Dahdaleh fails to return to court, Jones
said. Philip Martin Cutts, the chief executive officer of Credit
Suisse Group AG''s U.K. private bank, and BP Plc executive Thomas
Prescott are among those that made the assurances at a hearing
earlier this week. </p>
<p>Dahdaleh was charged Oct. 24 with six counts of making
corrupt payments, two counts of money laundering, and one charge
of conspiracy to corrupt. He is accused paying bribes to
officials of the smelting company Aluminium Bahrain, known as
Alba, including Sheikh Isa Bin Ali al-Khalifa, the former oil
minister of Bahrain and former chairman of the board of
directors, and Bruce Hall, the former chief executive officer. </p>
<p>Dahdaleh''s lawyer, Arnondo Chakrabarti, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Germany Charges Olympus Managers With Breach-of-Trust </p>
<p>Hamburg prosecutors have charged three former managers of
an Olympus Corp. (7733) unit in Europe with breach of trust, spokesman
Wilhelm Moellers said yesterday. </p>
<p>The managers, one Italian and two German nationals, were
charged in March in connection with four payments totaling
640,000 euros ($883,000) made between July and October 2003
where no services appeared to have been rendered, Moellers said
in a telephone interview. Two of the managers allegedly
authorized the payments, while a third is allegedly related to a
Swiss company that was the beneficiary of the payments, he said. </p>
<p>The court now has to decide whether to open the case,
he said, adding that no hearing date has been set. </p>
<p>Franziska Jorke, an Olympus Europa Holding GmbH spokeswoman
in Hamburg, declined to comment on the identity of the managers
or on the details of the case. </p>
<p>Olympus, the world''s largest maker of endoscopes, has been
in a war of words with fired president Michael C. Woodford over
advisory fees paid in takeovers. On Nov. 1, the Tokyo-based
company said it selected former prosecutors to investigate past
acquisitions. </p>
<p>In 2008, following an audit by the tax authorities, a
transaction was subjected to an internal audit, Jorke said in
an e-mail. Having consulted our external legal advisers,
Olympus submitted details of this transaction to the Office of
the Public Prosecutor. The management of Olympus Europa Holding
had no knowledge of the transaction in question prior to the
internal audit. </p>
<p>U.S. Witness in Azeri Bribery Case Faces New Laundering Claims </p>
<p>A Swiss lawyer who was the U.S. government''s star witness
in the 2009 bribery trial of American businessman Frederic
Bourke faces new allegations that he orchestrated a $1 billion
money-laundering scheme. </p>
<p>The lawyer, Hans Bodmer, pleaded guilty to money laundering
and testified for U.S. prosecutors at Bourke''s trial for paying
bribes in an oil deal in Azerbaijan. Bodmer said he told Bourke,
an investor in the 1998 oil deal, about the bribery plot he
helped organize. Bourke was convicted. Bodmer returned to his
Zurich law practice. </p>
<p>A New York judge on Nov. 10 will hear arguments on Bourke''s
claim that Bodmer lied at the trial. Meanwhile, Bodmer is facing
new laundering allegations. In August, Russian billionaire Oleg
Deripaska filed a legal complaint in Switzerland accusing him
and others of masterminding a scheme last year to loot OJSC MMC
Norilsk Nickel (GMKN), a nickel producer in which Deripaska invests. </p>
<p>Under the pivotal involvement of Hans Bodmer, a complex
structure was created to siphon funds out of Norilsk Nickel,
Deripaska''s complaint says. The accused parties extracted the
assets of Norilsk  Nickel unlawfully and to their own advantage,
an amount of approximately $1 billion. </p>
<p>Bourke''s lawyer, Michael Tigar, declined to say whether he
would cite the new allegations in his bid to win a new trial for
his client. As he challenges his conviction in an appeals court,
Bourke has also returned to the trial judge to claim that
prosecutors knew Bodmer lied in his testimony. Prosecutors say
there''s no evidence Bodmer lied when he tied Bourke to the
bribery scheme. </p>
<p>Bodmer''s lawyer, Saul Pilchen, didn''t have an immediate
comment on the Swiss case. Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Bourke case is U.S. v. Bourke, 05-cr-00518, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Austrian City Sues Bawag for $35 Million on Swiss Franc Swap </p>
<p>Linz, Austria''s third-biggest city, sued Bawag PSK Bank
over a 195 million Swiss franc ($221 million) swap. </p>
<p>Bawag didn''t inform Linz about the potential risks of the
2007 swap, which was used to secure a franc bond, according a
copy of the suit posted on Linz''s website. The city is seeking
30.64 million francs in the case. </p>
<p>Disputes over swap agreements, typically used by municipal
agencies to lower interest payments, have spread through Europe
with lawsuits in Germany, Italy and the U.K. Deutsche Bank AG in
March lost a case over swaps in the first ruling by Germany''s
highest court concerning sales of the products. </p>
<p>Bawag overstepped all legal boundaries that need to be
observed when entering into a contract with a municipality,
Mayor Franz Dobusch told reporters in Linz yesterday, according
to Austria Press Agency. </p>
<p>Sabine Hacker, a spokeswoman for the bank, didn''t
immediately answer a call after business hours yesterday. Bawag,
which is controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP, in March
said that it vehemently rejected Linz''s claims. </p>
<p>Linz''s former finance director Werner Penn, who resigned in
March, entered into the bond without getting the necessary
approval from city agencies. </p>
<p>The city has formed a special committee to investigate the
swap. Austrian Central Bank Governor Ewald Nowotny, who headed
Bawag when the swap was entered into, will address the committee
on Nov. 23, according to the committee''s chairwoman Ursula
Roschger. </p>

<p>Trials </p>
<p>Lilly Hid Zyprexa''s Diabetes Risks, Student Died, Lawyer Says </p>
<p>Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) didn''t properly warn a patient who took its
Zyprexa antipsychotic medication of diabetes risks and the young
man died, a lawyer for his family told a jury in the first case
to go to trial over the drug. </p>
<p>Cody Tadai, a 20-year-old college student, took Zyprexa to
battle mental illness without either him, or his doctor, being
properly advised about the drug''s link to diabetes, Ronald
Makarem, a Los Angeles-based lawyer, said in closing arguments
in the trial of a lawsuit filed by members of Tadai''s family.
They contend the student died of diabetes-related ailments in
March 2007 and that the drugmaker put profits ahead of the
safety of Zyprexa users. </p>
<p>They chose money over safety, Makarem told jurors in
state court in Los Angeles yesterday. A verdict on behalf of
Tadai''s family would remind Lilly executives to ensure safety
comes first and money second, he added. </p>
<p>Indianapolis-based Lilly, which lost patent protection on
Zyprexa last month, has paid about $2.9 billion to resolve
government and individual claims over its marketing of the
antipsychotic drug. </p>
<p>Lilly agreed in 2009 to pay $1.42 billion to settle federal
prosecutors'' allegations that it illegally marketed Zyprexa for
unapproved uses. The drugmaker also agreed to pay more than $260
million to resolve similar state claims. The company also has
agreed to pay more than $1.2 billion to settle about 31,000
suits by former users of the drug. </p>
<p>Stefanie Prodouz, a Lilly spokeswoman, declined to comment
yesterday on why the drugmaker decided to make the Tadai
family''s Zyprexa suit the first to go to trial after more than
eight years of litigation over the medication. The drug was
Lilly''s top seller last year, racking up more than $5 billion in
sales. </p>
<p>The drugmaker still faces about 40 Zyprexa suits that
include claims from about 110 former users of the drug, Lilly
executives said in an Oct. 28 U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. </p>
<p>The case is Cody Tadai v. Eli Lilly  Co., BC 379020,
California Superior Court (Los Angeles County). </p>

<p>Ex-Milan Mayors Tell Court of Bank Swap Fees, Adviser Roles </p>
<p>Former Milan Mayor Gabriele Albertini told a court
yesterday he knew banks would charge the city for arranging a
2005 financing package that included swaps, though he didn''t
know the amount of the commissions. </p>
<p>I took it for granted that banks were charging a fee,
Albertini said under questioning from a defense lawyer for the
banks at a trial in Milan yesterday. Banks aren''t doing
charity. </p>
<p>The firms charged a symbolic 168,000 euros ($231,000)
for arranging a 1.7 billion-euro bond sale, and he knew the city
would pay other commissions, Albertini said. He added that he
didn''t know how they would be paid or how much. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Dublin-
based Depfa Bank Plc face charges of mis-selling swaps to the
municipal government of Italy''s commercial capital, derivatives
that adjusted payments on the 2005 bond offering. Prosecutor
Alfredo Robledo said the banks earned 101 million euros in
hidden fees and misled Milan by telling the city it could save
about 55 million euros with the bond sale and a series of swaps.
The banks deny the charges. </p>
<p>Milan is seeking damages in the trial and sued the banks in
civil courts. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Rajaratnam Said to Be Assigned to Massachusetts Medical Prison </p>
<p>Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager sentenced to 11
years in prison for insider trading, was assigned to a federal
prison medical center in Massachusetts, according to a person
familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 54, was ordered by U.S. District Judge Richard
Holwell to report to prison on Dec. 5. At Rajaratanam''s request,
Holwell, who handed down the sentence on Oct. 13 in Manhattan
federal court, recommended the Galleon Group LLC co-founder do
his time at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North
Carolina, where convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff is
serving a 150-year sentence. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, who says he has health problems including
diabetes and will likely need dialysis and an eventual kidney
transplant, was instead assigned to Federal Medical Center
Devens, according to the person familiar with the matter. Devens
is located on the decommissioned Fort Devens military base in
Ayer, Massachusetts, 39 miles (63 kilometers) west of Boston. </p>
<p>John Dowd, Rajaratnam''s lawyer, declined to comment on the
prison assignment. </p>
<p>Ed Ross, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman, also declined to
comment, citing a policy not to disclose prison assignments
before the prisoner is in custody. </p>
<p>Devens houses male inmates who need specialized or long-
term medical or mental health care, according to the Bureau of
Prisons website. It is designated as an administrative facility,
which means it has inmates from different security
classifications - from white collar criminals like Rajaratnam to
mobsters and sex offenders. </p>
<p>In addition to the medical center, Devens includes a
minimum security prison camp. </p>
<p>Devens inmates often leave the facility to see outside
specialists and to have tests and medical procedures not
available in the medical center, according to Sandra Howard,
M.D., clinical director at Devens, who submitted an affidavit in
Rajaratnam''s case in September at the request of the government.
The facility has regular onsite specialists in cardiology,
nephrology, endocrinology, surgery, neurology and pulmonology. </p>
<p>Devens provides dialysis to about 85 inmates, with the
capacity for as many as 125, Howard said. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam is the central figure in what U.S. investigators
called the largest hedge fund insider-trading case in U.S.
history. The probe, which leveraged the widespread use of FBI
wiretaps for the first time in such an inquiry, led to
convictions of more than two dozen people. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said the hedge fund manager made more than $72
million by using illegal tips to trade in stocks of companies
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Intel Corp., Google Inc.,
ATI Technologies Inc. and Clearwire Corp. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Singapore Investors Lose Bid to Recoup Lehman-Related Losses </p>
<p>A group of 213 investors in Singapore lost a bid to recoup
S$18 million ($14 million) of losses tied to Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), with an appeal court upholding a lower court
ruling that dismissed their claim. </p>
<p>DBS Bank Ltd., which sold credit default swaps linked to
Lehman, had inconsistencies in the investment''s prospectus and
pricing statement, the investors claimed. They sought to have
the contracts annulled and their investments returned. DBS Bank,
a Singapore-based unit of DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS), Southeast
Asia''s biggest bank, had declared the investments were worthless
after Lehman collapsed in 2008. </p>
<p>The investment structure was artificial and complex, the
three-judge panel of the appeal court said in yesterday''s
ruling. The formula for calculating the payouts in the event of
a default is consistently stated across several documents and,
as a result, the investors claim must fail, the judges said. </p>
<p>A person who signs a contract which is set in a language
he is not familiar with or whose terms he may not understand is
nonetheless bound by the terms of that contract, the judges
said in the ruling. The principle of caveat emptor applies
equally to literates and illiterates. </p>
<p>The case is Soon Kok Tiang v. DBS Bank Ltd. CA6/2011,
Singapore Court of Appeal. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said its traders lost money on 16 days in
the third quarter as turmoil in Europe roiled bond and equity
markets. </p>
<p>The bank had 177 days of positive trading revenue in the
first nine months, including five days in which the gains
exceeded $200 million, according to a regulatory filing today by
New York-based JPMorgan. The biggest U.S. lenders have leaned on
trading operations this year to boost profit as results at
consumer-related businesses sagged. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s nine-month perfect trading record ended in the
second quarter with two days of losses, as concern rose that
Greece would default on its debt and U.S. lawmakers would fail
to raise the debt ceiling. In all, JPMorgan''s traders lost money
on 26 days during the past seven quarters. </p>
<p>Trading revenue averaged $76 million a day during the first
nine months. Revenue at JPMorgan''s investment-banking unit,
which houses the trading desks, fell 13 percent from the second
quarter to $6.4 billion. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) officials told
U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, in their first
meeting since he took the post, that they''ll keep pressing to
win congressional backing for an alternative F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter engine. </p>
<p>David Joyce, chief executive officer of General Electric
Aviation, and other company officials met on Monday with Carter,
who became deputy defense secretary last month, according to GE
spokesman Rick Kennedy and Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. </p>
<p>The Pentagon in April told General Electric and partner
Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/) that it was ending the secondary engine
program for Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)''s F-35. Since then, the U.S.
House has included provisions in its version of the annual
defense authorization bill to revive the project, which GE and
Rolls-Royce plan to self-fund. The Obama administration opposes
the legislation, calling the second engine wasteful spending. </p>
<p>The meeting took place at GE''s request, Whitman said in an
e-mailed statement. In his previous position as the Pentagon''s
acquisition chief, Carter terminated the second-engine project. </p>
<p>Pratt  Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (UTX),
builds the primary engine for the F-35. </p>
<p>GE Aviation leaders discussed the GE/Rolls-Royce desire
to seek congressional approval to self-fund the F136 development
in 2012, a proposal which received overwhelming support in the
House Defense Authorization bill, Kennedy said in an e-mailed
statement. The topic was part of an update on the General
Electric military engine fleet, Kennedy said. </p>
<p>Pentagon Still Opposed </p>
<p>Carter and GE officials agreed during the meeting to find
ways to enhance work on leading edge engine technologies,
Whitman said. The Pentagon''s position on scrapping the
development of the second F-35 engine is unchanged, according to
Whitman. </p>
<p>We believe it is just as important as ever to advocate
for the House DoD Authorization bill provision that preserves
the F136 engine and associated equipment, while authorizing GE
and Rolls Royce to self-fund the engine in 2012, Kennedy said. </p>
<p>The House legislation prohibits the Defense Department from
destroying or discarding the engines made by GE and Rolls Royce. </p>
<p>General Electric and Rolls Royce proposed to self-fund the
development of the alternative engine for the rest of this year
and next year. That would cost more than $100 million, Kennedy
said in May. The company''s goal is to compete with primary
engine maker Pratt  Whitney starting in 2016, Kennedy said. </p>
<p>Congress still has to approve the 2012 defense
authorization bill, which sets spending targets and military
policy. The House approved the bill in May and the Senate may
start debating its version of the bill as early as next week. </p>
<p>The Senate Armed Services panel included a provision that
prohibits any government funds to be spent on the development of
a second engine for the F-35. </p>
