&lt;p&gt;Richard Desmond, owner of the Daily
Express and Daily Star newspapers, asked Goldman Sachs Group Inc
to review his newspapers&#8217; assets, the Sunday Times of London
said, without saying where it got the information. There is no
formal mandate for a sale at this stage, according to the

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong granted 270 work visas for

March 11 earthquake, the South China Morning Post said, citing
Director of Immigration Eric Chan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented fast-track approval system was put in
place so that the department is able to approve the work visas
in two days, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the visas were given to senior managers of
multinational companies in Japan, mainly in the financial

&lt;p&gt;At Banco Santander SA (SAN) headquarters
on the outskirts of Madrid, Joaquin de Ena says he&#8217;s gotten used
to wearing his sweater vest indoors after the bank turned down
the heat to trim power use and greenhouse-gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is OK,&#8221; de Ena, director of corporate social
responsibility, says with a laugh as he looks at a conference
room thermostat as a chilly wind blows through the capital on an
early March day. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if it should go any lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on Santander&#8217;s 395-acre (160-hectare) campus,
Antonio Garcia Mendez is adapting the green philosophy to
investments. Spain&#8217;s biggest bank arranged a $324 million loan
for a U.S. wind farm developed by BP Plc and Sempra Energy (SRE) last
year, Bloomberg Markets reports in its May issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendez, 39, global head of power project and acquisition
finance, says his team has closed 40 deals already this year, 90
percent involving renewable energy. Investment in clean-energy
companies and projects rose 30 percent to a record $243 billion
in 2010, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander&#8217;s in-house conservation and ecominded investments
won it top billing in Bloomberg Markets&#8217; inaugural ranking of
the world&#8217;s greenest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data were compiled by Bloomberg from company filings,
websites, social responsibility reports and other public
documents. The ranking covers 188 banks with market
capitalizations of $10 billion or more in 49 countries,
assessing them in two areas: Investments in clean-energy
projects from 2004 through 2010 make up 70 percent of the final
score. The banks&#8217; efforts to reduce their own carbon footprints
account for 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla (TSLA) IPO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was second overall and topped the
list for green investing. New York-based Goldman, along with No.
4 bank Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), managed the $3 billion initial
public offering of Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW), Rome-based operator of
wind, geothermal and hydropower plants. Goldman also co-led the
IPO of Tesla Motors Inc., the Palo Alto, California, maker of
the $109,000 all-electric Roadster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milan-based UniCredit SpA (UCG) was No. 3. It arranged $1.4
billion of loans for wind farms, solar plants and waste-to-
energy generators last year, according to BNEF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of the top 10 banks are based in Europe, mirroring
the European Union&#8217;s commitment to curbing emissions through
such efforts as the world&#8217;s biggest carbon-trading market. The
EU plans to get 20 percent of its energy from wind, wave, tidal
and solar power and to cut carbon pollution by 20 percent from
1990 levels by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Environmental Awareness &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other U.S. bank among the top 10, No. 5 Citigroup
Inc. (C), is building on a 2007 pledge by former Chief Executive
Officer Charles Prince to invest $50 billion to fight climate
change. Spain&#8217;s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) was sixth,
followed by Edinburgh&#8217;s Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Societe Generale SA (GLE) in Paris, London-based HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and
another Paris bank, BNP Paribas SA. (BNP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander measured its global environmental footprint for
the first time in 2009 -- and aimed to improve. De Ena, 42, says
that raising awareness of environmental issues will help the
bank increase its overall operating efficiency and detect
financial risks for project loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander consumed 1,200 gigawatt-hours of electricity that
year, equal to 0.5 percent of Spain&#8217;s power demand, and emitted
the equivalent of 626,505 tons of carbon dioxide. It plans to
decrease those numbers by 3 percent a year during the next three
years. De Ena says it looks like Santander likely met the first-
year goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recycling Batteries &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is also parlaying its ties with Spain&#8217;s low-carbon
companies to make headway in Latin America. It arranged a $149
million loan for a 102-megawatt wind farm in Oaxaca, Mexico. In
its Brazilian branches, customers can leave batteries in white
bins for recycling. The bank collected 172 tons last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are markets that have done a lot, like Brazil and
Mexico,&#8221; Mendez says. &#8220;Others are yet to start but are very
concerned with carbon emissions and compliance. There is great
potential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are also chasing
carbon-free investments as they put their buildings on energy-
saving diets. Deep in the Madison Avenue basement of Zurich-
based Credit Suisse&#8217;s 30-story U.S. headquarters, an 800-ton
steel chiller produces ice during the evening when electricity
is cheaper. The ice is stored in 64 giant tanks to supplement
air conditioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse says it cut carbon emissions to zero last
year. It got about 208 million kilowatt-hours of electricity
from renewable sources, accounting for 34 percent of its global
energy consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero Footprint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank uses renewable energy exclusively for electricity
in all offices in Switzerland, says Andrew Aulisi, head of
sustainability for the Americas. The bank purchased carbon
offsets through sources including Europe&#8217;s emissions-trading
system to offset the 366,000 metric tons of CO2 the bank&#8217;s
50,100 employees were still emitting last year, Aulisi says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conservationists aren&#8217;t buying corporations&#8217; green
assertions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As environmental issues become more popular, companies
are ready to make any sort of claim to show their green
credentials,&#8221; says Brant Olson, a campaign director at
Rainforest Action Network in San Francisco. He points out that
banks also have big-spending clients from carbon-spewing
industries like coal and petroleum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a troubling sign for Europe&#8217;s banks, countries are
rolling back renewable-energy subsidies, making investments in
clean technologies potentially less lucrative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Pressures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., where the Senate voted last December to extend
tax credits for solar and wind producers for another year,
clean-energy projects face a different challenge. A glut of
shale natural gas, and prices that have tumbled 42 percent in
the past five years, are making alternative energy uneconomical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Global momentum for clean energy is not abating,&#8221; Aulisi
says. &#8220;But if subsidies are withdrawn, then you&#8217;ll see
significant declines.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup gained its No. 5 ranking thanks in part to two of
the biggest U.S. wind deals. It led banks that raised $1.43
billion in loans for Caithness Energy LLC to build the 845-
megawatt Shepherds Flat wind park in eastern Oregon, the world&#8217;s
largest. Citigroup also arranged $1.2 billion in financing for
Terra-Gen Power LLC&#8217;s Alta Wind Energy Center near Tehachapi,
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are elephant-size deals,&#8221; says Sandip Sen, global
head of Citigroup&#8217;s Alternative Energy Group. The bank had
planned to trim its greenhouse-gas emissions by 10 percent from
2005 by 2011. It now bets it can cut 25 percent by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Santander&#8217;s de Ena, the future means using less and
recycling more. He&#8217;s sure Santander can meet its goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Efficiency is one of the strengths of this bank,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;Energy savings is an area that we haven&#8217;t focused on
until now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to sell its Capsugel manufacturing unit to KKR
 Co. for $2.38 billion in an effort to focus on its higher-
profit business developing new medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company lowered its yearly revenue
forecast after backing out Capsugel, a unit that makes wholesale
pill casings and had $750 million in sales last year. Pfizer
said it will use proceeds from the deal to expand a planned $5
billion share repurchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s sale may be the first of several for Pfizer this
year, and may spur rivals to evaluate similar deals as generic
competition erodes sales of top-selling medicines, said Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at Miller Tabak  Co.,
which owns Pfizer shares. Drugmakers face generics copies in the
next five years to products with $141 billion in annual sales,
according to health research firm IMS Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pharma acts like a herd sometimes, and other
pharmaceutical companies are probably looking through their
portfolios as we speak,&#8221; Funtleyder said in a phone interview
today. Pfizer executives &#8220;have been signaling that they want to
do divestitures, and now they&#8217;re going through with it. That
will be perceived by the market as a positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 16 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $20.54 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 17 percent this year. KKR climbed 23 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $17.14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR&#8217;s Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of Capsugel is KKR&#8217;s second-largest deal in
the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In
November, a KKR-led group agreed to buy Del Monte Foods Co. for
$5.3 billion including debt. Capsugel, Pfizer&#8217;s smallest unit,
made more than 180 billion hard capsules for drugs in 2010,
Pfizer said. The unit is separate from Pfizer&#8217;s drug business
and will be easy to split off, said Barbara Ryan, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It really doesn&#8217;t make sense for Pfizer to keep it,&#8221;
Ryan said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s too tiny to make a
difference either way, and it&#8217;s a distraction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said Feb. 1 that he
is reviewing each of the company&#8217;s business units as the company
faces generic competition to $10.7 billion in annual sales of
its Lipitor cholesterol pill. Pfizer acquired the Capsugel unit
in its 2000 purchase of Warner-Lambert Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Starting Point&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our hope is that this represents the starting point of a
larger series of divestitures by the company, said Tim Anderson,
an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York, in a
note to clients today. Pfizer may shrink the company&#8217;s revenue
base by almost half, to as little as $35 billion from $67
billion, according to Anderson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To achieve this, Pfizer&#8217;s nutritionals, consumer health,
animal health and established products drug division may be
jettisoned,&#8221; Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer lowered its annual revenue forecast range by $800
million to $65.2 billion to $67.2 billion this year to reflect
lost Capsugel sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 81 acquisitions of U.S. health-care
companies by private equity firms in the past five years, with
an average value of $1.01 billion and a typical premium 64
percent. The biggest was the $32.2 billion purchase of hospital
operator HCA Holdings Inc. in 2006 by funds led by New York-
based KKR and Bain of Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$210 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR, the New York-based private-equity firm run by Henry Kravis and George Roberts has a portfolio of businesses with
more than 900,000 employees $210 billion in annual sales, the
company said. KKR&#8217;s investments in the health-care industry
include HCA Holdings, the largest publicly-traded U.S. hospital
chain, and Biomet Inc., a manufacturer of orthopedic medical
devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and KKR expect to complete the deal in the third
quarter. Morgan Stanley and Guggenheim Securities LLC were
financial advisers for the drugmaker, while Cadwalader,
Wickersham  Taft LLP and White  Case LLP provided legal
counsel. Simpson Thacher  Bartlett LLP acted as legal counsel
for KKR. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has finished a
turnaround at its Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana and
operations have returned to normal, Kevin Allexon, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allexon, based in Fairfax, Virginia, said in a Feb. 8
message that work on a fluid catalytic cracker and associated
units would last several weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic crackers are the main gasoline-making units at a
refinery. The Baton Rouge plant, second-largest in the U.S.
after Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Baytown, Texas, has a fluid catalytic
cracking capacity of 243,000 barrels a day, according to the
U.S. Energy Department&#8217;s Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge refinery processes domestic crudes from
Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alaska, according to the
company&#8217;s website. It also imports crude from Mexico, the North
Sea, West Africa, South America, Central America and the Arabian
Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant can process 525,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. government proposal forcing
bond issuers or lenders to keep stakes in securitized loans
contains a provision that may be a &#8220;deal killer&#8221; for home-loan
bonds and shut down the market for commercial-mortgage
securities, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies packaging property loans into securities would
need to set aside certain cash that they normally collect
upfront in bond sales. The proposed rules were released for
public comment on March 29 by regulators including the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;premium capture cash reserve accounts&#8221; would relate
to bonds tied to interest payments on securitized assets in
excess of what&#8217;s needed to pay other debt sold in the deals. The
accounts would be in addition to the amounts that issuers or
lenders must retain to satisfy a requirement that they hold 5
percent of the credit risk of transactions, according to the
proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For home-loan securities without government-backed
guarantees, a market that has become &#8220;close to viable&#8221; again
for the safest and largest loans, the provision &#8220;could
potentially be a &#8216;deal killer,&#8217;&#8221; New York-based JPMorgan
analysts led by John Sim and Ed Reardon wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sim didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking further
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reviving market for commercial-mortgage-backed
securities would also be damaged, separate JPMorgan analysts led
by Alan Todd wrote in another piece in the bank&#8217;s report,
released April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CMBS market, as it exists currently, would shut down
if the rules are enacted as written,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress Mandated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have arranged about $8.2 billion of commercial-
mortgage bonds this year, compared with $3.4 billion in all of
2009 and a record $234 billion in 2007, Bloomberg data show.
Less than $500 million of non-agency bonds backed by new home
loans have been created since July 2008, after sales reached
about $1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress mandated last year that U.S. agencies create risk-
retention rules, reflecting a view that a lack of skin in the
game among lenders and bond issuers helped fuel the shoddy
mortgages that sparked collapses in housing and financial
markets. Regulators included the provision on premium accounts
to address a way issuers could potentially work around their
rules&#8217; focus, including a &#8220;special anti-evasion&#8221; procedure to
strengthen the provision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of rules applies to so-called interest-only
securities or bonds sold for more than face value. It could be
most problematic for deals being put together during a period in
which interest rates are declining, Nomura Securities
International Inc. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Pushback &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This restriction would greatly decrease the
attractiveness of securitizations, as it would push issuers to
realizing gains over time rather than up-front,&#8221; the New York-
based Nomura analysts including Paul Nikodem and Ankur Mehta
wrote in an April 1 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision &#8220;might get the most pushback from banks
given that it forces big changes to their securitization
model,&#8221; Barclays Capital analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It could be improved substantially by allowing&#8221; a
modified version of the rules when originators have spent more
than the face value of the loans to obtain the debt, New York-
based analysts including Sandeep Bordia wrote in an April 1
report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired former
UniCredit SpA (UCG) analyst Eugenio Cicconetti to join its equity
research team covering Italian banks in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cicconetti, who resigned last week after almost two years
at Milan-based UniCredit, will start his post as senior banking
analyst in mid-July and report to Kian Abouhossein, said Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cicconetti, 35, covered Italian lenders including Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA and Unione di
Banche Italiane Scpa at UniCredit. His &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on
Verona, Italy-based Banco Popolare SC generated a return of 42
percent in the last 12 months, according data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining UniCredit, Cicconetti worked for Dresdner
Kleinwort as a banking analyst and for PwC Transaction Service&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
estimate of first-quarter U.S. economic growth by a percentage
point to 2.5 percent and said there are risks to the outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;First-quarter gross domestic product was held down by
temporary factors, including poor weather,&#8221; Jan Hatzius, chief
U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote in an e-
mailed note. &#8220;The risks to our second-half GDP forecast of 4
percent also remain on the downside&#8221; following higher energy
costs, tighter fiscal policy and weaker economic data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter and the Commerce Department is scheduled to
release an estimate of first-quarter GDP on April 28. Still, the
risks are &#8220;skewed toward&#8221; an earlier interest rate increase
from the Federal Reserve than the first quarter of 2013 as
currently forecast by Goldman Sachs, said Hatzius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The basic story of good growth, low inflation and
friendly monetary policy that we have been telling since late
last year still stands,&#8221; said Hatzius. &#8220;But it&#8217;s all a little
messier than we would like.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s $19 million
compensation for 2010, almost double the prior year, ended two
years in which the firm&#8217;s top executives gave up cash bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s pay included $5.4 million in cash, $12.6
million in restricted stock, a $600,000 salary and about
$464,000 in other benefits, a proxy statement from the New York-
based firm showed. Blankfein&#8217;s $9.8 million pay for 2009
included $9 million in restricted stock plus salary and other
compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash awards are back at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, after a 38 percent drop in annual earnings
and a year in which the stock price ended close to where it
began. While pay is up from 2008, when Blankfein, 56, and six
other senior officers got no bonuses, it remains below
Blankfein&#8217;s record-setting $67.9 million award for 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that they would return to a more market-based
pay is probably not surprising&#8221; after 2008 and 2009, said Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner at Compensation Advisory Partners
LLC in New York. &#8220;They&#8217;re not quite back to anything remotely
like what they paid in the prior years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 2010 share performance -- a decline of less
than half of 1 percent -- outstripped competitors including Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second-
biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs before both
converted to banks in 2008. Shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
which reported a record profit last year, rose 1.8 percent
during the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Difficult Market Conditions&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While our performance in 2010 was not as strong as in
2009 due to difficult market conditions for much of the year, we
continued to create value for our shareholders and prudently
manage our firm from a risk perspective,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in
the proxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 30 members of the management committee received only
restricted stock for their 2009 bonuses and four of them --Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55, President and Chief
Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, and Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans, 53, and John S. Weinberg, 54 -- received the same $9
million award as Blankfein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2010, Goldman Sachs once again matched those four
executives&#8217; bonuses to Blankfein&#8217;s $12.6 million in restricted
stock and $5.4 million in cash. All four also received a
$600,000 salary in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Partnership Mentality&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve had a history of paying their top five like
partners,&#8221; Orens said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unusual, but it really comes from
their partnership mentality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm disclosed in January that Blankfein&#8217;s salary will
increase to $2 million in 2011 and that Cohn, Viniar, Evans and
Weinberg will each receive a $1.85 million salary starting this
year. Each of them had received a $600,000 salary since 1999,
the year the firm became a public company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and eight deputies reaped a total of $125 million
during 2010 from their investments in private equity and hedge
funds managed by the firm, the proxy disclosed. Blankfein&#8217;s
payments, which included profits and any return of capital,
totaled $27.2 million, outstripping his compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Blankfein, the largest fund distributions were $23.3
million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; $20.2 million to
Cohn; $16.7 million to Viniar; and $13.7 million to Evans. The
others disclosed in the filing were $10.9 million to Vice
Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; $6.4 million apiece to Weinberg
and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and $430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s executives stand to earn more cash bonuses
in future years under a long-term incentive plan, the LTIP,
disclosed in the proxy. The payments are contingent on two
financial measures: return on equity and book value per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board&#8217;s Choice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial measurement period is three years and the board
can extend it through the end of 2018. The notional value of the
award for all five executives named in the proxy was $7 million,
a figure that wasn&#8217;t included in the 2010 compensation because
it won&#8217;t be delivered for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the executives to receive the awards in full, return on
equity, or ROE, must average 10 percent and book value per share
must rise an average of 7 percent, the proxy shows. They will
receive 150 percent of the bonus if the average ROE is 15
percent or more and book value per share climbs an average of 12
percent or more. The ROE target is below the firm&#8217;s long-stated
goal of achieving 20 percent return on tangible equity, which
equates to more than 15 percent ROE, over the economic cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleanor Bloxham, president of the Corporate Governance
Alliance in Columbus, Ohio, said Goldman Sachs seemed to be
responding to regulators&#8217; efforts to align pay to the firm&#8217;s
longer-term performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Paying out Cash&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Going forward I&#8217;m pleased that the LTIP cash will include
these deferral mechanisms so that it doesn&#8217;t encourage risk-
taking and that risk measures look at longer-term horizons,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a way to go in this year&#8217;s plan
because they&#8217;re paying out cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, all of the executives own company stock worth
hundreds of millions of dollars. Blankfein owned 3.29 million
shares as of March 7, the proxy disclosed, worth $527.6 million
at the $160.23 share price on April 1. Cohn&#8217;s 1.96 million
shares were worth $313.4 million and Viniar&#8217;s 1.89 million
shares were worth $302.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC requires that the company&#8217;s proxy disclose how much
compensation executives received during the fiscal year. Under
that methodology, which includes awards received during 2010 for
performance in prior years, Blankfein received a total of $14.1
million in compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board has unanimously recommended that the
firm give shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting at
9:30 a.m. on May 6 in Jersey City, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS),
Britain&#8217;s biggest government-owned lender, hired Sherry Liu from
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as chairman and chief executive officer of
the bank in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu, previously chairman of China Financial Institutions at
JPMorgan, will be responsible for overseeing and driving the
bank&#8217;s business strategy in China and its various joint
ventures, according to an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment demonstrates RBS&#8217;s &#8220;continuing focus on
building our corporate and investment banking business both in
and outside of China,&#8221; Asia-Pacific Chairman John McCormick
said. &#8220;RBS recognizes the importance of success in China as
critical to our business performance in Asia-Pacific.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester said yesterday
growth in Asia is crucial for the bank, which posted a net loss
of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.79 billion) for 2010 and has pledged
to return to profit this year. RBS, which is 83 percent owned by
the government, expects to triple its private banking assets in
India over the coming five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see across Asia a significant set of opportunities as
the economies develop, as the domestic markets get bigger and as
the two-way flows of capital and expertise become more
important,&#8221; Hester said in an interview in Singapore yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more than 500 million people in Asia with a net
worth of $10,000 to $100,000 and financial services revenue from
that segment of society is expected to grow by as much as 15
percent a year in most countries, Credit Suisse Group AG&#8217;s 2010
Global Wealth Report said. The combined wealth of millionaires
in the region will grow 8.8 percent annually until 2018,
compared with a global average of 7.1 percent, a report by
Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu will report to McCormick and Matthew Kirkby, the bank&#8217;s
regional head of global banking, according to the statement. She
will also join the global banking Asia-Pacific management team,
it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edinburgh-based RBS, which established a presence in China
in 1903, operates there through a locally-incorporated bank
headquartered in Shanghai that has five branches around the
country and 500 employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
biggest Spanish-language broadcaster, fell the most in four
months in Mexico City trading after saying it is discussing a
partnership with mobile-phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA to enter
the wireless market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 1.6 pesos, or 2.7 percent, to 58.38 pesos at
4 p.m. New York time, the biggest drop since Dec. 8. The
broadcaster, down 8.7 percent this year, was the day&#8217;s biggest
loser among the 37 companies in Mexico&#8217;s benchmark IPC index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa has said it plans to participate in the wireless
business, either through a direct investment or a reselling
arrangement, because it expects growth in the industry.
Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said in February
the company would consider all options for wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors fear Televisa will spend too much to enter the
mobile-phone market, straying from its strengths in the media
business, said Martin Lara, an analyst at Corp Actinver SAB in
Mexico City. Televisa&#8217;s plan last year to invest $1.44 billion
in Iusacell rival NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) hurt the stock before the
deal was abandoned, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it&#8217;s a small amount of resources, there&#8217;s no
problem,&#8221; said Lara, who doesn&#8217;t have a recommendation on
Televisa shares. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a very large amount that it wants to
invest in Iusacell, it would add risk to the stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Antitrust Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Iusacell, based in Mexico City, is controlled
by Ricardo Salinas, whose TV Azteca SAB has the second-largest
broadcast television audience in Mexico. Televisa has about 70
percent of the TV market, while Azteca has about 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil&#8217;s Mexican fixed-line unit, Telefonos de
Mexico SAB, filed an antitrust complaint against Televisa and TV
Azteca last month alleging monopolistic practices in broadcast
advertising. Televisa and Iusacell also filed antitrust
complaints last month against Telmex and against America Movil&#8217;s
Mexican mobile-phone unit, Telcel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell has also begun a service in Mexico City offering
home-phone, TV and Internet service over fiber-optic lines,
competing against cable-TV carriers controlled by Televisa.
Iusacell filed for bankruptcy protection in December in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa withdrew from its planned investment last year
with NII Holdings, Mexico&#8217;s fourth-largest wireless carrier,
after Iusacell went to court to challenge NII&#8217;s victory in a
government auction of mobile-phone airwaves. The company has
also explored a partnership with Telefonica. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities Investor Protection
Corp., which initiated the liquidation of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s
money-management firm, can be heard in trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s
$6.4 billion suit against JPMorgan Chase  Co., a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which is contesting Picard&#8217;s allegation that it
aided in Madoff&#8217;s $20 billion Ponzi scheme, said in a letter to
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon that SIPC&#8217;s filing of
arguments in the case wasn&#8217;t contemplated by existing agreements
between the parties and was done without informing JPMorgan. The
New York-based bank, which is trying to move the case to U.S.
district court from U.S. bankruptcy court, said it may object to
SIPC&#8217;s participation in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note on the docket yesterday said, &#8220;SIPC can be heard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), 11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s weighting in the
Nasdaq-100 Index was cut as the technology-heavy equity gauge
had its first major reshuffle since 1998 to better reflect
companies&#8217; market value. The maker of the iPhone fell in pre-
market trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s representation will be reduced to 12.33 percent of
the index on May 2, from 20.49 percent, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)
said in a slide show on its website today, after previous rules
caused its proportion in the gauge to grow disproportionately.
The weightings of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) will
more than double. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s weighting in the Nasdaq gauge is currently more
than six times that of the second-biggest constituent, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, while its market value is only 46
percent bigger, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rules
that adjusted members relative to their respective position in
the index caused stocks to move out &#8220;of alignment in relation
to their actual market capitalizations,&#8221; the presentation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would probably affect international funds, given
that Apple is such a big company globally,&#8221; said Tim Schroeders, a Melbourne-based money manager at Pengana Capital
Ltd., which manages about $1 billion. &#8220;Passive funds in
particular will be forced to re-weight into those stocks that
have had increases in weightings, and in the short term we will
see some selling pressure on Apple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging market credit in Asia will
outperform the U.S. as inflation in the region moderates,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), reversing a December
stance that favored developed countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace of Asian central bank policy tightening will be
&#8220;more moderate than the market feared,&#8221; Goldman Sachs credit
strategists led by Lotfi Karoui and Annie Chu in New York said
in a report dated April 1. That contrasts with the U.S. and
Europe, where the European Central Bank is likely to raise rates
this week and the Federal Reserve may confirm the end of its
quantitative easing program in June, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps beat the Markit iTraxx Asia index of swaps
by the most ever in the fourth quarter of 2010 on concern
inflation in Asia would force central bank rate increases. That
trend went into reverse last month, with the gap between the two
gauges shrinking the most on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This performance gap looks less justified now,&#8221; the
strategists said. &#8220;Economic activity in several countries is
slowing in response to policy tightening, which suggests that
inflation pressures will subside in the upcoming quarters. This
healthier macro backdrop should in our opinion allow the recent
underperformance of Asia ex-Japan to reverse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index, which investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, narrowed to 104 basis points, 10.5 higher than
the U.S. gauge, the tightest level since November, CMA data
show. The gap widened to 29 basis points on Feb. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps, which typically rise as investor
confidence deteriorates and fall as it improves, pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

McGrail" date="Apr 05, 2011 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-05/denver-schools-sale-to-help-escape-jpmorgan-swap-muni-credit.html"><headline>Denver Schools&#8217; Sale to Help Escape JPMorgan Swap: Muni Credit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Denver public school system is
borrowing $800 million to restructure pension debt and help
escape part of a money-losing interest-rate swap with JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denver City  County School District No. 1, Colorado&#8217;s
second-largest by enrollment, is issuing taxable securities with
about $400 million in fixed-rate bonds today and about $400
million of variable-rate next week, to replace $750 million
variable-rate debt and terminate a swap agreed with JPMorgan in
April 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district is being forced to restructure the debt in the
form of certificates of participation, because it is losing its
standby purchase agreement with Dexia Credit Local, a unit of
Dexia SA (DEXB), April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the best deal the board could unanimously agree
on,&#8221; said Jeannie Kaplan, a member of the district&#8217;s governing
committee, in a telephone interview. &#8220;It was important for us
to go forward with a united voice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale marks the end of months of debate among school
board members and administrators about how to restructure $750
million of variable-rate debt sold in 2008 with interest-rate
swap agreements. After district officials pushed for mostly
variable-rate borrowing and some board members wanted it all
fixed, the seven-member board chose a mix of half variable and
half fixed, said Kaplan, 65. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triple Food Bill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restructuring will cost about $50 million to end the
swap and pay the cost of new debt and other expenses, according
to bond documents. The exact cost to terminate the JPMorgan
contract isn&#8217;t spelled out in the preliminary official
statement. The district would have owed $85.4 million if the
swap had been unwound on June 30, 2010, the documents say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school system&#8217;s $750 million sale in 2008 also
refinanced debt sold for pensions and provided $12.1 million for
termination payments in connection with a swap from 2005, which
also was with JPMorgan, according to offering documents. The
estimated $62 million spent to end such agreements in the last
three years is almost three times annual spending for food,
according to the 2010-2011 recommended budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schools system used variable-rate debt and interest-
rate swaps to borrow $750 million at a lower cost than if it had
sold fixed-rate bonds. In most municipal market swaps, borrowers
sell variable-rate debt to investors. Then the issuer and the
banks agree on a swap in which a fixed-interest rate is paid to
the banks, who in turn pay a floating rate to the borrower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denver&#8217;s Swap &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Denver&#8217;s case, the contract called for the school
district to pay a fixed rate of 4.86 percent and receive a
floating rate equal to the wholesale cost of one-month deposits
in London, known as the London interbank offered rate. The
district expected that its borrowing cost would be 6 percent,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-month Libor rates fell to 24 basis points yesterday,
just 1.2 basis points higher than the record-low on March 1,
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg dating to 1984. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, one of the underwriters on the new issue, will no
longer have a swap agreement on the variable-rate debt after the
new debt is sold, said David Suppes, the district&#8217;s chief
operating officer, in a telephone interview. After the bond
sale, Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) will have swaps on the variable-rate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the bond sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s frustrating that we have to go through this
restructuring,&#8221; said Suppes. &#8220;But we believe the restructuring
will leave us in a positive position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standby Purchase Agreement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new variable-rate debt, the district will replace
the Dexia standby purchase agreement, which obliges an
underwriter to buy any unsold portion of an issue, with letters
of credit provided by JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Royal Bank of
Canada, according to bond documents. The credit facilities are
arranged for variable-rate debt issues to buy back bonds
investors don&#8217;t want to own when new interest rates are set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average yields on 10-year AA rated certificates of
participation rose to 4.08 percent yesterday, down 33 basis
points from Feb. 10, an almost three-year high for the
securities, according to Bloomberg Fair Market Value data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates of Participation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of certificates of participation, a type of
debt that gives investors the right to revenue from a lease,
keeps some conservative buyers from investing, said Bud Byrnes,
chief executive officer of RH Investment Corp., an Encino,
California-based broker-dealer, in a telephone interview. Some
asset managers won&#8217;t buy them, Byrnes said, because they fear
that the issuer would walk away from the lease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certificates usually pay about a 10-to-15 basis point
penalty in the marketplace,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia, based in Brussels, was among the biggest recipients
of U.S. Federal Reserve aid through its New York unit from the
Fed&#8217;s &#8220;discount window&#8221; lending program, according to Fed
documents released last week in response to a Freedom of
Information Act request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following are descriptions of pending sales of U.S.
municipal debt: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA, whose unemployment rate was 10.3 percent in
January, plans to sell $272 million in tax-exempt general
obligations tomorrow to refinance debt. The bonds are rated A2
by Moody&#8217;s, sixth-highest, and one level lower at A- by Fitch
Ratings, and BBB from Standard  Poor&#8217;s, second-lowest
investment grade. Banks led by JPMorgan will underwrite the
securities. (Updated April 5) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK CITY TRANSITIONAL FINANCE AUTHORITY, which helps
fund capital projects in the most-populous U.S. city, plans to
sell $500 million in tax exempts tomorrow to refinance debt. The
bonds, backed by personal-income taxes, are top rated from SP
and Fitch, and graded second-highest by Moody&#8217;s. Banks led by
Wells Fargo will underwrite the offering. (Updated April 5) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOWARD UNIVERSITY plans to sell $289 million in bonds
through the District of Columbia, including $65 in taxables, as
soon as tomorrow to refinance existing debt and fund building
renovations. The revenue-banked securities are rated A3 from
Moody&#8217;s and A- from SP, both fourth-lowest of 10 investment
grades. Underwriters led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch will
market the offering. (Updated April 5) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Montgomery, a senior Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) banker to the oil and gas industry, is leaving
the firm&#8217;s Houston office and plans to join a local private-
equity firm, said a person with knowledge of his plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montgomery, 49, may join Quantum Energy Partners later this
year, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. His
retirement is effective May 31, Goldman Sachs said in a
memorandum last month that was confirmed by Andrea Rachman, a
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montgomery was part of Goldman Sachs teams that advised
Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), the largest oilfield services company, on its
$11 billion acquisition of Smith International Inc. last year,
and counseled Apache Corp. (APA) on its $7 billion purchase of assets
from BP Plc (BP/) in the wake of the London-based oil company&#8217;s Gulf
of Mexico spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After joining Goldman Sachs from Merrill Lynch  Co. in
2000, Montgomery became a partner in 2002, the memo said. He
headed the natural resources investment banking group in the
Americas from 2003 to 2007. Outside of his banking work, he is a
former chairman of the board of trustees of the Houston Museum
of Natural Science and of the St. Francis Episcopal Day School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum, founded in Houston in 1998 by a group including
Wil VanLoh Jr., manages $5.7 billion of investments in the
energy industry, according to its website. It raised its fifth,
$2.5 billion fund in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beverly Jernigan, a spokeswoman for Quantum, had no
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London to Houston &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs banker in London, Suhail Sikhtian, will
move to Houston and become co-chief operating officer of the
global natural resources group along with Stephan Feldgoise,
Goldman Sachs said in a separate memo last month. Steve Daniel
remains head of the Houston office, and is co-head of energy
globally along with Alastair Maxwell, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs worked on $63.8 billion of mergers and
acquisitions in the oil and gas industry over the past 12
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, for a market
share second only to Barclays Plc&#8217;s Barclays Capital unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) are forming a partnership to develop in-car electronics
systems that help battery-powered vehicles run more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies will jointly invest 1 billion yen ($11.7
million) in Toyota Media Service Co., a Toyota subsidiary that
provides data services to drivers, the companies said in a
statement today. The system will include navigation and in-car
entertainment using Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Azure software. It will
also manage energy use in vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers are adding a broader range of entertainment and
power-saving tools to entice buyers to adopt electric vehicles.
Microsoft needs more customers to ensure success for Azure, its
cloud software for enabling companies to build and provide
software that can be delivered as a service over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer and Toyota
President Akio Toyoda plan to discuss the project with reporters
later today. The system relies on so-called telematics, which
involve the integration of wireless communications and computing
systems, often in vehicle navigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) have expanded the
range of technology services available in cars as well. Ford,
for instance, also offers an in-car electronics system developed
with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota aims to distinguish its system by including features
that can improve a vehicle&#8217;s energy efficiency. An electric
car&#8217;s range can vary significantly based on how drivers use
heating and cooling systems, and other in-car functions powered
by electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing Energy Use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota, based in Toyota City, Japan, said it&#8217;s already
testing a telematics system in its home country that links
drivers, cars and homes to help manage energy consumption.
Toyota plans next year to start selling a plug-in version of its
Prius hybrid. It also plans a tiny two-passenger electric car
and a rechargeable RAV4 sport-utility vehicle with a battery
system from Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership between Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Washington, and Toyota &#8220;is an important step in developing
greater future mobility and energy management for consumers
around the world,&#8221; Toyota&#8217;s Toyoda said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota has been an early customer for Azure, with the
carmaker saying last year that it was using the software to
track thousands of roadside assistance calls for its Lexus cars.
Azure competes with programs from Amazon.com Inc., Google Inc.
and Salesforce.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portugal&#8217;s borrowing costs are
&#8220;unsustainable&#8221; after the interest paid on an auction of 1
billion euros ($1.4 billion) of government bonds surged, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Chief European Economist Erik Nielsen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve been able to raise a bit of money, but it&#8217;s still
at rates that are clearly unsustainable,&#8221; Nielsen said in an
interview from London on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Surveillance
Midday&#8221; with Tom Keene today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese bond yields have climbed to record levels since
Prime Minister Jose Socrates quit on March 23 following a
parliamentary rejection of proposed budget-deficit cuts. That
has fuelled speculation the country will have to follow Greece
and Ireland and agree a financial rescue package with the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal needs to resort to the financing mechanisms
available in the European framework, Portuguese newspaper Jornal
de Negocios reported on its website, citing Finance Minister
Fernando Teixeira dos Santos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In Portugal right now, we&#8217;re in a stalemate with the
elections coming up in some months and an inability of them to
do very much about drawing up the program with EU and IMF,&#8221;
Nielsen said. So it&#8217;s a matter of &#8220;day by day and getting the
money in to get through these difficult months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters Plc (RWA), a U.K.
recruitment agency, said group net fee income rose 23 percent in
the first quarter, boosted by a &#8220;solid performance&#8221; in Asia
Pacific and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group net fee income, or gross profit, for the first
quarter climbed to 40.1 million pounds ($65.5 million) from 32.6
million pounds a year ago, the London-based company said in a
Regulatory News Service statement today. The company&#8217;s net cash
position was more than 20 million pounds at March 31, up from
15.6 million pounds a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As stated in our recent year-end results, the outlook for
the year remains broadly positive,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Robert Walters said in the statement, &#8220;We continue to pursue
our strategy of international expansion, having chosen Brazil,
China and Germany as new markets providing strong opportunities
for growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hays Plc (HAS), Britain&#8217;s biggest recruitment agency, said in
February it may expand its operations in Latin America, such as
in Chile and Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters net fee income in Asia Pacific grew 29
percent in the first quarter while net fee income in Europe rose
32 percent during the period. The recruiter said today its
operations in Japan, which were affected by a massive earthquake
which struck the island nation in March, are now operational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the strength in other regions will offset the
impact from the Japanese earthquake,&#8221; Henry Carver, an analyst
with Peel Hunt LLP, said in an e-mailed note to investors.
Carver recommends buying the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Walter shares added 4 percent to close at 320 pence
at 4:30 p.m. in London, giving the recruiter a market value of
245 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day after a jury heard recordings
of Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam thanking Danielle
Chiesi for a stock tip, a government agent testified about
Rajaratnam&#8217;s phone calls, trading dates and stock profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in Manhattan federal court yesterday presented
charts prepared by FBI Special Agent James Barnacle Jr.
connecting phone records, wiretaps, e-mails, share prices and
Galleon stock-trading records in an attempt to prove Rajaratnam
used confidential information to pick stocks. The U.S. said it
expects to rest its criminal case against Rajaratnam today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial in the largest crackdown on
hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The Sri Lankan-born
money manager is accused of making $45 million from tips leaked
by corporate insiders and hedge-fund traders. He has denied
wrongdoing and says his trades were based on legitimate
research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell granted a defense
request to bar prosecutors from offering as evidence videotapes
of ex-Intel Corp. executive Roomy Khan faxing him documents in
1997 and 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holwell said the videotapes would have been unfair to
Rajaratnam and had &#8220;diminished probative value.&#8221; Prosecutors
wanted to use them to support a claim that Khan leaked inside
tips to Rajaratnam in 2006 and 2007. Holwell said prosecutors
may use other evidence to prove that charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan, who pleaded guilty, has been cooperating with
prosecutors. She won&#8217;t testify at the trial, prosecutors have
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Taylor Bean President Says Ex-Chairman Ran Conspiracy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former president of Taylor, Bean  Whitaker Mortgage
Corp., Raymond Bowman, said ex-Chairman Lee Farkas ordered data
sent to Colonial Bank for nonexistent loans in an effort to
cover up the company&#8217;s growing deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowman, 45, testifying in federal court in Alexandria,
Virginia, yesterday for the government, said Farkas in 2003
explained that the sale of &#8220;dummy&#8221; loans, known as Plan B,
were necessary to prevent Taylor Bean from going out of
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I told him I didn&#8217;t think it was a good idea,&#8221; said
Bowman, who pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy and making
false statements. Bowman said he thought the plan was unethical
and &#8220;possibly illegal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farkas, 58, is charged with orchestrating a $1.9 billion
fraud scheme involving fake mortgage assets that duped some of
the country&#8217;s largest financial institutions, targeted the U.S.
bank bailout program and contributed to the failure of
Montgomery, Alabama-based Colonial Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowman is one of six people who have admitted to the
conspiracy and are scheduled to testify against Farkas, who
might spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted on 14
counts of wire, bank and securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Farkas, 10-cr-00200, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrari, Yacht Payoffs Alleged at Foreign-Bribes Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two executives at a California maker of power-line
equipment went on trial yesterday in Los Angeles, accused of
bribing officials at a Mexican utility with a car and a boat to
win orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsey Manufacturing Co. President Keith Lindsey and Chief
Financial Officer Steve Lee are charged with violating the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by using a Mexican intermediary to
pay off the officials, including buying one of them a $1.8
million yacht and a $300,000 Ferrari. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the closely held Azusa, California-based
company, which is also a defendant, paid Enrique Aguilar, an
independent Mexican sales representative and his company
inflated commissions to cover more than $5 million in bribes and
obtain orders from Comision Federal de Electricidad, a power
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They knew that in order to get business with CFE, they
had to pay bribes,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Miller said
yesterday in his opening statement in Los Angeles federal court.
One of the Mexican officials could pick up the Ferrari at the
Beverly Hills dealer in 2007 &#8220;without signing a single piece of
paper,&#8221; Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrique Aguilar&#8217;s wife, Angela Aguilar, was arrested last
year in Houston and charged with money laundering for setting up
a U.S. brokerage account through which the payments were made.
She is being tried with the Lindsey executives. Her husband was
also charged. A Mexican citizen, he isn&#8217;t in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The implication that the contracts were riddled with
corruption and stimulated by bribes is belied by the facts,&#8221;
Handzlik said. &#8220;Major purchases were stimulated by a need for a
vital product.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handzlik said that Enrique Aguilar&#8217;s business represented
other companies as well, and that Lindsey Manufacturing had no
control over what happened with the fees they paid for his
services, which were comingled with fees he received from his
other clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aguilar, 10-1031, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Feeder Fund Fairfield Sues Abu Dhabi for $300 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfield Sentry Ltd., a feeder fund that invested in the
Ponzi scheme of Bernard L. Madoff, sued the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority to try to recover $300 million in redemption payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfield Sentry, citing a $3.2 billion lawsuit against it
by Madoff trustee Irving Picard, has been filing so-called
clawback actions aimed at recouping money. Funds it received
from the jailed confidence man were passed on to its own
shareholders as redemption payments, it said in an April 1
bankruptcy court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unless redemption payments paid to shareholders are
recovered for the funds&#8217; estate, the funds will be unable to
satisfy their liabilities and claims,&#8221; it said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund is due to respond to
the lawsuit in May, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfield Sentry is being liquidated in the British Virgin
Islands and has a U.S. proceeding to protect its U.S. assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euart Glendinning, a spokesman for the investment
authority, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment
outside of regular business hours in the United Arab Emirates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fairfield Sentry Ltd. v. Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, 11-01719, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities Corp. Can Join Madoff Trustee JPMorgan Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities Investor Protection Corp., which initiated
the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s money-management firm,
can be heard in trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s $6.4 billion suit
against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which is contesting Picard&#8217;s allegation that it
aided in Madoff&#8217;s $20 billion Ponzi scheme, said in a letter to
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon that SIPC&#8217;s filing of
arguments in the case wasn&#8217;t contemplated by existing agreements
between the parties and was done without informing JPMorgan. The
New York-based bank, which is trying to move the case to U.S.
District Court from U.S. Bankruptcy Court, said it may object to
SIPC&#8217;s participation in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note on the docket April 4 said, &#8220;SIPC can be heard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Hurd Appeals Letter Release to Delaware Supreme Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Hurd appealed a judge&#8217;s decision that Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ) must release most of a letter about the ex-chairman&#8217;s
involvement with contractor Jodie Fisher, the relationship that
led to his departure from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr. on March
17 ordered that a redacted, public version of the letter be
filed within 10 days, and the pending appeal delayed that
release. Parsons on March 28 modified his earlier order, saying
that Hewlett-Packard should release the letter on the 10th day
following the filing of a notice of appeal unless he or the
Delaware Supreme Court issues a stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state high court yesterday ordered Hurd&#8217;s lawyers to
submit their opening brief on the appeal by May 19. It will
consider the case later, according to an electronic court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, sent by lawyer Gloria Allred on Fisher&#8217;s
behalf, is part of a case filed by HP shareholder Ernesto
Espinoza seeking access to company books and records. The letter
contains accusations of sexual harassment and details of Hurd&#8217;s
alleged advances toward Fisher and her rejection of them,
according to Parsons&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurd, now co-president of software maker Oracle Corp. (ORCL),
resigned from Palo Alto, California-based HP in August after a
company investigation determined he violated its standards of
business conduct. HP said it didn&#8217;t find that Hurd had violated
the company&#8217;s sexual-harassment policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no comment&#8221; on the latest appeal, a Hewlett-
Packard spokeswoman, Mylene Mangalindan, said yesterday in an e-
mailed message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancery case is Espinoza v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,
CA6000, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). The appeal is Hurd
v. Espinoza, 167, 2001, Delaware Supreme Court (Dover). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP, Spill Partners Seek Smaller Civil Fine for Gulf Spill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) said the U.S. should calculate its pollution fine
for last year&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico oil spill based on how long the
damaged well gushed, not on how many barrels of crude it
discharged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration in December sued BP and other
companies involved in the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
history, seeking a civil penalty based on the more than 4.1
million barrels of oil it said spilled into the gulf after the
Deepwater Horizon rig blew up off the Louisiana coast in April
2010, killing 11 people. The gusher was capped July 15 and
permanently sealed Sept. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP said in a filing April 4 in federal court in New Orleans
that the government should assess a fine based on the days the
well was in violation of the Clean Water Act, an alternative to
the government&#8217;s method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, the U.S. said it will seek civil
penalties of $1,000 for each barrel of oil spilled, or in the
case of negligence or willful misconduct, as much as $4,300 a
barrel from the companies involved, as provided under the law.
London-based BP has denied acting in a way that would trigger
the higher per-barrel fine. The company didn&#8217;t specify what the
penalty would be under its calculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) and MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC, BP&#8217;s
partners in the well, filed papers April 4 denying that they
acted with negligence or willful misconduct and repeating their
position that BP should pay the full cost of the spill. Anadarko
holds a 25 percent stake in the well, and MOEX, a unit of Mitsui
 Co., holds 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP admitted legal responsibility for damage caused by the
spilled oil and set aside $20 billion to compensate injured
parties and pay cleanup and restoration costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. vs. BP Exploration  Production Inc.,
2:10-cv-4536, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana
(New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Client Said to Plead Guilty to Hiding Bank Accounts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New Jersey businessman accused of conspiring with five
bankers at HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) to hide his Indian bank accounts
from U.S. tax authorities is scheduled to plead guilty next
week, according to court records and a person familiar with the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaibhav Dahake, of Somerset, New Jersey, will have a plea
agreement hearing on April 11 in federal court in Trenton, New
Jersey, court records show. He was indicted Jan. 26 on charges
of conspiring with bankers of &#8220;one of the largest international
banks in the world,&#8221; which has headquarters in England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based HSBC, Europe&#8217;s largest bank by market value,
is the bank, according to the person, who requested anonymity
because the U.S. Justice Department hasn&#8217;t identified the
conspirators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahake was the first taxpayer charged in a crackdown
focusing on whether HSBC helped clients with Indian accounts
hide assets from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. He&#8217;s accused
of conspiring with two bankers in New York, one in Fremont,
California, and two in Thane, India. He faces as long as five
years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HSBC does not condone tax evasion and fully supports the
U.S. efforts to promote appropriate payment of taxes by U.S.
taxpayers,&#8221; Juanita Gutierrez, a company spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahake&#8217;s attorney Lawrence Horn declined to comment.
Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Paul
Fishman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Dahake, 11-cr-42, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo to Pay $11.2 Million in SEC Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender, agreed to
pay $11.2 million to settle regulatory claims that Wachovia
Capital Markets improperly sold two collateralized debt
obligations tied to home mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wachovia unit, acquired by Wells Fargo during the
financial crisis, charged &#8220;undisclosed excessive markups&#8221;
while selling stakes in a CDO to the Zuni Indian tribe and an
individual investor as housing markets began collapsing, the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday in a
statement. Wachovia also falsely claimed it acquired assets for
a CDO &#8220;on an arm&#8217;s-length basis,&#8221; the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wachovia caused significant losses to the Zuni Indians
and other investors by violating basic investor-protection rules
-- don&#8217;t charge secret excessive markups, and don&#8217;t use stale
prices,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s securities unit didn&#8217;t admit or deny
wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the regulator&#8217;s claims,
according to the SEC&#8217;s statement. The violations occurred in
2006 and 2007, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement relates to actions taken by Wachovia in
2007 in the early days of the credit crisis,&#8221; Mary Eshet, a
Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The
issues presented here were complex, and Wells Fargo is pleased
to have resolved this matter with the SEC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon Pays $93.5 Million to U.S. to End Overcharging Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), the second-largest U.S. phone
company, paid the U.S. $93.5 million to resolve allegations it
overcharged the U.S. General Services Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department and the GSA, which supports
federal agencies with products and communications, found that
New York-based Verizon submitted false claims for reimbursement
of property taxes, common-carrier recovery charges and
unallowable surcharges, according to a government statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Corporations that contract to provide services to
federal, state and local governments must play by the rules,&#8221;
Assistant Attorney General Tony West said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whistle-blower lawsuit was filed on behalf of the
government by Stephen M. Shea and 2Probe LLC, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Verizon cooperated closely with the government throughout
the process,&#8221; Peter Lucht, a Verizon spokesman, said in an
interview. &#8220;It was in the best interest of all parties to
settle the matter. The government and Verizon disagreed on
whether certain fees could be charged under the contract, so
their settlement concludes the efforts by both parties to
resolve the dispute amicably.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Verizon Communications Inc., 07-cv-111,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ESPN is allowing
owners of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad and iPhone who subscribe to pay-
television service to watch its channels live on their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;WatchESPN,&#8221; available today at Apple&#8217;s App Store, will
stream ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPN3 to Time Warner Cable, Bright
House Networks and Verizon FiOS TV subscribers, the Bristol,
Connecticut-based sports network said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN, the most-watched U.S. sports channel, plans to start
inserting commercials into the video streams in August, said
Sean Bratches, executive vice president of sales and marketing.
Currently ads aren&#8217;t displayed when programs break for
commercials. ESPN is talking with Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) and
Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) about their use of its networks on the
companies&#8217; respective iPad apps, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our vision is to sell a dedicated and unique stream of
advertising on the iPhone and iPad platforms,&#8221; Bratches said in
an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re also experimenting with a different form
of advertising that will be more interactive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 23 cents to
$42.04 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 12 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching From Anywhere &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike apps from Time Warner Cable and Cablevision, which
restrict viewing to a subscriber&#8217;s home, ESPN lets viewers watch
from any location, Bratches said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ads seen through streams on apps from the cable companies
aren&#8217;t counted by Nielsen Co., which provides viewership data
that is used to determine how much advertisers pay for
commercials. Nielsen is working on a system to count online and
mobile viewing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN&#8217;s ad revenue from online and mobile viewing, although
small at first, will grow and add to the network&#8217;s total
revenue, Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York,
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a natural evolution,&#8221; Greenfield said. &#8220;It
shows the complexity of a world that relies on living-room
viewing transitioning to one where people watch television
anywhere and everywhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the channels, users of ESPN&#8217;s app must supply
cable-account information after downloading the free software. A
version optimized for the iPad will be released in May, the
company said. ESPN said it plans to make the software available
on other phones and tablets &#8220;in the near future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;WatchESPN&#8221; is customized for each viewer&#8217;s location to
comply with league contracts, Bratches said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is totally mobile,&#8221; Bratches said. &#8220;Whether
traveling, commuting or at a kids soccer game, you will have
complete access.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index fell 1 percent to 37,471.54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfa SAB (ALFAA MM), the world&#8217;s largest producer of
aluminum engine heads, fell 2.6 percent to 163.93 pesos, its
first decline in seven trading days. Before today, Alfa had
gained 35 percent since the end of 2010 compared to a 7 percent

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, declined 4.5 percent to 54.15
pesos, its lowest price since Oct. 12 and largest one-day
decline since April 27. Televisa agreed to buy a 50 percent
stake in Grupo Iusacell SA for $1.6 billion, entering Mexico&#8217;s
wireless market, the company said in a statement today to the
Mexican stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB (WALMEXV MM) slipped 1 percent to
35.31 pesos. Latin America&#8217;s largest retailer said same-store

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, will contribute assets including a 281,581-square-
foot building leased to a brewery to help its bankrupt, non-
operating Quigley unit pay asbestos claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley&#8217;s sixth outline of a plan to reorganize, filed in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan yesterday, also would require
Pfizer to forgive a secured claim of $86 million, a bankruptcy
loan of $12.6 million and unsecured claims of $33 million. The
drugmaker would also contribute $81 million in insurance
proceeds, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer will pay $42 million to acquire a commercial
property consisting of an approximately 281,581 square foot
building on approximately 12 acres of land,&#8221; according to court
papers. The building is leased to a distributor for &#8220;a leading
brewery company,&#8221; the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lease will produce net income of $1.9 million for the
first year of the lease, with the amount increasing over time,
the papers said. The location of the building and name of the
beer company aren&#8217;t specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Loder, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein refused to allow
Quigley to exit Chapter 11 court protection in September, saying
Pfizer had manipulated the process to benefit itself. Pfizer and
a committee of asbestos claimants won his approval of an
agreement that will support the new Chapter 11 plan, which still
requires court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel Industry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped most
operations in 1992. Pfizer said it never made or sold any
Quigley products, and some claimants hadn&#8217;t released Pfizer from
alleged &#8220;derivative liability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ensures that asbestos claimants are not compelled to
surrender their derivative claims against Pfizer without
appropriate compensation,&#8221; Quigley wrote in the plan. The plan
would give a 7.5 percent distribution to Quigley claims, and
give 23 percent of the liquidated claim value to claimants who
haven&#8217;t dismissed derivative claims against Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. As under prior proposals, Pfizer will
also contribute $264.9 million in cash and all of the stock in a
reorganized Quigley to a trust to pay asbestos claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in November reported a $701 million third-quarter
charge for asbestos litigation for Quigley. The ad hoc committee
representing 43,100 asbestos claimants asked the court to lift
an injunction that has barred them from bringing claims against
Pfizer since 2004, when Quigley filed for bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
biggest Spanish-language broadcaster, fell the most in almost a
year in Mexico City trading after agreeing to buy a 50 percent
stake in Grupo Iusacell SA for $1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 2.55 pesos, or 4.5 percent, to 54.15 pesos at
4 p.m. New York time. The shares, down 15 percent this year,
suffered their worst three-day drop since November 2008 after
Televisa disclosed talks with Iusacell on April 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase gives Televisa a way to offer clients mobile-phone service in addition to the packages of home-phone,
Internet and TV sold by its Mexican cable units. Iusacell, which
filed for bankruptcy protection last year, gets new funding
after struggling to gain market share against billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s America Movil SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, based in Mexico City, said today it will pay
$1.57 billion for debt convertible into Iusacell equity, plus a
direct payment of $37.5 million. Televisa said it would own 50
percent of Iusacell after the conversion of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement values Iusacell at as much as 18 times
enterprise value divided by its 2011 earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, estimated Tomas Lajous, an analyst at UBS AG, in a research note. Iusacell
delisted its shares last year from Mexico&#8217;s stock exchange and
hasn&#8217;t published earnings results since 2010&#8217;s first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still have some concerns on Televisa wanting to own
equity in mobile,&#8221; said Lajous, who is based in Mexico City.
The wireless business requires a higher degree of capital
investment than Televisa&#8217;s traditional media business, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 Million Customers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa agreed to pay an additional $400 million to
Iusacell shareholders if Ebitda reaches a cumulative $3.47
billion between January 2011 and Dec. 31, 2015. Iusacell had
Ebitda of about $150 million in 2009, according to Barclays
Capital Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not paying for the cash flows, so don&#8217;t try to look
at this from an Ebitda multiple,&#8221; said Carlos Madrazo,
Televisa&#8217;s investor relations officer, in a phone interview.
&#8220;We&#8217;re buying into the spectrum, we&#8217;re buying into the network,
we&#8217;re buying into the customer base and we&#8217;re buying into the
strategic value of this business to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell has more than 4 million subscribers and its
wireless network covers 70 percent of the market, Televisa said.
That gives it less than 5 percent of the Mexican market, behind
America Movil&#8217;s 71 percent and Telefonica SA (TEF)&#8217;s 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bankruptcy Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell filed for bankruptcy protection after failing to
gain a broader share of the market following billionaire Ricardo Salinas&#8217;s takeover of the company in 2003. Salinas also controls
TV Azteca SAB, which holds 30 percent of Mexico&#8217;s broadcast
television audience, trailing Televisa&#8217;s 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control of Mexico&#8217;s broadcasting market by those two
companies will give them a platform to advertise Iusacell&#8217;s
service. America Movil&#8217;s Telefonos de Mexico SAB unit filed an
antitrust complaint last month against Televisa and TV Azteca,
accusing them of monopolistic practices in broadcast
advertising. Televisa and Iusacell have also filed antitrust
complaints against America Movil and Telmex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa and Iusacell don&#8217;t expect Mexico&#8217;s antitrust
agency to block the agreement, said Luis Nino, vice chairman of
the banking unit of Grupo Elektra SA, also controlled by
Salinas. The companies haven&#8217;t yet solicited approval, an
antitrust official who can&#8217;t be named under the agency&#8217;s policy
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Increase Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be very difficult for a participant that has 4
percent of the market to be limited or stopped on competition
issues,&#8221; Nino told reporters today at a conference in Acapulco,
Mexico. &#8220;What we want is to increase competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa planned to enter Mexico&#8217;s mobile-phone market last
year by buying a stake in the local unit of NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD),
the nation&#8217;s fourth-biggest carrier, for $1.44 billion. The
company abandoned that plan after Iusacell went to court to
challenge NII&#8217;s victory in a government auction of mobile-phone
airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to buy Televisa dollar
bonds due 2018 instead of similar-maturity securities issued by
the Mexican government climbed to 23 basis points today, the
biggest gap since March 8, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The spread has increased 8 basis points since April
4, the day before Televisa said it was in talks with Iusacell
about a partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategy Pondered &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I just don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the best strategy for them
right now,&#8221; said Jack Deino, who oversees $1.75 billion in
emerging-market debt at Invesco Advisers Inc. in New York, in a
phone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re paying through the nose and they&#8217;re
not even getting full control.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa&#8217;s debt ratings won&#8217;t be changed as a result of the
Iusacell agreement, Fitch Ratings said today in a statement. The
company&#8217;s debt is rated by Fitch at BBB+, or three levels above
investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Televisa has the cash on hand to make these investments,
and the current business plan does not contemplate that
additional capital investments will be required,&#8221; Madrazo of
Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said potential rewards of investing in five
European nations including Greece and Ireland outweigh the risk
of losing $3 billion if the countries default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the unlikely occurrence of extremely bad outcomes in
all these countries, JPMorgan Chase ultimately could lose
approximately $3 billion,&#8221; Dimon said today in a letter to
shareholders. &#8220;But we are in the business of taking risks in
support of our clients and believe that this is a risk worth
bearing since we hope to be growing our business in these
countries for decades.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal is set to start hammering out a bailout package
that may total 75 billion euros ($107 billion), following Greece
and Ireland in seeking European Union aid. Nations in the
continent are seeking to quell the sovereign debt crisis that
threatened to splinter the euro region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the next year or two, we believe that the Euro Zone,
in fits and starts, will work through its problems,&#8221; Dimon
wrote. &#8220;It has the will and wherewithal to do so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had about $20 billion in net exposure to Greece,
Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy when the crisis began, and
the company scaled back some investments while continuing to
serve clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. began
the planned shutdown of an ethylene unit at its chemical plant
in Port Arthur, Texas, according to a filing with state

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Established procedures and practices will be followed to
safely shut down the process equipment,&#8221; The Woodlands, Texas-

&lt;p&gt;China Vanke Co., the nation&#8217;s biggest
publicly traded developer, jumped to the highest in more than
four months after saying March sales climbed and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. told investors to buy Chinese property stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanke jumped 2.4 percent to 9.15 yuan as of 3:00 p.m. local
close in Shenzhen trading, the highest close since Nov. 11.
Vanke&#8217;s contracted sales rose 48 percent in March to 9.3 billion
yuan ($1.4 billion) from a year earlier, and more than doubled
to 35.5 billion yuan in the first quarter, according to an e-
mail statement from the company late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s policy &#8220;will move to weaker tightening, as
measures aiming to curb inflation and cool the property market
have already started to work,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts led by
Hanfeng Wang and Helen Zhu wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government earlier intensified efforts to curb
speculation after prices gained for 19 consecutive months to
December and climbed in 68 of the 70 cities it monitored in the
first two months this year. Vanke said that while overall sales
increased, those in 14 major cities including Shanghai, Beijing
and Guangzhou, usual targets for speculators, declined 37
percent, adding to signs the measures are working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 40 Chinese cities including Shanghai said last month
they will cap new home prices below annual economic and
disposable per-capita income growth after local governments were
ordered to submit price control targets by the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Property curbs are already showing a clear impact on the
market with a sharp slowdown in transactions,&#8221; Tan Huajie,
Vanke&#8217;s board secretary, said in the statement. &#8220;Quick sales
strategy could help offset market fluctuation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property sales were traditionally stronger in March
compared with February, with businesses shut for at least a week
during the Lunar New Year holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China should expand limits on home purchases from large
cities to the entire nation in a bid to curb speculation, the
State Information Center&#8217;s economic forecast department said in
a report published in China Securities Journal newspaper today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks will become more reluctant to
provide financing to small and medium-size companies as Basel
III rules classify them as more risky, Klaus Diederichs, head of
European investment banking at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), told
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that are not publicly traded and have low credit
ratings will be especially regarded as risky borrowers,
Diederichs told the newspaper. Loans to medium-size firms will
therefore become disproportionately expensive and lenders will
use their capital elsewhere, FAZ cited him as saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it is
in talks with regulators about four warrants that were suspended
from Hong Kong trading last week because of a misprinted
settlement formula, and details will be announced &#8220;as soon as
possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four warrants linked to the Nikkei 225 Stock Average Index
were suspended from trading in Hong Kong on March 31. The
formula for the cash settlement amount per board lot for
European-style put and call warrants due Sept. 9 and Dec. 9 was
wrong in the listing and announcement documents, Goldman Sachs
said on March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the original document, the formula for
calculating the cash settlement included multiplying by the
exchange rate. In the amendment, the formula is calculated by
dividing by the exchange rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading in the warrants will continue to be suspended until
further notice, Goldman said in a statement to the exchange
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portugal is likely to be the last
euro region country to seek an international bailout after the
government yesterday joined Greece and Ireland in seeking aid,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not expect any other EMU sovereign to be in need of
financial assistance,&#8221; said Francesco Garzarelli, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s London-based chief interest-rate strategist, in a report
to clients. While Goldman doesn&#8217;t expect any &#8220;principal
impairment&#8221; for bonds sold by Ireland and Portugal &#8220;a
&#8216;voluntary&#8217; extension of the maturity profile of Greek debt is
likely.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal is aiming for a package that may be worth as much
as 75 billion euros ($107 billion), two European officials with
knowledge of the situation said. Bond yields have surged since
Socrates offered to resign on March 23 after parliament rejected
proposed budget cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds of &#8220;outer peripheral&#8221; countries &#8220;are likely to
remain volatile and less liquid as they are removed from bond
indices and fixed-income mandates,&#8221; Garzarelli said. Spreads
between the yields of Italy, Spain, Belgium and those of AAA-
rated economies such as Germany &#8220;will slowly compress,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects half of Portugal&#8217;s funding to come
from European funds and the rest to come from the International
Monetary Fund. The EU may use the opportunity to align the
bailout lending rates of Portugal and Ireland with those of
Greece, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA Chief Executive
Officer Emilio Azcarraga said the world&#8217;s biggest Spanish-language broadcaster is making its $1.6 billion bet on wireless
to expand faster than it can in its traditional media business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azcarraga, 43, is adding to the company&#8217;s collection of
media and telecommunications assets by buying a 50 percent stake
in Grupo Iusacell SA, Mexico&#8217;s third-largest wireless carrier,
to share control with billionaire Ricardo Salinas. Azcarraga
plans to use the agreement to compete against Carlos Slim&#8217;s
America Movil SAB for customers in Mexico, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a message that we&#8217;re not going to stay put with a
company that grows 3 or 4 percent,&#8221; Azcarraga said today in an
interview at Televisa&#8217;s Mexico City headquarters. &#8220;We need a
company that grows at a higher rate to deliver results to
investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa&#8217;s stock has fallen 7.5 percent in Mexico City
trading since the company announced on April 5 it was in talks
with Iusacell, compared with a 1.1 percent decline for Mexico&#8217;s
benchmark IPC index. Televisa fell 12 centavos today to 54.03
pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I understand they have doubts,&#8221; Azcarraga said. &#8220;We
have the management, the people and the right strategy in place
with Iusacell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azcarraga, who has led Televisa since his father&#8217;s death in
1997, has expanded the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language
broadcaster into cable and satellite TV services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not &#8216;Crazy&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those businesses represented 39 percent of Televisa&#8217;s
fourth-quarter sales, compared with 38.5 percent for the
broadcast business, where growth has slowed in a market where
Televisa gets 70 percent of the audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of people, when we started satellite, they said we
were crazy, and we weren&#8217;t,&#8221; Azcarraga said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa&#8217;s cable division is competing with America Movil&#8217;s
fixed-line unit, Telefonos de Mexico SAB, for customers of
phone, Internet and video service in the home. They have also
engaged in a political battle this year, with both sides filing
antitrust complaints against the other as they jockey for
position in Mexico&#8217;s telecommunications market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to create a competition, a real competition,
that can provide a better product, a better service and a
cheaper price for the user, at the same time making money out of
it,&#8221; Azcarraga said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if in 10 to 15 years we&#8217;re
going to be leaders, but we&#8217;re going to have a good business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advertising Disagreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s companies, including retailers in his Grupo Carso
SAB, have declined to purchase advertising on Televisa&#8217;s
networks this year, saying the disagreement is over price.
Televisa has asked regulators to reduce the fees America Movil
can charge to connect calls from its competitors&#8217; customers to
its network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telmex has accused Televisa of overcharging for pay
television services, a market regulators haven&#8217;t allowed Slim&#8217;s
company to enter. Telmex has instead teamed with Dish Mexico, a
satellite provider controlled by MVS Comunicaciones SA and
EchoStar Corp., to jointly offer phone and TV services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides are going to do what&#8217;s in their best interests
in the market, Azcarraga said. He offered no prediction for how
the conflict would be resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa wanted to buy all of Iusacell, just as it earlier
wanted to buy full control of the Mexican unit of NII Holdings
Inc. (NIHD), Mexico&#8217;s fourth-largest mobile-phone carrier, Azcarraga
said. Neither was for sale, and getting control of half of
Iusacell is better than the 30 percent stake Televisa almost
bought last year in the NII unit, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iusacell&#8217;s Court Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa backed out of that agreement after Iusacell went
to court to challenge NII&#8217;s victory in a government auction of
mobile-phone airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing control with Salinas, whose TV Azteca SAB competes
with Televisa in the broadcast business, will work because both
investors share the same objective, Azcarraga said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Televisa always would like to get control, but I don&#8217;t
think Ricardo would like to sell that control,&#8221; Azcarraga said.
&#8220;He also believes the communications and mobile sector is going
to be very big in the growth of his business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust regulators may take about six months to approve
the agreement, said Salvi Folch, Televisa&#8217;s chief financial
officer, in an interview. The agreement will give Iusacell
enough working capital to invest in its business for the first
time, giving it a better opportunity to grow, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azcarraga declined to say how much he believes Iusacell can
expand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you see the growth in telecommunications in
basically all of the countries of the world, it&#8217;s very big,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Len Blavatnik got counts
reinstated in his lawsuit claiming JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) lost 10
percent of the $1 billion it managed for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York state court Judge Melvin L. Schweitzer in
Manhattan upheld the claims in a decision today after Blavatnik
filed an amended complaint in December. That complaint gave more
context for negotiations of an investment-management agreement
between the parties, the judge said. Schweitzer declined to
dismiss claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty that
he had previously tossed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Structured in such a fashion, the claims for breach of
contract, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty do not
overlap,&#8221; he wrote in his decision today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik claims JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, put twice as much money into risky mortgages as
Blavatnik&#8217;s investment guidelines allowed while Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon was unloading such investments from the
bank&#8217;s books. Blavatnik says the bank lost $98 million of his
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s decision on the motion to dismiss is a
preliminary step in the case,&#8221; Darin Oduyoye, a JPMorgan
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Discovery is
ongoing. J.P. Morgan Investment Management denies the
allegations in the complaint, and will continue to defend
against all claims vigorously until the final resolution of the
case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Broad Discretion&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2006, Blavatnik and JPMorgan entered into an
investment agreement that gave the bank &#8220;broad discretion to
carry out its role,&#8221; the judge wrote. &#8220;This IMA maximized
plaintiff&#8217;s legal protections in a market environment where
conflicts risk was of significant concern to plaintiff.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2009, Schweitzer threw out Blavatnik&#8217;s claims
for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. He refused to
dismiss accusations of breach of contract and negligent
misrepresentation, though he narrowed the contract claim. In his
decision today, he ruled similarly, upholding the two latter
claims while narrowing the contract claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state appeals court upheld Schweitzer&#8217;s earlier ruling
and JPMorgan moved to dismiss Blavatnik&#8217;s new complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is &#8220;an improper attempt&#8221; to &#8220;use the courts to
collect reimbursement for investment losses that have resulted
from an extraordinary and unprecedented economic crisis that no
one could have anticipated,&#8221; New York-based JPMorgan has said
in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, born in Ukraine, runs New York-based Access
Industries Group, which owns energy, chemical, aluminum, media
and real-estate companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 53, sued JPMorgan in June 2009, claiming the
bank loaded his Access Industries fund with subprime and so-
called Alt-A mortgages at the same time CEO Dimon was ridding
his bank of such exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in court papers that the instruments it sold
were different from those in the Access Industries account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subprime mortgages are loans made to people with poor
credit scores. Alt-A mortgages are loans made to people with
higher credit scores than subprime borrowers who still don&#8217;t
meet underwriting criteria established by government-sponsored
entities such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or
Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management
Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin America&#8217;s
largest soft-drink bottler, plans to sell peso bonds for the
first time in two years before the central bank starts raising
interest rates from a record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottler, known as KOF, next week will sell 5 billion
pesos of fixed-rate bonds due 2021 and floating-rate notes due
2016, said Roland Karig, a spokesman in Mexico City. The fixed-
rate notes may yield 105 basis points more than government debt,
or about 8.50 percent, according to Scotia Capital Inc. Similar-
maturity bonds from America Movil SAB, which shares KOF&#8217;s A-
credit rating from Standard  Poor&#8217;s, yield 8.48 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fastest expansion in a decade in Latin America&#8217;s
second-biggest economy is prompting traders to bet that the
central bank will boost benchmark lending rates from 4.5 percent
as soon as August. Mexico is the only major country in the
region that hasn&#8217;t increased borrowing costs in the past year.
Brazil raised rates five times and Chile nine times as inflation
rose and commodity prices climbed to the highest in more than
two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a good moment to go to the market,&#8221; Karig said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Considering the outlook, many banks are
suggesting that in the coming months they may raise rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mexico&#8217;s inflation dropped to a four-year low of 3.04
percent in March, the pace of economic growth is fueling concern
that price increases will pick up later this year, according to
Sergio Luna, the head economist at Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Banamex unit
in Mexico City. The economy may expand as much as 5 percent this
year after 5.5 percent growth in 2010, the most in a decade,
Finance Minister Ernesto Cordero said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone is trying to take advantage of the low rates,&#8221;
said Alonso Madero, who helps manage about $5.5 billion of debt
at Corp. Actinver SAB in Mexico City. &#8220;We&#8217;re definitely going
to participate&#8221; in KOF&#8217;s debt sale, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank will raise rates by 75 basis points, or
0.75 percentage point, by the end of the year, according to
trading in TIIE, or interbank rate futures contracts. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies still may have time to sell debt before rates
head up, a survey showed. The central bank will resume increases
in January, according to the median economist estimate in an
April 4 survey by Banamex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates on Hold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This year rates aren&#8217;t going to move,&#8221; said Ricardo Aguilar, an economist with Invex Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico
City. &#8220;Inflation will begin to accelerate, but within the
expectations of Banco de Mexico.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karig said the company will use proceeds from the bond sale
to pay debt maturing in 2012 and bolster cash reserves. Coca-
Cola Femsa became the world&#8217;s largest franchise for Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola Co.&#8217;s namesake beverage in October. Mexico City-
based KOF&#8217;s profit rose 6.9 percent to 3.02 billion pesos in the
fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is about taking advantage of the market in regards
to rates and the spread,&#8221; Eduardo Uribe, an analyst with
Standard  Poor&#8217;s in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican dollar
bonds instead of Treasuries fell 3 basis points to 126,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-Default Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years fell four basis points to 97, according to CMA prices
in New York. Brazilian credit-default swaps dropped three basis
points to 107 and the U.S. swaps were little changed at 41.1
basis points. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or cash equivalent if the
issuer fails to comply with debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso gained 0.4 percent to 11.73050 per dollar. The
currency is up 5.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa shares were little changed at 94.99 pesos.
Its parent company, Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, whose
holdings include the Oxxo convenience store chain and Dos Equis
beer, rose 0.3 percent to 71.36 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican companies sold 62.8 billion pesos in local bonds in
the first quarter, the fastest start on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a sense that this is the floor for interest
rates,&#8221; said Luna, the economist. &#8220;From the point of view of
the corporate market, it&#8217;s a good time to sell debt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is unlikely to
react to the plunge in overnight lending rates, which won&#8217;t
interfere with policy makers&#8217; ability to change monetary
policy, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective federal funds rate dropped to as much as 0.16
percentage point below the rate the central bank pays banks on
excess reserves, which is equal to the top of the Fed&#8217;s zero to
0.25 percent target range for overnight loans between banks. The 
rate, a volume-weighted average on trades by major brokers, was
0.09 percent on April 5, equaling the lowest since June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate &#8220;is still perfectly consistent with the directive
issued by the Federal Open Market Committee,&#8221; wrote a team of
Goldman economists lead by Jan Hatzius, in an e-mailed note
today. &#8220;The effective funds rate has been around current levels
before: between September 2009 and January 2010 the funds rate
averaged 12 basis points. Unless market functioning is seriously
disrupted, we would not expect a Fed response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash in the banking system has risen this year, in part as
Fed&#8217;s purchases of Treasuries boosted banks&#8217; reserves parked at
the Fed. Excess reserves have climbed to $1.431 trillion from
$1.296 trillion a month ago, and $2.2 billion at the start of
2007. The Fed began paying interest on the reserves in October
2008 to keep the overnight interest rate traded in the market
close to the target set by policy makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 0 to 1/4
percent,&#8221; according to the minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee&#8217;s  March 15 meeting, which were published April 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repo Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate on repurchase agreements for government debt and
Treasury bills also escalated a 2011 decline this week, guided
down in part by the decline in the funds rate, as a cut in
government bill sales on behalf of the Fed, central bank debt
purchases and a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. fee change
helped trigger collateral shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a repurchase agreement, one party provides cash to
another in exchange for a security, and vice versa. Repos are
typically used to finance holdings, meaning movements in the
rates affect the cost of holding the securities in inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s ability to pay interest on excess reserves will
enable the central bank to drain the over $1 trillion added to
the financial system to combat the financial crisis and lift
rates when economic conditions warrant, wrote the economists at
Goldman, one of the 20 primary dealers that act as
counterparties on open-market operations with the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess Reserves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The striking observation about the funds market today is
that despite $1.4 trillion in excess reserve, the effective
funds rate remains well above zero,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &#8220;This is
clear evidence that the payment of interest on excess reserves
exerts a powerful force. That said, the recent variability in
the funds rate may influence one aspect of the exit strategy:
the way in which the FOMC communicates policy changes,&#8221;
referring to a method that Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke already
suggested last year, the Goldman economists added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke in February 2010 testimony to the House Financial
Services Committee stated that the Fed was considering the
&#8220;utility, during the transition to a more normal policy
configuration, of communicating the stance of policy in terms of
another operating target, such as an alternative short-term
interest rate.&#8221; Adding that, &#8220;in particular, it is possible
that the Federal Reserve could for a time use the interest rate
paid on reserves, in combination with targets for reserve
quantities, as a guide to its policy stance, while
simultaneously monitoring a range of market rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell for a second day as
crude oil rallied above $112 a barrel for the first time in 30
months, lifting energy shares while dragging down transportation
and consumer companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) lost 6.6 percent as the
NYSE Arca Airlines Index slid to an almost seven-month low,
while FedEx Corp. (FDX) and Macy&#8217;s Inc. fell at least 1.9 percent.
Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) paced gains in 30
of 41 energy companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index.
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) and Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold
Inc. (FCX) led raw-material producers higher as metals advanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,331.35 after gaining as
much as 0.5 percent earlier today. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average decreased 20.32 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,389.17.
The U.S. dollar fell 0.9 percent to $1.4435 per euro, helping
drive up prices of commodities traded in dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As oil rises, the synchronized trade is to de-risk,&#8221;
said Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based money
manager at Stifel Nicolaus  Co., which oversees $110 billion in
client assets. &#8220;Higher commodities prices raise concern about
future inflation and consumption. One should keep a careful eye
on companies&#8217; forecasts and on input costs in particular.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 6 percent in 2011 through yesterday as
government stimulus measures and higher-than-estimated profits
boosted investors&#8217; optimism. U.S. stocks fell yesterday,
dragging the Dow average down from an almost three-year high, as
another earthquake shook Japan and a dispute over the federal
budget threatened to shut down the American government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats have agreed to $38 billion in U.S. budget cuts,
and funding for Planned Parenthood remains the only policy
sticking point in talks aimed at avoiding a government shutdown
tonight, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have worked out every other rider&#8221; on policy issues
aside from Republicans&#8217; insistence on halting money for Planned
Parenthood, said Reid, a Nevada Democrat. &#8220;If they back off
from this ideological issue that is holding up this country, we
have a number agreed upon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities rose for a seventh day on optimism about
economic recovery and on a weaker dollar. Gold and tin climbed
to records. The SP GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw-materials
futures reached the highest level since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil rose above $112 a barrel in New York for the first time
since 2008 and surpassed $125 a barrel in London as a fire
burned at Libya&#8217;s Sarir field, bolstering concern that unrest in
the region will further reduce supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar dropped against most of its major counterparts
on speculation the Federal Reserve will trail other central
banks in raising interest rates and as signs of global growth
damped demand for haven assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not in a bubble condition,&#8221; said Philip Orlando,
the New York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated
Investors Inc. (FII), which manages $358.2 billion. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
multiple drivers that are resulting in this commodities rally.
There&#8217;s a weaker dollar versus the euro in response to European
monetary policy. There&#8217;s also inflation concern. The third and
most important one is the improvement of global economic growth,
which is resulting in more demand. That&#8217;s positive for stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher
said the central bank faces a &#8220;significant&#8221; risk of providing
record stimulus for too long and should weigh curtailing its
$600 billion bond-purchase plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tipping Point&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We at the Fed are near a tipping point,&#8221; the 62-year-old
regional bank chief said in the text of a speech today in
Dallas. &#8220;Just as we pressed on in doing our duty through
extraordinary, exigent measures, we must now discipline
ourselves to just as persistently normalize our operations in a
timely way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYSE Arca Airline Index slumped 2.5 percent as 14 of
its 15 stocks retreated. United Continental Holdings fell 6.6
percent to $19.62. AMR Corp. (AMR) declined 3.8 percent to $5.81. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FedEx lost 1.9 percent to $92.11 and Macy&#8217;s slipped 2.3
percent to $24.82. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy shares had the biggest gain within 10 SP 500
industries, rallying 0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron gained 0.8 percent to $109.86. Occidental Petroleum
added 2.3 percent to $103.41. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs Natural Resources gained 1.1 percent to $99.46.
Freeport-McMoRan, the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded copper
producer, rose 1.3 percent to $58.18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expedia Inc. (EXPE) surged 12 percent to $25.09. The company will
split into two separate businesses, giving investors a chance to
own shares in its fast-growing TripAdvisor unit. TripAdvisor,
which includes 19 travel and advertising brands, will be spun
off into a publicly traded company. Expedia investors will
receive a proportionate amount of shares in TripAdvisor, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seagate Technologies Plc advanced 8.2 percent to $15.89.
The world&#8217;s largest maker of computer disk drives said it would
pay a quarterly dividend of 18 cents and reported third-quarter
sales that topped analysts&#8217; predictions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s rushed
acquisition of Washington Mutual in 2008 has turned out to be
&#8220;a bit worse than expected but clearly still worth it,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mortgage and credit-card portfolios, which were
initially written down by $30 billion, have continued to
deteriorate, Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders
released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thought losses could wind up being $10 billion worse
(pretax) and we have experienced about half that,&#8221; wrote Dimon,
55. &#8220;We anticipate some further potential downside, depending
on the health of the U.S. economy, as well as some other one-
time gains and losses relating to litigation and other
unresolved matters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought Wamu&#8217;s banking operations in September 2008
during the financial crisis for a $1.9 billion payment to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Regulators seized the Seattle-
based lender after defaults on subprime home loans soared,
triggering the biggest banking failure in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wamu&#8217;s mortgage origination and servicing businesses
performed better than expected, while its other retail banking
operations, such as checking accounts and credit cards, &#8220;did
significantly worse,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the acquisition delivered prospects that
turned out to be better than anticipated, such as lending to
small businesses and commercial banking. The expanded commercial
banking and term-lending businesses may eventually deliver more
than $500 million each in annual profits, &#8220;significantly better
than we expected,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software company, sued a unit of the U.K.&#8217;s Amphion Innovations
Plc (AMP), seeking a court declaration that two patents are invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed yesterday in federal court
in Manhattan, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said Aphion&#8217;s
DataTern unit has sued other companies for infringing the
patents and, in their court papers, &#8220;referenced Microsoft
software.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute are patents 5,937,402, issued in August 1999,
and 6,101,502, issued in August 2000. Both patents deal with
relational databases and software. On April 4, DataTern filed a
patent infringement suit in federal court in Marshall, Texas,
accusing 11 companies in a variety of industries of infringing
one of the two patents that is the subject of the Microsoft case
against DataTern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the companies DataTern sued in that case are General
Mills Inc. (GIS), Hewlett-Packard Co. and Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its suit against DataTern, Microsoft said that some of
the defendants sued by DataTern have asked Microsoft to defend
them in the patent-infringement case, or to provide them with
indemnification. This has &#8220;placed a cloud over Microsoft and
its products&#8221; and has injured the Redmond, Washington-based
company&#8217;s business and business relationships, Microsoft said in
its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataTern has filed four additional infringement suits since
June 2009 relating to one or both of the patents that are the
subjects of Microsoft&#8217;s suits, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft claims a large number of defendants have been
dismissed from those cases, which, the software company says,
resulted in payment to DataTern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued in its court papers that both patents are
invalid because elements of each invention were not new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to declare it hasn&#8217;t infringed either
patent or induces others to infringe them. It also asked for
awards of attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is represented by Dale M. Heist, Steve J. Rocci
Aleksander J. Goranin and Daniel J. Goettle of Woodcock Washburn
LLP of Philadelphia, and Danielle L. Rose, Michael S. Kim and
Carrie A. Tendler of Kobre  Kim LLP of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. DataTern Inc., 1:11-cv-
02365, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE Says Ericsson Lawsuit Won&#8217;t Have Adverse Impact on Business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE Corp. (763), a Chinese telecommunications equipment maker
that&#8217;s being sued by Ericsson AB for alleged patent
infringement, said the lawsuit won&#8217;t have any &#8220;material and
adverse&#8221; impact on the company&#8217;s financial conditions and
operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business in the U.K. accounted for a &#8220;very small share&#8221;
of ZTE&#8217;s overall operating revenue, the company said in a
statement filed to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial Tobacco, BAT to Fight Aussie Cigarette Packaging Law &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial Tobacco Group plc (IMT) and British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)
have both threatened to sue Australia&#8217;s government over new
requirements that all cigarettes be sold in that country in
plain packages with no brands showing, the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott McIntyre, a BAT spokesman, told ABC that the
government &#8220;is trying to take away our intellectual property
rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified spokesman from Imperial Tobacco told ABC
&#8220;we will take whatever measures are open to us to protect our
valuable intellectual property and if that means going to court,
we will go to court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mark Davison, who teaches trademark law at
Australia&#8217;s Monash University, told ABC the tobacco companies
chances of winning a trademark case are slim because &#8220;there is
no acquisition of property going on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Thomson&#8217;s Headwaters Sued For Trademark Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headwaters Capital LLC, the private-equity fund begun in
2007 by Todd Thomson, the former chief financial officer of
Citigroup Inc. (C), was sued for trademark infringement by a Denver-
based merchant bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headwaters MB LLC, which registered its name as a trademark
in July 2001, said it has invested almost $2.5 million in
advertising and promotion of its mark. The company claims that
consumers associate &#8220;Headwaters&#8221; as a provider of &#8220;top-level
investment and merchant banking and private-equity investment
services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed April 5 in federal court
in Nashville, Tennessee, the Colorado company became aware of
Headwaters Capital in August 2010, and the company claims it
received numerous calls and e-mails from people who mistakenly
believe the entities are connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sent Headwaters Capital a cease-and-desist
letter in October 2010, and, in a Nov. 2 letter, demanded that
the New York-based company agree to a three-month phase-out of
its use of the &#8220;Headwaters&#8221; trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies&#8217; names and Internet domain names are &#8220;so
similar in terms of appearance, sound, meaning and connation&#8221;
that consumers are confused, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headwaters MB asked the court to bar the New York company&#8217;s
use of the name, and for awards of money damages, profits
derived from Headwater Capital&#8217;s alleged infringement, extra
damages to punish the New York company for its actions, and
awards of attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Merrill, a spokesman for Thomson, said in an e-mail
statement that &#8220;the allegations contained in the complaint are
entirely without merit and we look forward to addressing them in
court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headwaters MB is represented by Paige Waldrop Mills of Bass
Berry  Smims PLC of Nashville. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Headwaters MB LLC v. Headwaters Capital LLC,
3:11-cv-00333, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee
(Nashville). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Eagle Outfitters Sues Furniture Chain for Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO), a Pittsburgh-based clothing
chain with more than 900 retail outlets, sued a Chicago
furniture company for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed April 1 in federal court in Chicago,
accuses American Eagle Furniture Inc., of infringing trademarks
by moving into retail operations in shopping malls beginning in
February 2010. Before that, the furniture company had
&#8220;historically operated as a wholesale vendor&#8221; and hadn&#8217;t used
&#8220;American Eagle Furniture&#8221; as a service mark or a trademark,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clothing company says it sent multiple cease-and-desist
letters to the furniture company and received no response. It
claims that the furniture company is using &#8220;American Eagle
Furniture&#8221; in &#8220;a deliberate and willful attempt to draw on the
goodwill and commercial magnetism&#8221; of the clothing stores&#8217;
marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to order the furniture company to quit
using &#8220;American Eagle Furniture&#8221; and to cancel any advertising
in which it uses that mark. Additionally, it asked for an award
of three times the profits the furniture company derived from
its alleged infringement, plus money damages, and asked that the
damages be tripled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Eagle also asked for awards of attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Eagle Furniture didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an
e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Eagle Outfitters is represented by Debra R.
Bernard and Jeremy L. Buxbaum of Seattle&#8217;s Perkins Coie LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Eagle Outfitters Inc., v. American
Eagle Furniture Inc., 1:11-cv-02242, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Woman Acquitted of Criminal Trademark Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cleveland, Ohio, resident was acquitted of a criminal
trademark case, WFMJ.com television news reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerie Edwards was charged with criminal infringement
after police found counterfeit DVDs in the trunk of her car
during a traffic stop, according to WFMJ.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said she was given the videos to be donated to the
Boys Club of Cleveland, WFMJ.com reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louboutin Sues Yves Saint Laurent Over Red-Sole Shoes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Louboutin SA, the designer of expensive red-sole
women&#8217;s shoes popularized by characters on &#8220;Sex and the City,&#8221;
sued Yves Saint Laurent America Inc., alleging it violated
Louboutin&#8217;s trademark for the footwear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louboutin, based in Paris, said Yves Saint Laurent is
selling shoes with red soles that are &#8220;virtually identical&#8221; to
its own, according to a suit filed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan. It seeks a court injunction against the sale of the
shoes and damages of at least $1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Laurent has been selling red-sole shoes under brand
names such as Tribute, Palais and Woodstock at high-end fashion
stores that also sell Louboutin footwear, including Saks Fifth
Avenue, Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants&#8217; use of a red sole on their infringing
footwear threatens to mislead the public, and has impaired
plaintiffs&#8217; ability to control their reputation,&#8221; Louboutin
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridget Helene, a spokeswoman for New York-based Yves Saint
Laurent America, said in an e-mail that the company had no
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designer Louboutin got the idea for the red-sole shoes
when he painted red nail polish on the black soles of a pair of
women&#8217;s shoes, the complaint states. He introduced the red soles
in 1992 and since then they have been on all of the company&#8217;s
luxury shoes, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Barneys&#8217; website, Louboutin red-sole shoes are priced
from $445 to more than $4,000 a pair. Vanity Fair magazine
reported in May 2010 that San Francisco-based romance writer
Danielle Steel owns 6,000 pairs of Louboutin shoes, buying every
item in his collection each season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded Louboutin a
trademark for the red sole in 2008, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louboutin was informed by Yves Saint Laurent executives by
letter in January that they planned to &#8220;continue to sell the
infringing footwear,&#8221; the lawsuit states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves Saint Laurent is a unit of Paris-based PPR (PP), which owns
Gucci and other luxury brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Laurent, the Algeria-born French fashion designer,
died in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louboutin has filed three other trademark infringement
suits in federal court in Manhattan since December 2009,
according to Bloomberg data. All three have been dismissed, with
permanent court orders against the defendants barring future
infringement. None of those suits was against a well-known
couture house such as Saint Laurent.      The new case is
Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves Saint Laurent America Inc., 11-
2381, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ax Murder Defendant Says IP Rights Violated by TV in Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man on trial for an ax murder in Portland, Oregon, has
raised copyright issues in efforts to keep television reporters
from showing his face during the trial, the Oregonian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wayne French, who is accused of smashing a pickax
into the skull of his roommate, asked the judge to order the
reporter to turn off his equipment because he didn&#8217;t want the
media telling his story, according to the Oregonian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the court was &#8220;allowing a commercial entity to
make money off of this&#8221; and claimed they didn&#8217;t &#8220;have a right
to my name, likeness and . . . story,&#8221; the Oregonian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French&#8217;s request was denied by Judge Michael Marcus, who
said that under Oregon&#8217;s open court system, lawyers and video
cameras are allowed in the court, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and its state-owned
China partner will invest about $4.4 billion building a resort
in Shanghai, the entertainment company&#8217;s second amusement park
in the world&#8217;s most-populous nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Disney Resort will open in about five years
and be the first in mainland China for the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, which opened Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005.
Shanghai Shendi Group Co. will own 57 percent of the resort with
Disney owning the rest, and financing will be proportional to
ownership, according to a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger called the investment a
&#8220;defining moment&#8221; as Disney bets on China&#8217;s rising middle
class to fuel growth, three years after the global financial
crisis hurt spending in the U.S. and Europe. The company
increased film production in the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major
economy and plans to open Disney stores there by 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney has the strongest China strategy of all the media
companies,&#8221; said Alan Gould, an analyst with Evercore Partners
in New York who recommends the stock. A longer-term goal is to
negotiate wider distribution of films in China and the creation
of a 24-hour television channel, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Most Significant&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entertainment company may collect more than $200
million in annual management fees in a decade, plus licensing
revenue, Gould estimated. The park will attract 7.3 million
visitors annually, the Shanghai government said March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will hold a 70 percent stake in the management
company that will develop the resort and collect operating fees,
with Shanghai Shendi owning the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is our most significant investment in a market that
is experiencing dynamic growth,&#8221; Iger, 60, said in a separate
phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney declined 23 cents to $42.04 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. The stock has gained 12
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing area by
sales for the Burbank, California-based company, expanding 25
percent to $2.3 billion, which is 6.1 percent of total revenue,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial Investment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney and Shanghai Shendi today started building the
resort, which will occupy 963 acres (3.9 square kilometers) with
&#8220;room to expand,&#8221; the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial investment in the theme park will be about 24.5
billion yuan ($3.7 billion), according to the statement. Another
4.5 billion yuan will be spent building the rest of the resort,
which will include two hotels and retail, dining and
entertainment areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Disneyland may be the first of three theme parks
on the resort&#8217;s 7 square kilometers (1,730 acres), according to
a local government website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 330 million people live within three hours by car or
train from the site, Disney said. Spending on domestic leisure
travel in China may double to more than $200 billion by 2015,
according to Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks  Resorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China is the most exciting opportunity we&#8217;ve had since
Walt first bought land in Florida in 1964,&#8221; Staggs, 50, said at
a Feb. 17 investor presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30 million Chinese enter the middle class each year,
he estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Expo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland, part-owned by the city government,
missed its forecast to attract 5.6 million visitors in its first
year and has yet to make a profit. The park, which narrowed its
annual loss to HK$720 million ($93 million) in the 12 months
ended Oct. 2, has been criticized for its small size, with
Disney saying it fell short of expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism growth in China and Asia will support both parks,
said Andrew Kam, managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every park has to go through its learning process,&#8221; he
said today when asked if he had any advice to give to the
management of Shanghai park, which Staggs said will be larger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai&#8217;s $44 billion World Expo attracted 73 million
visitors from May 1 to Oct. 31 last year, with its 5.28 square-
kilometer park drawing 1 million visitors on a single day, local
media reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we saw at the Expo was a major learning process for
us,&#8221; Iger said. Disney has been &#8220;in communication&#8221; with
China&#8217;s government for more than a decade, Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Absorb Large Crowd&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s Shanghai park was designed &#8220;around how to absorb
a large crowd and still give them a good experience,&#8221; Staggs
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai project will be financed 30 percent with debt
and 70 percent with equity, with the companies making
proportional investments based on ownership, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Disneyland may generate management fees of
$65 million-$70 million for the company in the first year and
more than $200 million annually within a decade, Gould said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also will collect a license fee of about 6 percent
on ticket sales, revenue for the use of its name on hotels and a
separate fee on merchandise, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme parks contributed 28 percent of Disney&#8217;s $38.1
billion in full-year revenue and 17 percent of its $7.59 billion
in operating income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai also plans to spend 4 billion yuan ($611 million)
on a 9.2-kilometer (5.7-mile) subway line to the theme park in
the city&#8217;s Pudong area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) paid $421,458
in expenses related to the sale of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s Chicago house, which went under contract in September
after more than three years on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total includes $306,000 for real estate commissions and
fees for the eight-bedroom mansion, the New York-based bank said
in a regulatory filing yesterday. The home, located in Chicago&#8217;s
Gold Coast neighborhood, sold for $6.8 million, according to
documents on the website of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment was made &#8220;in accordance with the firm&#8217;s
general policy on relocation expenses, applicable to all
eligible employees who relocate at the request of the firm,&#8221;
according to the JPMorgan filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 55, moved to New York after JPMorgan&#8217;s 2004 purchase
of Bank One Corp., and kept the Chicago house while his children
completed high school, according to the filing. He listed the
property for $13.5 million in April 2007 before cutting the
asking price multiple times to as low as $6.95 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago-area home prices declined 25 percent from April
2007 through September, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index
of values in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon and his wife, Judith, bought the 15,000-square-foot
(1,390-square-meter) property in 2000 for $4.7 million,
according to county records. The mansion, which has nine full
bathrooms and a 900-square-foot terrace, was built in the late
1800s and is near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate panel that spent a
full day last year questioning Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
executives including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
about the company&#8217;s business practices before the 2008 credit
crisis will release its findings next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report, &#8220;Wall
Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial
Collapse,&#8221; is likely to focus, at least in part, on role of
Goldman Sachs, which paid $550 million last year to resolve
regulatory claims that it misled investors in sales of
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages.
&#8220;Significant new information&#8221; will be included in the April 13
report, the panel said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators Carl Levin of Michigan, the Democrat who leads the
subcommittee, and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, its top Republican,
will issue findings drawn from a two-year probe by lawmakers and
staff members. The panel held public hearings examining the
failure of Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), and the role of credit-
rating firms Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s in
the financial crisis as well as Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sales of CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Goldman Sachs executives testified appeared before the
panel in April 2010, lawmakers compared the bank&#8217;s mortgage
bankers to bookies and Levin asked why they sold securities that
company employees termed &#8220;shitty&#8221; deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subcommittee members questioned seven current and
former executives, including Blankfein and Chief Operating
Officer Gary D. Cohn, about whether the firm was betting
against the housing market as it also sold mortgage-linked
securities to customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) agreed to
acquire a stake in its proposed A$20 billion ($21 billion)
Wheatstone natural gas project in Western Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, will gain 6.4 percent
of the liquefied natural gas plants and 8 percent of the fields
off northwest Australia that will supply the Wheatstone
development, Chevron said in an e-mailed statement today.
Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has called the Wheatstone venture and the A$43
billion Gorgon LNG project the &#8220;centerpieces&#8221; of its global
growth plans. The Hague-based Shell also owns 25 percent of
Chevron-led Gorgon on Barrow Island, the largest of more than a
dozen LNG projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea seeking to
tap Asian demand for cleaner-burning alternatives to coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wheatstone venture initially will produce 8.9 million
metric tons of the fuel a year from two processing units, or
trains, when it begins in 2016, the company said last month. The
project may have as many as six units and produce as much as 25
million tons of LNG annually, Chevron said last July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron plans to make a decision in the second half of this
year to proceed with the project, it said today. Wheatstone is
estimated by Deutsche Bank AG to cost A$20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s $61
billion payment plan is &#8220;highly unlikely&#8221; to win approval and
contains &#8220;gifts&#8221; to bondholders that other creditors haven&#8217;t
approved, said a group of derivatives creditors including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Silver Point Capital LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group has said it may file a rival plan and wants the
judge to consider it concurrently with Lehman&#8217;s proposal.
Lehman, which is set to ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck on
June 28 to allow creditors to vote on its proposal, asked Peck
last week to give &#8220;primacy&#8221; to its proposal in order to &#8220;best
serve the interests of all stakeholders,&#8221; delaying
consideration of other plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman is trying to deal with mounting opposition to the
way it will apportion among creditors the $61 billion it aims to
raise as it liquidates assets. It amended its plan in January,
taking money from derivatives creditors to pay bondholders more
after a group including hedge fund Paulson  Co. filed a rival
proposal. Now it must deal with challenges from Goldman Sachs,
Silver Point and other derivatives creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paulson group of bondholders, including the California
Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System, has challenged Lehman&#8217;s
plans through much of its bankruptcy. On April 9, it said the
defunct firm, which is participating through an affiliate in a
bid for hotels owned by Innkeepers USA Trust, is taking a risk
that its own stake in the deal might be &#8220;virtually valueless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Unit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which aims to allow a second Lehman unit to
recover most of a $220 million mortgage to Innkeepers, is part
of a multibillion-dollar conflict between Lehman and its
affiliates as the parent solicits support for its plan to pay
Creditors, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for Lehman&#8217;s plan to be heard first, Harvey Miller,
Lehman&#8217;s lead bankruptcy lawyer, said last week in a filing that
the Paulson-Calpers plan &#8220;presents the parochial interests of
13 entities that collectively purport to hold claims of
approximately $20.2 billion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman also is fielding objections from creditors on how it
will share information with them as they try to understand how
Lehman was run and how creditors should be paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the former investment bank asked Peck to reject any
remaining objections to revised rules it had set up to circulate
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, &#8220;Left to their own devices, scores of
creditors, all represented by their own separate attorneys,
would serve multitudes of voluminous and duplicative document
requests,&#8221; it said. The process might take years, and Lehman
would incur &#8220;thousands of attorney hours&#8221; responding to such
individual requests,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman paid its lead bankruptcy law firm, Weil, Gotshal 
Manges LLP, $279.9 million in the 29 &#189; months through February,
according to a regulatory filing. It foots the bill for an
official creditors committee as part of those outlays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also today, FTI Consulting Inc., a financial adviser to the
Lehman creditors committee, asked a judge to approve fees of
$12.7 million for work done from October through January, plus
expenses of $186,352. According to a court filing, FTI has so
far asked bankrupt Lehman for a total of $52.2 million in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008 with debt of $613
billion, making it the largest bankruptcy ever in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Emilio Azcarraga said investors should
give his management team a &#8220;vote of confidence&#8221; as it spends
billions of dollars to reshape the company into a media and
communications empire in Mexico and the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa has dropped 10 percent in Mexico City trading
since April 4, the day before the company disclosed it was in
talks with Grupo Iusacell SA, Mexico&#8217;s third-largest wireless
carrier. The companies announced April 7 that Televisa would buy
a 50 percent stake in Iusacell for $1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors such as Jack Deino of Invesco Advisers Inc. have
said Azcarraga is overpaying for a company that has failed to
gain market share against billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s America
Movil SAB. Azcarraga said Iusacell is a key piece of his plan to
make Televisa&#8217;s communications companies a better alternative
for Mexican consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They need to have confidence in the management of
Televisa,&#8221; Azcarraga, 43, said in an April 8 interview at
Televisa&#8217;s Mexico City headquarters. &#8220;We have been a very good
investment for them, and we&#8217;re very grateful that they have had
confidence in us for a long time. I ask them to give us a vote
of confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azcarraga is taking Televisa from its roots as Mexico&#8217;s
biggest broadcaster into direct competition with Slim, the
world&#8217;s richest man. America Movil controls 71 percent of the
country&#8217;s wireless market and 80 percent of wired phone lines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medivation Inc. (MDVN) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
said their experimental drug Dimebon failed to ease Huntington&#8217;s
disease symptoms and testing for the illness will end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study of the medicine as a treatment for Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease will continue, the companies said in a statement. In
Huntington&#8217;s, Dimebon didn&#8217;t work better than a placebo in
lessening mental decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimebon, a 28-year-old hay fever treatment, failed in a
trial for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease in March 2010. Caused by a genetic
defect on chromosome 4, Huntington&#8217;s has no cure and there is no
way to prevent the disease from worsening, according to the
National Institutes of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Huntington&#8217;s is a challenging disease area, and we are
also disappointed,&#8221; said Steve Romano, the head of Pfizer&#8217;s
medicines development group, in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington&#8217;s symptoms include antisocial behavior,
hallucinations, irritability, paranoia, abnormal movements and
dementia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medivation, based in San Francisco, rose 37 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $20.48 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading. Pfizer, based in New York, rose 21
cents, or 1 percent, to $20.67 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors treating diabetes patients
for nerve-pain symptoms should consider Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Lyrica,
the best-studied drug for the condition, among 13 underutilized
treatments, new guidelines suggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrica, with sales topping $3 billion last year, was the
only medicine that ranked in the top tier of the recommendations
as having &#8220;very strong&#8221; research supporting it, according to
the first guidelines for the condition issued today by the
American Academy of Neurology. Twelve additional treatments were
&#8220;probably effective&#8221; and should be weighed by physicians to
meet the individual needs of each patient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 16 percent of people with diabetes develop pain and
numbness from nerve damage caused by high blood-sugar levels,
according to the report. About 40 percent of patients with nerve
pain aren&#8217;t being treated for it, said guideline author Vera
Bril, professor of medicine at the University of Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole field has so many options, it gets confusing,&#8221;
Bril said in a telephone interview from Honolulu, where the
guidelines were presented at the neurology academy&#8217;s annual
meeting. &#8220;You have to choose the treatment that&#8217;s most suitable
for the patient.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers combed through 2,234 research reports to find
the 79 most relevant studies, Bril said. One of the 13
recommended medicines with the greatest potential benefit is a
50-year-old depression treatment called amitriptyline. The drug
wasn&#8217;t included in the top level of recommendations because the
studies for it weren&#8217;t as comprehensive as more recent clinical
trials, Bril said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also identified nine treatments that aren&#8217;t
recommended to treat the nerve pain, including the epilepsy
drugs Trileptal, made by Novartis AG (NOVN), and Lamictal, by
GlaxoSmithKline, as well as magnetic-field treatment and low-
intensity laser therapy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asked a judge
to dismiss claims filed by three retirement funds alleging the
company, with the complicity of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, ignored its duty to protect $500 million in notes while
gaining $1.7 billion in profits from secured investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan knowingly and intentionally enriched itself
despite having actual knowledge that its actions would
substantially impair the financial interests&#8221; of noteholders,
three pension plans contend in court papers filed in federal
court in Manhattan as part of a 2009 lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s decision to enrich itself included &#8220;direct
involvement by Jamie Dimon,&#8221; the funds&#8217; lawyers said in a March
31 brief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These accusations are false and have no basis in fact,&#8221;
Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, said today in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The undisputed evidence shows that JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s
commercial and fiduciary businesses were separated,&#8221; thus
&#8220;preventing any arguable conflict,&#8221; the bank&#8217;s lawyers wrote
in a brief seeking judgment in their favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit centers on JPMorgan&#8217;s 2007 purchase for the
funds of $500 million in medium-term notes secured by assets of
Sigma Finance, an offshore investment vehicle. The bank is
accused by the plaintiffs, who ended up with about 6 cents on
the dollar, of knowing Sigma would fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Discounts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They allege JPMorgan made money in another deal by
secretly providing repurchase financing to Sigma secured by
&#8220;high-quality assets in large blocks at deep discounts&#8221; to
&#8220;capitalize on very big money making opportunities as the
market deteriorates,&#8221; according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From the start, Dimon was keenly interested in Sigma&#8217;s
assets,&#8221; and sought &#8220;a very real picture of the assets that
will be unwound,&#8221; according to one JPMorgan employee&#8217;s e-mail
cited in the funds&#8217; brief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another e-mail &#8220;between senior JPMorgan officials,&#8221;
the company acknowledged before the repurchase completion that
Sigma &#8220;is unlikely&#8221; to continue as a going concern, according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was unchanged at $46.84 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 3:35 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-00686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California gasoline prices rose as
a unit at Chevron Corp.&#8217;s El Segundo refinery was said to be
shut for unplanned maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker is down at the
279,000-barrel-a-day Chevron plant, according to Bob van der Valk, a fuel pricing analyst at 4Refuel Inc., a Canadian fuel-
management company. &#8220;West Coast traders are saying it will be
down for a week,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We generally do not discuss any details about the day-to-
day operations of the refinery,&#8221; said Rod Spackman, a spokesman
for the plant. &#8220;This ongoing work has no impact on our ability
to deliver products to our customers here in the Southern
California region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend gasoline in Los Angeles
rose 3.75 cents to 17.25 cents versus futures traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange in New York at 2:17 p.m. Prompt
delivery fell 1.46 cents to $3.3811 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differential for the same fuel in San Francisco rose
3.50 cents to 12.75 cents a gallon over futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge overseeing Capmark
Financial Group Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy will consider allowing
creditors to sue Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) units for at least
$96 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi today rejected
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s claim that the allegations against it were
resolved when Capmark settled a larger potential lawsuit related
to a $1.5 billion Capmark loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors of Capmark want permission to sue Goldman Sachs,
arguing units of the bank were insiders who wrongly used their
position to collect at least $96 million from Capmark. That
money should be returned and given to lower-ranking creditors,
they said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit would allow creditors to collect &#8220;at least
$96 million&#8221; from Goldman Sachs affiliates, said the official
committee of unsecured creditors in court papers filed in
Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sontchi didn&#8217;t say when he would decide whether creditors
have presented enough evidence to justify allowing a lawsuit to
go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Sontchi gave Capmark, based in Horsham,
Pennsylvania, permission to settle allegations that a
$1.5 billion loan made about five months before Capmark filed
bankruptcy in 2009 was a fraud on creditors because it wrongly
boosted the repayment priority of Goldman Sachs and other
lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that settlement, Capmark paid New York-based Goldman
Sachs and the other lenders about $835 million, less than the
full value of the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
property values and a drop in lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR, Goldman Sachs, Dune Capital Management LP and Five
Mile Capital Partners LLC bought 78 percent of Capmark, then
called GMAC Commercial Mortgage, in 2006 for $1.5 billion in
cash and the repayment of $7.3 billion of debt, before General
Motors Corp. sold a 51 percent stake in the rest of its finance
business, GMAC LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in bankruptcy, the company sold its loan-servicing
unit to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Leucadia
National Corp. (LUK) in a deal valued at $468 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Capmark Financial Group Inc., 09-13684,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economic growth will spur
gains for &#8220;upstream&#8221; commodity producers, consumer companies
and banks, according to Jing Ulrich, chairwoman of China
equities and commodities at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China will continue to lead the developing world and fuel
the need for raw materials,&#8221; Ulrich told reporters today in
Shanghai. &#8220;Commodities will be a bright spot for the
foreseeable future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s increasing dependence on commodity imports like
iron ore, coal, copper and oil will drive global demand, Ulrich
said. This will benefit natural resource producers in Australia
and Latin America, while the government&#8217;s plan to expand
spending in infrastructure and affordable housing will help
boost the earnings of cement producers including Anhui Conch
Cement Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer companies such as Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding
Corp., China&#8217;s biggest maker of packaged food, will maintain
profit margins even as they face pressure from higher wage costs
given the outlook for consumption growth over the next five
years, Ulrich said. China&#8217;s lenders will benefit from higher net
interest margins as borrowing costs rise, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) collected
almost $1.9 billion from collateral it obtained on lending to
the London-based investment vehicle Sigma while clients lost
almost all the $500 million they invested with the fund, the New
York Times reported, citing court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, rejected the
accusations and said the bank lent Sigma more than $8 billion to
help it survive and did its best to protect its clients, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit claims that JPMorgan employees planned to profit
from a collapse of Sigma even as employees in another of the
bank&#8217;s unit left their customers&#8217; money invested, the Times
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the assets JPMorgan received as a security depost
for its loans to Sigma appreciated in value and provided the
bank with a large profit, the newspaper reported, citing the
suit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge overseeing the
liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s defunct investment firm
maintained the seal on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s banking practices
while ordering the public disclosure of some names in lawsuits
seeking to claw back profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 suits
seeking $100 billion for the conman&#8217;s investors, said last month
there was no &#8220;compelling reason&#8221; why names of key people in
his complaints should be blanked out. The unsealing was
requested by the New York Times Co., WNBC-TV, NBC News and CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The public has a qualified First Amendment right to
access certain judicial documents,&#8221; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland said in a written order filed in Manhattan today,
citing previous cases. At the same time, bankruptcy law protects
trade secrets and confidential research, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, sued for $6.4 billion by Picard, had asked the
judge to guard the confidentiality of information about the New
York-based bank&#8217;s so-called know-your-customer program and anti-
money laundering procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ordering some names unsealed in some lawsuits, Lifland
said &#8220;the defendants have not adequately established any harm
beyond merely &#8216;embarrassing or prejudicial&#8217; association with
these Ponzi scheme proceedings, which is not sufficient for
sealing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-
ap-4932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators notified a former
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executive whose unit packaged mortgage-
linked investments that he may be sued for his role in selling
the securities as the housing crisis worsened in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Llodra, who was global head of structured-product
collateralized debt obligations when he left JPMorgan, received
a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Jan. 4 saying investigators planned to pursue civil claims
against him related to the sale of a 2007 product, according to
Llodra&#8217;s broker registration filings. The SEC also gave a Wells
notice on Jan. 14 to Edward Steffelin, a former executive at a
firm that helped manage JPMorgan&#8217;s 2007 &#8220;Squared&#8221; CDO, his
brokerage records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has been probing whether JPMorgan, the second
biggest U.S. bank by assets, and Steffelin&#8217;s former firm, GSC
Group, misled investors about hedge-fund Magnetar Capital LLC&#8217;s
possible role in selecting underlying assets in the $1.1 billion
Squared deal, according to a person briefed on the matter who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar has said it bought the junior-most slice of the
Squared CDO as part of its strategy of investing in some
mortgage-linked securities while betting against other housing
debt, sometimes including bonds from the same deals. CDOs
package assets such as mortgage bonds and buyout loans into new
securities with varying risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) won a U.S. panel&#8217;s
backing to expand marketing of a cancer drug for patients with
the rare type of pancreatic tumor diagnosed in Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
Steve Jobs in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine, Sutent, works sufficiently to outweigh
potential risks, outside advisers to the Food and Drug
Administration said today in an 8-2 vote in White Oak, Maryland.
The panel concluded earlier today that Swiss drugmaker Novartis
AG (NVS)&#8217;s Afinitor is effective for the same illness. The FDA usually
follows its advisory committees&#8217; recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, and Novartis want to sell their
kidney-cancer drugs for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that
strike about 2,500 people a year in the U.S., according to the
University of Southern California Center for Pancreatic and
Biliary Diseases in Los Angeles. Both medicines, which target
cancer at the molecular level, helped slow progression of the
disease in clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a benefit that we can&#8217;t really determine the
magnitude of,&#8221; panel member Ralph Freedman, a professor of
gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston, said after voting in favor of Pfizer&#8217;s
drug. &#8220;On the other hand, this is a rare disease and there is
an unmet need here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
first-quarter earnings estimate for Morgan Stanley by 60 percent
on expectation of lower interest rate, credit and currency
trading revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, had
its earnings estimate lowered to 32 cents from 80 cents,
analysts Daniel Harris and Richard Ramsden said today in a note.
Full-year estimates for 2011 and 2012 were cut to $2 per share
from $2.75 and $2.65 from $3.05, respectively. The average
first-quarter estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is
38 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from interest rate, credit and currency trading
will be $1 billion, down from the previous estimate of $1.7
billion, as charges from its hedging of exposure to monoline
insurers affect results by $400 million to $500 million,
according to the note. New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) will also
face a $300 million charge related to the narrowing of its
credit spreads, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking revenue will be $100 million lower than
previously estimated, according to the note. Merger and
acquisition advisory revenue will be down 14 percent from the
fourth quarter. Global wealth-management revenue of $3.3 billion
in the fourth quarter will be flat because of a decline in
client activity, Harris and Ramsden said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley fell 24 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $26.67 at
10:55 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas SA and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) pushed back their forecasts for the Bank of England to raise
interest rates after inflation unexpectedly slowed in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas economist Alan Clarke and JPMorgan economist
Malcolm Barr predict the central bank will raise the benchmark
rate to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent in August rather than in
May. They forecast a further quarter-point increase in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics today showed inflation unexpectedly slowed to 4
percent in March, and a survey by the British Retail Consortium
found that U.K. retail sales fell by a record last month. The
nine-member Monetary Policy Committee kept the key rate
unchanged last week as aiding the recovery took precedence over
an inflation rate that remains at twice its 2 percent target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inflation figure &#8220;is likely to represent one of the
final nails in the coffin for a rate hike at the May MPC
meeting,&#8221; Clarke said in an e-mailed today. &#8220;The most recent
indicators for first-quarter GDP data point to big downside
risks and the consumer looks very weak.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors pushed back bets for a quarter-point rate
increase to October, according to data compiled by Tullett

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
electronic payments network, plans to grow the number of point-
of-sale terminals in Kenya threefold over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenya, East Africa&#8217;s biggest economy, currently has 9,000
terminals and 22 partner banks, Gerald Hawkins, group general
manager for Africa, said today in an interview in Nairobi, the
capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terminals &#8220;should be increased by a factor of two or
three,&#8221; Hawkins said. &#8220;Traditionally, the banks start by
issuing their own cards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenya had 55,235 credit card transactions and 466,523
point-of-sale machines in October compared with 54,353
transactions and 443,633 units a month earlier, according to the
Central Bank of Kenya&#8217;s website. The value of credit card
transactions in October was 314 million shillings ($3.7 million)
compared with 323 million shillings the previous month,
according to the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB), one of Visa&#8217;s partners in Kenya, plans to
double its number of credit card customers over two years, James
Wainaina, director for personal banking, said today, without
providing further details. The lender, which began offering
credit card services in 2005, has recorded between 15 percent
and 20 percent growth of its credit card business year-on-year
for the last three years, Wainaina said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The intent is for us to bring on board our customers who
don&#8217;t have cards,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, NIC Bank is targeting growth of as much as 30
percent in its credit-card business, based on increased
customers and transactions, Wainaina said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
are due for a pullback, suggesting the two largest U.S. energy
companies may turn from leaders into a &#8220;soft patch&#8221; in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, said Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the stock with the highest market value in the
world, produced a &#8220;negative divergence,&#8221; failing to keep up
with the rally in oil prices and surpass February highs.
Chevron, the third-biggest U.S. company after Exxon and Apple
Inc., rose to highest level relative to its 30-week moving
average since July 2007, a sign that the stock may be poised to
drop, said Dan Wantrobski, the director of technical research at
Janney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;is in a vulnerable position,&#8221; Wantrobski said in
an interview from his office in Philadelphia. &#8220;If this comes in
and Exxon doesn&#8217;t recover, it could weigh on the SP 500.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy shares have performed the best among 10 industry
groups in the SP 500 this year as anti-government protests
erupted in the Middle East and northern Africa, pushing crude-
oil prices to a 30-month high. The SP 500 Energy index rallied
15 percent, compared with a 5.3 percent gain in the benchmark
gauge. Exxon and Chevron together have a 5.3 percent weighting
in the SP 500, so a pause by them would hold back any gains in
the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s advance since March 16 stalled at an intraday level
of $86.22 last week, short of exceeding its Feb. 23 intraday
high of $88.23. That marks a &#8220;lower high&#8221; that tends to signal
a downtrend, Wantrobski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron climbed to a closing level of $109.66 at
the end of last week, 21 percent above their average price over
the past 30 weeks, according to Janney and Bloomberg data. The
last time the stock posted a bigger gap -- July 13, 2007 -- the
shares fell 9.6 percent through Aug. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a sign of potential exhaustion,&#8221; Wantrobski said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to trap somebody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) may report weak revenue for the
first quarter after lending by the industry dropped in almost
every category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank loans and leases fell $87.4 billion to $6.97 trillion
from the end of 2010 through March 30, or 1.3 percent, according
to Federal Reserve data. Deposits at U.S. banks rose the same
percentage to $7.97 trillion, showing households and businesses
are still hoarding cash instead of borrowing, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While loan growth tends to be seasonally weak in the
first quarter, this quarter is tracking worse than seasonality
would suggest,&#8221; Barclays Capital Inc. analysts led by Jason Goldberg wrote in an April 8 report. &#8220;We fear companies have
been disappointed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors will get their first look at the quarter&#8217;s
results tomorrow when New York-based JPMorgan, ranked second by
assets in the U.S., is scheduled to report. The biggest lender,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, will report
April 15, followed next week by New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C)
and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), ranked third and
fourth by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits may have increased even with declining revenue as
lenders set aside fewer funds to cover loan losses and in some
cases released reserves they&#8217;ve already built up, said Matt
Burnell, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo. Cost reductions may
also help the bottom line in a smaller way, Burnell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Regulations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of loan demand is just one of the constraints on
revenue facing banks as new regulations limit proprietary
trading and fees on overdrafts and debit cards. Bank stocks
trailed this year&#8217;s 5.3 percent rise in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index, with the 24-company KBW Bank Index (BKX) little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While trading revenue was credited for bolstering last
year&#8217;s profit, lenders still depend on net interest income, the
money made on lending and securities investment. That accounted
for 46 percent of 2010 revenue at Bank of America and 53 percent
at Wells Fargo. The figure was 50 percent for JPMorgan and 63
percent for Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55,
may report adjusted net income rose 41 percent over the year-
earlier quarter to $4.68 billion, according to the median
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue probably
declined 9.5 percent to $25 billion, analysts estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, headed by CEO Brian T. Moynihan, 51, may
report a 2.8 percent decline in profit to $3.09 billion on a 19
percent decline in revenue to $26.5 billion, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts. The bank told investors in
January that net interest income would decline in the first
quarter from the last period of 2010, and then level off
&#8220;sometime in the second.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue may fall 20 percent at Citigroup, led by CEO Vikram Pandit, 54, and 1.3 percent at Wells Fargo, headed by John Stumpf, 57, according to Bloomberg&#8217;s survey. First-quarter
profit may rise 41 percent to $3.56 billion at Wells Fargo, and
decline 36 percent to $2.84 billion at Citigroup, according to
Bloomberg&#8217;s survey. Spokesmen for all four banks declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer  Co. analyst Chris Kotowski estimates that
banks in his coverage universe, which includes the four largest,
will say loans outstanding declined by about 1.5 percent,
according to a March 24 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak spots include U.S. consumers, who are cutting credit-
card use and slowing home purchases. Closed-end residential
mortgage loans fell 3.3 percent in the first quarter, while
credit-card and other revolving loans fell 1.2 percent,
according to the Fed. Consumer and residential home loans
account for about 54 percent of total defined bank lending, Fed
data shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial Lending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest banks are still constrained by weak
balance sheets or aren&#8217;t replacing loans with new ones when they
mature, CreditSights Inc. analysts led by David Hendler wrote in
an April 10 note. For example, JPMorgan may cut as much as $10
billion from its credit-card portfolio in the first quarter, and
said its residential real-estate book may decline as much as 15
percent per year, Hendler wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders may not get much help this time from investment-
banking and trading revenue, which analysts are predicting may
fall for the fourth straight year-over-year quarter.  Guy Moszkowski at Bank of America lowered first-quarter earnings
estimates last month at Citigroup and JPMorgan, as well as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, saying trading
revenue won&#8217;t rebound as much as he had expected from a weak
fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial Lending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area of strength may be commercial and industrial
loans, used by companies to purchase inventory or improve
technology and other capital-intensive parts of their business.
Total CI loans increased to $1.25 trillion in the week ended
March 30, the seventh week of increases in the last nine, Fed
data show. Wells Fargo&#8217;s average loan balance advanced 1 percent
in the first quarter, fueled by CI lending, Goldberg estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s likely to continue; the business sector is doing
well in general,&#8221; said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at
Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut, and a former
Fed economist. Demand isn&#8217;t stronger because the cash hoard held
by U.S. corporations &#8220;limits their appetite&#8221; for bank loans,
Stanley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonfinancial corporations based in the U.S. held $1.89
trillion in liquid assets, including cash, at the end of
December, according to the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That seems to be the one bright spot,&#8221; said Burnell at
Wells Fargo. For everything else, &#8220;you&#8217;re still looking for
negative loan growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued
by two co-founders of Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) who allege
the investment bank tricked them into selling company shares by
claiming the sale was needed to cover a margin loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sehat Sutardja, Marvell&#8217;s chief executive officer, and
Weili Dai, the company&#8217;s former chief operating officer, said
they were duped into selling shares in 2008 that are now worth
$141.5 million, according to a complaint filed yesterday in
state court in San Francisco. Goldman Sachs pressured them by
claiming a regulatory rule, which didn&#8217;t exist, required them to
sell their stock, according to the complaint. Goldman Sachs held
millions of shares of Marvell stock in 2008, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman forced its clients to unnecessarily liquidate
their holdings through forced margin calls, only to repurchase
these same shareholdings for accounts owned by Goldman and its
related hedge funds,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also forced a sale of Sutardja and Dai&#8217;s
shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), causing them to lose $166 million, they
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed under California&#8217;s unfair competition
and the state&#8217;s Consumers Legal Remedies Act, seeks compensatory
damages for the two stock sales and unspecified punitive
damages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
Standard  Poor&#8217;s adjusted the way they graded securities after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and at least six more banks
pressured them, according to a U.S. Senate report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s two largest bond-ranking companies, both based
in New York, made exceptions to rules when bankers asked for
better safety ratings on complex mortgage-backed securities, the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said yesterday.
When Moody&#8217;s and SP changed their assessments of hundreds of
those bonds in July 2007, it helped trigger the financial
crisis, the panel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ratings agencies weakened their standards as each
competed to provide the most favorable rating to win business
and greater market share,&#8221; according to the report. &#8220;The
result was a race to the bottom.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusions cap a two-year investigation into the
financial crisis during which senators questioned executives
about the failings of Wall Street banks, regulators and mortgage
companies. In a televised hearing last year, lawmakers compared
Goldman Sachs bankers to bookies and subcommittee Chairman Carl M. Levin grilled them about marketing securities. Levin&#8217;s
committee wants regulators to eliminate rules shielding Moody&#8217;s
and SP from being sued over flawed ratings and publish accuracy
rankings for the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Key Enablers&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin and Republican Senator Tom A. Coburn of Oklahoma held
four public hearings in 2010. The Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission also looked into the role of ratings companies,
calling them &#8220;key enablers of the financial meltdown&#8221; in its
January report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on mathematical models, Moody&#8217;s and SP awarded AAA
ratings to mortgage securities packaged during the five-year
housing boom, deeming them as safe as government bonds. About 90
percent of AAA securities backed by subprime mortgages from 2006
and 2007 were later downgraded to junk status, Levin&#8217;s committee
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such revisions forced banks, pension funds and insurance
companies to sell holdings, contributing to $2 trillion in
losses and asset-writedowns worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP Rejects Responsibility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower ratings &#8220;reflected the unprecedented deterioration
in credit quality, but were not a cause of it,&#8221; Catherine Mathis, an SP spokeswoman, said in an e-mail response to
Levin&#8217;s findings. &#8220;We regret that, like many others, we did not
foresee the speed and extent of the housing downturn, which was
the steepest decline since the Great Depression.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Adler, a Moody&#8217;s spokesman who hadn&#8217;t seen the
Levin report, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s gross revenue from rating the complex products
quadrupled to $260 million in 2006 from $61 million in 2002,
according to the congressional report. For SP, the number also
quadrupled to $265 million in 2006 from $64 million in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment bankers who complained about rating
methodologies, criteria, or decisions were often able to obtain
exceptions or other favorable treatment,&#8221; according to the
Levin report. The decisions appeared to be &#8220;concessions made to
prevent the loss of business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight Banks Cited &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee released e-mails showing UBS, Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., Citigroup Inc., Bear Stearns Cos.,
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Nomura
Holdings Inc. all pressured the ratings companies to loosen
standards for assessing certain securities or make exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS told SP that grading securities the bank was selling
more conservatively might shift business to Moody&#8217;s and
competitor Fitch Ratings, according to Levin&#8217;s findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another case, a Goldman Sachs banker objected to a
rating decision SP made on a collateralized-debt obligation
called Abacus 2006-12, according to an e-mail released by the
panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP director Chris Meyer at first &#8220;pushed back&#8221; then
&#8220;suggested an exception could be made if it were limited to the
CDO at hand,&#8221; the committee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, JPMorgan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s made concessions in 2007 when it rated a deal
called Lancer II for UBS and exceptions for three Bear Stearns
deals in 2006, according to the report. JPMorgan acquired Bear
Stearns in 2008 as the company teetered on the brink of
collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Miller of JPMorgan complained in 2007 that Moody&#8217;s
was planning to give a deal a lower rating than SP. &#8220;There&#8217;s
going to be a three notch difference when we print the deal if
it goes out as is,&#8221; Miller wrote in an e-mail to Moody&#8217;s Mark DiRienz. &#8220;I&#8217;m already having agita about the investor calls I&#8217;m
going to get.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiRienz replied that an analyst &#8220;is looking into some
adjustments to his methodology that should be a benefit to you
folks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment before seeing the report, as did UBS spokeswoman Kelly Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flawed Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, a Michigan Democrat, criticized the ratings
providers&#8217; business model of collecting fees from the companies
whose deal they rate, comparing the practice to &#8220;one of the
parties in court paying the judge&#8217;s salary.&#8221; Ray McDaniel,
Moody&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, told the panel
those potential conflicts are well-managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We, like many others, did not anticipate the
unprecedented confluence of forces that drove the unusually poor
performance of subprime mortgages in the past several years,&#8221;
McDaniel said in prepared testimony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) designed,
marketed and sold collateralized debt obligations that misled
investors and created conflicts of interest as the company built
short positions before the U.S. housing market collapsed, a
Senate panel said in its report on the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of one CDO, Hudson Mezzanine, Goldman Sachs
told investors its interests were aligned with theirs while the
firm held 100 percent of the short side, according to the report
released today by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
leads the panel, urged regulators to review all of the
structured finance transactions described in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a briefing today, Levin said he believed Goldman Sachs
executives weren&#8217;t truthful about the company&#8217;s transactions in
testimony before the subcommittee at an April 2010 hearing. He
said he would refer the testimony to the Justice Department for
possible perjury charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my judgment, Goldman clearly misled their clients and
they misled the Congress,&#8221; Levin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With today&#8217;s release, the Senate panel completes a two-year
investigation of mortgage firms, federal regulators and Wall
Street banks highlighted by the expletive-laden interrogation of
Goldman Sachs executives including Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein a year ago this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our investigation found a financial snake pit rife with
greed, conflicts of interest, and wrongdoing,&#8221; Levin told
reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Hearings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin and Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the panel&#8217;s top
Republican, held four public hearings on the financial crisis
last year, examining regulatory failures, the collapse of
Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), the role of credit-rating firms in
fueling bets on high-risk debt and the business practices of
Goldman Sachs and rival investment banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report comes less than a year after Goldman Sachs paid
$550 million to resolve Securities and Exchange Commission
claims that it misled investors in a collateralized debt
obligation and its executives were called to testify before two
congressional panels and a commission formed to investigate the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. A committee
of Goldman Sachs employees led by E. Gerald Corrigan and J.
Michael Evans released 39 recommendations on Jan. 11 for the
company to reform its business practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate report also faults Deutsche Bank AG (DB), saying the
Frankfurt-based company created a $1.1 billion CDO with assets
that its traders referred to as &#8220;crap&#8221; and then attempted to
sell &#8220;before the market falls off a cliff.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Record earnings from JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) failed to improve its creditworthiness in the eyes of
swaps traders, as reduced provisions for bad mortgages accounted
for almost half of its profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, which investors use to hedge against losses or to
speculate on creditworthiness, climbed 0.2 basis point to 71.7
basis points, according to CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits rose 67 percent to $5.56 billion, the New York-
based company said today in a statement. The results beat the
average per-share estimate for adjusted earnings of $1.15 by 26
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Provisions for credit losses
dropped 83 percent to $1.17 billion as defaults and late
payments declined, allowing the bank to release money that had
been reserved for bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the reasons they did very well is they released a
lot of reserves,&#8221; said Jason Brady, a managing director at
Thornburg Investment Management Inc. in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
The firm oversees $73 billion of assets, including stocks and
bonds from both companies. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re making
tons of money, it just means they&#8217;re not losing it,&#8221; Brady
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts protecting the debt of Bank of America Corp., the
largest U.S. lender, climbed 0.5 basis point to 129.8 and those
on Morgan Stanley increased 0.5 basis point to 137, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on Citigroup Inc. added 0.1 basis point to 119.4 and
contracts on debt issued by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gained 1.1
basis points to 111.3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fewer Risks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
posted a record $17.4 billion in earnings last year, in part by
releasing about $7 billion of reserves against bad loans back
into income as the U.S. economy improved. Dimon, 55, has said he
doesn&#8217;t consider reserve releases as &#8220;quality&#8221; earnings
because they don&#8217;t represent growth in the bank&#8217;s businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank may also settle an investigation by federal
regulators into its foreclosure practices as early as today,
executives said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting U.S. corporate bonds from default
was little changed from the highest level this month after a
report that U.S. retail sales increased in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 0.1 basis point to a
mid-price of 95.1 basis points as of 5:04 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at U.S. retailers rose in March for a ninth
consecutive month, easing concern that the jump in food and fuel
costs would cause consumers to retrench. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchases increased 0.4 percent following a 1.1 percent
February gain that was larger than previously estimated,
Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, is at the
highest level since March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of Markit&#8217;s CDX North America High Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence deteriorates, declined 0.2
percentage point to 102.2 percent of face value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) gained share in the
U.S. online-search market last month, according to ComScore
Inc. (SCOR), a sign that it may be benefiting from changes aimed at
weeding out results that are of little value to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, reversing two months of declines, had 65.7
percent of searches in March, an increase from 65.4 percent in
February, said Reston, Virginia-based ComScore. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
also gained share, while Yahoo! Inc.&#8217;s portion shrank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google aims to improve the relevance of results while
facing scrutiny from regulators who are exploring whether the
company uses its lead in search to thwart rivals. The U.S.
Federal Trade Commission is weighing a broad antitrust
investigation, people familiar with the matter said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine had 13.9 percent of searches
in March, up from 13.6 percent a month earlier, its eighth
consecutive monthly gain. Yahoo&#8217;s share slipped to 15.7 percent,
from 16.1 percent, after being unchanged the previous month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google in February altered the way it carries out Web
searches to feature more &#8220;high-quality&#8221; sites, affecting 12
percent of queries. It was responding to complaints that
spammers and websites game its system to receive prominent
placement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Search &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another tweak aimed at making its search tool more
appealing, Google last month announced features to make the
query results and related advertising more social, letting users
tell their friends whether they like a particular result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, gained $5.67,
or 1 percent, to $576.28 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The shares have declined 3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott have begun investigations into whether Google is skewing
its search results to favor its own businesses over competitors&#8217;
websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat who heads a
Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, has said he will examine
Google&#8217;s business practices, and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, the
panel&#8217;s senior Republican, has called for hearings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Google&#8217;s $700 million purchase of ITA
Software Inc. was approved by the U.S. Justice Department after
an eight-month review, on the condition it makes travel data
available to search-engine rivals and creates an appeals process
to handle complaints that it&#8217;s acting unfairly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said profit rose 67 percent to a
second straight record as provisions for bad mortgages and
credit-card loans tumbled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income climbed to $5.56 billion, or $1.28
a share, from $3.33 billion, or 74 cents, in the same period a
year earlier and from $4.83 billion, or $1.12, in the fourth
quarter, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
The results beat the average per-share estimate for adjusted
earnings of $1.15 by 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve releases, money the bank decides it no longer needs
to hold against future losses, accounted for $2.55 billion, or
almost half, of the profit. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
55, has said he doesn&#8217;t consider reserve releases as &#8220;quality&#8221;
earnings because they don&#8217;t represent growth in the bank&#8217;s
businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I thought it was a good quarter, but it&#8217;s just not a
quarter that&#8217;s going to get people excited,&#8221; said Paul Miller,
a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;It
was very noisy,&#8221; he said, referring to the earnings attributable
to the reserve releases, which accounted for more than 40 cents
of the per-share profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan fell 47 cents, or 1 percent, to $46.17
at 2:53 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock was up 10 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 29 cents of the per-share earnings were from the
bank&#8217;s $2 billion draw on credit-card reserves. JPMorgan may
record one more &#8220;strong quarter&#8221; of reserve releases from its
credit-card division before they taper off in the third quarter,
said Shannon Stemm, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in St.
Louis who rates the stock &#8220;buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisions for credit losses dropped 83 percent to $1.17
billion as defaults and late payments declined. JPMorgan posted
a record $17.4 billion in earnings last year in part by
releasing about $7 billion of reserves against bad loans back
into income as the U.S. economy improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 43 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s net income in the first
quarter came from its investment bank, where earnings fell 4
percent to $2.37 billion. Those results were up from $1.5
billion in the fourth quarter as the bank took advantage of
volatility in the market caused by the European debt crisis and
turmoil in the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed Income &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter revenue fell 8 percent to $25.8 billion.
Fixed-income and equity markets revenue was $6.6 billion,
compared with $6.9 billion a year earlier and $4 billion in the
fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retail bank posted a $208 million loss. Dimon said in
the statement that the business had &#8220;good underlying
performance&#8221; that was &#8220;more than offset by the extraordinarily
high losses we still are bearing on mortgage-related issues.
Unfortunately, these losses will continue for a while.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank took a $1.1 billion charge and may add as many as
3,000 employees to comply with a consent agreement with federal
bank regulators over JPMorgan&#8217;s foreclosure practices announced
today, Dimon and Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein told
reporters on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the expense was a one-time charge, &#8220;that&#8217;s an
asset that&#8217;s continually fair-valued, so we could see further
charges or gains from that line item in the future,&#8221; Stemm
said. &#8220;We absolutely could see further charges over the next
couple of quarters on mortgage issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest behind JPMorgan and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), may report first-quarter profit of $2.78
billion when it releases results on April 18, the survey of
analysts shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
may report a profit of $2.99 billion on April 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-day delinquency rates on credit cards dropped to
3.57 percent from 5.6 percent in the same quarter in 2010 and
4.1 percent in the fourth quarter. The rate of credit cards
charged off as bad debt also fell, to 7 percent from 11.8
percent the prior year and 7.9 percent in the previous quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s credit-card division, which lost money for all
of 2009, generated $1.34 billion in profit, or 24 percent of net
income for the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail Banking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss in retail banking, which includes home loans and
checking accounts, compared with $708 million of profit during
the fourth quarter and a $131 million loss a year earlier. The
division benefited from a $2.4 billion reduction in provisions
to $1.3 billion, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices, which stabilized early last year, have fallen
every month since the middle of 2010 and may slow reserve
releases, which are determined in part by economic forecasts,
said Jason Goldberg, a senior analyst with Barclays Capital in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The most important things should be moving in the right
direction, but you&#8217;re not yet firing on all cylinders,&#8221;
Goldberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan growth remains slow and net interest margins, which
measure the profitability of lending, continue to narrow at U.S.
banks. Bank loans and leases fell $87.4 billion to $6.97
trillion from the end of 2010 through March 30, or 1.3 percent,
according to Federal Reserve data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Interest Margin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other large banks, which have benefited from
record low costs of funding mortgages and other assets, face a
squeeze on net interest margins -- the difference between what
they pay to borrow money and what they get for loans and on
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net yield on interest-earning assets -- what the bank
collects on interest on loans and securities minus what it pays
out on deposits and other borrowings -- rose to 2.89 percent in
the first quarter, from 2.88 percent in the fourth quarter and
3.32 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In aggregate, it&#8217;s kind of lackluster,&#8221; said Moshe Orenbuch, a bank analyst for Credit Suisse Group AG in New York.
&#8220;Net interest is still declining. Mortgage-banking revenues are
going to be under pressure because volumes are under pressure
and spreads are under pressure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks rallied after their
steepest sell-off in five weeks as oil rebounded and a report

&lt;p&gt;The Micex snapped two days of losses, advancing 0.6 percent
to 1,809.83 at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The gauge tumbled
2.5 percent yesterday. OAO Novatek, Russia&#8217;s second-largest gas

the biggest lender, rose 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may settle an investigation into
the bank&#8217;s foreclosure practices by federal regulators as early
as today, executives said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank took a $1.1 billion charge and may add as many as
3,000 employees to comply with the consent agreement, Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein told reporters on a conference call today after the
bank reported a 67 percent increase in net income. The accord
involves the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the
Federal Reserve, the bankers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are going to issue some very significant changes,&#8221;
Braunstein said. The agreement will address &#8220;weaknesses with
our processes and controls&#8221; when the bank forecloses on overdue
homeowners and cover the New York-based company&#8217;s use of
affidavits, fees and documentation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.1 billion writedown on mortgage-servicing rights led
the retail-banking division to post its first loss in a year.
Revenue from mortgage fees and related income was negative $489
million, the first time the lender has had negative revenue in
that business since at least its merger with Bank One Corp. in
2004. The writedown represented about 8 percent of the $13.6
billion total carrying value of the bank&#8217;s MSRs at Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the agreement doesn&#8217;t include fines, Dimon said
regulators reserved the right to levy penalties in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of interested parties, it&#8217;s complex and
eventually there will be penalties and fines paid and other
changes made to things. So we just don&#8217;t know yet,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummings&#8217;s Request &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland,
sent a letter to the OCC, calling on the regulator to postpone
the consent agreement and brief Congress on its investigation
into foreclosure processes, the lawmaker said today in a
statement. The OCC agreed to brief Cummings on the
investigation, the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I remain deeply concerned with any proposed consent
orders that would allow mortgage servicers to continue
disregarding their legal and contractual obligations, and that
fail to rectify the damage that servicers have inflicted on
borrowers, investors, communities, and the U.S. economy,&#8221;
Cummings said in the letter dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the third-largest servicer in the U.S.,
trailing Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. Servicers
collect payments from borrowers and pass them on to mortgage
lenders or investors, less fees. They also keep records, manage
escrow accounts and contact delinquent debtors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under U.S. accounting rules in place since 1995, banks
should report the value of mortgage-servicing rights on a fair-
market basis, or roughly what they would bring in a sale. A bank
must record a loss whenever it sells MSRs for a price below
where they&#8217;re marked on the books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators, as part of a broad
probe of how Wall Street firms bundled mortgage-linked financial
products as the housing crisis worsened, notified a former
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executive he may be sued for his role in
selling the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Llodra, who was global head of structured-product
collateralized debt obligations when he left JPMorgan, received
a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Jan. 4 saying investigators planned to pursue civil claims
against him related to the sale of a 2007 product, according to
Llodra&#8217;s broker registration filings. The SEC also gave a Wells
notice on Jan. 14 to Edward Steffelin, a former executive at a
firm that helped manage JPMorgan&#8217;s 2007 &#8220;Squared&#8221; CDO, his
brokerage records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has been probing whether JPMorgan, the second
biggest U.S. bank by assets, and Steffelin&#8217;s former firm, GSC
Group, misled investors about hedge-fund Magnetar Capital LLC&#8217;s
possible role in selecting underlying assets in the $1.1 billion
Squared deal, according to a person briefed on the matter who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar has said it bought the junior-most slice of the
Squared CDO as part of its strategy of investing in some
mortgage-linked securities while betting against other housing
debt, sometimes including bonds from the same deals. CDOs
package assets such as mortgage bonds and buyout loans into new
securities with varying risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llodra, who joined JPMorgan in 2006, began working at
Harvard Management Co. in 2008 and then went to Sunrise
Securities Corp. through last November, his records at the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show. He has since left
Sunrise, a woman who answered the phone there today said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steffelin, 41, is now director of institutional sales and
research at Walton International Group, which acquires and
manages land in North America, according to his profile at the
Linkedin business-networking website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Investigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti declined to comment.
Llodra and Steffelin declined to comment, as did Steven Lipin, a
spokesman for Magnetar, and SEC spokesman John Nester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s investigation has focused on the role of each of
the three firms involved in the transaction, a person familiar
with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity because
the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squared was sold in April 2007, with GSC Group serving as
the CDO&#8217;s manager and JPMorgan underwriting the deal, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its collateral consisted partly
of other CDOs tied to bonds backed by assets such as mortgages,
with the initial holdings including credit-default swaps
referencing $968 million of those CDOs, according to an offering
document. CDOs backed by other CDOs were commonly referred to as
&#8220;CDOs squared.&#8221; Squared went into default the following
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe is part of the SEC&#8217;s wider investigation of how
banks packaged and sold mortgage-linked investments as the
housing market unraveled in 2007. The agency has targeted firms
at various stages of that process, ranging from loan originators
such as Countrywide Financial Corp., to underwriters including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which agreed to pay $550 million last
year to resolve claims it misled investors in a subprime-linked
CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evanston, Illinois-based Magnetar told investors in an
April 2010 letter that it didn&#8217;t help banks create CDOs that
were &#8220;built to fail&#8221; on a bet that homeowners with bad credit
would default on their loans. The firm offered limited input on
the creation of CDOs, and made bets that would pay off if they
soured as part of a &#8220;market neutral&#8221; portfolio designed to
profit no matter what happened, Magnetar said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar said in its letter that it didn&#8217;t select specific
securities to be included in its CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar was started in late 2005 by Alec Litowitz, who
previously worked at Ken Griffin&#8217;s Citadel Investment Group LLC.
He specialized in trading the stocks of merging companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSC Bankruptcy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSC, based in Florham Park, New Jersey, filed for
bankruptcy last year, blaming losses in its funds caused by the
credit crisis and an &#8220;extremely unfavorable global business
environment.&#8221; The investment firm, founded by former Goldman
Sachs partner Alfred Eckert III, managed $28 billion at its
peak, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Diamond Capital Management LLC won a bankruptcy
auction for its assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSC, which entered into the business of managing CDOs tied
to asset-backed securities in 2006, ran $8.1 billion of them by
the time the market collapsed the next year, according to a
Standard  Poor&#8217;s report at the time. The company ranked as the
No. 17 manager of such CDOs, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s name surfaced last year in e-mails released by a
U.S. Senate panel investigating the financial crisis. Goldman
Sachs employee Fabrice Tourre, who helped arrange the CDO that
would later force Goldman Sachs to pay the record fine, wrote in
a January 2007 e-mail that GSC Group had turned down a request
that it serve as collateral manager for that deal, which hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped select assets for and bet against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GSC had declined given their negative views on most of
the credits that Paulson had selected,&#8221; Tourre wrote, after
discussing the Abacus CDO again with Steffelin that day,
according to the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who has denied wrongdoing, is litigating the SEC&#8217;s
case against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate panel, the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, held a series of hearings about the financial
crisis last year, including a full day questioning Goldman Sachs
executives about the company&#8217;s business practices. It is
scheduled to release its findings today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) missed out
on arranging Glencore International AG&#8217;s initial public
offering, which may be the world&#8217;s largest this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Morgan Stanley (MS)
will manage the IPO in London and Hong Kong, which may raise as
much as $11 billion. All nine banks together will earn as much
as $250 million in fees, excluding the so-called incentive fees,
according to New York-based consulting firm Freeman  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs missed out because it doesn&#8217;t
have a long-term relationship with the commodities trader, said
a person with knowledge of the situation, who declined to be
identified because the details are private. Goldman didn&#8217;t
manage the 10 largest Glencore mergers and acquisitions, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way to contribute to a deal like this&#8221; is to develop
relationships with clients over many years, said Scott Moeller,
a professor at Cass Business School in London and a former
investment banker. &#8220;Everyone has known for a long time that
Glencore will go public. You have to make sure you are on board
with them and you need to be connected and make the effort over
the long term and not just on your reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) misled
clients and Congress about the firm&#8217;s bets on securities tied to
the housing market, the chairman of the U.S. Senate panel that
investigated the causes of the financial crisis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, releasing the findings of a two-year
inquiry yesterday, said he wants the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to examine whether Goldman
Sachs violated the law by misleading clients who bought the
complex securities known as collateralized debt obligations
without knowing the firm would benefit if they fell in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Democrat also said federal prosecutors should
review whether to bring perjury charges against Goldman Sachs
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and other current and
former employees who testified in Congress last year. Levin said
they denied under oath that Goldman Sachs took a financial
position against the mortgage market solely for its own profit,
statements the senator said were untrue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my judgment, Goldman clearly misled their clients and
they misled the Congress,&#8221; Levin said at a press briefing
yesterday where he and Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma
Republican, discussed the 640-page report from the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating con man
Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s former investment firm filed a revised
complaint that disclosed new details of his $6.4 billion lawsuit
against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document, a new version of the complaint filed by
trustee Irving Picard on Dec. 2 in Manhattan, adds information
redacted from the original, including the names of almost two
dozen JPMorgan Chase employees and Madoff investors Norman Levy
and Carl Shapiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s filing follows a ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland on April 12 ordering that the names be made
public. Lifland allowed other information to remain private to
protect trade secrets and confidential research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For whatever it&#8217;s worth, I am sitting at lunch with Matt Zames who just told me that there is a well-known cloud over the
head of Madoff and that his returns are speculated to be part of
a Ponzi scheme,&#8221; John Hogan, the bank&#8217;s chief risk officer,
according to Picard, is quoted as saying on June 15, 2007, a
year and a half before Madoff was arrested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames is head of interest rate trading, global foreign
exchange, public finance, global mortgages and global fixed
income for JPMorgan Chase, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unsealing was requested by the New York Times Co.,
WNBC-TV, NBC News and CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Employees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint names 23 current and former JPMorgan
employees in connection with allegations the bank should have
known about the Madoff fraud. They include, in addition to Hogan
and Zames, Carlos Hernandez, head of global equities, Brian Sankey, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s chief credit officer, and Michael Cembalest, chief investment officer at J.P. Morgan Global Wealth
Management, according to Picard. No individuals are named as
defendants in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan complied fully with all applicable laws and
regulations in the banking services we provided to Madoff&#8217;s
firm,&#8221; said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank.
&#8220;Madoff&#8217;s assertion that his account activity should have
alerted us to his fraud is baseless and ignores his repeated and
concerted efforts to conceal his fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelisti said JPMorgan Chase employees weren&#8217;t aware of
the fraud and the bank is confident it has good defenses to
Picard&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrogate Father &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Bloomberg News identified Levy, a New York
real estate broker described as a &#8220;surrogate father&#8221; to
Madoff, as &#8220;Customer 1,&#8221; as he was called in the original
complaint. According to Picard, Levy transferred more than $83
billion in and out of Madoff&#8217;s main JPMorgan Chase account from
1998 to 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard also identified allegedly irregular transactions by
Madoff friend and investor Carl Shapiro, which Picard claims
should have served as &#8220;red flags&#8221; alerting JPMorgan Chase to
the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard is suing 1,000 banks, individuals, feeder funds and
others he claims profited from Madoff&#8217;s fraud. So far he&#8217;s
recovered about $10 billion for Madoff creditors. In the
complaint he claimed JPMorgan Chase turned a blind eye, even
though there were numerous indications that he was carrying on a
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeder Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint, Picard claims Hogan told the story about
his conversation with Zames when JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Hedge Fund
Underwriting Committee met to consider a proposal to invest
additional money in Madoff feeder funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, after Madoff&#8217;s arrest in December 2008, Sankey
referred to the agenda for the June 2007 Hedge Fund Underwriting
Committee meeting, saying: &#8220;Perhaps best this never sees the
light of day again!!&#8221; Picard claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year sentence in a North
Carolina federal prison after admitting he directed the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. Madoff was arrested and his firm, New
York-based Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, forced
into bankruptcy when news of the fraud became public in December
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of his arrest, Madoff&#8217;s account statements
reflected 4,900 accounts with $65 billion in nonexistent
balances. Investors lost about $20 billion in principal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-ap-
4932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department and
regulators will have to determine whether employees and
executives of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) violated any laws when
they traded securities tied to the housing market and testified
to Congress about the transactions, Senator Carl Levin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Democrat, who released the findings of a two-
year inquiry into the 2008 financial crisis yesterday, said
today in an interview with Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Street
Smart with Carol Massar and Matt Miller&#8221; that he wanted to send
the report to federal prosecutors and the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Lawmakers don&#8217;t have the authority to
declare whether the activities were illegal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That is not for Congress to determine whether or not a
crime was committed or whether or not he violated the security
laws,&#8221; Levin said, referring to Goldman Sachs Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein. &#8220;That is for the Justice Department
and that is for the SEC to make those determinations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, who is chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, said he also wants to forward all of the
testimony that Goldman Sachs executives gave before his panel so
the Justice Department can determine whether any statements
constitute perjury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to make the determination as to whether
or not he committed perjury,&#8221; Levin said, after explaining that
he thought Blankfein &#8220;attempted to mislead the Congress and I
believe they did mislead their clients in very significant
ways.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Truthful and Accurate&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Goldman Sachs denied that it had misled
anyone about its activities. &#8220;The testimony we gave was
truthful and accurate and this is confirmed by the
subcommittee&#8217;s own report,&#8221; Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin doesn&#8217;t have the power on his own to formally refer
the report&#8217;s allegations to federal authorities. The
subcommittee has a process for making such referrals that
requires Levin to obtain the support of the senior Republican on
the panel, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin is going to recommend that the subcommittee make
formal referrals, though he has not done it yet, staff members
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coburn Statement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coburn issued a statement today saying committee members
have yet to decide whether to make formal referrals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been a lot of speculation about the nature of
any possible referrals that may result from our financial crisis
investigation,&#8221; Coburn said. &#8220;At this point, no final
decisions have been made regarding this issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 640-page report issued yesterday by the subcommittee
found that Goldman Sachs peddled mortgage-related securities to
its clients while failing to disclose that the firm had bet that
those instruments would lose value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also said the firm acted against its clients&#8217;
interests by attempting to profit more generally from the
housing-market decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a subcommittee hearing last year, Blankfein
testified that Goldman Sachs never bet against its clients for
its own profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan report also examined the role of credit-
rating firms in the meltdown, lax oversight by Washington
regulators and the drop in lending standards that fueled the
mortgage bubble and ultimately caused hundreds of bank failures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect debt issued by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) jumped to the highest level in almost a
month after the chairman of the Senate panel that investigated
the financial crisis said the bank misled clients and Congress
about investments in securities tied to mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the U.S. bank that makes the most
revenue from trading climbed 4.2 basis points to 115.5 basis
points, according to data provider CMA. That&#8217;s the highest level
since 118.1 basis points on March 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin said he wants the Justice Department and
the Securities and Exchange Commission to examine whether
Goldman Sachs violated the law by misleading clients who bought
collateralized debt obligations without knowing the firm was
betting they would fall in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my judgment, Goldman clearly misled their clients and
they misled the Congress,&#8221; Levin said at a media briefing
yesterday where he and Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma
Republican, discussed a 640-page report from the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the New York-based bank denied that it had
misled anyone about its activities. &#8220;The testimony we gave was
truthful and accurate and this is confirmed by the
subcommittee&#8217;s own report,&#8221; Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on other major U.S. banks also rose,
with contracts on Morgan Stanley adding 3.6 basis points to
140.6 and those on JPMorgan Chase  Co. climbing 2.8 basis
points to 74.5, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Citigroup Inc. increased 1.5 basis points to
120.9, and those on Wells Fargo  Co. added 1.2 basis points to
79.4. Default swaps on Bank of America Corp. climbed 2.7 basis
points to 132.5, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default in the
U.S. fell for the first time in four days as the House approved
a spending bill to avert a government shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, declined 0.4 basis point to a
mid-price of 94.6 basis points as of 4:56 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. It&#8217;s risen
from 93.6 at the end of last week. Credit swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s U.K.
unit was sued by an executive search firm in London that said it
wasn&#8217;t paid after recruiting a banker from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) in
Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cazar Search Ltd., which says it specializes in hiring
investment bankers across Europe, introduced Mirek Urbanski at
Deutsche Bank in Warsaw to Goldman Sachs. When he was later
hired, the search firm didn&#8217;t receive a fee and was told it
wasn&#8217;t entitled to one, according to the lawsuit filed in
February in London which became public this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cazar had an agreement with Goldman to recruit candidates
in exchange for a fee of 30 percent of their compensation, as
much as 100,000 pounds ($163,000) for revenue-generating
divisions, and 125,000 pounds for investment banking and non-
revenue-generating divisions, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although the claimant does not know Mr. Urbanski&#8217;s
compensation, it is likely that it is sufficiently high that the
fee will be 100,000 pounds,&#8221; Cazar said in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment. Urbanski
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar case, settled confidentially last year,
executive-search firm Hogarth Davies Lloyd sued Nomura Holdings
Inc. over fees for recruiting Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)
bankers after it collapsed in late 2008. In that case, the firm
sought as much as 35.1 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Key Players&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cazar was instructed in August 2009 by Halil Emecen and
Leon Ceder, of Goldman&#8217;s fixed income, currency and commodities
division to identify &#8220;key players&#8221; in Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia, &#8220;particularly at Deutsche Bank,&#8221;
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm says it was told by Goldman after Urbanski met
with Ceder that the interview process was put on hold. It later
found out that Urbanski was hired by Goldman in July last year
in its securities department to expand operations in Eastern
Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross Nolan of Cazar Search said in the suit he was told
they weren&#8217;t entitled to a fee. They had previously placed four
employees with the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cazar Search Ltd. v. Goldman Sachs
International, case no. 11-535, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s
Bench Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-FrontPoint Partners LLC
portfolio manager Chip Skowron joined those accused in a U.S.
crackdown on insider trading of hedge funds when he was charged
with conspiracy, securities fraud and obstruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skowron, 41, of Greenwich, Connecticut, surrendered
yesterday to agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#8217;s New
York office, said James Margolin, an FBI spokesman. Information
Skowron obtained from an insider about hepatitis C drug trials
enabled FrontPoint to avoid more than $30 million in losses,
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skowron was linked to the case brought in November by U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission against Dr. Yves Benhamou, an expert in
hepatitis drugs and a former adviser for Human Genome Sciences
Inc., prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty April 11 to federal
charges and is cooperating with the U.S., prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is also an example of insider trading gone
global,&#8221; Bharara said at a news conference yesterday. &#8220;The
alleged trail of cash and trade of information took the
defendants from Manhattan to Milan and from Boston to
Barcelona,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When Dr. Skowron needed information, Dr.
Benhamou was always on call, helping Skowron and his hedge fund
illegally benefit to the tune of $30 million.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benhamou acted as a paid consultant to hedge funds while
also working as an adviser to HGSI and serving on its steering
committee for trials of Albuferon, a hepatitis treatment, the
U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skowron appeared briefly yesterday before U.S. Magistrate
Judge Ronald Ellis, who agreed to release him on $6 million bond
secured by his Connecticut home and the signatures of three
financially responsible people. He declined to speak to
reporters as he left the courthouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dr. Skowron intends to plead not guilty,&#8221; his lawyer
James Benjamin Jr. said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to
responding to the allegations more fully in court at the
appropriate time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC yesterday separately accused Skowron of insider
trading. Six hedge funds previously named as defendants in the
case agreed to settle and pay more than $33 million in
disgorgement and interest, without admitting or denying
wrongdoing, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FrontPoint, which manages several hedge funds, closed its
health-care funds last year because of the probe. It was
subsequently spun off from Morgan Stanley (MS) in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skowron, whose employment contract at FrontPoint was
terminated in December, was previously an analyst at hedge funds
Millennium Partners LLC in New York and SAC Capital Advisors LLC
in Stamford, Connecticut, according to FrontPoint&#8217;s marketing
documents dated September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FrontPoint yesterday said in an investor letter that it had
entered into a settlement with the SEC and that the payment
won&#8217;t have any financial impact on the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The alleged conduct of the former portfolio manager is
completely contrary to FrontPoint&#8217;s principles and represents a
clear violation of FrontPoint&#8217;s policy against insider
trading,&#8221; the hedge fund said yesterday in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment. Steve Bruce, a FrontPoint spokesman,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Skowron, 11-MAG-997, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Och-Ziff&#8217;s Fancy Sues Lawyers Over Failed Singapore Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zain Fancy, the former head of Och-Ziff Capital Management
Group LLC&#8217;s Asian real estate unit, sued the lawyer who acted
for him in several Singapore deals after the collapse of a home
purchase in the city state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancy, who has sued hedge fund manager Och-Ziff for unfair
dismissal, asked Singapore&#8217;s High Court to assess the damages
he&#8217;s owed by law firm Tan Peng Chin LLC and its head of real
estate Gwendoline Ong after his agreement to buy a bungalow for
S$18.5 million ($14.7 million) in June was terminated in August.
A closed hearing is scheduled for April 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore law firm has countersued to cap its liability
to the forfeited deposit of S$184,600, &#8220;reasonable&#8221; legal
costs and any difference to the property&#8217;s value in August. Ong
has also asked the court to remove her as a defendant in the
lawsuit, which was intended to embarrass her personally,
according to court papers. Fancy has indicated he&#8217;s seeking
damages including a S$10 million difference with the house&#8217;s
current valuation, according to Ong&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan Peng Chin, managing director of the law firm, declined
to comment, as did Alvin Yeo, who&#8217;s representing Fancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Tan Peng Chin LLC v Zain Asif Fancy OS68/2011
and Zain Asif Fancy v Tan Peng Chin LLC S117/2011 in the
Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Sues Travelport, Orbitz as Ticket Dispute Expands &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Airlines sued Travelport Ltd. to stop what it
called anticompetitive behavior and retaliation against the
carrier for a push to use its own technology to distribute fares
and schedules to travel agents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal action expands a dispute between AMR Corp. (AMR)&#8217;s
American and global distribution systems that historically have
compiled fare and schedule data from various airlines and
distributed them to travel agents. American wants to bypass
those companies, including units of Travelport and Sabre
Holdings Corp., and substitute its proprietary technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Travelport, Orbitz and other industry participants have
undertaken attacks against American that have been swift and
punitive,&#8221; said the lawsuit, which was filed April 12 in
federal court in Fort Worth, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit against Travelport and its Orbitz Worldwide
Inc. (OWW) affiliate seeks triple the airline&#8217;s actual damages as well
as punitive damages to be determined at trial. More than $2.7
billion in sales were booked through Travelport&#8217;s global
distribution systems in the past year, the lawsuit said.
American had $16.8 billion in passenger revenue in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American said on April 4 it reached a tentative agreement
with Expedia Inc. that would allow the online travel agency and
its Hotwire unit to immediately resume selling the airline&#8217;s
tickets, resolving a dispute that started in December. American
remains in talks with Sabre after the two earlier agreed to
freeze a lawsuit over the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Airlines Inc. vs Travelport Ltd,
Travelport LP and Orbitz Worldwide LLC, 4-11-cv-00244-Y,
Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaBarge Sued by Shareholder Over $340 Million Ducommun Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaBarge Inc. (LB), the electronics-manufacturing services
company being bought by aerospace component maker Ducommun Inc. (DCO),
was sued by a shareholder who contends the $340 million offer is
too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaBarge is worth more than the $19.25-a-share bid partly
because of the value of future contracts, Barry Borodkin said in
a Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed in Wilmington.
Borodkin said he owns 25,000 LaBarge shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price &#8220;fails to reflect the substantial value&#8221; of
anticipated work on United Technology Corp.&#8217;s Sikorsky Black
Hawk helicopter, Raytheon Co. (RTN)&#8217;s Tomahawk cruise missile and
Boeing Co. (BA)&#8217;s aerial-refueling tanker, Borodkin claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ducommun, based in Carson, California, said in a statement
April 4 it would acquire St. Louis-based LaBarge to add new
customers and markets. Ducommun reported sales of $408.4 million
last year, compared with LaBarge&#8217;s fiscal 2010 revenue of $289.3
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is LaBarge&#8217;s practice not to comment on pending
litigation,&#8221; said Colleen Clements, a company spokeswoman, in
an e-mailed message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Borodkin v. LaBarge, CA6368, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon&#8217;s Schutte Won&#8217;t Say Whether Funds Are Competitive &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard &#8220;Rick&#8221; Schutte, the former president of hedge-
fund company Galleon Group LLC, sparred with a prosecutor over
the nature of competition, pressure and investor expectations at
the insider-trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After testifying for two days in Manhattan federal court on
behalf of Rajaratnam, his ex-boss, Schutte, once Galleon&#8217;s head
of research, began fielding questions yesterday from Assistant
U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky, who asked him whether the hedge-fund
industry is competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to say whether it&#8217;s highly or lowly&#8221;
competitive, Schutte answered. He was also noncommittal when
Brodsky asked about the pressure to perform well at Galleon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean by pressure,&#8221; Schutte said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if Galleon investors would be content with an annual
profit of 20 percent, a combative Schutte said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak
to what investors would be happy with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, is the central figure in the largest
crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The Sri
Lankan-born money manager is accused of gaining $63.8 million
from tips leaked by corporate insiders and hedge fund traders.
He denies wrongdoing, saying he based his trades on research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross-examination followed two days of questioning by
defense lawyer Michael Starr, who had Schutte review analyst
reports, news accounts, internal firm e-mails and other
documents designed to show that Rajaratnam&#8217;s trades were based
on Galleon research, not inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During about 10 hours of direct testimony, Schutte sought
to support the defense case that Rajaratnam&#8217;s trades were
lawful. Prosecutors had claimed, for example, that Rajaratnam
possessed inside information that Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) would
acquire Starent Networks Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobacco Industry Owes Millions for Care, Hospitals Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobacco companies cost Missouri hospitals millions of
dollars to care for patients with smoking-related illnesses who
can&#8217;t pay their medical bills, a lawyer said in closing
arguments of a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of St. Louis, along with more than 40 area
hospitals, sued Altria Group Inc. (MO), R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
Lorillard Tobacco Co. and other cigarette makers, claiming they
manipulated the nicotine content in cigarettes and
misrepresented the health effects of smoking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tobacco companies &#8220;sell their defective products here
and they take their money back to North Carolina, Virginia or
wherever,&#8221; Kenneth Brostron, a lawyer for the hospitals, said
yesterday in St. Louis. &#8220;They are responsible for what they did
and it&#8217;s about time they take responsibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry&#8217;s actions boosted the amount spent on
&#8220;unreimbursed and uncompensated tobacco-related health care,&#8221;
the hospitals said in court papers. The tobacco companies deny
any responsibility for patient care costs at the hospitals or
any financial losses by the hospitals. The suit, which doesn&#8217;t
include patients as plaintiffs, went to trial in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Brostron wants to punish companies for making
perfectly legal cigarettes,&#8221; Andrew McGaan, lawyer for
Reynolds, told the jury yesterday. &#8220;Even after this lawsuit was
filed, some hospitals sold cigarettes in their gift shops.
Should they be penalized?&#8221; he asked, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for other defendants will give closing arguments
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is the third such health-care cost-recovery claim
to reach trial, according to regulatory filings by Altria. The
industry won the first, in Ohio, in 1999. The second initially
resulted in a $17.8 million award for a health insurer by a New
York jury in 2001. That was reversed on appeal in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is City of St. Louis v. American Tobacco Co., CV
982-09652-01, Circuit Court, City of St. Louis, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TCF Appeals Court&#8217;s Refusal to Stop Limits on Swipe Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF National Bank appealed a lower-court decision rejecting
its request to block forthcoming federal rules limiting the
amount of money the largest U.S. banks can collect for debit-
card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF, a unit of TCF Financial Corp. (TCB), sued Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and the Fed&#8217;s Board of Governors in
October, challenging the legislation included in last year&#8217;s
Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul bill. TCF claims the
rules, which aren&#8217;t final, are unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lawrence L. Piersol, in Sioux Falls,
South Dakota, on April 4 denied TCF&#8217;s request for a preliminary
injunction, while rejecting the defendants request to throw out
the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF filed its notice April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke, 10-cv-04149,
U.S. District Court, District of South Dakota (Sioux Falls). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirectBuy Accord Opposed by Attorneys General of 37 States &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirectBuy Holdings Inc.&#8217;s nationwide settlement of a class
action over its sales practices drew opposition from attorneys
general in 37 states, who said the agreement offers no real
benefit to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal settles a lawsuit brought by members in 2009
accusing the consumer club of marking up the supplier and
manufacturer&#8217;s prices they paid. DirectBuy agreed in December to
provide as much as $55 million in free memberships to class
members. The settlement&#8217;s value to consumers is vastly
overstated, Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said in
court papers filed April 12 in U.S. District Court in
Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed settlement is, in essence, a sales vehicle
for defendants designed to drive current and former customers
into membership renewal contracts,&#8221; Jepsen said in the filing
on behalf of 37 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico. &#8220;The proposed settlement cloaks the limited-time &#8216;free&#8217;
memberships and reduced-price membership extensions as having
value to absent class members.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirectBuy, based in Merrillville, Indiana, didn&#8217;t admit any
wrongdoing in the agreement, which was granted preliminary
approval in December by U.S. Magistrate Judge William Garfinkel.
The company is owned by Miami-based Trivest Partners LP, a
private equity firm which purchased it for an undisclosed amount
in November 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is fair, DirectBuy said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A settlement hearing is scheduled for May 10 before U.S.
District Judge Janet C. Hall, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey S. Nobel, an attorney for the plaintiffs and the
settlement class, didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Christopher Wilson v. DirectBuy Inc., 09-00590,
U.S. District Court District of Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks Must Pay Victims of Botched Foreclosures, Regulators Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 14 largest U.S. mortgage servicers must pay back
homeowners for losses from foreclosures or loans that were
mishandled in the wake of the housing collapse, according to a
consent decree released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement between the servicers and U.S. regulators
imposes more substantial penalties than early reports of the
deal indicated. It could also help the U.S. Justice Department
determine the size and scope of any future fines for the flawed
practices, regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC), agreed in the settlement to conduct a review of all loans
that went into foreclosure in 2009 and 2010. They also agreed to
improve their foreclosure, loan modification and refinancing
procedures by hiring staff, upgrading document-tracking systems,
assigning a single point of contact for each borrower and
policing lawyers and vendors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal
Reserve, Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. released the consent decrees in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators took action against the companies for &#8220;unsafe
and unsound&#8221; practices, said acting Comptroller of the Currency
John Walsh, who called the settlement &#8220;comprehensive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our enforcement actions are intended to fix what is
broken, identify and compensate borrowers who suffered financial
harm, and ensure a fair and orderly mortgage servicing process
going forward,&#8221; Walsh said in a written statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sanctions are the first to arise from state and federal
investigations into mortgage servicers&#8217; lapses in foreclosure
procedures. Unprepared for the record number of loan
delinquencies brought by subprime loans and the collapse of
housing prices, servicers relied on inexperienced workers who
failed to track paperwork or improperly signed legal documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks didn&#8217;t admit or deny regulators&#8217; findings,
according to the orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the consent decree, banks must hire outside
consultants to identify borrowers who improperly lost their
homes, failed to get loans rewritten or were forced into court
in 2009 and 2010 because of mistakes made by mortgage servicers
or their vendors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks must determine the financial injury to borrowers and,
within the next six months, submit a plan for reimbursing them,
according to the decrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C), the GMAC unit of Ally Financial Inc.,
Aurora Bank FSB, EverBank Financial Corp., HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
OneWest, MetLife Inc. (MET), PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC),
Sovereign Bank, SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), and US Bancorp also signed
consent agreements with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BGC, Tullett Settle U.K. Broker-Poaching Damages Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP) settled the damages portion of a lawsuit
filed by inter-dealer brokerage competitor Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR)
over BGC&#8217;s poaching of traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms settled at a hearing in London yesterday, one
month into a trial. Tullett lawyer Daniel Oudkerk told the judge
the agreement was confidential and terms wouldn&#8217;t be disclosed.
BGC lawyer Andrew Hochhauser said he had nothing to add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullett, based in London, sued BGC in 2009 claiming Anthony
Verrier, BGC&#8217;s executive managing director, spent tens of
millions of pounds to convince the heads of various Tullett
trading desks to breach their contracts by getting colleagues to
defect. A year ago Justice Raymond Jack ruled against New York-
based BGC and ordered a second trial on damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This could have been a very, very unpleasant action,&#8221;
Jack said at yesterday&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronnie Fox, and employment lawyer at Fox Lawyers in London,
said that while it was good the parties reached a settlement,
he&#8217;s disappointed not to know the figure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A great many lawyers and people in the financial services
sector have been watching this case,&#8221; said Fox, who isn&#8217;t
involved in the case. &#8220;The initial judgment against BGC was
extremely damning, so I&#8217;m sure a substantial figure is
involved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullett sought to recoup lost profits, legal fees, &#8220;wasted
management time,&#8221; the cost of steps &#8220;to safeguard its
interests&#8221; and the gardening-leave pay to 10 brokers who were
prevented from working while the lawsuit was going on, Oudkerk
said at a hearing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGC spokesman Richard Oldworth said he couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment. Tullett spokesman Nigel Szembel didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: Tullett Prebon Plc v. BGC Brokers LP,
HQ09X01241, High Court (London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Wins Dismissal of Ex-Deutsche Bank Executive&#8217;s Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. didn&#8217;t violate law or breach a
contract when it fired the Australian head of its corporate
derivatives marketing in 2008, after he objected to changes in
the job, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin Keays sued JPMorgan, claiming the bank lured him from
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) in 2005 and then deceived him and breached his
contract by limiting him to dealing only with JPMorgan clients.
He had sought more than A$6 million ($6.3 million) for his
expected pay to January 2018, when he would be 60 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second biggest U.S. bank by assets, had the
right, under its contract with Keays, to fire him by giving him
three months notice or pay in lieu of the notice, Australia
Federal Court Judge Robert Buchanan wrote in a 34-page ruling
released yesterday. The bank abided by the terms of the
contract, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Keays was under no obligation to accept the position
at JPM,&#8221; Buchanan wrote. &#8220;When he did so it was on the terms
which he had negotiated&#8221; and that included &#8220;dealing with the
possibility that his employment might come to an end,&#8221; the
judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keays declined to comment after yesterday&#8217;s verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Colin Keays v. J.P.Morgan Administrative

Australia (Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FDIC Settles Dispute Over Failed Bank Executive Documents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. settled a lawsuit filed
by a law firm representing former executives at four failed
banks, who said they need access to bank files and records to
defend against possible fraud claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal court in Atlanta dismissed April 12 McKenna Long
 Aldridge LLP&#8217;s lawsuit against the FDIC after both parties
requested the case be closed. McKenna Long sued in November
after the FDIC demanded the law firm return records it received
from its clients before the banks collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the FDIC understands it is reasonable for bank
officers and directors to have some access to documents,&#8221; said
David L. Balser of McKenna Long in Atlanta. He declined to say
in an interview how the suit was resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC has a pending complaint against Bryan Cave LLP,
alleging the St. Louis-based law firm broke federal privacy laws
and Kansas trade secret laws by acquiring bank files while
representing executives at Hillcrest Bank in Overland Park,
Kansas. A federal judge in Atlanta is considering whether to end
the case without a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC said the records sent to Bryan Cave&#8217;s Atlanta
office included customer information, as well as financial
statements, business plans, and &#8220;confidential information
relating to the FDIC&#8217;s regulatory activities,&#8221; according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKenna Long represents executives from four banks that
failed last year: Darby Bank  Trust Co. in Vidalia, Georgia;
McIntosh Commercial Bank in Carrollton, Georgia; Northwest Bank
 Trust in Acworth, Georgia; and K Bank in Randallstown,
Maryland. As part of that representation, the firm said it
received copies of board and committee minutes, commercial loan
files, and reports prepared by the bank executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balser said the FDIC has not filed any lawsuits against his
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKenna Long turned three boxes of materials over to the
court shortly after asking for a ruling that the firm must have
access to the materials. On Feb. 17, U.S. District Judge Richard
Story ordered the documents released to the FDIC. He ruled that
McKenna Long could access the documents in order to create an
index, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC spokesman David Barr declined to comment on the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are McKenna Long  Aldridge LLP v. FDIC, 10-
cv-3779, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia
(Atlanta) and FDIC v. Bryan Cave LLP, 10-cv-03666, Northern
District of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Ex-Employee Pleads Guilty to Making False Statements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former foreman at the Massey Energy Co. (MEE) coal mine in West
Virginia where 29 workers died in an explosion last year pleaded
guilty to a federal charge of making false statements to U.S.
agents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Harrah also pleaded guilty yesterday to a U.S.
charge that he misrepresented himself as a certified foreman,
qualified to conduct examinations of mining equipment. Harrah
failed the test required to be certified as a foreman and used a
false certification number to sign off on reports at the Upper
Big Branch mine, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I signed the fire boss book knowing I didn&#8217;t have a
certificate or nothing,&#8221; Harrah told U.S. District Judge Irene
Berger yesterday in Beckley, West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire boss inspects equipment before a shift and is
required to be certified under federal mining regulations. When
federal agents investigating the explosion &#8220;came to my house
and talked about this situation, I lied,&#8221; Harrah said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations against Harrah, filed March 22, resulted
from the continuing federal investigation into the causes of the
Upper Big Branch explosion, according to the Justice Department.
Harrah wasn&#8217;t employed by Massey at the time of the April 5,
2010, blast, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Mr. Harrah was caught having forged the
certification he left before we could terminate his employment,
which we intended to do,&#8221; Shane Harvey, Massey general counsel,
said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It appears that Mr. Harrah forged the certification
because he was unable to pass the test&#8221; required, Harvey said.
&#8220;We have no tolerance for such behavior and are thankful that
no one was hurt as a result of Mr. Harrah&#8217;s conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Berger set sentencing for Aug. 11. Harrah faces up to
10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, according to
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Harrah, 5:11-cr-00082, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of West Virginia (Beckley). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are turning to hedge
funds such as Caxton Associates LLC that don&#8217;t have restrictions
on withdrawals when making new commitments, according to a new
survey of fund clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund customers plan to allocate 90 percent of new
investments in 2011 to firms that agree not to tie up money for
more than one year, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
survey released today. Funds that rely on longer lockup periods
so they can buy illiquid assets such as distressed debt will
have a harder time attracting cash, said David Solomon, co-head
of capital introductions at the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have more choices of liquidity terms than they
did before the financial crisis,&#8221; Solomon said in an interview.
&#8220;Consequently, hedge funds with less liquid terms are pursuing
a diminishing pool of capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand for short lockups is a legacy of the 2008
financial crisis, when some hedge funds restricted withdrawals
to avoid having to sell assets at a loss. Investors pulled a
record $154.4 billion from hedge funds in 2008, according to
data from Hedge Fund Research Inc. of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caxton, a New York-based hedge fund with $11 billion in
assets, places no limits on how long clients must keep their
initial investment with the firm. It has also eliminated gates,
or restrictions on subsequent withdrawals, even though the firm
had never imposed such provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some hedge funds used gates during the financial crisis to
prevent investors from withdrawing money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity Preferred &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While clients want fewer barriers to pulling money, the
perception that hedge funds can provide better returns than
other investments means the industry will continue to grow, the
Goldman Sachs survey found. Pension funds, endowments and
sovereign wealth funds surveyed by the firm expect the
industry&#8217;s assets to increase 14 percent this year to almost
$2.1 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers who pursue the most liquid strategies, such as
those using computers to predict trends in futures prices and
funds that buy and sell stocks, will be among the most popular
this year, Goldman Sachs found. Investors plan to withdraw money
from fund categories including credit, multistrategy and
convertible arbitrage, the survey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds raised a record $34.9 billion in February,
according to estimates by BarclayHedge Ltd. Funds betting that
stocks will rise took in the biggest share at $8.5 billion,
followed by commodity trading advisers, which raised $7.5
billion, the Fairfield, Iowa-based research firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer Funds Selected &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are taking longer to scrutinize hedge funds and
making fewer allocations, said Marc Gilly, who runs the capital
introductions unit with Solomon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investors meet with more than 100 hedge-fund managers
each year. Only about three to five of those managers get money,
a process that can take as long as six months and requires about
four interviews, Goldman Sachs said. Investors made about 15
allocations a year before the hedge-fund industry had widespread
losses in 2008, Gilly said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bar is coming up very rapidly because of the
institutionalization of the process,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Investors
don&#8217;t have to invest and they want to wait as long as they
can.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds on average gained 9.8 percent last year and 2.2
percent this year through March, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Newedge Commodity Trading Advisor Index, which
tracks the category of futures funds that investors told Goldman
Sachs they plan to allocate money to this year, fell 1.2 percent
through March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the worst performing quarter for the Newedge index
since the final three months of 2009, as some CTA and managed
futures funds were hurt by a quick shift in currency markets
after the earthquake struck Japan in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, strategies that investors said they planned to
shun have risen in 2011. Credit-arbitrage funds rose 3.6 percent
on average in the first quarter and multistrategy funds
increased 2.9 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s survey, taken in January, gathered information from 545
investors managing more than $1.1 trillion of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 40 percent of investors said they would lock money up
with a hedge fund for longer than a year if the firm agreed to
lower its fees, with pension funds and endowments the most eager
to negotiate discounts. Hedge funds typically charge investors 2
percent of assets under management to cover costs and 20 percent
of any profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium for Lockup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lockup of three years doesn&#8217;t make economic sense unless
the hedge fund is producing returns that exceed less restrictive
investments by about 1.3 percentage points a year, according to
a 2009 study by Emanuel Derman, head of risk management at
Prisma Capital Partners. Investors should earn about 0.8
percentage point more a year for agreeing to a two-year lockup,
Derman&#8217;s research found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma is a fund of funds, which charges fees to pick
hedge-fund managers for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the underlying strategy invests in illiquid
investments, it makes a lot of sense to have a lockup,&#8221; Derman,
who&#8217;s also a professor at Columbia University in New York, said
in an interview. &#8220;What you want to avoid is instances in which
the manager has a long lockup for no apparent reason.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR), the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Treasury Department
Deputy Secretary Roger Altman, hired Raymond B. Strong III from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to build out its energy investment-
banking group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong, 41, was most recently a managing director in
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global natural resources group where he advised
Chevron Corp. on its $4.9 billion acquisition of Atlas Energy
Inc., New York-based Evercore said today in a statement. Strong
will focus on the oil sector as a senior managing director,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evercore added six senior managing directors in 2010,
bringing the total to 54, and expanded its headcount by 38
percent to 610 employees, according to a regulatory filing. The
firm advised ATT Inc. on its $39 billion acquisition of
T-Mobile USA Inc., the largest deal this year, and Lubrizol
Corp. on its sale to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. for about
$9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Evercore has a lot of momentum, and Ray adds to it,&#8217;&#8217;
Altman said in the statement. &#8220;We are committed to building a
market-leading energy banking practice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest

June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office will be responsible for operations in all East

Saharan Africa, it said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Kenya presents an opportunity for Visa to grow its
existing electronic payments business,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Visa also
sees an opportunity to broaden our existing range of products
and services as well as to address specific market needs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2.96 million Visa-branded cards in the Kenyan

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
released gases at its chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas,

&lt;p&gt;The flaring of benzene, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide
occurred at 3:40 p.m. local time yesterday, according to an
incident report on the National Response Center website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries and chemical plants must notify the

&lt;p&gt;Copper in London may drop for a
fourth day, the longest period of declines since January, on
concern that China may step up its credit-tightening measures to
cool asset prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
was little changed at $9,500 a metric ton at 2:31 p.m. Singapore
time, after falling as much as 0.6 percent earlier. The contract
dropped to $9,443 a ton yesterday, the lowest in a week. Zinc,
lead and tin gained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Higher prices hinge on China&#8217;s demand, which is unclear
at the moment,&#8221; said Yang Zhenqiang, an analyst at First
Futures Co. &#8220;We do see physical buyers emerge every time
there&#8217;s a decline, so that&#8217;s keeping the market supported.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July-delivery copper on the Comex in New York gained 0.4
percent to $4.3315 a pound. The metal for June-delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped for a third day, declining as
much as 1.8 percent to 70,880 yuan ($10,848) a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is likely to raise banks&#8217; reserve requirement ratios
in the &#8220;near future,&#8221; the China Securities Journal said in a
front-page commentary today. China has increased the ratio three
times this year as part of efforts to curb inflation. The
government is scheduled to release March inflation and first-
quarter economic growth data tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts&#8217; Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa, meeting in China, said rising commodities prices pose a
threat to global growth, according to a draft copy of the
communiqu&#233; given to Bloomberg News. Copper&#8217;s 30-day historical
volatility, a measure of how much the metal fluctuates, was at
26 percent today, the highest level since April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its year-end copper
forecast 11 percent on concern that weak Chinese demand and the
earthquake in Japan will delay an expected reduction in exchange
stockpiles. Copper may reach $9,800 a ton by the end of this
year, down from a previous forecast of $11,000, analysts Joshua
Crumb and Allison Nathan said in an April 12 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The global copper market will show a small deficit this
year, even if Chinese demand does not grow at all,&#8221; Bank of
America Merrill Lynch strategist Michael Widmer wrote in a
report yesterday. &#8220;Reduced copper offtake from China will,
however, have a knock-on impact on 2012: if the country&#8217;s demand
increases by less than 2.5 percent in 2011, there is scope for
an oversupplied market next year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc in London gained 0.8 percent to $2,440 a ton, lead
climbed 0.6 percent to $2,695 a ton, nickel increased 0.2
percent to $26,300 a ton and tin advanced 1.2 percent to $32,644
a ton. Aluminum was little changed at $2,664 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors said they were
prepared to summon Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President Gary Cohn
as a witness to rebut Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam&#8217;s defense in his insider-trading trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told U.S. District
Judge Richard Holwell in Manhattan on April 12 that the
government would call Cohn to testify if a defense witness,
former Galleon U.S. President Richard Schutte, was permitted to
tell jurors about comments Cohn made at a meeting with
Rajaratnam on July 31, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s hearsay&#8221; and shouldn&#8217;t be allowed as evidence,
Brodsky told the judge, according to a transcript of a
&#8220;sidebar&#8221; conference that jurors and others in the courtroom
couldn&#8217;t hear. If the defense witness testified about Cohn&#8217;s
comments, Brodsky said, &#8220;We are prepared to call Mr. Cohn, and
we would be allowed to do that as part of our rebuttal case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schutte, who completed his testimony yesterday, wasn&#8217;t
asked by Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers about Cohn&#8217;s comments at the
meeting. Rajaratnam&#8217;s attorneys may finish their defense of the
billionaire hedge fund manager on April 18. Brodsky told Holwell
yesterday that prosecutors intended to present a rebuttal case.
He didn&#8217;t mention Cohn or identify other potential witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a bit of a rebuttal case we&#8217;re still preparing,&#8221;
Brodsky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, Clearwire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, has been on trial since March 8 in the
largest crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
The Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of gaining
$63.8 million from tips leaked by corporate insiders and hedge-
fund traders about a dozen stocks, including Goldman Sachs,
Intel Corp. (INTC), Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) and Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) He
denies wrongdoing, saying he based his trades on research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summations in the case may begin next week, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregg Jarrell, the top economist for the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission from 1984 to 1987, testified today as an
expert witness for Rajaratnam. Jarrell, who now teaches at the
University of Rochester&#8217;s graduate school of business in New
York, said the tips Rajaratnam allegedly received weren&#8217;t
material to Galleon or didn&#8217;t comprise inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainty, Uncertainty &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarrell showed jurors charts displaying press articles and
analyst reports about the stocks Rajaratnam is accused of
trading based on inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Streeter, Jarrell testified that mergers and acquisitions are
almost always preceded by analysts and journalists speculating
on whether the deal will go through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streeter asked Jarrell if a trader with access to accurate
information from a corporate insider has an advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you have certainty, in a world of uncertainty, that&#8217;s
an advantage,&#8221; Jarrell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarrell&#8217;s testimony will continue April 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion about Cohn came on April 12 as prosecutors
objected to Schutte&#8217;s testimony about a meeting he and
Rajaratnam had with Cohn. At that July 31, 2008, meeting, the
Galleon and Goldman Sachs executives discussed the &#8220;potential&#8221;
that the New York-based investment bank would &#8220;combine with an
entity that had a large deposit base,&#8221; including a commercial
bank or insurance company, Schutte testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Tip &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense offered Schutte&#8217;s testimony to respond to the
government&#8217;s claim that Rajat Gupta, then a Goldman Sachs board
member, tipped Rajaratnam two days before that meeting that the
bank was considering buying American International Group Inc. (AIG) or
Wachovia Corp. Through Schutte&#8217;s testimony, the defense may have
been trying to show that the alleged tip from Gupta didn&#8217;t
involve confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brodsky objected, according to the transcript of the
sidebar conference with the judge, saying defense lawyers wanted
to elicit &#8220;a hearsay statement that Mr. Cohn made at the
meeting&#8221; about Goldman Sachs possibly making &#8220;a certain
plan.&#8221; Brodsky then said the government would summon Cohn on
rebuttal if there was such testimony, according to the
transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-Examination &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Schutte didn&#8217;t testify about Cohn&#8217;s comments at
the July 2008 meeting. Under cross-examination by Brodsky,
Schutte said he didn&#8217;t ask Cohn at the meeting whether Goldman
Sachs was planning to buy a bank imminently and that Cohn didn&#8217;t
address the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
testifying at the trial on March 23, said Gupta violated the
firm&#8217;s confidentiality policies by allegedly telling Rajaratnam
about its earnings and strategic plans. Rajaratnam is accused of
earning $4.6 million by trading on tips about the New York-based
investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta denies wrongdoing and hasn&#8217;t been criminally charged.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has brought an
administrative action against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groupon Inc. is close to retaining
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) as the lead
underwriters for a planned initial public offering later this
year, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, which haven&#8217;t yet been formally hired by
Groupon, would help handle an IPO that&#8217;s likely to take place
before October, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the talks were private. Groupon has discussed terms that
would value the company between $15 billion and $25 billion, two
people familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupon, the top provider of online daily discounts, has
drawn growing interest from Wall Street since December, when it
decided to consider an IPO instead of accepting a $6 billion
takeover bid from Google Inc. (GOOG) The company has been holding
discussions with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other banks
since January, including a meeting with Goldman Sachs Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein at Groupon&#8217;s Chicago
headquarters, a person familiar said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Mossler, a spokeswoman for Groupon, declined to
comment, as did Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs, and Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupon offers discounts of as much as 90 percent from
local businesses, such as restaurants, nail salons and clothing
stores. It then keeps a portion of the revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Groupon leads the daily-deal market, it faces
mounting competition from rivals such as LivingSocial. That
company recently raised $400 million in funding, two people
familiar with the matter said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupon&#8217;s valuation in private-market trading rose to $5.6
billion in the first quarter of this year, up 19 percent over
the fourth quarter of last year, according to New York-based
research firm Nyppex LLC. That valuation is based on
transactions among institutional investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Groupon was
expected to hire the banks for its IPO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index fell 0.2 percent to 36,988.38. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfa SAB (ALFAA MM) jumped 3.3 percent to 174.41 pesos.
Alfa agreed to buy ATT Inc.&#8217;s stake in Alestra SA, giving it
100 percent of the telecommunications company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB (COMERUBC MM) slipped
0.4 percent to 19.67 pesos. The Mexican supermarket chain was
cut to &#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;outperform&#8221; at Grupo Financiero
BBVA Bancomer SA by analyst Miguel Ulloa Suarez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Mexico SAB (GMEXICOB MM), the country&#8217;s largest
mining company, declined 2.7 percent to 39.93 pesos. Twelve of
20 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by Bloomberg, or 60

predicted a gain and three expected little change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Modelo SA (GMODELOC MM), Mexico&#8217;s largest beer maker,
advanced 1.7 percent to 74.60 pesos. The brewer&#8217;s first-quarter

Mexico made up for higher marketing expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO)  tumbled 1.5 percent to
52.45 pesos. The world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster
said first-quarter profit fell 18 percent as its broadcast-
advertising business slowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark de Mexico SAB (KIMBERA MM) advanced 2.6

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said its experimental rheumatoid arthritis pill
reduced symptoms of the disease in a study that may help it
wrest part of a $12 billion market from rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, tofacitinib, led to &#8220;statistically significant
improvements&#8221; for patients at six months compared with a
placebo, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement today. The
pill met the primary goals of the study when given in a 10-
milligram dose, while missing on a measure for reducing the
progression of structural damage in a 5-milligram dose, the
statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is competing with biotechnology companies to develop
the first pill in a decade for rheumatoid arthritis, which
destroys joints in 1.3 million Americans. The drug may bring
annual sales of $1.4 billion to treat the disease in 2015, said
Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in San
Francisco, in a March 21 note. If approved, it would compete
with Abbott Laboratories (ABT)&#8217; Humira, Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Remicade
and Amgen Inc. (AMGN)&#8217;s Enbrel, injectable drugs that now dominate the
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were mixed for Pfizer, since the ability to
prevent structural damage is &#8220;an important attribute&#8221; for
arthritis drugs, Lawrence Biegelsen, a Wells Fargo Securities
analyst in New York, said in a note to clients today. &#8220;We do
not believe this is a major issue for tofacitinib&#8221; as long as
the structural data is better at one year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained 4 cents to $20.53 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares rose 20 percent in the 12
months before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, dubbed Oral Scan Phase 3, followed 800 patients
with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Pfizer said
researchers found no new safety concerns for the pill, which was
formerly known as tasocitinib. An analysis of the results will
be submitted to a future scientific meeting, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug is the most-advanced pill in a family of
experimental treatments targeting a protein called JAK that
leads to joint destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study may lessen worries about the future of Humira,
which generated one-fifth of Abbott&#8217;s sales last year, said
David Lewis, a Morgan Stanley analyst in San Francisco, in a
note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Reports of Humira&#8217;s death are greatly exaggerated,&#8221; he
wrote. &#8220;Our sense is that expectations for tofacitinib are
optimistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott rose 75 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.75 at 12:51
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of the
Abbott Park, Illinois-based company fell 2.5 percent in the 12
months before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edoma Partners LLP, the hedge fund
started by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader Pierre-Henri Flamand last year, was little-changed in the first quarter, said
two people with knowledge of the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund gained about 0.2 percent in the first three months
of 2011, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the firm&#8217;s performance is private. The pool, which received
almost $2 billion from investors, began trading in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event-driven funds such as Edoma that trade securities of
companies going through mergers, bankruptcies and other events
rose by 3.5 percent on average in the first quarter, according
to data compiled by Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flamand, 40, ran Goldman Sach&#8217;s largest internal hedge fund
before stepping down last year after U.S. lawmakers questioned
whether banks should be permitted to make speculative bets with
their own capital. He shut Edoma to new customers after requests
by clients to invest exceeded the firm&#8217;s expectations, according
to another person with knowledge of the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martina Slowey, Edoma&#8217;s London-based chief operating
officer, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flamand worked at New York-based Goldman Sachs for 15
years. In 2007, the firm named him head of Goldman Sachs
Principal Strategies, a unit that sought to profit from
discrepancies in the values of securities, company filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs decided to shut down the principal strategies
unit after the U.S. Congress in July approved the Dodd-Frank
Act. The law, a response to the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, included a provision known as the Volcker rule
that restricts banks from making bets with their own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation was named after former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker, who advocated separating lending units
from investment banking out of concern that speculative trading
could put institutions taking money from depositors at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds are mostly private pools of capital whose
managers participate substantially in the profits from their
speculation on whether assets will rise or fall. Funds climbed
an average of 2.23 percent in the first quarter, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least five former Goldman Sachs employees work at Edoma,
including Ali Hedayat and Emmanuel Niogret, who both traded for
the Principal Strategies unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Sze, who also ran Goldman Sachs Principal
Strategies, started a hedge fund in Hong Kong this month with
more than $1 billion of commitments. Ariel Roskis and Daniele
Benatoff, two London-based traders who worked on the Principal
Strategies desk, are also starting a hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said first-quarter profit
fell 18 percent as its broadcast-advertising business slowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income dropped to 870.7 million pesos ($74 million)
from 1.06 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based
Televisa said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. That missed
the 922 million-peso forecast of Gregorio Tomassi, an analyst at
Banco Santander SA in Mexico City. Sales rose 8.7 percent to
13.2 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is seeking growth from its pay-TV businesses as
sales expand more slowly in its Mexican broadcasting unit. The
over-the-air TV division is contending with the loss of
advertising from the companies controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim after a disagreement over pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the broadcast business, Televisa&#8217;s largest
division, fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier to 4.11 billion
pesos. Operating profit in the unit slid 11 percent to 1.43
billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depreciation and amortization costs rose 20 percent to 1.78
billion pesos, hurting net income, Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite subscriptions increased by 268,000 to 3.3
million, while the three cable systems controlled by Televisa
added more than 40,000 TV customers for a total of 2.01 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said this month it agreed to buy full control
of its Cablemas SA unit for 4.7 billion pesos to add the 42
percent of the company it didn&#8217;t already own. Televisa also
agreed to acquire a 50 percent stake in Grupo Iusacell SA for
$1.6 billion to get access to Mexico&#8217;s mobile-phone market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 53 centavos to 52.71 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 10:10 a.m. New York time. The shares had declined 17
percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) misled
clients and Congress about the firm&#8217;s bets on securities tied to
the housing market, the chairman of the U.S. Senate panel that
investigated the causes of the financial crisis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, releasing the findings of a two-year
inquiry yesterday, said he wants the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to examine whether Goldman
Sachs violated the law by misleading clients who bought the
complex securities known as collateralized debt obligations
without knowing the firm would benefit if they fell in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Democrat also said federal prosecutors should
review whether to bring perjury charges against Goldman Sachs
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and other current and
former employees who testified in Congress last year. Levin said
they denied under oath that Goldman Sachs took a financial
position against the mortgage market solely for its own profit,
statements the senator said were untrue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the blame for the 2008 market collapse belongs to
banks that earned billions of dollars in profits creating and
selling financial products that imploded along with the housing
market, according to the report. The Levin-Coburn panel levied
its harshest criticism at investment banks, in particular
accusing Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DB) of selling
collateralized debt obligations backed by risky loans that the
banks&#8217; own traders believed were likely to lose value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, New York-based Goldman Sachs denied that it
had misled anyone about its activities. &#8220;The testimony we gave
was truthful and accurate and this is confirmed by the
subcommittee&#8217;s own report,&#8221; Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van
Praag said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Michele Allison
said, &#8220;As the PSI report correctly states, there were divergent
views within the bank about the U.S. housing market. Moreover,
the bank&#8217;s views were fully communicated to the market through
research reports, industry events, trading desk commentary and
press coverage. Despite the bearish views held by some, Deutsche
Bank was long the housing market and endured significant
losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borg Seeks Nordic Accord on Capital as Nordea Threatens Move &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said he will look at a
common Nordic solution for capital standards after Nordea Bank
AB (NDA) signaled that Sweden&#8217;s plans to implement the strictest rules
could make it leave Stockholm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borg and other policy makers such as central bank Governor
Stefan Ingves have argued that the largest Nordic economy should
take the lead in tightening capital requirements as regulators
globally seek to introduce measures to stabilize the banking
system after the financial crisis. Sweden is home to four of the
Nordic region&#8217;s six biggest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordea Chairman Bjoern Wahlroos said the largest Nordic
bank has a responsibility to its shareholders to seek the best
solution, according to a report April 13 in Dagens Industri&#8217;s
monthly magazine Dimension. Nordea is the product of mergers
between banks in Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borg seeks to prevent future imbalances in its credit and
property markets and wants banks to follow stricter standards
than those set out by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. The Swedish Bankers&#8217; Association has said it will
fight rules that undermine competitiveness, while Nordea Chief
Executive Officer Christian Clausen has called the plan &#8220;not
realistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodity Trading Rules Targeted by Global Securities Watchdogs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International securities regulators will seek extra
regulation for agricultural and other commodities markets, the
International Organization of Securities Commissions said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOSCO plans to extend its existing work on commodities
beyond assessing the transparency and functioning of oil
markets, the Madrid-based group of supervisors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Other markets including agricultural markets are crucial
for our economies,&#8221; IOSCO said. The &#8220;expanded focus&#8221; is
&#8220;likely to lead to proposals to improve market transparency,
oversight and anti market-abuse treatment for these commodities
markets where necessary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union finance ministers on April 9 approved
recommendations for stricter oversight of commodity-derivatives
trading following concerns that speculation is driving up prices
for raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOSCO brings together securities regulators to set
international standards for financial-market supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Rule-Making Deadlines Slip, Delaying Dozens of Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers anxious about facing stricter standards for
handling clients&#8217; accounts will have to wait at least three more
months for new rules -- and possibly longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed the
timetable for setting a fiduciary standard for brokers -- just
one of dozens of Dodd-Frank Act regulations whose timetable is
slipping. Others include new rules for security-based swaps and
credit ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s latest rule-making calendar, released last week,
indicates that the agency will miss adoption deadlines on a long
list of rules mandated by last year&#8217;s financial-regulatory
overhaul. The Dodd-Frank Act assigned more work to the SEC than
any other agency, and agency officials have admitted publicly
that the act&#8217;s expectations can&#8217;t be met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial firms that have opposed the changes welcome the
postponements. For other firms, the delays prolong uncertainty
in regulation of credit-rating firms, derivatives, executive pay
and conflict-minerals disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for the SEC, along with the rest of the federal
government, has been held at 2010 funding levels this year. The
squeeze will mostly affect how the agency will implement the
rules, Shapiro said; the main problem delaying the rule-writing
is the high volume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies to Pay $2 Million for Disclosure Failure, Finra Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) agreed to pay about $2 million to
resolve Financial Industry Regulatory Authority claims that
three employees failed to disclose conflicts of interest while
selling auction-rate securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers for New York-based Jefferies bought and sold ARS
for eight customers from August 2007 through March 2008 without
telling them about additional compensation they would earn,
Finra said in a statement. The brokers also didn&#8217;t tell the
clients they could have purchased comparable or similar
securities with higher yields, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra also filed a complaint against a third Jefferies
broker for his role in the matter, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Finra
and to have this matter behind us,&#8221; Jefferies spokesman Tom
Tarrant said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies began repaying customers in July 2008 for
commissions it received on ARS that froze, remitting about
$868,000 as of October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Needs Better Review of TARP Legal Fees, Audit Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury risks paying too much in legal fees
related to bailouts because it isn&#8217;t adequately reviewing bills
from law firms, a government watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury office managing the Troubled Asset Relief
Program needs to &#8220;improve controls over the review and payment
of legal fee bills,&#8221; according to a report yesterday from the
Office of the Special Inspector General for TARP. &#8220;Current
contracts and fee-bill review practices create an unacceptable
risk that Treasury, and therefore the American taxpayer, is
overpaying for legal services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special inspector general&#8217;s office, or SIGTARP, said it
&#8220;found weaknesses&#8221; in the Treasury&#8217;s contract with law firm
Venable LLP. The contract didn&#8217;t include sufficient detail on
how Venable should prepare bills or how to describe tasks within
each bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury &#8220;has already taken steps&#8221; to implement
recommendations SIGTARP made to improve the review and payment
of legal fees, Timothy Massad, acting assistant secretary for
financial stability, said in a letter released with yesterday&#8217;s
report. The department &#8220;has implemented strong and effective
processes in regard to all its contracts, including those for
legal services,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Venable fully cooperated with SIGTARP&#8217;s review,&#8221; the law
firm said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We have not had the
opportunity to read the full report. However, we are confident
that Treasury received fair value for the services that we
provided.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Sues Subprime Auto-Loan Dealer for $110 Million Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Inofin
Inc., a Massachusetts-based subprime auto-loan provider, and
five of its executives for illegally raising at least $110
million and then diverting investors&#8217; money to businesses
including car dealerships and real-estate developments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inofin executives Michael Cuomo, Kevin Mann and Melissa
George raised the funds from hundreds of investors in 25 states
through the sale of unregistered notes, the SEC said yesterday
in a filing at U.S. District Court in Boston. They told
investors they could expect returns of nine to 15 percent
because their subprime borrowers typically paid 20 percent
interest on average, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inofin misrepresented the company&#8217;s financial performance
from as early as 2006 through this year, the SEC said. The SEC
also sued two sales agents, David Affeldt and Thomas Keough, for
illegally offering to sell the securities without being
registered as brokers, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone calls to Inofin&#8217;s lawyer Mark DeGiacomo, Affeldt&#8217;s
lawyer Thomas Affeldt, Cuomo&#8217;s attorney William Kettlewell,
George&#8217;s lawyer Christopher Trombetta, Keough&#8217;s attorney Martin
Auerbach, and Mann&#8217;s lawyer Raymond Ausrotas, weren&#8217;t
immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Inofin,
11-cv-10633, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Marsh Pleads Guilty in Gryphon Stock-Tip Fraud Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Marsh, who ran Gryphon Holdings Inc., pleaded
guilty to charges that he misled investors into paying fees for
phony stock tips and investment advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsh, 44, pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of
securities fraud before U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in
Brooklyn, New York. Marsh faces a prison sentence of as long as
14 years under federal sentencing guidelines, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Roger Burlingame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsh is the 17th of 18 defendants, including members of
Gryphon&#8217;s sales force, to plead guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Futerfas, Marsh&#8217;s lawyer, declined to comment after
the sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsh was charged in April 2010. He was also sued by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Marsh, 10-cr-00480, and the
SEC case is SEC v. Gryphon Holdings Inc., 10-cv-01742, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

Michigan Democrat, on the causes of financial crisis and what
steps should be taken to prevent a second one from occurring. &lt;/p&gt;

market regulator, until June 2013, the EFSA said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Sharkawy will head the organization&#8217;s eight-member board

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Disneyland opened earlier
than its 8 a.m. schedule today as about 10,000 people lined up
to visit the amusement park that had been shut for five weeks 
by the strongest earthquake on record to hit Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I could hardly sleep last night because I was too
excited,&#8221; Takashi Katakura, 56, said as he waited to get
inside. &#8220;Disneyland is the place that cheers me up, and I
never age here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earthquake damaged its parking lot and turned some of
the ground to mud in the surrounding areas, which didn&#8217;t have
reinforced foundations like the resort does. People have
hoarded food and necessities as a crippled nuclear plant 135
miles (217 kilometers) north of Tokyo has leaked radiation.
More than 28,000 people are dead or missing and the Asian
Development Bank has warned of the possibility of a recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long lines outside Tokyo Disneyland &#8220;symbolize a
change in people&#8217;s mindsets,&#8221; said Toshihiro Nagahama, chief
economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute Inc. &#8220;It means
that people can go out and enjoy themselves once again, even if
power supply and many problems remain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oriental Land Co., which operates Tokyo Disneyland and
Tokyo DisneySea, rose 1.5 percent to 6,850 yen at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo trading. Today&#8217;s gain pared the stock&#8217;s drop
since the March 11 earthquake to 17 percent, compared with the
broader Topix index&#8217;s 9.6 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforced Foundations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People want a place where they can feel a sense of
comfort,&#8221; Toshio Kagami, chairman and chief executive officer
of Oriental Land, said in an interview at the park today. &#8220;The
number of guests today exceeds expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Disney resort, which sits on reclaimed land in Urayasu
city near the eastern edge of Tokyo, changed its closing time
to 6 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. to conserve energy. The Tokyo
DisneySea theme park remained shut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the quake triggered ground liquefaction, which
causes soil to act like quicksand, across much of the 1,455
hectares (3,600 acres) of reclaimed land in Urayasu, the main
park areas didn&#8217;t suffer as they sit on 15-meter (49-foot) deep
reinforced foundations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earthquake and ensuing tsunami, as well as the damage
to the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear facility, may lead to a 10
percent decline in Japan&#8217;s retail sales this year, convenience-
store chain FamilyMart Co. said April 7. Retailers including
Japan&#8217;s biggest, 7-Eleven owner Seven  I Holdings Co., have
forecast earnings declines because of the disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Shortage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthlong closure of the Tokyo resort may have cut
Oriental Land&#8217;s revenue by about 21 billion yen ($252 million),
according to Bloomberg calculations using data from the company.
Sales at the theme parks, which generate more than 80 percent
of Oriental Land&#8217;s revenue, may suffer during summer as power
supply is regulated to avoid a large-scale blackouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If consumption slumps from disruptions in power supply,
that&#8217;s a problem, but if consumption drops as people cut back
on leisure activities because they feeling it&#8217;s inappropriate
to be enjoying themselves when others are in tough situations,
that&#8217;s a bigger problem,&#8221; Nagahama said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government said it plans to urge companies to reduce
power use by as much as 25 percent this summer. The magnitude-9
temblor prompted Tokyo Electric Power Co. to shut power plants
including the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo and eight nearby prefectures, which account for
about 40 percent of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product, may
have a shortage of 8,000 megawatts this summer even as Tepco,
as the power company is known, plans to boost its capacity to
52,000 megawatts. That shortfall is equal to the amount of
power that would be generated by four Hoover Dams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relief Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will decide on our next steps based on the result
this weekend of our energy-saving measures&#8221; such as dimming
lights and cutting back on air-conditioning, Kagami said in an
interview at the park. &#8220;We will fully cooperate with cutting
electricity use, but safety comes first.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lights inside shops and restaurants will be turned
off, the company said. The Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster
wasn&#8217;t operating as workers repaired parts of the walls damaged
by the earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toko Tanaka, professor of media studies at Waseda
University, said it&#8217;s &#8220;too early&#8221; for Tokyo Disneyland to open.
&#8220;Reviving the economy may be important, too, but we shouldn&#8217;t
rush with reopening Disneyland and starting the baseball
games,&#8221; she said in a phone interview. &#8220;How can you prioritize
those over the situation in Fukushima, which isn&#8217;t settled
yet?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oriental Land said it will donate 300 yen to a relief fund
for every customer who goes to the park from today to May 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park&#8217;s opening is an &#8220;upbeat message to the world,&#8221;
Hiroshi Mizohata, commissioner of the Japan Tourism Agency,
said at a briefing in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masamichi Katori, 27, said he&#8217;ll cut back on his
electricity use to help ensure there will be enough power for
Tokyo Disneyland, which he visits three times a month. &#8220;Today
is the day I&#8217;ve been waiting for,&#8221; he said, before he and his
son, who was dressed as Donald Duck, ran off to chase some
Disney mascots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partners Ltd. is
weighing a sale of Belgian chemical maker Taminco NV, which may
attract interest from strategic and private-equity buyers,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC is working with advisers at Bank of America Corp. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to assess interest in the business
which the private-equity firm bought for 800 million euros ($1.2
billion) in 2007, said the people, who asked not to be
identified as the matter is private. The process is at an early
stage and may not lead to a sale, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of amine derivatives, used in products from crop
protection to paint and cosmetics, reported sales of 715 million
euros in 2010. CVC canceled the Taminco IPO that valued the business
at as much as $1 billion in February 2010, because of market volatility.
The private-equity firm is already preparing another of its chemical
investments, Evonik Industries AG of Germany, for a share sale within
the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC&#8217;s spokesman James Olley, Goldman Sachs spokeswoman
Sophie Bullock and Bank of America spokeswoman Victoria Garrod
all declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, Taminco&#8217;s main competitor is BASF SE. (BAS) Antitrust
issues would likely prevent the Ludwigshafen, Germany-based
company from buying the asset, one of the people said. Taminco,
based in Ghent, Belgium, was spun off from UCB SA (UCB) in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC, based in London, has already given the go-ahead for
two new amine-derivative units in Florida and Louisiana. Taminco
also entered a joint venture with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co. to
expand production in Nanjing, China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taminco&#8217;s exposure to Asian markets will make it attractive
to makers of intermediate chemicals in the region as they seek
to add domestic production, one of the people said. The unit may
also fit similar companies in the Middle East, which are seeking
to diversify from petrochemicals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taminco has reduced debt to 3.2 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a ratio implying
borrowings of about 510 million euros. Ebitda rose 14 percent to
159 million euros last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) received
approval from India&#8217;s central bank to become a primary dealer,
allowing it to underwrite government bonds in the world&#8217;s
second-fastest growing major economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank, based in New York, will be able to
start the operations on April 18, according to a statement on
the website of the Reserve Bank of India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permit will let Goldman Sachs compete to help the
finance ministry raise an estimated 4.17 trillion rupees ($94
billion) from debt in the year ending March 31. The U.S. firm,
which lacks a license that would enable it to trade currencies
in India, trailed rivals including Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup
Inc. (C) in entering the nation&#8217;s primary dealership business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects to receive a banking license in the
nation in three to six months, according to a March 21 report by
Guy Moszkowski and Steven J. Chubak, analysts at Bank of America
Corp. who met with the investment bank&#8217;s Asian senior management
team in Hong Kong last month. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank currently employs about 100 people in
its Mumbai office and another 3,500 in Bangalore to provide
back-office services for its global operations. It has invested
about $2 billion in India, most of it since 2005, buying stakes
in companies including Mahindra  Mahindra Ltd. (MM), Max India Ltd.
and TVS Logistics Services Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Goldman Sachs agreed to buy Mumbai-based
Benchmark Asset Management Co. for an undisclosed amount. That
transaction gives it access to a market where assets managed by
mutual funds more than tripled to 6.8 trillion rupees in the
five years ended Dec. 31, according to the Association of Mutual
Funds of India. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hayate Atom Multi Strategy fund has
returned 0.9 percent since former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader Masaru Matsumoto started the Japan focused hedge fund
four days after the nation&#8217;s strongest earthquake on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, which invests in stocks and futures indexes based
on a mathematical model, started with about $4 million from
domestic and overseas investors on March 15, said Matsumoto,
chief executive officer at Atom Investment Co. With a maximum
capacity of about 20 billion yen ($239 million), the fund aims
to raise about 2 billion yen over the next six months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto began his fund a month ago, on the day Japanese
stocks suffered their third-worst daily decline in history as
Tokyo Electric Power Co. confirmed an explosion at its nuclear
reactor. The fund bases investments on an algorithmic model that
Matsumoto developed and which takes into account market moves,
fundamental analysis, news and &#8220;noise&#8221; factors that determine
stock moves, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a good time to start,&#8221; said Matsumoto, 35, who
previously traded equities and was the chief trader of yen
interest rate option trading at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. &#8220;We
lowered our risks to adjust to this crisis condition, but our
fund depends on a model that eliminates any human emotions, so
that has helped in a market like this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Breed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto joins a breed of managers who are setting up
their own shops in Asia after working at global financial firms.
More than 150 funds have started in the first quarter of this
year, according to Eurekahedge Pte, a Singapore-based industry
data provider. The Eurekahedge Japan Hedge Fund Index declined
1.1 percent in March, based on preliminary figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atom fund -- named after the Japanese animation character
Astro Boy, or Mighty Atom, because Matsumoto is a member of
Japan&#8217;s national team for the world arm wrestling championships
-- posted average annual returns of 61.3 percent based on
simulated trading from August 2004 through March 2010, according
to Matsumoto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund had an annual Sharpe ratio, a formula which
analyzes whether investments offer enough return to offset their
risks, of 2.25 during the first month of trading, said
Matsumoto. The greater a fund&#8217;s Sharpe ratio, the better its
risk-adjusted performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto started his fund four days after the earthquake
and ensuing tsunami that led to more than 28,000 missing or dead
and crippled nuclear plants in Fukushima prefecture, causing the
worst nuclear disaster since 1986 in Chernobyl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikkei Plunge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day the fund that employs a long-short equity
strategy started, the Nikkei 225 (NKY) Stock Average plunged as much
as 14 percent, its biggest intraday slide since the stock market
crash of October 1987, on record trading volume. In a short
sale, a trader borrows stock and sells it in the hope it can be
bought back later at a cheaper price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei today declined 0.7 percent to 9591.52, bringing
its decline since the March 11 temblor to 8.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter the slide and turbulence in the market, the fund
limited investments and made adjustments to the algorithm model
by reducing or eliminating some industries affected by the
nuclear and radiation disaster, such as utilities and fisheries
stocks, Matsumoto said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund focuses on about 200 highly traded stocks, Nikkei
and Topix index futures. It currently invests in about 50
positions, instead of about 30 as usual, to diversify its risk,
Matsumoto said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know very well the weakness for these models, so I had
to make some tweaks after the crisis,&#8221; Matsumoto said. &#8220;There
is no such historic data for this sort of event, and the model
strictly picks the investments based on historical data, so the
more it gathers information, the more accurate the investment
picks become.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s private-
equity portfolio increased 16 percent during the first quarter
as the company stepped up investments in firms that aren&#8217;t
publicly traded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, ranked second by assets in the U.S., pegged the
carrying value of its portfolio at $10.1 billion, 6.6 percent
below cost, according to a supplement released April 13 along
with the New York-based company&#8217;s earnings. The cost of the
portfolio was listed at $10.8 billion, an 8.2 percent increase
in three months. Compared with a year earlier, the carrying
value rose 39 percent and the cost by 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity managers have been marking up holdings as
stock markets rose, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index posting
a 21 percent return including dividends since the start of 2010.
KKR  Co., founded by billionaires Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, said last quarter that all except one of its private-
equity funds were marked above cost. All the private-equity
holdings at Stephen Schwarzman&#8217;s Blackstone Group LP (BX) are above
cost, according to its quarterly report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan told investors that future returns will be
&#8220;volatile,&#8221; according to a slide presentation accompanying
first-quarter results. Mary Callahan Erdoes, chief executive
officer of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said during a February
investor conference that the bank&#8217;s activity in hedge funds,
private equity and real assets &#8220;continues to help us understand
the markets better and be closer to our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Greg Stohr" date="Apr 18, 2011  2:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-18/patent-challenges-debated-as-high-court-hears-microsoft-appeal.html"><headline>Patent Challenges Debated as Top Court Hears Microsoft Case</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court justices debated
making it easier to challenge some patents, reviewing a case
that led to changes in Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Word software and may
force the company to pay a $300 million award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today urged the justices in a one-hour hearing in
Washington to overturn a jury verdict won by closely held I4i
LP, which sued the larger company for patent infringement. The
verdict now stands as the largest ever upheld by an appeals
court in a patent case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and its allies -- including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google
Inc. (GOOG), Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) and Intel Corp. (INTC) -- say the appeals
court ruling favoring I4i left companies vulnerable to
infringement suits by making it too hard to invalidate patents
that never should have been issued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In upholding the verdict, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit said Microsoft didn&#8217;t prove that the disputed
patent, which covers a feature that lets large companies add
special data to Word files, was based on technology that was
already in the marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said Microsoft needed to offer &#8220;clear
and convincing evidence&#8221; to overcome the traditional
presumption that patents approved by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office are valid. Microsoft says a less-demanding
standard should apply when a jury is presented with evidence
about pre-existing technology that the patent examiner didn&#8217;t
consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in the Law &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the Patent Office didn&#8217;t even consider the evidence,
it makes absolutely no sense&#8221; to use the clear-and-convincing
standard, Microsoft&#8217;s lawyer, Thomas Hungar, argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stephen Breyer said Microsoft&#8217;s position &#8220;would be
a change&#8221; in the law, and several other justices suggested they
were resistant to making such a shift. Justice Elena Kagan said
Microsoft&#8217;s approach was inconsistent with a 1934 Supreme Court
opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you read that opinion, no one would gather from that
opinion the kinds of limits that you&#8217;re suggesting on it,&#8221;
Kagan told Hungar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts didn&#8217;t take part in today&#8217;s
argument. His most recent financial disclosure form indicates he
or his family owns Microsoft stock worth between $100,000 and
$250,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longstanding Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto-based I4i argues that the clear and convincing
standard is a longstanding rule that has encouraged innovation.
I4i&#8217;s Supreme Court lawyer, Seth Waxman, said Congress had
&#8220;actively acquiesced&#8221; in the clear-and-convincing standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Congress has been very, very active in this field,&#8221;
Waxman said. &#8220;It is well aware of the clear-and-convincing
evidence standard and it has done almost nothing to change it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I4i has support in the case from venture capital firms and
a trade group representing the pharmaceutical industry.
Microsoft also has support in its appeal from trade groups
representing the financial services and wireless industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case stems from a method developed by I4i for editing
documents using XML, a so-called markup language that tells the
computer how text should appear. I4i created a way to store the
content and the XML codes separately, making it easier for users
to work alone with either the content or the codes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers including drugmakers Merck  Co. and Bayer AG use
I4i&#8217;s software to make sure that people get up-to-date
information on the labels of their medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word Program &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its 2007 lawsuit, I4i accused Microsoft of incorporating
the invention into the larger company&#8217;s Word program, which is
used by 500 million people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued in defense that I4i had included its
innovation in a product it sold to a client more than a year
before it filed its patent application. That prior use would
have rendered the invention ineligible for patenting under
federal law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury agreed with I4i and awarded $200 million. The judge
overseeing the case increased that sum because of misconduct by
Microsoft&#8217;s trial lawyer, and the figure has continued to grow
with interest. The court also ordered Microsoft to stop using
the invention, forcing the company to update the Word software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, which the court is scheduled to resolve by the
end of June, is Microsoft v. I4i Limited Partnership, 10-290. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, &#8220;needs to accelerate the pace of
product development&#8221; to compete with Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple
Inc. (AAPL), co-founder Paul Allen said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 7 phone software and XBox Kinect
sensors, which help people play video games using physical
motion instead of controllers, are &#8220;resonating with a younger
audience&#8221; as the company tries to &#8220;get more momentum&#8221; in new
technology markets, said Allen, 58, who spoke at an event at the
92nd Street Y in New York last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen, whose memoir, &#8220;Idea Man,&#8221; will be released this
week, co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975. He left the
company in 1983 after being diagnosed with Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma
and resigned from the board in 2000. He is the 17th-wealthiest
American with a net worth of about $13 billion, according to
Forbes magazine, and currently owns the National Basketball
Association&#8217;s Portland Trail Blazers and the National Football
League&#8217;s Seattle Seahawks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has struggled to compete with mobile devices from
Apple, which has supplanted Microsoft as the largest technology
company by market value. Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs&#8217;s
transformation of Apple since his return in 1997 has been
&#8220;unbelievable,&#8221; Allen said. Microsoft, Google and Apple may be
in a &#8220;three-horse race&#8221; to innovate and win consumer approval
on new platforms including smartphones and tablet computers, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What he&#8217;s done with the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad --
what a triple play there,&#8221; Allen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Disclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Jobs, Allen is again dealing with health issues. After
surviving Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, Allen was diagnosed with non-
Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma in 2009. He said it was &#8220;important for
companies to disclose some level of detail&#8221; about their
executives&#8217; health conditions for transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen declined to comment on the NBA and NFL labor
situations, and he wouldn&#8217;t say if he would vote for the
Sacramento Kings to move to Anaheim, California. One of the
NBA&#8217;s &#8220;biggest challenges&#8221; was to come up with a financially
feasible revenue sharing plan so that midsize market
organizations can field competitive teams, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one likes teams moving around, but we all face the
financial consequences, too,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;No owner enjoys
losing money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named
Leslie A. Biddle, the firm&#8217;s global head of commodities sales,
to a new merchant-investing unit that will focus on the mining
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As chief financial officer of the new business, Biddle
&#8220;will focus on the evaluation, structuring and financing of new
opportunities&#8221; and work closely with the Global Commodities
Principal Investing business, according to a memo today from the
co-heads of the securities unit, Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz. Biddle will
continue to report to Isabelle Ealet, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global
head of commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
continues to pursue opportunities to invest the firm&#8217;s own money
in companies and other assets even as the Dodd-Frank Act passed
last year prohibits banks from risking capital by betting for
their own accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank provision known as the Volcker rule limits
banks that get federal support, such as deposit insurance, from
proprietary trading or investing in private equity or hedge
funds. The rule, which is still being interpreted by regulators,
doesn&#8217;t explicitly prevent banks from using their own money to
make long-term investments that are similar to those made by
private-equity firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing and lending, the segment that includes positions
held with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own money, accounted for 19 percent of
revenue in 2010, the firm reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined in 2002 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biddle joined the New York-based company in 2002 as vice
president in U.S. power sales and was promoted to managing
director in 2004 and to partner in 2006, the memo said. She is a
member of the firm-wide new activity committee, structured-
investment products, European audit and compliance committee and
the finance committee, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As global head of commodities sales, Biddle &#8220;has driven
some of our most important private-equity relationships and has
played a large role in expanding our commodities growth markets
footprint,&#8221; the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biddle will be replaced as global head of commodities by L. Peter O&#8217;Hagan, who was a partner in the commodities unit before
becoming chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the
deposit-taking unit, in 2008, according to a separate memo
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of both memos was confirmed by Stephen Cohen, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, who declined to comment
further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John F. W. Rogers, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chief of staff, has $33.6 million of the firm&#8217;s
stock, according to a regulatory filing that disclosed his
holdings for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edith W. Cooper, the global head of human capital
management, held stock worth $19.4 million, according to a
separate filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The values are based on the company&#8217;s closing stock
price of $155.13 on April 15 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper and Rogers, who each have worked at Goldman Sachs
for more than 14 years and were promoted to partner in 2000, had
to disclose their holdings because they became executive
officers this month. They&#8217;re among 12 executive officers,
including Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper, 49, and Rogers, 55, already were on the firm&#8217;s
management committee and Rogers is chairman of the boards of the
Goldman Sachs Foundation and Goldman Sachs Gives, both
philanthropies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on behalf of Rogers and Cooper, and the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to stock the executives already own, the
documents filed April 13 show Rogers has options to buy 444,503
shares and Cooper has options to buy 133,147. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reagan, Bush &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers, who worked in the administrations of presidents
Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush before joining Goldman Sachs
in 1994, directly owns 103,950 shares and 91,668 restricted
stock units, the filing shows. A family trust also holds 21,113
shares of Goldman Sachs stock. His options have strike prices
ranging from $78.78 to $204.16 and exercise dates from Nov. 25,
2011, through December 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper, who joined the firm&#8217;s commodities unit in 1996 and
worked in futures and sales before taking over the personnel
division in 2008, has 20,869 shares and 98,169 restricted stock
units. A family trust owns 5,710 shares. Her options can be
exercised at prices ranging from $78.78 to $91.61 from Nov. 25,
2011, through the end of 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of New York-based Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, have dropped 7.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors said they were
prepared to summon Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President Gary Cohn
as a witness to rebut Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam&#8217;s defense in his insider-trading trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told U.S. District
Judge Richard Holwell in Manhattan on April 12 that the
government would call Cohn to testify if a defense witness,
former Galleon U.S. President Richard Schutte, was permitted to
tell jurors about comments Cohn made at a meeting with
Rajaratnam on July 31, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s hearsay&#8221; and shouldn&#8217;t be allowed as evidence,
Brodsky told the judge, according to a transcript of a
&#8220;sidebar&#8221; conference that jurors and others in the courtroom
couldn&#8217;t hear. If the defense witness testified about Cohn&#8217;s
comments, Brodsky said, &#8220;We are prepared to call Mr. Cohn, and
we would be allowed to do that as part of our rebuttal case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schutte, who completed his testimony April 14, wasn&#8217;t asked
by Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers about Cohn&#8217;s comments at the meeting.
Brodsky told Holwell April 14 that prosecutors intended to
present a rebuttal case. He didn&#8217;t mention Cohen or identify
other potential witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in Manhattan, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, has been on trial since March 8 in the
largest crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
The Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of gaining $63.8
million from tips leaked by corporate insiders and hedge-fund
traders about a dozen stocks, including Goldman Sachs, Intel
Corp. (INTC), Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) and Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) He denies
wrongdoing, saying he based his trades on research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregg Jarrell, the top economist for the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission from 1984 to 1987, testified April 15 as
an expert witness for Rajaratnam. Jarrell, who now teaches at
the University of Rochester&#8217;s graduate school of business in New
York, said the tips Rajaratnam allegedly received weren&#8217;t
material to Galleon or didn&#8217;t comprise inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarrell showed jurors charts displaying press articles and
analyst reports about the stocks Rajaratnam is accused of
trading based on inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarrell&#8217;s testimony will continue today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Taylor Bean&#8217;s Farkas Testifies He Didn&#8217;t Commit Crimes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Farkas, the former chairman of Taylor, Bean  Whitaker
Mortgage Corp. on trial for allegedly masterminding a 1.9
billion fraud scheme, testified that he didn&#8217;t commit any
crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farkas told jurors April 15 in federal court in Alexandria,
Virginia, that he was aware his company was having cash
problems, saying it was the nature of the business for a growing
company that was funding hundreds of new mortgages a day. Farkas
said he didn&#8217;t have authority to move money between Taylor Bean
accounts at Colonial Bank and said his employees acted on
directions from bank officials on how to deal with overdrafts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe at the time I committed any crimes and I
don&#8217;t believe now that I committed any crimes,&#8221; Farkas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farkas, 58, is charged with orchestrating a fraud involving
fake mortgage assets that duped some of the country&#8217;s largest
financial institutions, targeted the Troubled Asset Relief
Program and contributed to the failure of Montgomery, Alabama-
based Colonial Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farkas is accused of 14 counts of conspiracy and wire, bank
and securities fraud. If convicted of the single conspiracy
charge, Farkas faces a prison term of as long as 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;

Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kluger Granted Bail as Insider-Trading Probe Widens &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Kluger, the lawyer charged with passing merger-and-
acquisition tips stolen from four law firms, was granted bail
April 15 in an insider-trading case that prosecutors now say
generated at least $37 million in profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kluger, 50, appeared in federal court in Newark, New
Jersey, where he agreed to post a $1 million bond. He must
undergo electronic monitoring and detention at his home in
Oakton, Virginia, where he was arrested April 6. Kluger&#8217;s
parents will secure the bond with $500,000 in cash. Kluger&#8217;s
father, Richard, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning social historian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kluger is charged with passing inside data to a middleman
who gave it to stock trader Garrett D. Bauer in a scheme
spanning 17 years. The middleman, Kenneth T. Robinson, pleaded
guilty April 11 and secretly recorded Kluger and Bauer for the
Federal Bureau of Investigation last month. On April 6,
prosecutors said the illicit profits in the last five years of
the scheme was at least $32 million. April 15, they said it was
at least $37 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overall number of trades in the scheme, and his
profits from the scheme, continue to rise,&#8221; Assistant U.S.
Attorney Judith Germano told U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Falk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say he helped Robinson and Bauer use nonpublic
data to trade ahead of at least 15 corporate transactions
involving companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc., 3Com Corp.
and Acxiom Corp. (ACXM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kluger lives with a former partner who is helping him raise
their children, Kluger attorney Alan Zegas told Falk. The judge
said Kluger can leave his house for child care and may undergo
mental-health treatment as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities said Kluger passed tips about deals that he
learned of when he was an associate for New York-based Cravath,
Swaine  Moore LLP from 1994 to 1997 and Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher  Flom LLP, another New York firm, from 1998 to 2001.
Kluger also passed on tips that he stole from Fried Frank Harris
Shriver  Jacobson LLP after he left Skadden Arps, Robinson said
in pleading guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a hiatus, the scheme resumed in December 2005 and ran
until March of this year, when Kluger worked in the Washington
office of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich  Rosati PC, authorities
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Bauer, 11-mj-3536, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Newark). The Robinson case is U.S. v.

(Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattel Suit Over Alleged MGA Illegal Money Transfers Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge dismissed Mattel Inc. (MAT)&#8217;s lawsuit alleging that rival
toymaker MGA Entertainment Inc. illegally transferred $400
million to shield it from a possible judgment in a federal court
battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Superior Court Judge Mel Red Recana in Los
Angeles issued an April 13 order saying he agrees with the judge
overseeing the federal case who previously rejected the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The state court has ruled on procedural grounds and is
leaving open our right to re-file the case at a later date,&#8221;
Mike Zeller, a lawyer for Mattel, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel and closely held MGA are awaiting a jury verdict in
a second federal court trial over the origins of MGA&#8217;s Bratz
dolls. Mattel, based in El Segundo, California, accuses MGA of
trade-secret theft and copyright infringement, alleging that a
Mattel designer came up with the idea for Bratz and secretly
took it to MGA. MGA, based in Van Nuys, California, also seeks
damages from Mattel for trade-secret theft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGA Chief Executive Officer Isaac Larian said in an e-
mailed statement said the company will sue Mattel for malicious
prosecution and for its legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state court case is Mattel v. MGA, BC444819, Superior
Court of California (Los Angeles County). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alstom Executives Say Bribery Search Warrants Aren&#8217;t Valid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives at Alstom SA (ALO)&#8217;s U.K. unit said investigators
didn&#8217;t have enough evidence to search their homes as part of a
probe into claims the company paid 81 million pounds ($132
million) in bribes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Stephen Burgin, president of the French
transport company&#8217;s unit, and Robert Purcell, its finance
director, told a London court April 15 that they should be
allowed to argue the U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office didn&#8217;t have
enough reason to suspect them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is absolutely no evidence of these men being
involved in any substantial payments,&#8221; said Clare Montgomery,
their lawyer. The men joined Alstom in 2008 and 2009 &#8220;well
after&#8221; the allegations took place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burgin and Purcell won a partial ruling last year allowing
them to argue police didn&#8217;t have good reason to arrest them as
part of a bribery, money laundering and false accounting probe.
They are seeking court approval to also challenge the SFO&#8217;s role
in the case. Prosecutors suspect that from 2004 to 2010 Alstom,
through its Alstom Network U.K. Ltd. unit, gave money to
companies that acted as &#8220;bogus consultants&#8221; to bribe overseas
officials for contracts, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the SFO, James Eadie, said Alstom Network
acted as &#8220;a conduit&#8221; to pass money through and that the
payments were &#8220;ongoing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit was paying &#8220;nine times as much commission in the
Middle East and Africa compared to Europe, and eight times for
Asia,&#8221; Eadie said. &#8220;That&#8217;s as good of an inference as one
could muster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alstom has denied the allegations. No further hearings in
the matter were scheduled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Burgin v. Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis, 10/6227; and Burgin v. Director of the Serious Fraud
Office, 10/5723, High Court of Justice, Administrative Court
(London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Can&#8217;t Claim $115 Million Tax Deductions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) won&#8217;t be able to claim $115 million in
tax deductions from 2002 based on an appellate court judge&#8217;s
ruling that its leases with public transit agencies and
technology companies amount to &#8220;abusive tax shelters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld
April 15 a lower court decision that found the bank&#8217;s leases
with 26 entities including New Jersey Transit and the Washington
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority &#8220;lack economic substance.&#8221;
The leases were structured as so-called sale-in, lease-out -- or
SILO -- deals that allow tax-exempt entities to bestow their tax
benefits to a taxpayer for a fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax benefits include deductions for depreciation of
assets. The appeals court rejected the Wells Fargo leases as
little more than a money-making strategy for all the entities
involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These transactions were win-win situations for all the
parties involved because free money -- in the form of previously
unavailable tax benefits utilized by Wells Fargo -- was divided
among all parties,&#8221; Judge William C. Bryson wrote in the
opinion. &#8220;The money was not entirely &#8216;free,&#8217; of course, because
it was in effect transferred to Wells Fargo from the public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, said the bank was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wells Fargo continues to believe in the merits of the
litigated transactions,&#8221; she said in an e-mailed statement
April 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wells Fargo  Co. v. U.S., 2010-5108, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-New York Comptroller Hevesi Gets Up to 4 Years in Prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who pleaded
guilty in a pay-to-play scandal at the state pension fund he
once ran, will go to prison for as many as four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hevesi, 71, the highest-ranking official convicted in an
investigation of corruption at the pension fund, was sentenced
to a minimum of one year April 15 by State Supreme Court Justice
Michael Obus in Manhattan. Hevesi, a Democrat, resigned in 2006
after four years as comptroller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I publicly disgraced myself,&#8221; Hevesi told the judge at
his sentencing hearing. &#8220;I have only myself to blame. I will
live with this shame for the rest of my life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hevesi pleaded guilty in October to the crime of receiving
reward for official misconduct. He admitted giving preferential
treatment to Markstone Capital Partners, approving $250 million
in pension-fund investments in exchange for almost $1 million in
gifts, including $75,000 in travel expenses, $380,000 in sham
consulting fees for a lobbyist, and more than $500,000 in
campaign contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry &#8220;Hank&#8221; Morris, Hevesi&#8217;s former political
consultant, was sent to prison for as long as four years in
February. Morris, who reaped $19 million in fees through 23
state investments while acting as a middleman, admitted that the
investment process at New York&#8217;s pension fund was manipulated to
benefit him, his associates and contributors to Hevesi&#8217;s
campaign. Morris agreed to forfeit the $19 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People v. Hevesi, New York State Supreme Court,
New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbott Agrees to Pay $52 Million to Resolve Aids Drug Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories (ABT) agreed to pay $52 million to resolve
claims by direct drug buyers that it tried to harm competition
when it quadrupled the price of its HIV medicine Norvir in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, which is subject to court approval, would
resolve a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Abbott
customers that purchased Norvir, a boosting agent for other HIV
drugs, and a second medicine Kaletra, which includes Norvir,
according to an April 8 filing in federal court in Oakland,
California. Abbott denied wrongdoing, according to the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott increased the wholesale price of a Norvir capsule
containing 100 milligrams to $8.57 from $1.71, the Abbott Park,
Illinois-based company said in court documents. GlaxoSmithKline
Plc (GSK) and drug retailers and distributors sued, claiming other
drugmakers that used Norvir in their medicines couldn&#8217;t compete
on price with Kaletra, and the price increase penalized drug
customers that wanted to buy medicines that competed with
Kaletra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott said it increased Norvir&#8217;s prices for legitimate
business purposes and Kaletra lost market share after the price
increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS), Walgreen Co. (WAG), Rite Aid Corp. (RAD) and
retailers that sued opted out of the settlement, according to
court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Meijer v. Abbott Laboratories, 07-5985, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crest Nicholson, ISG Pearce Win 82% Reduction of U.K. Fines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s antitrust regulator lost another round of appeals
in its price-fixing case against U.K. builders after a court cut
by 82 percent its fines against Crest Nicholson Plc and a former
subsidiary, ISG Pearce Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of Fair Trading was &#8220;wrong in principle&#8221; and
out of step with its own guidelines when it fined the companies
a total of 5.19 million pounds ($8.5 million) for joining a
cartel to drive up prices, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled
April 15 in London. The fine was reduced to 950,000 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ultimate penalty imposed on the appellants in the
decision was disproportionate and excessive in all the
circumstances of the infringement,&#8221; the tribunal said in its
judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator in 2009 levied fines totaling 129.5 million
pounds against 103 builders, including Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY) and
Carillion Plc (CLLN), the U.K.&#8217;s two biggest, for rigging bids from
2000 to 2006. Twenty-five companies appealed, including Kier
Group Plc (KIE), whose penalty of 17.9 million pounds was reduced to
1.7 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will consider these judgments in detail, alongside
those in all other construction appeals, and will then decide
whether to appeal to the Court of Appeal,&#8221; OFT spokesman Frank
Shepherd said April 15 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA Hires SEC&#8217;s Former Top Cop for Legal Disputes, Probes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Lynch, the former Securities and Exchange Commission
enforcement head who later helped Morgan Stanley (MS) and Credit
Suisse AG tackle legal disputes, is looking to repeat his
success at the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) announced April 14 that it had hired
Lynch, 60, as its global chief of legal, compliance and
regulatory relations. Scott Silvestri, a Bank of America
spokesman, said Lynch wasn&#8217;t available for an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan, 51, brings in Lynch
as the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank deals with lawsuits
and investigations tied to soured loans from the housing boom.
The lender, which posted its first profit in three quarters
April 15, had its capital plan rejected by the Federal Reserve
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynch, who started at the SEC in 1976, headed the
regulator&#8217;s enforcement division from 1985 to 1989. He led
investigations of Ivan Boesky, the former takeover investor who
was convicted of insider trading, and Michael Milken, the high-
yield bond chief at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who went to
prison for securities violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynch joined Credit Suisse First Boston as it faced a
federal probe into its handling of initial public offerings
during the dot-com bubble. He took over Morgan Stanley&#8217;s legal
division after it lost a $1.57 billion verdict as its lawyers
failed to turn over relevant e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynch&#8217;s position was newly created, and general counsel Ed
O&#8217;Keefe will report to him, the bank said. Lynch, who&#8217;s been in
London since 2009, is moving back to New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galleon&#8217;s Rajaratnam Case Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam was the
most-read litigation docket on the Bloomberg Law system last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, has been on trial since March 8 in the
largest crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
The Sri Lankan-born money manager and co-founder of Galleon is
accused of gaining $63.8 million from tips leaked by corporate
insiders and hedge-fund traders. He denies wrongdoing, saying he
based his trades on research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein may consider
stepping down because of fatigue from guiding the bank through
the financial crisis, the New York Times reported, citing two
unidentified persons who spoke with Blankfein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility that Blankfein might resign has prompted
speculation over who might succeed him, the newspaper added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top candidates to replace him include vice chairmen Michael
Sherwood, who handles much of the bank&#8217;s international business
from London, J. Michael Evans, chairman of Goldman&#8217;s Asia
business, and Gary D. Cohn, president and chief operating
officer and Blankfein&#8217;s top deputy in New York, the newspaper
said, citing three unidentified company veterans briefed on the
situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 56, may wait until the firm completes
negotiations with Washington over new banking regulations in the
second half this year before turning management over to a
younger team, the Times reported, citing Roger Freeman, a

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, boosted
its full-year profit forecast as companies buy more software and
equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating earnings will be at least $13.15 a share this
year, higher than a previous projection of at least $13 and the
$13.08 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
First-quarter services signings fell 14 percent from a year
earlier, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today, erasing a gain
in the shares in extended trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract signings were &#8220;a blemish,&#8221; although they
aren&#8217;t a good indicator of future revenue, said Chris Whitmore,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in San Francisco who recommends
buying the stock. For the first quarter, IBM reported &#8220;a solid
revenue beat, driven by improvement in services and strength in
hardware.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales last quarter climbed 7.7 percent to $24.6 billion,
topping projections, as software, hardware and services revenue
jumped. Equipment sales climbed for the fifth straight quarter
as customers continued to upgrade after IBM released its Power7
server-computer system and a new mainframe last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM slid $4 to $161.40 at 6:17 p.m. after rising to $170 in
extended trading. Before the earnings&#8217; release, the stock fell
54 cents to $165.40 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Volatile&#8217; Signings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signings -- the value of new contracts signed during a
specific quarter -- declined to $10.5 billion. It&#8217;s the fourth
time in five quarters that a drop in new contract signings
overshadowed an improved profit forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signings figure is &#8220;volatile&#8221; and not as accurate a
predictor of sales as the backlog, which includes contracts
accumulated over time, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said on a conference call today. Backlog climbed 5.6 percent to
$142 billion last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income rose 10 percent to $2.86 billion,
or $2.31 a share, from $2.6 billion, or $1.97, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit on an operating basis was $2.41 a share, compared
with analysts&#8217; average estimate of $2.30. This is the first year
IBM is reporting on an operating format, which excludes
acquisition and some retirement costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware sales climbed 19 percent to $4.02 billion, the
largest jump of any segment. Software revenue rose 5.8 percent
to $5.31 billion. Sales from emerging markets, which IBM expects
to make up almost 30 percent of revenue in 2015, advanced 18
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross profit margin expanded to 44.1 percent last quarter,
from 43.6 percent a year earlier. The company had about $220
million in workforce restructuring costs, Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Limited&#8217; Japan Effect &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which gets about 11 percent of its sales from Japan,
saw a limited effect from last month&#8217;s earthquake, Loughridge
said on the call. The company&#8217;s infrastructure in the country,
which is in &#8220;very good shape,&#8221; had about $20 million in
damages. The company doesn&#8217;t expect &#8220;appreciable impact&#8221; on
its supply chain, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating earnings will be at least $20 a share in 2015,
IBM said last month, reiterating a forecast from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is investing in cloud-computing and analytics-
software businesses, which the company predicts will generate $7
billion and $16 billion in revenue, respectively, by 2015. Those
initiatives, along with investments in emerging markets and
Smarter Planet -- IBM&#8217;s plan to digitize physical infrastructure
-- will help add on about $20 billion in sales through 2015, the
company said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano also plans to make
about $20 billion in acquisitions in the same period, a
projection he first gave last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) declined
in New York trading after first-quarter profit fell 21 percent
and analysts said the fifth-biggest U.S. bank relied on
unpredictable investment gains to beat estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs dropped $1.92, or 1.3 percent, to $151.86 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest closing
price since Oct. 15. Net income slid to $2.74 billion, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
56, depended on trading and investments with the firm&#8217;s own
money to generate 79 percent of first-quarter revenue. The
investing and lending segment, which accounted for 23 percent of
revenue, is unreliable because results are tied to market moves
and because regulators might add restrictions to the business,
said some analysts and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A large part of that beat was driven by larger-than-
expected investment gains, which are volatile and could easily
fall sharply into the next quarter,&#8221; said Richard Staite, an
analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London who rates the stock
&#8220;neutral.&#8221; &#8220;It is still unclear under the new regulations
just how much proprietary trading and investing Goldman can
do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings per common share, which includes the cost of
preferred dividend payments to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., dropped to $1.56 from $5.59, beating the 81-cent
average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basel, Dodd-Frank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest businesses, trading and investing,
are the ones most affected by new capital requirements drawn up
by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and by limits on
the firm&#8217;s proprietary trading and investments in hedge funds
and private-equity funds imposed by the U.S.&#8217;s Dodd-Frank
financial-overhaul law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from the other main businesses, investment banking
and asset management, were disappointing, according to analysts
including Glenn Schorr at Nomura Holdings Inc. and Richard Bove
at Rochdale Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show &#8220;solid trading, better-than-expected
Investing  Lending, and some softness in investment banking and
asset management,&#8221; Schorr, who rates the company&#8217;s shares a
buy, said in a note to investors. &#8220;Some may question the
sustainability of some of the gains in Investing  Lending.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove cut his rating on Goldman Sachs stock to &#8220;neutral&#8221;
from &#8220;buy&#8221; even as he raised his earnings estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Particularly Disappointing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Particularly disappointing were the advisory results,&#8221;
Bove wrote in a note to investors, referring to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
revenue from providing takeover advice. &#8220;Investment management
activity was weak.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s overall net revenue fell 7 percent to $11.9
billion, the company said. Compared with last year&#8217;s fourth
quarter, revenue increased 38 percent. Annualized return on
average common shareholders&#8217; equity, a measure of how well the
firm reinvests earnings, decreased to 12.2 percent from 20.1
percent in the first quarter of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies
and commodities, the firm&#8217;s biggest source of revenue, dropped
28 percent to $4.33 billion from $6.02 billion a year earlier,
and more than doubled from $1.64 billion in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Looking ahead, we continue to see encouraging indications
for economic activity globally,&#8221; Blankfein said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, reported last week that its fixed-income trading revenue
fell 4 percent to $5.24 billion from a year earlier, and was up
82 percent from the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities-trading revenue at Goldman Sachs fell 7 percent to
$2.32 billion from $2.49 billion a year earlier and was up from
$2 billion in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from investing and lending, the firm&#8217;s second-
biggest segment after trading last year, climbed 37 percent to
$2.71 billion from $1.97 billion a year earlier and compared
with $1.99 billion in the fourth quarter. The business includes
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s holding in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (1398)
Ltd. as well as stakes in companies and other assets held by
units like the Special Situations Group or Principal Investment
Area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer,
told analysts on a conference call that about 20 percent to 25
percent of the investing and lending segment&#8217;s revenue is from
interest on loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So that is going to be recurring, but that&#8217;s a small part
of it,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading, Investing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the better-than-expected trading and investing
lines, Goldman Sachs wouldn&#8217;t have been able to exceed
estimates, said Benjamin Wallace, analyst at Grimes  Co. in
Westborough, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The beat that was delivered was from things people look
at as less predictable,&#8221; said Wallace, whose firm manages about
$1 billion and doesn&#8217;t own Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;It goes back
to the grand point that Goldman still relies on its trading
operations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation and benefits, the company&#8217;s largest expense,
fell 5 percent to $5.23 billion from $5.49 billion a year
earlier and accounted for 44 percent of revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-compensation expenses rose 23 percent to $2.62 billion,
driven in part by an impairment charge of about $220 million on
assets held for sale, the firm said. The primary cost related to
the firm&#8217;s Litton Loan Servicing LP unit, a residential
mortgage-servicing company that the firm has said it is trying
to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advisory Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking revenue increased 5 percent to $1.27
billion from $1.2 billion. Advisory revenue, which includes fees
for takeover advice, declined 23 percent to $357 million from
$464 million a year earlier, while fees from debt underwriting
climbed 32 percent to $486 million and equity underwriting
revenue advanced 15 percent to $426 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm ranks third this year among advisers on announced
mergers, down from the top spot at the same point last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
advisory revenue fell short of JPMorgan&#8217;s $429 million in the
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs tops underwriters of equity and equity-linked
offerings globally so far this year and is fifth among managers
of high-yield debt sales worldwide, up from seventh at the same
point last year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlog Grows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s backlog of investment-banking transactions
increased compared with the end of 2010, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from investment management rose 16 percent to $1.27
billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier. Assets under
management were unchanged at $840 billion as clients withdrew
$12 billion from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s funds and market gains
increased the value of the assets by an identical amount, the
firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be a business where they don&#8217;t have the
kind of competitive advantage that they do in the others,&#8221; said
David Trone, head of U.S. banks and brokerage research for JMP
Securities LLC in New York, who recommends buying Goldman Sachs
shares. &#8220;You&#8217;re as good as your last performance, not your
brand name.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline strengthened after
Exxon Mobil Corp. had an upset associated with a fluid catalytic
cracker at its Joliet refinery in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit tripped yesterday because of a mechanical failure,
according to a filing with the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was the FCC that was involved in the operational
upset,&#8221; said Kevin Allexon, an Exxon spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 1.5 cents to 3.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:50 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
1.39 cents to $3.1864 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) reported a unit upset yesterday at its
Robinson refinery in Illinois, according to a filing with state
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Midwest, or Group
3, narrowed its discount 0.63 cent to 9 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 1 cent to 13.5 cents a gallon. Prompt
delivery fell 3.33 cents to $3.0945 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reported that a
fluid catalytic cracker at its Joliet refinery in Illinois had
an upset yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mechanical failure caused the unit to trip, according to
a filing with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Workers
were investigating what caused the incident at the time of the
filing, late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Allexon, an Exxon spokesman, said in an e-mail that
in a filing to the National Response Center the company
identified the unit as a fluid catalytic cracker and that the
unit was involved in an operational upset. &#8220;There is no impact
on production,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 248,000-barrel-a-day refinery processes Canadian crude
delivered by pipeline by Enbridge Energy Partners LP. The
refinery produces gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and
asphalt among other products, according to Exxon Mobil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and
Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. (ENDP) will have to train doctors
before they can give patients extended-release painkillers under
a U.S. plan aimed at reducing prescription drug abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen companies that make 25 pain patches and pills must
create a program to teach medical professionals when these drugs
should be used to combat pain and how to recognize signs that
the treatments are being misused, the Food and Drug
Administration said today. The Obama administration is urging
Congress to mandate the training as part of licensing required
by the Drug Enforcement Administration every three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA began discussing in February 2009 how best to
prevent deaths and side effects from overdose or tampering of
long-acting painkillers to get high. While the agency has
stopped short of restricting drug distribution, tougher controls
may follow if abuse isn&#8217;t curbed, said Janet Woodcock, director
of the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an epidemic of prescription drug abuse that is
beginning to rival that of illegal drug abuse,&#8221; Woodcock said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s either the kids who get it out
of their medicine cabinet or someone who gets multiple
prescriptions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicines cited by the FDA include New York-based
Pfizer&#8217;s Avinza and Embeda morphine capsules; Duragesic, a
fentanyl patch made by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ and
generic competitors; Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania-based Endo&#8217;s
Opana oxymorphone tablets; and OxyContin, an oxycodone tablet
made by closely held Purdue Pharma LP of Stamford, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-Dose Painkillers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs are sustained-release, high-dose painkillers
derived from the opium poppy, also known as opioids. Doctors
considered these medicines to be a major breakthrough for cancer
and chronic pain when they were introduced in the mid-1990s,
though it became clear the drugs were easy to manipulate. Purdue
agreed in 2007 to pay $634.5 million to settle claims that
promotions for OxyContin from 1996 to 2001 misled doctors about
the drug&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk-minimization program is the largest ever imposed
by FDA, Woodcock said. The agency gained the authority to
require these types of plans as a condition for marketing under
2007 legislation. An estimated 23 million prescriptions for
extended-release opioid drugs are written annually, representing
about one-tenth of prescription painkillers, according to the
FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s King Pharma division, acquired last month, has
been developing drugs with physical and chemical properties to
resist tampering. Embeda, the first of these medicines, is
included in the training program because it hasn&#8217;t been proven
to be safer than the older medicines, Woodcock said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, set aside $5.23 billion to
pay employee salaries, bonuses and benefits in the first
quarter, down 5 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compensation and benefits expense, the firm&#8217;s biggest
cost, is enough to pay each employee $147,825 for the quarter,
down 11 percent from $165,952 a year earlier, New York-based
Goldman Sachs said today in a statement. The bank employed
35,400 people at the end of March, up 7 percent from a year
earlier even after the firm cut 300 jobs in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has reduced pay since 2007, when Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein was awarded a record
$67.9 million bonus and the firm&#8217;s average compensation per
employee was $661,490. Last year average pay per employee
dropped 14 percent to $430,700 as the firm set aside 39 percent
of revenue for compensation. The ratio of compensation to
revenue was 44 percent in the first quarter, up from 43 percent
a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, set aside $3.29 billion in the quarter to compensate
employees at its investment bank, or an average $124,300 per
person, according to the New York-based bank&#8217;s earnings report
last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank, posted a 21 percent drop in first-
quarter profit, a smaller decline than analysts estimated, as
fixed-income trading revenue more than doubled from a weak
fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $2.74 billion from $3.46 billion a year
earlier, the New York-based firm said today in a statement.
Earnings per share, which includes the cost of preferred
dividend payments to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
dropped to $1.56 from $5.59. The average estimate of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for 81 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, Goldman Sachs has relied on fixed-income,
currencies and commodities trading for the biggest piece of its
revenue. After reaching a record in 2009, earnings failed to
attain their year-earlier mark in the last four quarters as
competition and regulation increased. Wall Street&#8217;s fixed-income
trading revenue in the fourth quarter dropped to the lowest
level since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Trading was good this quarter, not bad,&#8221; Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. who recommends buying
Goldman Sachs shares, said before the earnings were reported.
&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of concern in the marketplace about whether
what we saw in the fourth quarter was an early warning of a
continuing slowdown in fixed income.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose to $155.80 at 8:15 a.m. in New York
trading, from $153.78 at the close yesterday. The stock has
performed worse this year than rivals including New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) and Zurich-based Credit
Suisse Group AG. (CSGN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net revenue fell 7 percent to $11.9 billion, the statement
showed. Compared with last year&#8217;s fourth quarter, revenue
increased 38 percent. Annualized return on average common
shareholders&#8217; equity, a measure of how well the firm reinvests
earnings, decreased to 12.2 percent from 20.1 percent in the
first quarter of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies
and commodities dropped 28 percent to $4.33 billion from $6.02
billion a year earlier, and jumped 164 percent from $1.64
billion in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Looking ahead, we continue to see encouraging indications
for economic activity globally,&#8221; Blankfein said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported
last week that its fixed-income trading revenue fell 4 percent
to $5.24 billion from a year earlier, and was up 82 percent from
the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities-trading revenue at Goldman Sachs fell 7 percent to
$2.32 billion from $2.49 billion a year earlier and was up from
$2 billion in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from investing and lending, the firm&#8217;s second-
biggest segment after trading last year, climbed 37 percent to
$2.71 billion from $1.97 billion a year earlier and compared
with $1.99 billion in the fourth quarter. Investing and lending
includes Goldman Sachs&#8217;s holding in Industrial  Commercial Bank
of China (1398) Ltd. as well as stakes in companies and other assets
held by units like the Special Situations Group or Principal
Investment Area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation and benefits, the company&#8217;s largest expense,
fell 5 percent to $5.23 billion from $5.49 billion a year
earlier and accounted for 44 percent of revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litton Business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-compensation expenses rose 23 percent to $2.62 billion,
driven in part by an impairment charge of about $220 million on
assets held for sale, the firm said. The primary cost related to
the firm&#8217;s Litton Loan Servicing LP unit, a residential
mortgage-servicing company that the firm has said it is trying
to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking revenue increased 5 percent to
$1.27 billion from $1.2 billion. Advisory revenue, which
includes fees for takeover advice, declined 23 percent to $357
million from $464 million a year earlier, while fees from debt

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s backlog of investment-banking transactions
increased compared with the end of 2010, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from investment management rose 16 percent to $1.27
billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier. Assets under
management were unchanged at $840 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who is approaching his fifth anniversary as
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and CEO, is grappling with new capital
requirements drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision along with limits on the firm&#8217;s proprietary trading
and investments in hedge funds and private-equity funds imposed
by the U.S.&#8217;s Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing on March 1, Goldman Sachs estimated its
&#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses from legal claims could reach
$3.4 billion as the firm faces suits related to its activities
before, during and after the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Senator Carl M. Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
leads the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, issued a
report based on two years of investigation into the financial
crisis and accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients and
Congress. Goldman Sachs has denied that it misled anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to supply
films online to U.K. customers of Lovefilm, the Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).-
owned company that operates a subscription-based movie-rental
service in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovefilm will add more than 50 Disney titles including
&#8220;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&#8221; and &#8220;Dead Poets Society&#8221; to
movies it offers online to U.K. subscribers paying 5.99 pounds
($9.74) and up per month, according to a statement today. The
company, which claims 1.6 million customers, also offers DVDs by
mail, like Netflix Inc. (NFLX) in the U.S., as well as video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Disney agreement also provides Lovefilm with newer
movies like &#8220;Tron: Legacy&#8221; to offer for a pay-per-view fee,
the company said. Seattle-based Amazon, which acquired Lovefilm
in January, started a  U.S. service to compete with Netflix in
February with 5,000 movies and TV shows. The subscription
service is an add-on to Amazon Instant Video, which offers more
than 90,000 movies and TV shows to buy or rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovefilm&#8217;s U.K. subscribers pay as much as 19.39 pounds a
month for unlimited mail and streaming viewing of films, TV
shows and games. The company also operates in Germany, Sweden,
Denmark and Norway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, the world&#8217;s largest online retailer, fell $1.67 to
$178.34 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares
have lost less than 1 percent this year. Disney, based in
Burbank, California, declined 32 cents to $41.20 on the New York
Stock Exchange and has added 9.8 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Turner, chief operating
officer of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), comments on the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker&#8217;s business performance in Japan and other markets
and its plans to invest in cloud computing. Turner spoke to
reporters in Singapore today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On business performance: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our business in Japan has been really strong. We&#8217;re
certainly working through the national disaster that they&#8217;re
dealing with in their economy. We don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to
happen there. But certainly, we&#8217;ve had a very good and a very
healthy business for a very long time and certainly year to
date, it&#8217;s been very strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;If you look across markets like Singapore, our business
is growing extremely well and very rapidly. The beautiful thing
about the global economy is that there&#8217;re always some strong
markets and always some markets that are going through
opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Our developed markets have been really, really strong all
out as a company. In emerging markets, it&#8217;s really relative to
what&#8217;s going on in the various environments, some are really off
the charts and some are going through an opportunity to
correct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On cloud technology, or computing delivered over the Internet: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Office 365 is a game changer for our customers. Our plan

&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC) and International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) issued sales and profit forecasts that
reflected demand from companies eager to upgrade computer
systems left fallow during the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the largest computer-services provider, boosted its
full-year profit forecast, while Intel, the top chipmaker,
forecast second-quarter sales higher than analysts predicted.
VMware Inc. (VMW), EMC Corp. and Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR), three other
business-technology providers, also met or topped analysts&#8217;
projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spate of results suggests that after the recession
ended in 2009 a rebound in demand may be gathering steam.
Companies are outfitting data centers capable of delivering
storage, software and other computing tasks over the Internet.
The global market for such cloud-related services may more than
double to $148.8 billion in 2014 from $58.6 billion in 2009,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The product replacement cycle is finally occurring after
the downturn of 2008,&#8221; said Michael Yoshikami, chief investment
strategist for YCMNet Advisors in Walnut Creek, California.
&#8220;The earnings in all of these companies reflect the fact that
businesses are spending again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies curtailed computer and software spending during
the recession, which stretched from December 2007 to June 2009.
The belt-tightening crimped sales at Intel, Microsoft Corp. and
other technology bellwethers and sent the Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)
to a more than six-year low in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel&#8217;s Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel&#8217;s current-quarter revenue will be $12.8 billion, plus
or minus $500 million, the company said yesterday. That compares
with $11.9 billion, the average of analysts&#8217; projections
compiled by Bloomberg. IBM&#8217;s operating earnings will be at least
$13.15 a share this year, higher than a previous projection of
at least $13 and the $13.08 average estimate of analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, is benefiting as
mobile devices including Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad drive demand for
online services provided by Intel-powered servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income rose 29 percent to $3.16 billion,
or 56 cents a share, from $2.44 billion, or 43 cents, a year
earlier, Intel said. Analysts had estimated profit of 46 cents.
Sales increased 25 percent to $12.8 billion, compared with an
average prediction of $11.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel rose $1.55, or 7.8 percent, to $21.41 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. IBM fell 65 cents to
$164.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s sales last quarter climbed 7.7 percent to $24.6
billion, topping projections, as software, hardware and services
revenue jumped. Equipment sales climbed for the fifth straight
quarter as customers continued to upgrade after IBM released its
Power7 server-computer system and a new mainframe last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware, the biggest maker of programs that let computers
run multiple operating systems, reported profit excluding
certain costs of 48 cents a share. That exceeded the 42-cent
average of projections compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 33
percent to $843.7 million, the Palo Alto, California-based
company said. Analysts on average estimated $814.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers are snapping up VMware products that help make
their servers -- computers used to run websites and networks --
into multitasking machines that can operate several different
applications. Its gains also reflect an expansion into new
businesses, including storage and desktop software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware, EMC, Juniper &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They released 18 new products last year, and here we are
almost six months later,&#8221; Robert Breza, an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets in Minneapolis, said in an interview. &#8220;You&#8217;re
starting to see the new products penetrate the customer base.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of storage computers and the
majority owner of VMware, posted per-share profit, excluding
some costs, of 31 cents, meeting analysts&#8217; average estimate.
Sales jumped 18 percent to $4.61 billion, topping estimates, as
companies upgrade their storage systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC, based in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, climbed $1.24 to
$27.96. VMware rose $11.93, or 14 percent, to $97.90. VMware
shares had fallen 3.3 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology stocks rallied as the reports spurred optimism
for other companies&#8217; earnings prospects. Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)
climbed $11.55, or 8.9 percent, to $142.08. The Nasdaq Composite
Index posted its biggest gain since October, rising 2.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juniper, the No. 2 maker of Internet-networking equipment,
reported first-quarter profit that matched analysts&#8217; estimates.
The results were buoyed as Internet and telecommunications
service providers purchase gear to handle the flood of data on
smartphones and computers running bandwidth-hungry videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juniper rose 79 cents to $39.26. The shares of the
Sunnyvale, California-based company have climbed 6.3 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s antitrust regulator
cleared Novell Inc. (NOVL)&#8217;s sale of 882 software patents to a group
including Microsoft Inc., Oracle Inc., Apple Inc. (AAPL) and EMC Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bonn-based Federal Cartel Office cleared the deal after
the companies agreed to accommodate antitrust concerns raised by
the German regulator and the U.S. Department of Justice, the
office said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent sale was linked to the acquisition of Novell by
Attachmate Corp. The sales agreement was cleared only after the
companies retracted their original plan and refiled it with new
terms, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the revised terms Microsoft will sell Seattle-based
Attachmate its share in the patents. EMC agreed not to acquire
Novell patents and patent applications related to virtualization
software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in Germany and the U.S. had concerns because the
original deal could have threatened smaller competitors, the
office said. Changes in the sale terms were necessary to protect
competition and innovation in the open-source software
community, the Justice Department said it a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of four deaths during a trial
of Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s experimental rheumatoid arthritis pill can be
linked to the drug, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based drugmaker&#8217;s shares fell the most since
August after a study summary published online showed four deaths
and four infections among patients taking tofacitinib. There
were no serious adverse events in the group given a placebo,
according to the abstract of the study being presented at the
European League Against Rheumatism meeting in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a big overreaction,&#8221; said David Maris, an analyst
with CLSA in New York, in a telephone interview today. Investors
&#8220;saw four deaths and flipped out, and as they start to digest
this a little more they&#8217;ll realize it doesn&#8217;t appear to be as
bad as people thought.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the four deaths was from respiratory failure related
to tofacitinib, Pfizer said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 60 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $19.79 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the
biggest decline since August 11. Abbott Laboratories, whose
Humira injectable drug would face competition from Pfizer&#8217;s
pill, rose $1, or 2 percent, to $51.80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biotech Rivals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, is competing with
biotechnology companies to develop the first pill in a decade
for rheumatoid arthritis, which destroys joints in 1.3 million
Americans. By 2015, Pfizer&#8217;s drug was expected to reach $1.18
billion in annual sales, the average estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are no serious events in the control arm, and then
you have a bunch of adverse events; people are going to question
the safety of the drug,&#8221; said Les Funtleyder, a New York-based
fund manager at Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Really we need to get more data. It may
not be statistically significant. But that may not even matter
because people are so sensitive about safety concerns these
days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study followed 792 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
who failed to improve after taking other treatments. The other
deaths involved a case of brain injury after trauma, a case of
worsening rheumatoid arthritis after discontinuing the drug and
a case of acute heart failure, Pfizer said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug is the most advanced pill in a family of
experimental treatments targeting a protein called JAK that
leads to joint destruction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), one of the
lenders criticized over improper foreclosures on military
families&#8217; homes, agreed to pay $56 million to settle claims it
overcharged service members on their mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $27 million in cash to about 6,000
active-duty military personnel who were overcharged on their
mortgages, cut interest rates on soldiers&#8217; home loans and return
homes that were wrongfully foreclosed upon, according to
settlement terms filed in federal court in Beaufort, South
Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan officials said three months ago that one of the
bank&#8217;s units had made errors in the handling of mortgages
covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. That law was
enacted in 1942 to shield deployed military personnel from
financial stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are sorry and regret the mistakes our firm made on
mortgages for members of the military,&#8221; Frank Bisignano, a
JPMorgan official appointed to oversee the company&#8217;s home-
lending unit in February, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
hold ourselves accountable and responsible for these mistakes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, JPMorgan officials said they returned 10 homes
to families protected by the law that were found to have been
taken improperly in foreclosure actions. The servicemembers law
requires enhanced reviews of soldiers&#8217; mortgages and payment
histories before such actions are undertaken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan officials said at the time that its mortgage unit
didn&#8217;t provide the required review to a total of 18 military
families whose homes were foreclosed upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Painful Aberration&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This company has a great history of honoring military and
veterans, and the mistakes we made on military foreclosures are
a painful aberration on that track record,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said in a February statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said in January it would pay about $2 million to
about 4,500 service members after discovering they&#8217;d been
overcharged on their JPMorgan mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The servicemembers law allows soldiers to demand mortgage
interest rates be set at 6 percent while on active-duty status.
The law applies to current loans and those taken out by troops
prior to being deployed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan executives discovered the errors after Marine
Captain Jonathon Rowles, a fighter pilot, sued the bank in
federal court in South Carolina last year over the mortgage
unit&#8217;s handling of his $255,000 loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-Rate Reduction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowles contends Chase Home Finance LLC officials originally
failed to heed his interest-rate reduction request, according to
court filings. After agreeing to comply with the law, the lender
required him to reapply for the protections four times in a
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also failed to credit Rowles&#8217; payments based on
the mandated 6 percent interest rate and began a round of
&#8220;aggressive collection methods for what it characterized as a
past-due balance&#8221; on the account, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank threatened to report Rowles to credit bureaus and
start foreclosure proceedings against his home, the captain said
in his lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the settlement, Rowles and an estimated
6,000 other service personnel whose mortgage accounts were
mishandled will split $27 million in cash, according to court
filings. That will provide an average payout of $4,500 per
soldier. Recoveries in the cases will vary based on service
member&#8217;s individual damage claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowles, now stationed in South Korea, will become &#8220;an
informal advisor&#8221; to a veterans advisory council JPMorgan has
created, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-Rate Cut &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord also calls for JPMorgan to cut interest rates on
all mortgages held by deployed troops to 4 percent for one year,
the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender has agreed to return houses that have been
improperly foreclosed upon and not yet sold and to pay fair
market value for those already auctioned off, according to the
filing. It also will forgive any remaining mortgage debt of
military borrowers who were protected by the law and mistakenly
foreclosed upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan officials said in today&#8217;s statement they&#8217;ve
already made $6 million in payments to military borrowers who
were overcharged. Under the settlement, the bank also will
provide an estimated $6.4 million in additional benefits to
soldiers who may have been subjected to &#8220;wrongful foreclosure
practices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the company will pay $8 million in legal fees for
Rowles and other affected military personal who sued over the
mishandled mortgages, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Must Approve &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Margaret B. Seymour still must approve
the class-action settlement before it becomes final.
&#8220;We are very satisfied with this negotiated settled as are our
clients,&#8221; Richard Harpootlian, a Columbia, South Carolina-based
lawyer representing soldiers who sued the bank over the mortgage
miscues, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation
of lenders&#8217; handling of service members&#8217; mortgages in the wake
of disclosures about mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units of Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest U.S. bank by
assets, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) are being probed over alleged
violations of the servicemembers law, Justice Department
officials said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Michigan judge found in 2009 that Saxon Mortgage, the
Morgan Stanley unit, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas
violated the servicemembers law by foreclosing on a U.S. Army
sergeant&#8217;s home in Michigan. The case later settled and terms of
the accord weren&#8217;t made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina case is Rowles v. Chase Home Finance
LLC, 10-1756-MBS, U.S. District Court, District of South
Carolina (Beaufort Division). &lt;/p&gt;

the group receiving the drug, tofacitinib, while there were no
serious adverse events in the group given a placebo, according
to the abstract of the study being presented at the European
League Against Rheumatism meeting in London. Victoria Davis, a
spokeswoman for Pfizer, declined to immediately comment. It
wasn&#8217;t clear whether the deaths were related to taking the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The abstract notes that one of the deaths was due to
acute heart failure at the 10mg dose,&#8221; Larry Biegelsen, an
analyst with Wells Fargo Securities LLC in New York, wrote in a
research note today. &#8220;This would make the fourth known case of
heart failure with 10mg of tofacitinib.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 60 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $19.79 at 4

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said that cash will
play a larger role in employee compensation amid stiffening
competition for valuable workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For all employees, we will shift a portion of stock award
targets into base salary, providing more cash up front,&#8221; Steve Ballmer, Chief Executive Officer of Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, wrote today in a memo, which was obtained by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said he&#8217;s making the shift to improve how the
world&#8217;s biggest software maker rewards staff. As economic growth
rebounds, technology companies are adding employees, touching
off a tussle for engineers and computer scientists among such
companies as Microsoft, Google Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. More cash
may be a more alluring reward than Microsoft&#8217;s shares, which are
lower now than they were a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The newer companies may be more attractive, because of
thinking there might be better stock options with them,&#8221; Denise
Lidell, CEO of High-Tech Professionals, a technology recruiter
based in San Diego, whose clients have included Intel Corp. (INTC) and
Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are courting prospective employees with
everything from coffee with the CEO to piles of cash. The
competition for talent is especially fierce among social media
and other Internet companies as well as computer systems
manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus, Stock Awards &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said Microsoft also will increase funding for bonus
and stock awards so that it can give full awards to 80 percent
of eligible employees, compared with about 50 percent in
previous years. The company will increase compensation for
workers involved in certain geographies and other business
areas, such as research and development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through our history, we have been the place people came
when they wanted to make a difference in the world through
software, hardware and services,&#8221; Ballmer wrote. &#8220;The changes
we&#8217;re rolling out today will help ensure Microsoft continues to
be the place that top talent comes to change the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sina Corp., which owns the Twitter-
like Weibo service in China, fell the most in a month after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the company&#8217;s shares to
&#8220;sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares slid 4.9 percent to $135.86 at 11:45 a.m. in New
York trading, after losing as much as 8.6 percent earlier, the
biggest intraday decline since March 15. Goldman analysts led by
Catherine Leung cut the company&#8217;s rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; in a
research note today, saying the share price fully reflects the
company&#8217;s value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sina, also the owner of China&#8217;s third-most visited website,
had more than doubled this year through yesterday on
&#8220;expectations that Weibo will evolve from a social media into a
fully fledged social network,&#8221; the Goldman report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares &#8220;have already more than fairly reflected the
potential&#8221; for Sina to evolve, the report said. &#8220;With tougher

&lt;p&gt;The impact of a Greek debt
restructuring on non-Greek European banks would be &#8220;milder&#8221;
now than a year ago thanks to European Central Bank loans,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A so-called haircut of 20 percent to 60 percent on Greek
government bonds corresponds to losses of between 13 billion
euros ($19 billion) and 41 billion euros for European banks,
Goldman Sachs banking analysts led by London-based Jernej Omahen
said in a research note today. That represents 1 percent to 3
percent of their aggregate Tier 1 capital, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the context of the sector aggregate, this is small,&#8221;
the analysts said. &#8220;By extending 91 billion euros of
refinancing facilities to Greek banks (and a further 153 billion
euros to Portuguese and Irish banks), the ECB has effectively
dis-intermediated the &#8216;core&#8217; banks from the periphery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a consequence, the knock-on effects of a restructuring
would be milder for European banks today than, say, just last
year,&#8221; the analysts added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek bonds have slumped the past week, with two-year
yields exceeding a record 22 percent, reflecting mounting
investor expectations that Greece will renege on its debts. The
government in Athens has ruled out a restructuring, saying it
would devastate domestic banks and hammer the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek debt holders who accept that a restructuring is
inevitable should push for it to be executed as soon as
possible, Citigroup Inc. analysts said in a separate note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Accelerate the Event&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once debt holders fully realize that Greece cannot escape
a haircut, they should accelerate &#8216;the event&#8217; as soon as
possible,&#8221; Citigroup analysts led by Stefan Nedialkov said in
the note. &#8220;Leaving the haircut for the future means a larger
haircut for the same reduction&#8221; in indebtedness, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in Belgium, France and Germany are the most exposed
to Greece apart from Greek banks, Citibank said. The Association
of German Public Sector Banks and Munich Re, the world&#8217;s biggest
reinsurer, both said this week that they could handle a Greek
debt restructuring. French banks could withstand a default by a
euro-area nation, Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer also
said this week. German insurers would overall be able to handle
a haircut, Handelsblatt reported today, citing figures from
Germany&#8217;s Finance Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek Recapitalizing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as 80 percent of Tier 1 capital at Greek banks
would be wiped out if there was a 60 percent haircut, the
Goldman analysts said. They would need &#8220;pre-emptive&#8221; capital
injections to avoid contagion, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Greek banks would realistically require substantial
additional capital to cover for incremental losses from a
theoretical restructuring,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;In our view
pre-emptive provision of incremental capital would be required
to stem potential second round effects, most notably loss of
creditor confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks were downgraded to
&#8220;equal-weight&#8221; at Morgan Stanley and &#8220;underweight&#8221; at JPMorgan
Chase  Co. on interest-rate increases and earnings. Morgan
Stanley upgraded Colombian equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s &#8220;earnings revisions&#8221; and earnings growth have
fallen relative to other markets, Jonathan Garner, Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s chief Asia and emerging-markets strategist in Hong
Kong, and analysts wrote in a research note. The U.S. bank
previously had an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downgrade at JPMorgan was by Adrian Mowat, the bank's 
Hong Kong-based chief Asia and emerging-markets strategist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetary tightening and uncertainties about Brazil&#8217;s
economic policy are among the factors weighing on economic
growth and earnings, Emy Shayo, a Sao Paulo-based Brazil equity
strategist for JPMorgan, wrote in a report dated April 20. The
country&#8217;s gross domestic product grew 7.5 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank raised the benchmark interest rate a
quarter point to 12 percent yesterday. The rate was 8.75 percent
at the start of 2010. Consumer growth will be hurt by higher
credit costs, according to the JPMorgan note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings growth expectations are low (below 10 percent)
for 2011, in line with nominal GDP,&#8221; Shayo wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised Colombian equities to &#8220;equal-
weight&#8221; from &#8220;underweight.&#8221; The country&#8217;s stocks will benefit
from &#8220;consistent positive earnings revision,&#8221; &#8220;supportive&#8221;
global conditions and &#8220;strong&#8221; domestic demand, according to
Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
will buy back at a premium warrants that were suspended from
trading in Hong Kong because of a misprinted settlement formula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is offering 110 percent of the
higher of either the total net purchase price paid or the total
buyback value, according to a statement filed to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today. It will also pay investors agreeing to the
repurchase a one-off fixed administrative fee of HK$5,000
($643.5) each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyback value has been calculated using the highest
level of the index on each trading day during the March 30 to
April 21 period for the call warrants, and the lowest level for
the put warrants, the statement said. The bank also took into
account swings in the index level and the passage of time, it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculation method is to ensure existing investors
&#8220;get the benefit but not the downside of any market movements
in the index during the relevant period,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said on April 7 that it&#8217;s in talks with
regulators about warrants linked to the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
that were suspended from trading in Hong Kong on March 31.
Trading in the warrants will be halted until further notice,
Goldman Sachs said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula for the cash settlement amount per board lot
for European-style put and call warrants due Sept. 9 and Dec. 9
was wrong in the listing and announcement documents, Goldman
Sachs said on March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Responsibility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the original document, the formula for
calculating the cash settlement included multiplying by the
exchange rate. In the amendment, the formula is calculated by
dividing by the exchange rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four warrants at least doubled on the exchange on March
31 before being suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges  Clearing Ltd. Chief Executive Charles
Li said he hopes that the group that amended the warrant
contracts will take responsibility for compensating investors,
the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today it will issue new warrants with
the same key economic terms to investors who wish to retain such
investments. The buyback value of the existing warrants will be
39 percent to 106 percent higher than the issue price of the new
warrants, the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 9 p.m. yesterday, race-
car driver E.J. Viso popped into a midnight-blue 2011 Lotus
Evora IPS, revved up the engine, and steered the car past
several hundred guests seated for dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow ride made for an exciting moment at the New York
International Auto Show gala preview, a fundraiser for East Side
House Settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viso parked near gala co-chairman Christopher LaSusa,
portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors LLC, and the podium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, Christie&#8217;s International auctioneer Lydia Fenet
auctioned the car, for $80,000, to Jamie Brown, president of
investment bank Canaccord Genuity Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I bought it for the charity, and I&#8217;m looking forward to
driving it,&#8221; Brown said in an interview after, standing with
co-workers next to his firm&#8217;s two tables. &#8220;This is a terrific
event.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More money was raised when Steven Cho, a partner at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), and chairman of the East Side House Settlement
scholarship committee, talked about the income gap between those
with college educations and those without. His words spurred
more than 30 guests to make $1,000 donations, for which they
received Lotus baseball caps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The East Side House Settlement gala preview is an annual
event that gives guests the chance to roam the show early,
cocktail in hand. Dinner tickets for this year&#8217;s event were
$1,000 and cocktail tickets were $200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Sponsor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lotus signed on as a sponsor of the gala as part of its
effort to break into the American market. The European carmaker
produces 2,500 cars annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have an ambition to actually deliver to American
customers something like 500 units,&#8221; said Lotus&#8217;s director of
sales, Guillaume Chabin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Evora model retails for $64,000 to $75,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A Lotus is all about driving, handling, cornering, having
this direct relationship between the road and yourself,&#8221; Chabin
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the closest you can get to a racing experience
with a standard road car.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York International Auto Show opens to the public
today and runs through Sunday, May 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest publicly traded oil company, plans to halt its Sriracha
refinery in Thailand as it modifies units to reduce sulfur in
fuels, according to two people with knowledge of the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shutdown will start in September and last about five
weeks, the people said, declining to be identified because the
information hasn&#8217;t been made public. Kevin Allexon, a Fairfax,
Virginia-based Exxon spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shutdown will enable work to be completed and enable
Exxon to produce low-sulfur fuels before Thailand&#8217;s switch to
Euro-4 standards next year, which will limit allowable sulfur
content in gasoline and diesel to 50 parts per million or less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said on July 29 that it began work on a clean-fuels
project at the plant, with commissioning expected by the end of
2011. The company said on July 16 it would modify existing
hydrotreating units to cut sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel
to 50 parts per million and build a facility to reduce benzene
in gasoline to 1 percent to meet stricter fuel specifications
that will take effect on Jan. 1, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, which the company estimates will cost $394
million, is progressing as planned, Kitiyavadee Nilavan, an
Exxon communications manager in Bangkok, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Sriracha refinery has the capacity to process
170,000 barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It uses crude oil from the Middle East, Far East Asia
and West Africa, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing Sulfur &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is building a diesel hydrotreater at its Singapore
refining complex, which will boost production of ultra-low-
sulfur diesel, according to a statement in November. The company
also has inaugurated a hydrotreater at its refinery in Antwerp,
Belgium, with annual output equivalent to the yearly consumption
of 2 million diesel-powered cars. The unit has been operating
since the end of January, Johan Scharpe, a company spokesman in
Antwerp, said on April 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrotreaters remove sulfur from fuels allowing them to
burn more cleanly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd.,
India&#8217;s second-largest drugmaker, will be allowed to sell a
generic version of Wyeth&#8217;s antidepressant drug starting June 1
following an agreement with the unit of Pfizer Inc. (PFE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokesman Christopher Loder, who confirmed the
agreement in an e-mail yesterday, declined to disclose financial
terms of the deal. Wyeth, a unit of the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, and Dr. Reddy&#8217;s reached a settlement to sell the drug
Effexor XR in the New Jersey Federal Court, Press Trust of India
reported on April 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer last year sold $1.7 billion of Effexor, which was
Wyeth&#8217;s best-selling antidepressant drug until 2008, before
cheaper generic version were released. The company has
previously settled patent-infringement suits regarding Effexor
it filed against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and Anchen
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Impax Laboratories Inc. (IPXL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reddy&#8217;s fell 1.2 percent to 1,656.8 rupees in Mumbai on
April 21. The shares have declined 0.4 percent this year
compared with a 1.6 percent advance in the MSCI AC Asia Pacific
excluding Japan Health Care Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wockhardt Ltd. (WPL) will also start sales of generic version of
the drug from June 1 after getting approval from the U.S. Food 
Drug Administration, the Mumbai-based company said in a
statement on April 19. Pfizer lost exclusivity for Effexor in
July 2010, the company said in its 2010 annual report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and other
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) creditors, including Morgan
Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), filed a liquidation plan for
the defunct company that would give their group more money than
two other proposals for allotting $61 billion among creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rival plan, filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan, is the second that Lehman Chief Executive Officer
Bryan Marsal must contend with as he tries to end the 2 1/2-
year-old bankruptcy case. The group, which includes Silver Point
Capital LP and banks with derivatives claims on Lehman, filed
its plan about four months after bondholders including Paulson 
Co. and the California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System
submitted a competing proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Goldman Sachs group&#8217;s plan, derivatives creditors
of Lehman&#8217;s special financing unit would get 26 cents on the
dollar, up from 22.3 cents in Lehman&#8217;s proposal. They would
boost their payout by another 15 cents after claiming more money
under a guarantee from the Lehman parent. The losers would be
senior bondholders, who would get 21.4 cents from Lehman and 16
cents from the group including Goldman Sachs, which is the
fourth-largest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan &#8220;fully respects the best view of the legal rights
and obligations of all entities and constituencies,&#8221; the group
said in the filing. It &#8220;also provides the only practical path
toward confirmation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bondholder &#8216;Windfall&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s plan would give bondholders more than they&#8217;re
entitled to, the group said. &#8220;This windfall is unprincipled,&#8221;
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Kamensky, a senior vice president at Paulson, a New
York-based hedge fund, declined to comment. Kimberly Macleod, a
Lehman spokeswoman, said the company is reviewing the Goldman
Sachs group filing. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of about 19 Lehman creditors includes State
Street Bank  Trust Co., Oaktree Capital Management LP, Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs filed two claims totaling $2.5 billion
against a Lehman unit that financed derivatives transactions,
according to claims records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which collapsed in 2008 in the biggest bankruptcy
in U.S. history, faces opposition to the way it will apportion
among creditors the $61 billion it aims to raise as it
liquidates assets. It amended its plan in January, taking money
from derivatives creditors to pay bondholders more after the
group including Paulson filed a rival proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowable Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsal seeks to reduce allowable claims to $322 billion,
according to court filings. That would give the average Lehman
creditor 18.6 cents on the dollar. Lehman, once the fourth-
largest investment bank, aims to win a bankruptcy judge&#8217;s
approval for a plan in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering its plan, the Goldman-Morgan Stanley (MS) group said
Lehman was run through separate subsidiaries whose borrowing
arrangements -- including guarantees -- should be preserved in a
liquidation. The Paulson-Calpers group would treat Lehman more
like a single company, canceling parent guarantees and inter-
company debt and paying creditors more equally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the prospect of a Goldman Sachs plan last month,
John Beiers, chief deputy county counsel for San Mateo County in
California, told Bloomberg that big banks were &#8220;taking a
position that adversely impacts&#8221; bondholders such as San Mateo
County, which is owed $155 million by Lehman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama said a
Justice Department probe will examine the role of &#8220;traders and
speculators&#8221; in oil markets and how they contribute to high gas
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The attorney general&#8217;s putting together a team whose job
it us to root out any cases of fraud or manipulation in the oil
markets that might affect gas prices, and that includes the role
of traders and speculators,&#8221; Obama said April 21 in Reno,
Nevada. &#8220;We are going to make sure that no one is taking
advantage of American consumers for their own short-term gain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration on April 21 created a working group to
explore whether oil and gasoline prices are being driven higher
by illegal manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, which includes representatives of federal
agencies and state attorneys general, will check for fraud,
collusion or misrepresentation at the retail and wholesale
level, the Justice Department said in a statement last week. The

Crude oil futures have increased 22 percent and gasoline surged
34 percent this year as Middle East unrest reduced supply and
the global economic rebound bolstered fuel demand. Both futures

&lt;p&gt;Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan to Settle Lehman Brokerage Claims for $800 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreed to return $800 million in cash
and securities to settle claims against it brought by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)&#8217;s brokerage, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defunct brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc., will
distribute the money to customers, according to a filing April
21 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the main clearing bank for the Lehman
brokerage, processing billions of dollars of transactions and
lending tens of billions of dollars daily to LBI, according to
the filing. While some of the loans were secured by securities
in the brokerage&#8217;s accounts, the bank didn&#8217;t have a valid lien
on some customer property, which now is being returned, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The agreement will have no material financial impact on
JPMorgan,&#8221; the bank said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the assets were set aside to await a resolution of
claims by the trustee who is liquidating the remnants of
Lehman&#8217;s brokerage, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is
trying to get an $8.6 billion lawsuit by the Lehman parent
dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers
Inc., 08-01420, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Settles Military Mortgage Suits for $56 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), one of the lenders criticized over
improper foreclosures on military families&#8217; homes, agreed to pay
$56 million to settle claims it overcharged service members on
their mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $27 million in cash to about 6,000
active-duty military personnel who were overcharged on their
mortgages, cut interest rates on soldiers&#8217; home loans and return
homes that were wrongfully foreclosed upon as part of the
accord, according to filings in federal court in Beaufort, South
Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan officials said three months ago that one of the
bank&#8217;s units had made errors in the handling of mortgages
covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. That law was
enacted in 1942 to shield deployed military personnel from
financial stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are sorry and regret the mistakes our firm made on
mortgages for members of the military,&#8221; Frank Bisignano, a
JPMorgan official appointed to oversee the company&#8217;s home-
lending unit in February, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
hold ourselves accountable and responsible for these mistakes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Harpootlian and William Harvey, two South Carolina
lawyers who represented the soldiers who sued the bank, didn&#8217;t
return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Margaret B. Seymour still must approve

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Seeks Delay of Insider-Trading Case Against FDA Chemist &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. asked a federal judge to delay its insider-trading
case against a Food and Drug Administration chemist, claiming
the government is trying to work out a potential resolution with
the defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors, in a filing April 20 in federal court in
Greenbelt, Maryland, said the defendant, Cheng Yi Liang, agreed
to a 60-day delay of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties request additional time in order to discuss
further steps and a potential resolution of this matter,&#8221; the
government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng Yi Liang, who worked for the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research, and his son, Andrew Liang, are accused
of reaping at least $3 million from trading on nonpublic
information related to drug-approval applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liangs, who live in Gaithersburg, Maryland, were
charged last month with conspiracy, wire fraud and securities
fraud. The maximum penalty for the fraud charges is 20 years in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in a related
civil lawsuit said the elder Liang made $3.6 million by trading
shares of 19 firms before 27 FDA decisions since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An FDA employee since 1996, Liang had computer access to
nonpublic records of the review process for each drug examined
by the office, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liang traded in smaller developmental drug companies, where
a government decision would be more likely to have a significant
effect on the stock price, the SEC said. He gained more than $1
million trading stock of Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VNDA) a Rockville,
Maryland, firm that rose more than 600 percent a day after the
FDA cleared sales of its schizophrenia drug Fanapt in May 2009,
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He profited from share purchases ahead of 19 positive
announcements and on short sales before six negative decisions,
the SEC said. He also avoided losses by selling stock before two
other negative decisions, the agency said. His average profit on
each announcement was $135,015, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Carter, Liang&#8217;s lawyer, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Chen Yi Liang, 8:11-mj-01236-WGC, and
U.S. v. Andrew Liang, 8:11-mj-01237-WGC, U.S. District Court,
District of Maryland (Greenbelt). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Prosecutors Inhabit &#8216;Imaginary World,&#8217; Dowd Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyer
accused U.S. prosecutors of living in a &#8220;make-believe&#8221; and
&#8220;imaginary world&#8221; where publicly available information about
pending deals &#8220;didn&#8217;t exist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Dowd, in the second day of closing arguments at
Rajaratnam&#8217;s insider-trading trial on April 21, took jurors in
Manhattan federal court through weeks of evidence to show that
his client wasn&#8217;t guilty of conspiracy or securities fraud. His
recurring theme was that information the government claimed was
secret was actually public knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dowd said Rajaratnam traded on information about a pending
takeover of ATI Technologies Inc. by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)
because Hector Ruiz, the chief executive officer of AMD at the
time, had told Wall Street analysts about it. Prosecutors say
Rajaratnam was tipped by Anil Kumar, a former partner at
McKinsey  Co., where AMD was a client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dowd&#8217;s summation came in the seventh week of a trial that
might send Rajaratnam, 53, to prison for 20 years in the biggest
U.S. crackdown on insider trading at hedge funds. Rajaratnam is
accused of gaining $63.8 million from tips leaked by corporate
insiders and hedge-fund traders about a dozen stocks, including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Intel Corp. (INTC), Clearwire Corp. and
Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dowd said another alleged leak from Kumar, that Abu Dhabi&#8217;s
Mubadala Development Co. was investing in a 2008 spinoff of
Sunnyvale, California-based AMD, was &#8220;public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said wiretaps of conversations between Kumar
and Rajaratnam supported Kumar&#8217;s claim that he tipped Rajaratnam
about rumored job cuts at EBay Inc. Dowd said the news had been
widely reported beforehand in the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Streeter told
jurors that Rajaratnam was the manager of a multibillion-dollar
hedge fund and a graduate of a top U.S. business school, the
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. &#8220;Of course&#8221;
Rajaratnam knew it was illegal to trade on advance word of a
company&#8217;s earning, Streeter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge is likely to instruct jurors on the law today,
and jurors will then begin deliberating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is charged with five counts of conspiracy and
nine counts of securities fraud. The conspiracy counts each
carry a maximum five-year prison sentence and the fraud counts
each carry a maximum 20-year term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York Lawyer Pleads Guilty in Probe of Ex-Galleon Trader &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Brooklyn, New York, lawyer, who the U.S. said was a
member of one of three Galleon Group LLC insider-trading rings,
pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges in federal court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Goldfarb pleaded guilty April 21 to conspiracy and
securities fraud before U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan.
Goldfarb was one of 14 people arrested in November 2009 by the
FBI as part of the probe into the Galleon hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With great regret, I made a horrible mistake and agreed
to participate in this scheme,&#8221; Goldfarb told the judge at the
hearing. His lawyer, Michael Soshnick, declined to comment after
the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his plea agreement, Goldfarb won&#8217;t be prosecuted
further by the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District
of New York, except for any potential criminal tax violations,
according to a copy of the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil Fine of 12 Billion Pesos Confirmed by Agency &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency said it levied a fine of 12
billion pesos ($1 billion) against the local unit of America
Movil SAB, Latin America&#8217;s largest wireless provider, for
charging competitors too much to connect to its network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine is equal to 10 percent of the assets of America
Movil&#8217;s local unit, or the maximum allowed by law, the Federal
Competition Commission said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcel, as the unit is known, has 30 days to appeal or
present a plan to comply with the ruling, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Orders Contractors to Give Workers Injury Insurance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China ordered contractors to offer injury insurance for
workers and encouraged the companies to give workers who take
dangerous assignments accident insurance in the nation&#8217;s amended
construction law, the Xinhua News Agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Financial Regulator to Extend Short-Sale Restrictions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s financial regulator plans to continue restricting
naked short-selling and require investors to disclose short-sale
positions, it said in a statement posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official extension until Oct. 31 will be announced by
the end of this month, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s Central Bank Extends Administration of Sotskombank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s central bank said it extended its administration
of PAT KB Sotskombank for a second time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration will run through July 21, the Kiev-based
Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy said April 22 in a statement on its
website. Nataliya Khorolenko will remain as an administrator in
Rodovid, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Tells Regulators T-Mobile Deal Is a Win for Consumers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T) formally asked regulators last week to approve
its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc., saying the
transaction to form the largest U.S. mobile phone company would
benefit consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will help meet escalating demand for advanced
wireless services and consumers will suffer fewer blocked calls,
ATT said in papers filed April 21 in Washington at the Federal
Communications Commission, which will vet the transaction along
with the Justice Department in a review that could take a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase announced March 20 would combine the second-
and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers into a new market
leader, ahead of Verizon Wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger would bring less competition and higher prices,
according to critics including rival Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and
Consumers Union. Concentration has increased in the wireless
industry, with Dallas-based ATT and Verizon having 60 percent
of both subscribers and revenue, the FCC concluded last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wireless market would remain competitive after the
merger, featuring strong competitors including Sprint, Clearwire
Corp. (CLWR) and regional operators such as Cincinnati Bell Inc. (CBB), ATT
said in its filing at the FCC, which will judge if the deal is
in the public interest. The agency began accepting comments
April 14, ahead of the company&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT filed earlier at the Justice Department, where
antitrust experts will consider whether the combined company
would improperly dominate markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction needs three votes on the five-member FCC,
which has a Democratic majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Michael Copps, a Democrat, on March 31 said
the merger faces &#8220;a very steep climb&#8221; to win his approval and
Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said April 8 the FCC
needs to keep in mind the need to &#8220;encourage competition&#8221; as
it weighs mergers. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, a Democrat,
has declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) to Buy Back New Jersey Auction-Rate Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, operator of the world&#8217;s largest brokerage,
agreed to buy back $323 million of auction-rate securities from
New Jersey customers to settle state allegations that it misled
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for the securities collapsed during the
financial crisis of 2008 when banks stopped using their own cash
to support the market, leaving investors stuck with bonds they
couldn&#8217;t sell. The securities were marketed to investors as a
higher-yielding alternative to cash because, until the market
froze, they could be sold at periodic auctions run by banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have agreed to buy back securities from individual
investors to settle state and federal regulatory inquiries into
whether they misled investors about risks associated with the
investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Morgan Stanley agreed to repurchase $4.5 billion
of the securities under a settlement with state regulators. The
company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is nothing new,&#8221; Christy Pollak, a Morgan Stanley
spokeswoman, said April 21. &#8220;It&#8217;s simply New Jersey&#8217;s portion
of the settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Lamm, a spokesman for the New Jersey Attorney
General&#8217;s office, didn&#8217;t return a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC, CFTC to Consider Swap Definitions Required by Dodd-Frank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will meet this
week to consider whether to propose joint rules with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission defining swaps, security-
based swaps and security-based swap agreements as required by
the Dodd-Frank Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both agencies will consider the proposal at meetings on
April 27, according to statements posted on their websites on

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Airways Files Antitrust Suit Against Sabre Holdings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) said it filed a federal antitrust
lawsuit against airline ticket reservation service Sabre
Holdings Corp. to halt alleged anticompetitive and anticonsumer
practices and recover monetary damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabre, the parent of Travelocity.com, &#8220;engaged in a
pattern of exclusionary conduct to shut out competition, protect
its monopoly pricing power and maintain its technologically-
obsolete business model,&#8221; Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways said
April 21 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 35 percent of US Airways revenue is booked
through Sabre and affiliated travel agents, the carrier said in
a statement, or about $3.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit follows a new distribution agreement between
Sabre and US Airways reached this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry tensions boiled over on Dec. 21 when AMR Corp. (AMR)&#8217;s
American Airlines pulled fares from travel agent Orbitz.com as
the carrier focuses on a proprietary computer system to share
prices, bypassing distributors such as Sabre. American is in
talks with Sabre to settle a lawsuit the airline filed Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabre is &#8220;reviewing the details of their legal claims,&#8221;
Nancy St. Pierre, a spokeswoman for Southlake, Texas-based
Sabre, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We will have further comment when
appropriate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronco Drilling Sued by Investor Over Chesapeake Energy Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronco Drilling Co. was sued in Delaware Chancery Court by
a stockholder seeking more than the $11 a share being offered
for the company by Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) The deal is currently
valued at about $316 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors of Bronco, based in Edmond, Oklahoma, have a duty
to get the best price for the company and have undervalued the
stock, investor Sam Berlinberg said in a complaint filed April
20 in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed transaction offers Bronco shareholders a
mere 6 percent premium,&#8221; and &#8220;analysts have set a target price
for Bronco shares as high as $13.50,&#8221; the plaintiff&#8217;s lawyers
said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronco, which reported a $50.6 million net loss last year
on $124.4 million in revenue, is 22 percent owned by Third
Avenue Management LLC and 15 percent controlled by billionaire
Carlos Slim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is our policy to not comment on pending litigation,&#8221;
Bob Jarvis, a Bronco spokesman, said in an e-mailed message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sam Berlinberg v. Bronco Drilling Co., CA6398,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Board Rejects Nasdaq-ICE Bid With Reverse Breakup Fee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Euronext (NYX) directors again rebuffed an $11.3 billion
takeover offer from Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) and
IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE), saying a proposed breakup fee to
allay antitrust concerns doesn&#8217;t change their commitment to
merging with Deutsche Boerse AG. (DB1) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX and ICE&#8217;s pledge to pay $350 million to the New
York Stock Exchange owners should their bid be blocked by
competition authorities didn&#8217;t improve the offer enough, the
board said in a statement April 21 on the company&#8217;s website.
Directors have twice deemed the Nasdaq OMX-ICE proposal
inadequate, saying April 10 that &#8220;execution risk&#8221; and the
threat of rising debt and layoffs were too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This proposal is substantially the same as what was
previously rejected,&#8221; NYSE Euronext chairman Jan-Michiel
Hessels said in the release. &#8220;Consequently, our view has not
changed. This proposal does not provide compelling value, has
unacceptable execution risk and is therefore not in the best
interests of NYSE Euronext shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld and ICE
CEO Jeffrey Sprecher said last week that they are meeting with
NYSE Euronext shareholders as they try to head off the $9.53
billion Deutsche Boerse agreement. Their offer is priced about
14 percent higher than the bid from Deutsche Boerse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Continually refusing to engage is starting to appear as
if they are protecting their deal rather than acting in the best
interest of their shareholders,&#8221; Greifeld said in a joint
Nasdaq OMX-ICE statement after the rejection. &#8220;We will not be
deterred by the board&#8217;s attempts to protect an inferior
transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse is &#8220;pleased&#8221; with the decision and it
plans to move forward with the merger agreement, according to an
e-mailed statement April 21. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speeches/Interviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTC Might Stop Internet Firms From Dominating Multiple Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy Wu, an information industries scholar hired by the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission, said in his first interview since
joining the regulator that dominant Internet companies should be
barred from monopolizing more than one market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We just take it for granted the Internet is always going
to be vibrant, always going to be moving,&#8221; Wu, who joined the
FTC in February, said in an April 18 interview. &#8220;It may require
some oversight and also may require that the government itself
doesn&#8217;t become the guarantor of monopoly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the agency have said it&#8217;s weighing a
probe of Google Inc. (GOOG), owner of the world&#8217;s most popular Internet
search engine. Wu said the FTC may consider how to prevent the
more powerful Internet firms from gaining multiple monopolies,
which would make them hard to displace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cited as an earlier example ATT, which controlled
local, long-distance and wireless telephone service and
switching before it was broken up in 1984. International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM), which dominated computer hardware,
software, operating systems, accessories and repair businesses,
is another example, Wu said, adding that his comments reflect
his own views, not the commission&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu, 38, is on leave from Columbia University in New York,
where he teaches telecommunications and copyright law. He is
working on preliminary investigations and formal probes, and
running a weekly internal discussion group that examines how
companies come to dominate the Internet business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB), India&#8217;s top-ranked
underwriter of debt sales, tumbled the most in two months after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. downgraded the stock and as concerns rose
over a contraction in the lender&#8217;s interest margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock dropped 4.9 percent to 1,377.30 rupees as of the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the steepest decline since Feb. 24.
The shares were the worst performers on the 14-member Bombay
Stock Exchange Bankex index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analyst Seshadri Sen cut the lender&#8217;s stock to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; and lowered the 12-month price
estimate to 1,525 rupees per share from 1,600 rupees earlier.
The &#8220;upside potential is about 5 percent&#8221; and the &#8220;risk-
reward is unfavorable,&#8221; Sen wrote in a note dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Re-pricing of a large proportion of bulk deposits and
growth funded through high cost deposits led to the margin
disappointment,&#8221; Sen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net interest margin narrowed to 3.44 percent in the March
quarter from 3.81 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31,
Mumbai-based brokerage K.R. Choksey Shares  Securities Pvt.
said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;higher-than-expected margin contraction is a key
concern to us,&#8221; Manish Ostwal and Palak Shah, analysts at K.R.
Choksey, wrote in the note. They rate the stock &#8220;hold,&#8221; with a
price estimate of 1,601 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axis Bank&#8217;s shares gained 4 percent in the quarter ended
March 31, compared with a 1 percent drop in the Bankex in the
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest publicly traded oil company, said its Indonesian unit
discovered oil at a second field in the Cepu Block on Java
island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobil Cepu Ltd., the operator of the block, found oil at
the Kedung Keris-1 well, about 9 miles (14 kilometers) from the
Banyu Urip area, where it discovered oil in 2001, Exxon Mobil
said in an e-mailed statement from Jakarta today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Kedung Keris discovery will be an important addition
to the 450 million barrels of oil expected to be recovered from
the full field development at Banyu Urip,&#8221; Terry S. McPhail,
president of Mobil Cepu, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobil Cepu and Ampolex (Cepu) Ltd., both units of Exxon
Mobil, together hold a 45 percent interest in the block.
Pertamina EP Cepu owns a 45 percent stake and the Cepu Block
Cooperation Body holds the rest, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProLogis (PLD), the world&#8217;s largest

from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to buy ProLogis European Properties. (PEPR) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior, unsecured term loan may be used only to pay for

that valued ProLogis European at 1.2 billion euros, beating a

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services provider, increased its
quarterly dividend 15 percent and set aside more money for share
buybacks, sending the stock to a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarterly payout will rise by 10 cents for the second
straight year, to 75 cents a share, IBM said today in a
statement. IBM added $8 billion to the stock-repurchase plan,
bringing the total authorized by the board to $12.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM last week said earnings will be at least $13.15 a share
this year, topping estimates, as it works toward a goal of at
least $20 a share in earnings by 2015. Today&#8217;s increases keep
the company on schedule for a goal to spend about $20 billion on
dividends and $50 billion on buybacks through 2015, IBM
Treasurer Martin Schroeter said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 82 cents to $168.49 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the highest
closing price in the 100-year-old company&#8217;s history. The shares
have climbed 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, also plans to use
about $20 billion on acquisitions through 2015 to focus on IBM&#8217;s
four revenue-growth initiatives: cloud computing, analytics,
emerging markets and Smarter Planet, the concept that
infrastructure can be digitized to be made more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company&#8217;s a cash flow machine,&#8221; said Chris Whitmore,
a San Francisco-based analyst for Deutsche Bank. &#8220;It&#8217;s giving
people a little added confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$100 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano, who took over in 2002, has increased earnings by
steering the company toward software and services. IBM has spent
more than $100 billion on dividends and buybacks since 2003, the
year Palmisano also became the chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the 16th year in a row that IBM has increased its
dividend. The company has boosted the payout by 10 cents each
year since 2006, except for 2009, when it halved the increase
amid the recession. The dividend is payable June 10 to
shareholders of record May 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company ended last quarter with $13.2 billion in cash
and short-term investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, posted first-quarter profit that fell short of
analysts&#8217; projections as earthquake damage squeezed margins in
Japan and total revenue trailed expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding items such as restructuring costs, earnings were
86 cents, compared with the 87-cent average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Damage from the March earthquake in Japan
cut 1 cent from profit, the Atlanta-based company said today in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales climbed to $10.5 billion, short of the average
analyst estimate of $10.7 billion. Revenue suffered partly from
discounting at retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), which ate
into Coca-Cola&#8217;s gains from volume sales, said Kaumil Gajrawala,
an analyst with UBS Investment Bank in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Revenues were below expectations in all regions but Latin
America,&#8221; Gajrawala said today in a note. &#8220;Much of the profit
miss was driven by North America.&#8221; He advises investors to buy
the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola declined 81 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $66.93 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest
drop in more than a month. Coca-Cola has gained 1.8 percent this
year, while rival PepsiCo Inc. has increased 3.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Disaster &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Coca-Cola manufacturing and vending operations in
Japan, which represents more than one-10th of operating profit,
were disrupted following the March 11 earthquake and ensuing
tsunami. Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has pledged more
than $30 million in relief for the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent has expanded further in developing countries to widen
Coca-Cola&#8217;s market-share lead. The beverage maker generated
almost one-third of its sales in the U.S. and Canada last year,
compared with 11 percent for the Latin America unit and 14
percent for Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola boosted sales volumes in the U.S. and Canada for
the fourth consecutive quarter, following his decision to take
control of 90 percent of the company&#8217;s North American
distribution system. Global sales by volume jumped 6 percent,
with a matching increase in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbonated soft-drink volume in Mexico rose 11 percent,
while China posted a 14 percent gain. Net income advanced 18
percent to $1.9 billion, or 82 cents a share, from $1.61
billion, or 69 cents. Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo, the
second-biggest soft-drink company, plans to report first-quarter
results this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo face rising costs for
ingredients and packaging as commodity prices advance and crude
oil for June delivery touched $113.48 yesterday, the highest
intraday price since Sept. 22, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity costs for the year may rise by as much as $700
million, according to estimates provided by Chief Financial
Officer Gary Fayard during a conference call. That&#8217;s higher than
the $300 million to $400 million he estimated in February. The
increase is fueled by the higher cost of plastic for bottles,
which is made from oil. Almost all of the commodity gain will be
offset by supply savings, higher pricing and a currency benefit,
Fayard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Note that we are continuing to actively hedge our
commodity and currency exposure,&#8221; Fayard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo, which gets about two-thirds of sales come from
snacks, has said total commodity costs may increase $1.4 billion
to $1.6 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A payment plan sponsored by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley and other creditors of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. treats pension funds and retirees
who own Lehman bonds &#8220;unfairly,&#8221; the California Public
Employees&#8217; Retirement System said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creditors, which also include Credit Suisse Group AG,
filed a liquidation plan for the defunct company yesterday that
would give their group more money than two other proposals for
allotting $61 billion among creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This plan treats members of pension funds, including
retirees who hold LBHI bonds through their pension plans,
unfairly,&#8221; Calpers Chief Investment Officer Joseph Dear said in
a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed that Goldman Sachs and other
big banks are proposing to reward themselves at the expense of
bondholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calpers, the largest U.S. pension fund, paid 86 cents to
$1.04 on the dollar for $90.1 million of Lehman&#8217;s senior bonds
between July 2006 and December 2007, according to a court
filing. It would get 16 cents on the dollar from the group
including Goldman Sachs, the fourth-largest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to immediately comment. Lehman spokeswoman
Kimberly Macleod declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calpers is a member of a rival group with hedge fund
Paulson  Co. The Paulson-Calpers plan, which transfers money to
bondholders from Goldman Sachs and other derivatives creditors
of Lehman, represents &#8220;a fair outcome for all stakeholders,&#8221;
it said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior bondholders would get 24.5 cents on the dollar under
the Paulson-Calpers plan, compared with 21.4 cents if Lehman&#8217;s
plan prevails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rival plans for Lehman are due to be discussed at a June 28
court hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in New
York. The Paulson-Calpers groups wants to reduce inequalities
among creditors, while the Goldman-Morgan Stanley group says
Lehman made a variety of deals with lenders that should be
preserved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, is hiring about 250 small-business
bankers this year to keep pace with a pickup in loan demand and
an expanded lending goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is bolstering staff to accommodate customers in
California and Florida who were added after the firm&#8217;s 2008
acquisition of Seattle-based thrift Washington Mutual Inc., said
Michael Cleary, head of small-business lending. The unit
provides direct loans, lines of credit and credit cards to
companies with less than $20 million in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleary hired 450 new bankers in 2010 and added about 100
more so far this year. By December, JPMorgan will have about 40
percent more small-business specialists than the 1,950 who
worked for the unit in 2009, excluding support staff, he said.
The unit increased its lending commitment to small businesses to
$12 billion this year from $10 billion in 2010 as applications
and approval rates have climbed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s some pent-up demand, they want to invest and the
quality of the borrower is improving,&#8221; Cleary said in an
interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s appeal of an 899
million-euro ($1.3 billion) European Union fine for failing to
comply with an antitrust ruling will be heard on May 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court, the 27-nation region&#8217;s second-highest
tribunal, will hear oral arguments in the case next month,
according to the court&#8217;s online calendar. Microsoft, the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, is seeking to overturn or cut the fine
levied by the European Commission in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of EU
competition policy to face a penalty for failing to comply with
an EU order. The commission in 2004 found that Microsoft
overcharged for patent licenses that rivals needed to connect
products to the Windows operating system. The additional fine in
2008 brought the total penalty against Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft to 1.68 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InterMune Inc. (ITMN), the only company
with an approved drug for a certain rare lung disease, is
weighing a sale and working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to
find a buyer, said three people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been running an auction process for InterMune
for at least a month, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the matter is private. Some potential buyers
are deterred by the company&#8217;s expectations on a sale price, and
there is no guarantee a takeover will occur, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biotechnology company, whose shareholders include
private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, had a market value of
about $2.86 billion as of today&#8217;s close. The stock advanced
$2.43, or 5.3 percent, to $48.48 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterMune has more than tripled since December, when a
European regulatory committee recommended marketing clearance
for Esbriet, which was approved March 3 as the first treatment
of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung
disease, in Europe. Annual sales in the European Union may reach
about $1 billion in 2015, Avik Roy, an analyst with Monness
Crespi Hardt  Co. in New York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Study Design &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterMune would appeal to drug companies that make
respiratory products and have a European sales force, said Roy,
who has a $58 price target on the stock and said the company
could fetch $70 in a sale. The company may be attractive to
London-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and AstraZeneca (AZN) Plc; Novartis
AG (NOVN), based in Basel, Switzerland; and Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd., based in Petah Tikva, Israel, Roy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators rejected InterMune&#8217;s application for Esbriet
May 4, sending shares down 80 percent in two days. The company
met with the FDA in March to discuss the design of an additional
study of the drug, known chemically as pirfenidone, Jim Goff, a
spokesman for Brisbane, California-based InterMune, said today
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the company sold the rights to its experimental
hepatitis C treatment, danoprevir, to its partner, Swiss
drugmaker Roche Holding AG for $175 million. While InterMune has
one other product on the market -- the osteoporosis drug
Actimmune, which had revenue of $20 million in 2010 -- Esbriet
is the only value driver in the near term, Brian Abrahams, an
analyst for Wells Fargo Securities in New York, said in a note
on April 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biotech Acquisitions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 531 announced or completed acquisitions of
U.S. biotechnology companies in the past three years, with an
average disclosed size of $303.8 million and an average premium
of 61 percent, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterMune&#8217;s Goff and Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for
Goldman, declined to comment. DealReporter said earlier today
that InterMune was using a financial adviser to explore a sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Harrison, a spokeswoman for Glaxo, declined to
comment. AstraZeneca declined to comment on speculation, Abigail Baron, a spokeswoman for the company in London, said. Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis, said the company doesn&#8217;t
comment on speculation. Teva doesn&#8217;t comment on market rumors
concerning acquisitions, spokesman Yossi Koren said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 100,000 Americans and more than 100,000 Europeans
have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which causes scarring and
inflammation in the lungs and is usually fatal within five
years. The condition mostly affects people ages 50 to 75,
causing air sacs in the lung to be gradually replaced with scar
tissue, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute&#8217;s website. Most patients die of respiratory failure
when the lungs can&#8217;t expand to get oxygen into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt has temporarily left the team, concerned about his family
after deadly tornadoes struck near his home in Mississippi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt may rejoin the Phillies in time for his next
scheduled start, which is May 3 against the Washington
Nationals, the Major League Baseball team said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phillies said tornado activity has caused several
deaths and significant damage in the area near Oswalt&#8217;s home.
The Associated Press reported that storms had killed at least 10
people from Arkansas to Alabama, including a man struck by a
tree at a Mississippi campsite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has chosen to take time to make sure there wasn&#8217;t
significant damage to his home, but more importantly, to make
certain that his wife and children are OK,&#8221; Phillies General
Manager Ruben Amaro said. &#8220;It is almost a year to the day that
his parents&#8217; house was destroyed by a tornado, which has
heightened his concern about the current situation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt, 33, is one of four All-Star pitchers in the
Phillies&#8217; starting rotation, along with Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee
and Cole Hamels. The group has helped Philadelphia win 15 games
this season, tied for the second-most in the majors behind the
Colorado Rockies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt lasted three innings in yesterday&#8217;s 7-5 loss to the
Arizona Diamondbacks, allowing five runs on six hits. It was his
first defeat in five starts this season and his first regular-
season loss since his Phillies debut on July 30, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt is 3-1 with a 3.33 earned run average this season.
He allowed five earned runs in his first four starts before
yesterday&#8217;s loss in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s top
software maker, reported third-quarter sales in the Windows
division that missed analysts&#8217; predictions as consumers shunned
its products in favor of tablets such as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the unit that includes Windows fell to $4.45
billion, Microsoft said in a statement today. That was shy of
the $4.6 billion average prediction of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Shares slipped in late trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal computer shipments unexpectedly fell 3.2 percent
in the quarter as consumers held off purchases and shifted to
tablet computers, IDC said. Multiyear contracts with
corporations and robust demand for Office business software
couldn&#8217;t make up for consumers who are choosing iPads over a new
laptop with Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;PCs aren&#8217;t being bought and if you are going to buy a
laptop you&#8217;ll look at an iPad,&#8221; said Kim Caughey Forrest, an
analyst at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc. which
manages $1.1 billion, including Microsoft shares. &#8220;That&#8217;s where
some of those Windows sales went.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, declined as much
as 74 cents to $25.97 in extended trading, after gaining 33
cents to $26.71 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. The shares dropped 9 percent last quarter, while the
Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 5.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overtaken By Apple &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results underscore the ascendance of Apple, which
surpassed Microsoft as the world&#8217;s most valuable technology
company in May. Apple&#8217;s profit in the period that ended in March
almost doubled to $5.99 billion, compared with $5.23 billion for
Microsoft in the same period. That was the first time Apple&#8217;s
profit topped Microsoft&#8217;s in two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrywide shipments of consumer PCs dropped 8 percent in
the quarter while shipments to corporate customers rose 9
percent, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an
interview. Netbooks dropped 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s fair to say tablet is some of that,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the Windows division fell 4.4 percent, the
second quarter in a row that sales in that unit fell short of
projections. Microsoft said in a slide presentation on its
website that overall PC sales declined 2 percent last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are growing slower than PCs now,&#8221; said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who rates
Microsoft &#8220;sector perform.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s suggesting some market
share loss, some real deterioration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office, Servers Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to 61 cents a share, from $4.01 billion, or
45 cents, Microsoft said today. Excluding a 5-cent per-share tax
benefit, earnings matched the 56-cent average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose to $16.4 billion, compared with the $16.2
billion average projection. That reflects demand for such
products as Office business-productivity software and the
programs that run servers, computers that run networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For a long time, I&#8217;ve been looking at Microsoft as an
enterprise play, rather than consumer, and in that area they
didn&#8217;t disappoint,&#8221; Caughey Forrest said. &#8220;Office was good.
Servers weren&#8217;t bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the business division, which sells Office software
and is the company&#8217;s biggest, rose to $5.25 billion, compared
with the $4.9 billion average estimate of analysts. Server and
Tools unit sales were $4.1 billion, compared with the $4 billion
analysts expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Integration Stumbles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing businesses invest in technology,&#8221; Klein
said. &#8220;They are buying hardware and they are buying Microsoft
software.&#8221; Microsoft expects corporate PC shipments to outpace
those for consumers for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also getting less revenue than expected on a
per-search basis from its partnership with Yahoo! Inc.,
Microsoft&#8217;s Klein said. The companies still face integration
complications and expect to fix them by year end, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said operating expenses in the year that starts
July 1 will rise to $28 billion to $28.6 billion. In the current
fiscal year they will be $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion, the
company said, reiterating a previous forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unearned revenue, a measure of future sales, was $13
billion, above the average analysts&#8217; estimate of $12.8 billion,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s iPad is luring customers from Windows-based PCs as
Microsoft tarries in furnishing computer makers with a Windows
operating system that&#8217;s capable of challenging the iPad.
Microsoft won&#8217;t release a viable competitor to the Apple and
Google Inc. tablet operating systems until the second half of
2012, people with knowledge of the plans said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone is worried about the Windows numbers,&#8221; said
Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
cash cow and everyone is worried the cow is running out of
milk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byron Trott&#8217;s BDT Capital Partners
LLC agreed to help provide $110 million to a Texas energy
investment firm run by Bobby Tudor, a former colleague at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDT, founded by Trott in 2009 and based in Chicago, teamed
with former Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR) Chief Executive Officer Claiborne Deming to buy debentures in Tudor, Pickering, Holt  Co., TPH
said today in a statement. Some of the debt is convertible into
a minority equity stake, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tudor is chairman and CEO of Houston-based TPH, a broker-
dealer and investment bank he formed in 2007 that provides
advisory and underwriting services in the energy industry. Tudor
had been a partner at New York-based Goldman Sachs, where Trott,
a vice chairman, arranged some of the biggest purchases by
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) Chairman Warren Buffett, including the
$4.5 billion acquisition of Marmon Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The experience and quality of our partners in this
transaction are as important as the capital they provide,&#8221;
Tudor said in the statement. Deming is an immediate past
chairman of the National Petroleum Council who will serve on
TPH&#8217;s board, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDT oversees $2 billion and specializes in closely held
companies, acquiring a majority stake in grill-maker Weber-
Stephen Products Co. in December. Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) said its No. 4
and No. 7 mines in Alabama will be offline until power is
restored after the South was swept by the worst day of tornadoes
and storms in the U.S. in 37 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect production to resume as soon as all power is
restored and any related underground issues are resolved,&#8221; Walt Scheller, Walter&#8217;s president of U.S. operations, said in a
statement today. &#8220;We are uncertain how long it will take to
restore power to this facility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both mines are in Tuscaloosa County, which suffered some of
the worst damage from the tornadoes. Walter said this month that
it plans to sell as much as 8 million tons of metallurgical
coal, used to make steel, from the operations this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 269 people have died in six states as a result of
the storms. As many as a million people were without power in
Alabama, according to its governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter, based in Tampa, Florida, said its Taft Choctaw
surface mine near Jasper, Alabama, incurred &#8220;superficial&#8221;
damage and that the storm cut power to the operation and its
dragline. The company said that it plans to sell 1.4 million to
1.6 million tons of thermal coal, used by power plants, from its
surface mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had one injury at a surface mine that required
first aid treatment, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter fell 59 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $133.65 a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 45 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the world&#8217;s
largest consumer-products company, reduced the top end of its
annual profit forecast after higher raw-material costs and slow
growth in Europe and North America ate into income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG cut the top of its forecast range by 5 cents. It now
predicts profit this year of $3.91 to $3.96 a share, excluding
the impact of legal costs and taxes. Twenty-five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimated an average profit of $3.96. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other consumer-products companies, the maker of
Gillette razors and Olay skin care continues to cope with higher
costs for wood pulp, resins and other raw materials. Commodities
cost increases are about $1.8 billion this fiscal year, triple
what the company expected, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller
said during a media call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald is raising some U.S.
prices and expanding in emerging markets to boost revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rate of improvement in developed markets is obviously
slower than we had originally forecast,&#8221; McDonald said on the
call. Almost two-thirds of the company&#8217;s sales last year came
from North America and Western Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit rose 11 percent to $2.87 billion, or 96 cents a
share, in the period ended March 31, from $2.59 billion, or 83
cents a share, a year earlier, the Cincinnati-based company said
today in a statement. Twenty-three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg estimated profit of 97 cents a share on average,
excluding such items as legal costs and taxes. Revenue rose 5.5
percent to $20.23 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Competitive Environment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG rose 48 cents to $64.50 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares are about unchanged this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toothpaste maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) said today its
first-quarter profit excluding some items fell amid higher
material costs and what CEO Ian Cook called &#8220;an intense
competitive environment globally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 4.3 percent to $3.99 billion. Net income
increased to $576 million, or $1.16 a share, compared with $357
million, or 69 cents a share, in the year-ago period. That
included an after-tax charge in the year-ago quarter of $271
million for accounting changes in Venezuela. The shares of New
York-based Colgate have gained 0.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) earlier this week reduced the bottom
end of its full-year profit forecast and reported earnings below
analysts&#8217; expectations after raw-materials costs jumped more
than anticipated. The Dallas-based maker of Huggies diapers and
Kleenex tissues says it&#8217;s raising prices on most of its North
American goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG is raising U.S. prices on Charmin toilet paper, Pampers
diapers and Bounty paper towels, spokesman Paul Fox said in an
April 26 e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, posted its largest profit in
almost three years as soaring gasoline prices fueled discontent
among consumers and policymakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With U.S. motorists paying the most for gasoline since
prices reached a record $4.11 a gallon in the summer of 2008,
Exxon said today that its first-quarter net income jumped 69
percent to $10.7 billion. The Irving, Texas-based company is
sitting on a cash pile of $13.2 billion, even after distributing
more than $7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama has called for an end to decades-old
tax breaks for domestic oil and natural-gas drilling, and urged
Saudi Arabia, the world&#8217;s largest crude exporter, to help rein
in surging world crude prices by boosting output. Exxon said
inflicting higher taxes would drain funds the company needs to
find new oil and gas fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the past five years, we incurred a total U.S. tax
expense of almost $59 billion, which is $18 billion more than we
earned in the United States during the same period,&#8221; Kenneth
Cohen, Exxon&#8217;s vice president of public and government affairs,
said yesterday in a blog post on the company&#8217;s website.
&#8220;Critics often try to ignore these facts by saying the oil and
gas industry receives &#8216;subsidies.&#8217; But what they really mean is
that they want to increase our taxes by taking away long-
standing deductions for our industry while leaving these same
deductions in place for other sectors of the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, posted its biggest first-
quarter profit increase in eight years as surging energy demand
and supply concerns pushed crude prices to a 30-month high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income rose 69 percent to $10.7 billion,
or $2.14 a share, from $6.3 billion, or $1.33, a year earlier,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said today in a statement. Per-share
profit was 10 cents higher than the average of five analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s profit from selling oil and natural-gas rose 49
percent to $8.7 billion as Brent oil futures, the benchmark
price for two-thirds of the world&#8217;s crude, averaged more than
$105 a barrel. Soaring demand for fuels to run trains, trucks,
cars and airplanes coincided with civil unrest that disrupted
exports from Libya, home to Africa&#8217;s largest reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 26 percent to $114 billion. Three-fourths of
Exxon&#8217;s sales come from outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, the world&#8217;s second-largest consumer of oil and
gas after the U.S., demand for oil-based fuels such as diesel
rose 11 percent during the first three months of this year,
almost seven times the U.S.&#8217;s 1.6 percent growth rate, according
to the International Energy Agency. Brazilian and Indian demand
expanded by 5 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining Improves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon fell 80 cents to 86.98 at 9:30 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has 10 buy ratings from
analysts, 12 holds and one sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s refining business earned $1.1 billion. In
Exxon&#8217;s chemicals division, net income rose 21 percent to $1.52
billion, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon raised oil and gas production 10 percent to the
equivalent of 4.82 million barrels a day during the quarter as
new projects such as the West Qurna 1 field in Iraq came online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to spend $34 billion this year on capital
projects such as new oil wells, pipeline repairs and refinery
upgrades. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told analysts
last month that he is targeting a 4 percent increase in oil and
natural gas production this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Exxon and many of the integrateds, the growth is
international,&#8221; said Eliecer Palacios, energy sector specialist
at Maxim Group, a boutique investment bank. &#8220;Increased capital
expenditures are necessary to continue adding reserves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s discoveries and acquisitions last year were
enough to replace 209 percent of the crude and gas pumped from
wells, boosting proved reserves to the equivalent of 24.8
billion barrels, which exceeded the crude reserves of nations
such as Algeria or Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which traces its roots to the 1880s and John D. Rockefeller&#8217;s Standard Oil Trust, has exploration prospects from
Greenland to Madagascar to Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil production in Libya dwindled to 390,000 barrels a day
in March, a 75 percent drop from the end of 2010, according to
Bloomberg estimates, as a rebellion against Muammar Qaddafi
prompted foreign energy companies to evacuate staff and the
country&#8217;s cities were put under siege. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects size of credit-default swap market in fourth
paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and 14 other investment banks face the first-ever
European Union antitrust probes into the swaps market, following
investigations by U.S. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is examining whether 16 banks, including Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), colluded by giving market information
to Markit Group Ltd., a data provider majority-owned by Wall
Street&#8217;s largest banks. It will also check if nine of the firms
struck unfair deals with Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE)&#8217;s
European derivatives clearinghouse, shutting out rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lack of transparency in markets can lead to abusive
behavior and facilitate violations of competition rules,&#8221;
Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s competition commissioner, said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;I hope our investigation will contribute
to a better functioning of financial markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global regulators have sought to toughen regulation of the
$30.3 trillion credit-default swap market, saying the trades
helped fuel the financial crisis. The EU&#8217;s probes add to
separate investigations in the U.K. and U.S. into whether banks
colluded to manipulate the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR), the
cable-TV operator that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, hired
Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to sell its southern
California systems, said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction for the assets, which could fetch as much as $2
billion, is in the very early days, said one person, who asked
not to be identified because details of the sale aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC), with about 1.8 million customers in
Los Angeles, will evaluate whether to bid on Charter&#8217;s assets,
Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt said yesterday on a
conference call. St. Louis-based Charter had about 4.5 million
basic video subscribers in 2010 and doesn&#8217;t disclose customers
by region. Charter is now controlled by Apollo Global Management
LLC, Oaktree Capital Management LP and other private equity
firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to evaluate it like we look at all
acquisitions and look at what it would look like under our
ownership,&#8221; Britt said. &#8220;And then evaluate it versus other
investment alternatives, including buying our shares back, and
we&#8217;ll come out wherever we come out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter doesn&#8217;t comment on speculative transactions, Anita Lamont, a Charter spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Mark Costiglio, a Citigroup spokesman, and Andrea Rachman, a Goldman
Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, Charter operates systems around Los Angeles,
Lompoc, San Louis Obispo, Chico and Redding. Multichannel News
reported on April 26 that Charter was about to hire investment
banks to sell its Los Angeles system, citing anonymous sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter rose 30 cents to $58.94 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained 51 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said first-quarter profit rose 36 percent as
economic growth and supply disruptions drove crude prices above
$100 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $6.21 billion, or $3.09 a share, from
$4.55 billion, or $2.27, a year earlier, San Ramon, California-
based Chevron said in a statement today. The company was
expected to report per-share profit of $2.99, based on the
average of two analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 25 percent to $60.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global demand for petroleum-derived fuels rose 2.9 percent
during the first quarter, led by growth in China, Brazil and
India, according to the International Energy Agency. Oil futures
traded in New York climbed 20 percent to average $94.60 a barrel
amid civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East that
imperiled crude supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company beat analysts&#8217; estimates &#8220;because of pricing,
so from the standpoint of earnings quality that&#8217;s not really a
great reason to beat,&#8221; said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at
Raymond James  Associates Inc. in Houston who owns Chevron
shares and has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 63 cents to $109.44 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has gained 20
percent this year, has 19 buy ratings from analysts and six
holds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from the company&#8217;s oil and natural-gas business
increased 27 percent to $5.98 billion as higher commodity prices
offset a less than 1 percent decline in output. Chevron pumped
the equivalent of 2.76 million barrels of crude during the
period, down from 2.78 million a year earlier, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s refineries earned $622 million, more than three
times the profit of the first quarter of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron plans to spend $26 billion in 2011 to explore for
crude, construct gas-export plants and repair oil refineries.
Chief Executive Officer John Watson has been reducing refining
and retail operations to concentrate on higher-profit ventures
such as deep-water exploration in places such as the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron announced two U.S. Gulf projects last year with a
combined value of $11.5 billion that will tap deep-water oil
fields, part of Watson&#8217;s plan to boost output by 20 percent by
the end of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the company received one of the first permits
to resume exploratory drilling in the Gulf since the U.S.
suspended such work in response to the Deepwater Horizon tragedy
that killed 11 rig workers and led to the biggest U.S. offshore
oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. oil company. Exxon yesterday reported a 69 percent rise in
net income for the first quarter, to $10.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Windows sales
slumped last quarter as the iPad crimped demand for consumer
laptops, marking the first time in 20 years that the software
maker reported a smaller quarterly profit than Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s Windows division fell 4.4 percent to
$4.45 billion, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
yesterday in a statement. That missed the $4.6 billion average
prediction of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income was
$5.23 billion, eclipsed by the $5.99 billion reported by Apple
last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer PC shipments dropped 8 percent in the quarter,
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said. Netbooks --
the cheap laptops that became popular during the recession --
plunged 40 percent, partially because of defections to tablet
computers, he said. The decline overshadowed a better-than-
anticipated performance from Microsoft&#8217;s Office unit and
increased PC demand from corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to live underneath a rock not to know that the
iPad has taken share from the netbook,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr.,
principal of Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management
Inc., which holds Microsoft shares as part of its $2.5 billion
in assets. &#8220;It&#8217;s a problem on the consumer side, and that&#8217;s a
market where Microsoft continues to give up territory to
Apple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 79 cents, or 3 percent, to $25.92 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares have
declined 7.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Than Apple &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to 61 cents a share, from $4.01 billion, or
45 cents, Microsoft said yesterday. Excluding a 5-cent per-share
tax benefit, earnings matched the 56-cent average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results underscore the ascendance of Apple, which
surpassed Microsoft as the world&#8217;s most valuable technology
company last May. The last time Apple&#8217;s profit was bigger than
Microsoft&#8217;s was 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PC shipments to corporate customers rose 9 percent,
tablet competition accounted for some of the sluggishness in
consumer sales, Klein said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s fair to say tablet is some of that,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total PC sales declined 2 percent last quarter, Microsoft
said. That the Windows business performed even worse adds to the
concern over Microsoft&#8217;s performance, said Brendan Barnicle, an
analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in Portland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s suggesting some market share loss, some real
deterioration,&#8221; said Barnicle, who rates Microsoft&#8217;s stock
&#8220;sector perform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s overall sales rose to $16.4 billion, compared
with the $16.2 billion average projection. That reflected demand
for such products as Office business-productivity software and
programs for servers -- the computers that run networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing businesses invest in technology,&#8221; Klein
said. &#8220;They are buying hardware and they are buying Microsoft
software.&#8221; Microsoft expects corporate PC shipments to outpace
consumer sales for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the business division, which sells Office software
and is the company&#8217;s biggest unit, rose 21 percent to $5.25
billion, compared with the $4.9 billion average estimate of
analysts. Revenue at the Server and Tools unit was $4.1 billion,
compared with the $4 billion analysts projected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a tale of two cities going on here,&#8221; said Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco, who recommends
buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;You have consumers who say an iPad is
good enough for consuming data, but for the enterprise side,
those enterprises are continuing with Microsoft. The thing that
has hurt Microsoft is that tablets are no question the must-have
item for consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#180;s revenue in Latin
America is growing as fast as 36 percent as rising incomes and
lower computer prices bolster demand, said Hernan Rincon, the
company&#180;s president for the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s sales surpassed the growth of the area&#8217;s
information technology industry, which is expanding at 12
percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cost of PCs and technology is declining and the
incomes in Latin America are rising,&#8221; Rincon said in an
interview at the World Economic Forum on Latin American in Rio
de Janeiro. &#8220;The combination of the two makes information
technology more accessible year after year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region, which is the fastest growing market for
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, also saw a decline in
software piracy, Rincon said. About 62 percent of software in
Latin America is illegally sold, down from 70 percent five years
ago, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission will return to work on mutual-fund fees &#8220;with full
force&#8221; once it gets past the July deadline for many Dodd-Frank
Act rules, SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every dollar collected in 12b-1 fees is a dollar deducted
from a fund&#8217;s return,&#8221; Walter said today in a Washington
speech, referring to fees mutual funds charge for marketing. The
agency will focus attention on the fees again when it clears the
bulk of its Dodd-Frank work, she said in the comments delivered
at a Mutual Fund Directors Forum conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is writing as many as 100 rules required by Dodd-
Frank, the regulatory overhaul enacted last year. Many of the
rules must be completed by July 21, the one-year anniversary of
the law being signed by President Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day Dodd-Frank was enacted, SEC commissioners voted
unanimously on a proposal to increase disclosure and cap fees
investors pay over time. Under the measure, a company couldn&#8217;t
charge more in 12b-1 fees for a class of fund shares that
continue to solicit new investors than they charge for classes
that don&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC in 1980 allowed mutual funds to charge clients
distribution fees to pay for advertising as the industry
struggled to attract new investors. Those payments amounted to
$9.5 billion in 2009, and money managers are increasingly using
proceeds to pay brokers who sell funds. That has prompted
regulators to re-examine the purpose and need for 12b-1 fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) product
manager who once worked for Michael Dell&#8217;s hedge fund aims to do
for restaurants what Expedia Inc. (EXPE) does for airplanes: fill empty
seats during off-peak hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dazhi Chen, a Harvard Business School alumnus, has amassed
a staff of 20 from postings on Craigslist.com and is betting
half a million dollars that his website, DailyGobble.com, can
challenge LivingSocial and Groupon Inc. to become a premier-
dining discount destination. The site is set to debut today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen put up $100,000 of his own money to chase his cut of
the $385.5 billion diners spend at restaurants and bars each
year by offering food rebates on his site. He tried and failed a
decade ago, using $1 million in funding on an effort Chen says
was poorly timed to coincide with the dot-com crash. The rise of
smartphones and online marketing convinced him to try again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is very significant opportunity for new entrants to
come in with innovation and gain significant traction, but these
things are lightning in a bottle,&#8221; said Lou Kerner, a social
media analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. &#8220;Groupon has grown
dramatically faster than anyone thought they would.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen&#8217;s challenge is ensuring DailyGobble.com stands out
among hundreds of online coupon sites, led by Groupon and
LivingSocial. The 330 restaurants posting discounts on
DailyGobble.com so far are Chen&#8217;s proof his concept has
potential. Within a year, he projects quarterly revenue of as
much as $7 million and net income of $250,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limit Discounts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DailyGobble&#8217;s pitch to restaurateurs is that they only pay
for coupons diners use, and they can limit discounts to specific
times of day when tables typically sit vacant. Many established
coupon sites, LivingSocial among them, charge up-front fees for
listings and don&#8217;t permit time restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can use DailyGobble for times that the restaurant is
not full,&#8221; said Darren Wan, 36, owner of Red Egg in New York,
which is offering a 20 percent rebate on Chen&#8217;s site on Tuesdays
and Sundays from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DailyGobble charges eateries fees of 5 percent of food
sales to list deals -- a smaller cut than most other coupon
sites take -- and requires discounts of at least 20 percent,
Chen said. Diners get rebate checks in the mail after spending
enough to amass $25 in savings or can send funds to a PayPal
account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebates Versus Coupons &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refund model sets DailyGobble apart from Groupon and
LivingSocial, among other deal sites, where buyers purchase the
discounted items up front, then use coupons when they dine out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think there will be some resistance and hesitation in
getting the money back later,&#8221; said Greg Sterling, an analyst
with Opus Research Inc. in San Francisco. &#8220;There&#8217;s a trust
issue initially. If it&#8217;s easy to get the money, it will create a
lot of stickiness and loyalty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen says diners will like avoiding the hassle and
potential embarrassment of coupons, particularly in the two
food-obsessed cities his site targets: New York and San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sales force is paramount to make such sites viable, said
Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research. DailyGobble
has nine employees on its sales team so far, Chen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very, very labor intensive,&#8221; Mulpuru said. &#8220;You
have to get the word out to customers and you have to do it in a
way that&#8217;s not predictable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone Apps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site now works through an iPhone application that lets
diners photograph receipts and e-mail them to DailyGobble.
Employees at the company&#8217;s one-room New York office verify the
bill and start a rebate tab for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps for Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software should be available
within a week, and software for Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM)&#8217;s
BlackBerry will be released in four to six weeks, Chen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other deal companies offer businesses delayed returns,
usually giving the eatery 50 percent of its money within three
to 10 days and the rest as many as 40 days after the deal, said
Alberto Gonzalez, 46, owner of New York-based GustOrganics. They
also don&#8217;t let businesses pick the time customers can use the
deal, he said. A flood of coupon-carrying clients can overwhelm
an unprepared small business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the issues we normally have with other deals is
all the people with the deals come when we&#8217;re the busiest,&#8221;
Gonzalez said. &#8220;We have to run the vouchers, and that takes
time, and sometimes it gets complicated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez, who is offering 25 percent off meals between 8
a.m. and 11 a.m. with DailyGobble, said other deal companies
he&#8217;s used, including Groupon, DailyCandy Inc. and Gilt Groupe
Inc.&#8217;s Gilt City, take as much as 25 percent of sales generated
through their sites, versus DailyGobble&#8217;s 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkout, Tips &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No coupons also means diners don&#8217;t have to slow the
checkout process while managers verify authenticity, and the
wait staff is tipped for the full amount of the bill, said Wan,
owner of Red Egg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wan said he tried Groupon in February because of the
breadth of its user base. The customers who came were the sort
who &#8220;are always looking for deals&#8221; and often tipped based on
the discounted price, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to keep the wait staff motivated when they&#8217;re
getting jerked on tips,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupon spokeswoman Julie Mossler said the company puts a
note on vouchers reminding people to be good customers, and has
data that show customers are spending 60 percent to 80 percent
more than the face value of its coupons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wan says he has little to lose by trying DailyGobble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Best-case scenario, we&#8217;re able to fill up empty seats
during specific times of the day when we don&#8217;t experience a lot
of diners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Worst-case scenario, you lose a customer
that used to dine at your restaurant any time of the week, but
now only dines when there&#8217;s a special available.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, who invested $5
billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) at the depths of the
financial crisis, said he plans to retain warrants in the bank
in a bet its shares will increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will keep them very close to their expiration,&#8221;
Buffett said yesterday at a press conference in Omaha, Nebraska,
where his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) is based. &#8220;At some point,
we&#8217;re likely to exercise the warrants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire holds warrants, expiring in 2013, to buy $5
billion in New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s common stock at $115 a
share as a result of his 2008 preferred investment in the
company. The bank closed at $151.01 on April 29 on the New York
Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s support boosted Berkshire&#8217;s profit and buoyed New
York-based Goldman Sachs as the bank navigated the credit crunch
and was criticized by lawmakers. Goldman Sachs in March won
Federal Reserve approval to redeem the $5 billion in preferred
shares, which paid 10 percent annual interest to Berkshire.
Goldman also had to pay a $500 million fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s warrants have generated a paper profit of more
than $1.5 billion based on the April 29 stock price. Goldman
Sachs has declined 10 percent this year, compared with the 8.4
percent advance of the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. First-
quarter profit slipped 21 percent to $2.74 billion, beating
analysts&#8217; estimates on gains in investments, Goldman Sachs said
April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Leverage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. banking profitability will be considerably less in
my view in the period ahead than it was in the early part of
this century,&#8221; Buffett said April 30 at the annual meeting of
Berkshire shareholders in Omaha. &#8220;A very important reason is
that the leverage will be reduced&#8221; as regulators tighten
capital rules, he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably a good thing for
society. That may be a bad thing for banks who can use leverage
intelligently.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, whose relationship with Goldman Sachs dates to his
childhood when he met with an executive of the company, defended
the firm and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein at
Berkshire&#8217;s annual meeting in 2010 after the bank was sued by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs settled the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit in July by agreeing
to pay $550 million, and said it made a mistake in omitting
disclosure to investors. The SEC had said that Goldman Sachs
clients weren&#8217;t told when they invested in a collateralized debt
obligation from the bank that a hedge fund picked mortgages in
the investment and was betting on them to fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, who also makes derivative bets through Goldman
Sachs as Berkshire&#8217;s CEO, has said it makes no difference who is
on the other side of a trade and that it is an investor&#8217;s duty
to independently assess risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at its Joliet refinery in Channahon,
Illinois, according to a filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency said
malfunctioning equipment caused the flaring, which began at 2:45
a.m. yesterday and ended three minutes later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has a processing capacity of 248,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
