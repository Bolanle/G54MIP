<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to sell its Capsugel manufacturing unit to KKR
 Co. for $2.38 billion in an effort to focus on its higher-
profit business developing new medicines. </p>
<p>The New York-based company lowered its yearly revenue
forecast after backing out Capsugel, a unit that makes wholesale
pill casings and had $750 million in sales last year. Pfizer
said it will use proceeds from the deal to expand a planned $5
billion share repurchase. </p>
<p>Today''s sale may be the first of several for Pfizer this
year, and may spur rivals to evaluate similar deals as generic
competition erodes sales of top-selling medicines, said Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at Miller Tabak  Co.,
which owns Pfizer shares. Drugmakers face generics copies in the
next five years to products with $141 billion in annual sales,
according to health research firm IMS Health. </p>
<p>Pharma acts like a herd sometimes, and other
pharmaceutical companies are probably looking through their
portfolios as we speak, Funtleyder said in a phone interview
today. Pfizer executives have been signaling that they want to
do divestitures, and now they''re going through with it. That
will be perceived by the market as a positive. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 16 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $20.54 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 17 percent this year. KKR climbed 23 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $17.14. </p>
<p>KKR''s Deals </p>
<p>The acquisition of Capsugel is KKR''s second-largest deal in
the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In
November, a KKR-led group agreed to buy Del Monte Foods Co. for
$5.3 billion including debt. Capsugel, Pfizer''s smallest unit,
made more than 180 billion hard capsules for drugs in 2010,
Pfizer said. The unit is separate from Pfizer''s drug business
and will be easy to split off, said Barbara Ryan, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG in New York. </p>
<p>It really doesn''t make sense for Pfizer to keep it,
Ryan said in a telephone interview. It''s too tiny to make a
difference either way, and it''s a distraction. </p>
<p>Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said Feb. 1 that he
is reviewing each of the company''s business units as the company
faces generic competition to $10.7 billion in annual sales of
its Lipitor cholesterol pill. Pfizer acquired the Capsugel unit
in its 2000 purchase of Warner-Lambert Co. </p>
<p>Starting Point'' </p>
<p>Our hope is that this represents the starting point of a
larger series of divestitures by the company, said Tim Anderson,
an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York, in a
note to clients today. Pfizer may shrink the company''s revenue
base by almost half, to as little as $35 billion from $67
billion, according to Anderson. </p>
<p>To achieve this, Pfizer''s nutritionals, consumer health,
animal health and established products drug division may be
jettisoned, Anderson said. </p>
<p>Pfizer lowered its annual revenue forecast range by $800
million to $65.2 billion to $67.2 billion this year to reflect
lost Capsugel sales. </p>
<p>There have been 81 acquisitions of U.S. health-care
companies by private equity firms in the past five years, with
an average value of $1.01 billion and a typical premium 64
percent. The biggest was the $32.2 billion purchase of hospital
operator HCA Holdings Inc. in 2006 by funds led by New York-
based KKR and Bain of Boston. </p>
<p>$210 Billion </p>
<p>KKR, the New York-based private-equity firm run by Henry Kravis and George Roberts has a portfolio of businesses with
more than 900,000 employees $210 billion in annual sales, the
company said. KKR''s investments in the health-care industry
include HCA Holdings, the largest publicly-traded U.S. hospital
chain, and Biomet Inc., a manufacturer of orthopedic medical
devices. </p>
<p>Pfizer and KKR expect to complete the deal in the third
quarter. Morgan Stanley and Guggenheim Securities LLC were
financial advisers for the drugmaker, while Cadwalader,
Wickersham  Taft LLP and White  Case LLP provided legal
counsel. Simpson Thacher  Bartlett LLP acted as legal counsel
for KKR. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley bought barges of jet
fuel and sold gasoil in Europe''s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil
hub. Gasoline rose as refiners switched their production to
produce summer-grade motor fuel. </p>
<p>Light Products </p>
<p>Gasoline for immediate loading traded at $1,076 and $1,080
a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts trading
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time That''s up from
$1,063 to $1,066 on April 1. Vitol Group, Mabanaft BV and
Cargill Inc. were sellers, while Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell
Plc, Vitol and Chevron Corp. were buyers. </p>
<p>Those prices are for so-called barge lots of 1,000 or 2,000
tons of Eurobob grade motor fuel, which is mixed with ethanol
before it is sold at the pump. European refiners changed their
production on April 1 to produce summer-grade gasoline, which
has a higher boiling point than winter specification. </p>
<p>The product''s 14 percent gain in the last month may
dissipate if high retail prices temper demand, Olivier Jakob,
managing director of Switzerland-based researcher Petromatrix
GmbH, said today in a note. Prices at the pump in Europe are
already over the peaks of the summer of 2008. </p>
<p>Gasoline''s crack, or premium to Brent crude, narrowed 8
cents to $8.17 a barrel in Europe, according to data from
London-based broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd. </p>
<p>The spread is increasingly vulnerable to a correction
given rising crude prices relative to the motor fuel, Harry Tchilinguirian, London-based head of commodity markets strategy
at BNP Paribas SA, said in an April 1 report. </p>
<p>Middle Distillates </p>
<p>Gasoil barge discounts widened to $5 and $6 less than April
contracts on London''s ICE Futures Europe exchange, the Platts
survey showed. That compares with $4.25 to $4.50 on April 1.
Morgan Stanley and BP Plc sold to Mercuria Energy Trading SA,
Statoil ASA, Glencore International AG and Vitol. </p>
<p>Jet fuel barge premiums were little changed at $79 a ton
more than ICE gasoil, according to the Platts survey. Morgan
Stanley and Vitol bought from North Sea Group, Gekol
Mineraloelhandel, BP and Lukoil, the trading arm of OAO Lukoil. </p>
<p>April gasoil on ICE gained $10, or 1 percent, to $1,010.50
a ton as of 5:08 p.m. London time. The more active May contract
advanced 0.9 percent to $1,005.50. </p>
<p>ICE gasoil is moving to a greater backwardation in the
first two nearby months and that will continue to work against
holding distillates in storage, Jakob said, referring to a
situation where prompt supplies sell at a premium to later
delivery contracts. </p>
<p>The rise in gasoil, used as a benchmark for diesel, may
curtail demand for the motor fuel, he said. </p>
<p>Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at premiums of $12.50
to April gasoil versus $14.50 to $15 on April 1, the survey
showed. BP was the only seller, while Mabanaft, Vitol and Total
were the main buyers. </p>
<p>Residues </p>
<p>Low-sulfur fuel oil barges traded from $699 to $701 a ton,
the survey showed. That''s up from $678 to $688 in the previous
session. The high-sulfur grade changed hands from $637 to $639 a
ton, compared with $626 to $628 on April 1. Fuel oil is used to
power ships and generate electricity. </p>
<p>Refinery </p>
<p>TNK-BP, BP''s Russian venture, started planned maintenance
at its oil Ryazan refinery today, Dmitry Sergeev, a Moscow-based
spokesman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The refinery has a capacity to process 340,000 barrels a
day of oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has finished a
turnaround at its Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana and
operations have returned to normal, Kevin Allexon, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Allexon, based in Fairfax, Virginia, said in a Feb. 8
message that work on a fluid catalytic cracker and associated
units would last several weeks. </p>
<p>Catalytic crackers are the main gasoline-making units at a
refinery. The Baton Rouge plant, second-largest in the U.S.
after Exxon''s refinery in Baytown, Texas, has a fluid catalytic
cracking capacity of 243,000 barrels a day, according to the
U.S. Energy Department''s Energy Information Administration. </p>
<p>The Baton Rouge refinery processes domestic crudes from
Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alaska, according to the
company''s website. It also imports crude from Mexico, the North
Sea, West Africa, South America, Central America and the Arabian
Gulf. </p>
<p>The plant can process 525,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC), a boutique
hotelier, agreed to sell the Royalton and Morgans hotels in New
York City to FelCor Lodging Trust Inc. (FCH) for $140 million to help
reduce debt. </p>
<p>The hotels were valued at about $500,000 per room, New
York-based Morgans said in a statement today. The company, which
expects $100 million in net proceeds from the sale, will
continue to manage both properties under a 15-year agreement. </p>
<p>This is a terrific outcome and an important continuation
in our shift toward an asset light'' business model, allowing us
to focus on higher-margin management and branding
opportunities, Morgans Chief Executive Officer Michael Gross
said in the statement. </p>
<p>Morgans has been seeking to cut debt and said it would use
the proceeds from the sale to further reduce its load. The
company in October won extensions for loans backed by its Hudson
New York hotel in Manhattan and the Mondrian Los Angeles after
paying down a portion of the money owed on the two properties. </p>
<p>The hotelier will pay $37.7 million in debt with the
proceeds from the Royalton and Morgans sale. The transaction
will terminate a credit line that had been backed by the
properties and the Delano hotel in Miami, Morgans said. </p>
<p>FelCor, an Irving, Texas-based real estate investment
trust, said in a separate statement that it expects to complete
the deal in the second quarter. The Royalton and Morgans hotels
will be the company''s first properties in New York. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
estimate of first-quarter U.S. economic growth by a percentage
point to 2.5 percent and said there are risks to the outlook. </p>
<p>First-quarter gross domestic product was held down by
temporary factors, including poor weather, Jan Hatzius, chief
U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote in an e-
mailed note. The risks to our second-half GDP forecast of 4
percent also remain on the downside following higher energy
costs, tighter fiscal policy and weaker economic data. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter and the Commerce Department is scheduled to
release an estimate of first-quarter GDP on April 28. Still, the
risks are skewed toward an earlier interest rate increase
from the Federal Reserve than the first quarter of 2013 as
currently forecast by Goldman Sachs, said Hatzius. </p>
<p>The basic story of good growth, low inflation and
friendly monetary policy that we have been telling since late
last year still stands, said Hatzius. But it''s all a little
messier than we would like. </p>

<p>Emerging market credit in Asia will
outperform the U.S. as inflation in the region moderates,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), reversing a December
stance that favored developed countries. </p>
<p>The pace of Asian central bank policy tightening will be
more moderate than the market feared, Goldman Sachs credit
strategists led by Lotfi Karoui and Annie Chu in New York said
in a report dated April 1. That contrasts with the U.S. and
Europe, where the European Central Bank is likely to raise rates
this week and the Federal Reserve may confirm the end of its
quantitative easing program in June, they wrote. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps beat the Markit iTraxx Asia index of swaps
by the most ever in the fourth quarter of 2010 on concern
inflation in Asia would force central bank rate increases. That
trend went into reverse last month, with the gap between the two
gauges shrinking the most on record. </p>
<p>This performance gap looks less justified now, the
strategists said. Economic activity in several countries is
slowing in response to policy tightening, which suggests that
inflation pressures will subside in the upcoming quarters. This
healthier macro backdrop should in our opinion allow the recent
underperformance of Asia ex-Japan to reverse. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Asia index, which investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, narrowed to 104 basis points, 10.5 higher than
the U.S. gauge, the tightest level since November, CMA data
show. The gap widened to 29 basis points on Feb. 22. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps, which typically rise as investor
confidence deteriorates and fall as it improves, pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>

<p>William Montgomery, a senior Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) banker to the oil and gas industry, is leaving
the firm''s Houston office and plans to join a local private-
equity firm, said a person with knowledge of his plans. </p>
<p>Montgomery, 49, may join Quantum Energy Partners later this
year, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. His
retirement is effective May 31, Goldman Sachs said in a
memorandum last month that was confirmed by Andrea Rachman, a
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Montgomery was part of Goldman Sachs teams that advised
Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), the largest oilfield services company, on its
$11 billion acquisition of Smith International Inc. last year,
and counseled Apache Corp. (APA) on its $7 billion purchase of assets
from BP Plc (BP/) in the wake of the London-based oil company''s Gulf
of Mexico spill. </p>
<p>After joining Goldman Sachs from Merrill Lynch  Co. in
2000, Montgomery became a partner in 2002, the memo said. He
headed the natural resources investment banking group in the
Americas from 2003 to 2007. Outside of his banking work, he is a
former chairman of the board of trustees of the Houston Museum
of Natural Science and of the St. Francis Episcopal Day School. </p>
<p>Quantum, founded in Houston in 1998 by a group including
Wil VanLoh Jr., manages $5.7 billion of investments in the
energy industry, according to its website. It raised its fifth,
$2.5 billion fund in 2009. </p>
<p>Beverly Jernigan, a spokeswoman for Quantum, had no
immediate comment. </p>
<p>London to Houston </p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs banker in London, Suhail Sikhtian, will
move to Houston and become co-chief operating officer of the
global natural resources group along with Stephan Feldgoise,
Goldman Sachs said in a separate memo last month. Steve Daniel
remains head of the Houston office, and is co-head of energy
globally along with Alastair Maxwell, the memo said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs worked on $63.8 billion of mergers and
acquisitions in the oil and gas industry over the past 12

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) are forming a partnership to develop in-car electronics
systems that help battery-powered vehicles run more efficiently. </p>
<p>The companies will jointly invest 1 billion yen ($11.7
million) in Toyota Media Service Co., a Toyota subsidiary that
provides data services to drivers, the companies said in a
statement today. The system will include navigation and in-car
entertainment using Microsoft''s Windows Azure software. It will
also manage energy use in vehicles. </p>
<p>Automakers are adding a broader range of entertainment and
power-saving tools to entice buyers to adopt electric vehicles.
Microsoft needs more customers to ensure success for Azure, its
cloud software for enabling companies to build and provide
software that can be delivered as a service over the Internet. </p>
<p>Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer and Toyota
President Akio Toyoda plan to discuss the project with reporters
later today. The system relies on so-called telematics, which
involve the integration of wireless communications and computing
systems, often in vehicle navigation. </p>
<p>General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) have expanded the
range of technology services available in cars as well. Ford,
for instance, also offers an in-car electronics system developed
with Microsoft. </p>
<p>Toyota aims to distinguish its system by including features
that can improve a vehicle''s energy efficiency. An electric
car''s range can vary significantly based on how drivers use
heating and cooling systems, and other in-car functions powered
by electricity. </p>
<p>Managing Energy Use </p>
<p>Toyota, based in Toyota City, Japan, said it''s already
testing a telematics system in its home country that links
drivers, cars and homes to help manage energy consumption.
Toyota plans next year to start selling a plug-in version of its
Prius hybrid. It also plans a tiny two-passenger electric car
and a rechargeable RAV4 sport-utility vehicle with a battery
system from Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) </p>
<p>The partnership between Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Washington, and Toyota is an important step in developing
greater future mobility and energy management for consumers
around the world, Toyota''s Toyoda said in the statement. </p>
<p>Toyota has been an early customer for Azure, with the
carmaker saying last year that it was using the software to
track thousands of roadside assistance calls for its Lexus cars.
Azure competes with programs from Amazon.com Inc., Google Inc.

<p>Cesare Geronzi, chairman of
Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), resigned today, after clashes with
board members over his role at Italy''s biggest insurer. </p>
<p>Geronzi stepped down because of differences that prevent
his involvement with the company, Generali said in a stock-
exchange statement. It didn''t elaborate. Geronzi quit after at
least 10 directors were prepared to support a no-confidence
motion against him at the board meeting today, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Geronzi, 76, drew criticism from directors including Diego Della Valle, founder of the Tod''s SpA luxury goods company, who
accused the non-executive chairman of interfering with top
management. In the last month, Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of
eyewear maker Luxottica Group SpA, and Banco Santander SA''s Ana Patricia Botin resigned from Generali''s board, sparking concerns
about the company''s governance. </p>
<p>This is clearly good news for the entire Italian system
as the most powerful man in the industry from a political
standpoint has quit, Atanasio Pantarrotas, an analyst at CA
Cheuvreux, wrote in a note today. In our view, it is a triumph
of management governance against political power games. This
explains the reaction of the stock to this news. </p>
<p>Generali rose as much as 5.7 percent, and closed up 3
percent to 15.93 euros in Milan, giving the company a market
value of 24.8 billion euros ($35.6 billion). The Bloomberg
Europe 500 Insurance Index has risen 14 percent in the past six
months, compared with Generali''s 9 percent increase. </p>
<p>Extraordinary Meeting </p>
<p>Geronzi called today''s extraordinary meeting to discuss the
company''s governance after director Vincent Bollore abstained
from the board''s approval of 2010 earnings over concerns about
the company''s joint venture with PPF Group NV. </p>
<p>Generali needs to be more transparent about its investments
in eastern Europe and Russia, Bollore told Italian daily
Corriere Della Sera in an interview published March 19. </p>
<p>He told the newspaper the partnership in eastern Europe
with PPF group is unbalanced and an investment in VTB Group
overvalues the Russian bank. Geronzi sparked criticism from
directors including Della Valle when he said in an interview
with the Financial Times on Feb. 16 that the insurer might
invest in Italian banks. </p>
<p>Geronzi, a former chairman of investment bank Mediobanca
SpA, was appointed to the Generali post a year ago, replacing
Antoine Bernheim. </p>
<p>Geronzi became chairman of Mediobanca''s supervisory board
in 2007 after the bank''s investors reinstated him to the
position. He had been temporarily removed after a court-imposed
suspension following his conviction in connection with the
bankruptcy of property and tourism company Italcase. </p>
<p>That conviction was overturned on appeal. </p>

<p>At least 10 directors were prepared to support a no-
confidence motion against Geronzi at a board meeting today in
Rome, according to one person. </p>
<p>Geronzi, 76, clashed with board members including Vincent Bollore over the company''s joint venture with PPF Group NV,

He told the newspaper the partnership in Eastern Europe with PPF

<p>Officials for Trieste-based Generali didn''t have an
immediate comment. A spokesman for Geronzi didn''t answer calls
to his mobile phone seeking comment. </p>
<p>Generali shares rose as much as 5.7 percent in Milan,

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s ESPN is allowing
owners of Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad and iPhone who subscribe to pay-
television service to watch its channels live on their devices. </p>
<p>WatchESPN, available today at Apple''s App Store, will
stream ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPN3 to Time Warner Cable, Bright
House Networks and Verizon FiOS TV subscribers, the Bristol,
Connecticut-based sports network said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>ESPN, the most-watched U.S. sports channel, plans to start
inserting commercials into the video streams in August, said
Sean Bratches, executive vice president of sales and marketing.
Currently ads aren''t displayed when programs break for
commercials. ESPN is talking with Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) and
Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) about their use of its networks on the
companies'' respective iPad apps, he said. </p>
<p>Our vision is to sell a dedicated and unique stream of
advertising on the iPhone and iPad platforms, Bratches said in
an interview. We''re also experimenting with a different form
of advertising that will be more interactive. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 23 cents to
$42.04 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 12 percent this year. </p>
<p>Watching From Anywhere </p>
<p>Unlike apps from Time Warner Cable and Cablevision, which
restrict viewing to a subscriber''s home, ESPN lets viewers watch
from any location, Bratches said. </p>
<p>Ads seen through streams on apps from the cable companies
aren''t counted by Nielsen Co., which provides viewership data
that is used to determine how much advertisers pay for
commercials. Nielsen is working on a system to count online and
mobile viewing. </p>
<p>ESPN''s ad revenue from online and mobile viewing, although
small at first, will grow and add to the network''s total
revenue, Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York,
said in an interview. </p>
<p>This is a natural evolution, Greenfield said. It
shows the complexity of a world that relies on living-room
viewing transitioning to one where people watch television
anywhere and everywhere. </p>
<p>To access the channels, users of ESPN''s app must supply
cable-account information after downloading the free software. A
version optimized for the iPad will be released in May, the
company said. ESPN said it plans to make the software available
on other phones and tablets in the near future. </p>
<p>WatchESPN is customized for each viewer''s location to
comply with league contracts, Bratches said. </p>
<p>This is totally mobile, Bratches said. Whether
traveling, commuting or at a kids soccer game, you will have
complete access. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, will contribute assets including a 281,581-square-
foot building leased to a brewery to help its bankrupt, non-
operating Quigley unit pay asbestos claims. </p>
<p>Quigley''s sixth outline of a plan to reorganize, filed in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan yesterday, also would require
Pfizer to forgive a secured claim of $86 million, a bankruptcy
loan of $12.6 million and unsecured claims of $33 million. The
drugmaker would also contribute $81 million in insurance
proceeds, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Pfizer will pay $42 million to acquire a commercial
property consisting of an approximately 281,581 square foot
building on approximately 12 acres of land, according to court
papers. The building is leased to a distributor for a leading
brewery company, the filing said. </p>
<p>The lease will produce net income of $1.9 million for the
first year of the lease, with the amount increasing over time,
the papers said. The location of the building and name of the
beer company aren''t specified. </p>
<p>Chris Loder, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer, didn''t
immediately return a call for comment. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein refused to allow
Quigley to exit Chapter 11 court protection in September, saying
Pfizer had manipulated the process to benefit itself. Pfizer and
a committee of asbestos claimants won his approval of an
agreement that will support the new Chapter 11 plan, which still
requires court approval. </p>
<p>Steel Industry </p>
<p>Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped most
operations in 1992. Pfizer said it never made or sold any
Quigley products, and some claimants hadn''t released Pfizer from
alleged derivative liability. </p>
<p>This ensures that asbestos claimants are not compelled to
surrender their derivative claims against Pfizer without
appropriate compensation, Quigley wrote in the plan. The plan
would give a 7.5 percent distribution to Quigley claims, and
give 23 percent of the liquidated claim value to claimants who
haven''t dismissed derivative claims against Pfizer. </p>
<p>Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. As under prior proposals, Pfizer will
also contribute $264.9 million in cash and all of the stock in a
reorganized Quigley to a trust to pay asbestos claims. </p>
<p>Pfizer in November reported a $701 million third-quarter
charge for asbestos litigation for Quigley. The ad hoc committee
representing 43,100 asbestos claimants asked the court to lift
an injunction that has barred them from bringing claims against
Pfizer since 2004, when Quigley filed for bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), angling to reap more than 5 percent of its revenue from
cloud computing by 2015, is introducing new ways for customers
to run business software inside its data centers. </p>
<p>IBM will begin selling the computing service, called
SmartCloud, today to help large companies save money on
equipment and software by letting them store data on IBM''s
servers and access it over the Internet. Lockheed Martin Corp.,
Macy''s Inc., ING Groep N.V. and Kaiser Permanente are among
companies that use IBM''s cloud-computing technology and may be
target customers for SmartCloud, the company said. </p>
<p>SmartCloud software offers companies ways to analyze data,
plan orders and deliveries and manage sales. The initiative is
part of a push by IBM, the world''s largest computer-services
company, to post $7 billion in cloud-related sales in 2015, a
goal laid out by Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge on
March 8. Total revenue may reach $123 billion that year, the
average of analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>It''s a gargantuan number, Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Gleacher  Co. in San Francisco, said of the $7 billion goal.
While IBM hasn''t laid out its cloud plans as comprehensively as
Wall Street would like, this push will help it sell hardware and
software, he said. It will give them a double dip. </p>
<p>Marshall rates the shares neutral and doesn''t own any. </p>
<p>IBM rose 34 cents to $164.38 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, and has gained 12 percent this year. </p>
<p>Security Anxieties'' </p>
<p>IBM is distinguishing its approach from rivals including
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc., which sell
cloud services to independent software developers and larger
companies based on the amount of time they use the services and
how much data they consume. </p>
<p>By contrast, SmartCloud is designed to run parts of very
large companies'' key business applications, emphasizing security
and reliability, Senior Vice President Steve Mills said in an
interview. IBM''s cloud will let customers tailor data security,
regulatory compliance and backup features based on their needs. </p>
<p>There are a lot of concerns and anxieties that larger
businesses have that startups and three-man companies aren''t
concerned about, said Mills, who manages systems and software
at IBM. It''s not a one-size-fits-all world. </p>
<p>Growth Driver </p>
<p>IBM has a history of making emerging technologies safe for
skeptical chief information officers. It made personal computers
acceptable for companies in the early 1980s, then ratified
parallel processing -- which breaks down calculations into small
chunks handled by hundreds of chips -- with its chess-playing
Deep Blue supercomputer in the 1990s. In 2000, IBM said it would
invest $1 billion in the open-source Linux operating system to
improve its capabilities and expand its use. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano has identified cloud
computing as a key growth area, along with data analysis, sales
in emerging markets, and IBM''s Smarter Planet initiative to make
buildings, hospitals, and highways more efficient. Together,
they can contribute about $20 billion in revenue growth by 2015
Loughridge said. </p>
<p>At an IBM event in San Francisco today, Mills said the
SmartCloud services could be as profitable as hardware and
software IBM would have otherwise sold customers to perform
similar tasks. </p>
<p>We don''t see this as diminishing profitability, he
said. IBM can save on packaging costs by delivering software and
computing power as a service, though it would recognize some
revenue later than it would with traditional sales. SmartCloud
will also create technology-services revenue as customers seek
to connect their data centers to IBM''s, Mills said. </p>
<p>Forecast </p>
<p>The company''s revenue forecast includes cloud computing and
online software for tasks such as collaboration, data analysis,
sales lead management and supply chain management, IBM said in a
statement. It also includes hardware sales to companies building
private clouds. </p>
<p>They''re not the first mover, but they''re pretty confident
about their ability to win in cloud computing, Brian Stevens,
chief technology officer at Linux software provider Red Hat
Inc. (RHT), said in an interview. IBM''s absolutely going to be a
strong player. Red Hat and IBM have a partnership to supply
Linux to customers. </p>
<p>IBM has an advantage in its existing massive data centers,
which are already equipped to handle customers'' needs, Stevens
said. What''s less clear is whether IBM can convince developers
to use its service instead of the popular Amazon Web Services,
which claims hundreds of thousands of customers, Bloomberg
Businessweek reported last month. </p>
<p>They don''t have the pioneering mindshare of Amazon, he
said. </p>
<p>Development Tools </p>
<p>IBM has taken steps to remedy that gap. A year ago, it
began selling versions of its development tools, middleware, and
database software that programmers can access over the Web to
build apps. In 2007, IBM and Google started a project to connect
universities with computing clouds using open-source software. </p>
<p>More companies are making forays into the market. Hewlett-
Packard said last month it would expand its cloud-computing
offerings within a year. Microsoft said in October it signed up
customers including Toyota Motor Corp., 3M Co. and Lockheed
Martin for its cloud software, called Windows Azure. </p>
<p>SmartCloud will support hardware and operating systems
including Linux, Windows, IBM''s AIX, and the Solaris system
Oracle Corp. (ORCL) got when it bought Sun Microsystems last year.
SmartCloud will also let customers choose storage computers from
IBM and EMC Corp. and a variety of databases, Mills said.
Customers will be able to perform tasks including maintenance
chores on Oracle databases and business applications from SAP. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin America''s
largest soft-drink bottler, plans to sell peso bonds for the
first time in two years before the central bank starts raising
interest rates from a record low. </p>
<p>The bottler, known as KOF, next week will sell 5 billion
pesos of fixed-rate bonds due 2021 and floating-rate notes due
2016, said Roland Karig, a spokesman in Mexico City. The fixed-
rate notes may yield 105 basis points more than government debt,
or about 8.50 percent, according to Scotia Capital Inc. Similar-
maturity bonds from America Movil SAB, which shares KOF''s A-
credit rating from Standard  Poor''s, yield 8.48 percent. </p>
<p>The fastest expansion in a decade in Latin America''s
second-biggest economy is prompting traders to bet that the
central bank will boost benchmark lending rates from 4.5 percent
as soon as August. Mexico is the only major country in the
region that hasn''t increased borrowing costs in the past year.
Brazil raised rates five times and Chile nine times as inflation
rose and commodity prices climbed to the highest in more than
two years. </p>
<p>It''s a good moment to go to the market, Karig said in a
telephone interview. Considering the outlook, many banks are
suggesting that in the coming months they may raise rates. </p>
<p>Inflation Outlook </p>
<p>While Mexico''s inflation dropped to a four-year low of 3.04
percent in March, the pace of economic growth is fueling concern
that price increases will pick up later this year, according to
Sergio Luna, the head economist at Citigroup Inc.''s Banamex unit
in Mexico City. The economy may expand as much as 5 percent this
year after 5.5 percent growth in 2010, the most in a decade,
Finance Minister Ernesto Cordero said last month. </p>
<p>Everyone is trying to take advantage of the low rates,
said Alonso Madero, who helps manage about $5.5 billion of debt
at Corp. Actinver SAB in Mexico City. We''re definitely going
to participate in KOF''s debt sale, he said. </p>
<p>The central bank will raise rates by 75 basis points, or
0.75 percentage point, by the end of the year, according to
trading in TIIE, or interbank rate futures contracts. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Companies still may have time to sell debt before rates
head up, a survey showed. The central bank will resume increases
in January, according to the median economist estimate in an
April 4 survey by Banamex. </p>
<p>Rates on Hold </p>
<p>This year rates aren''t going to move, said Ricardo Aguilar, an economist with Invex Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico
City. Inflation will begin to accelerate, but within the
expectations of Banco de Mexico. </p>
<p>Karig said the company will use proceeds from the bond sale
to pay debt maturing in 2012 and bolster cash reserves. Coca-
Cola Femsa became the world''s largest franchise for Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola Co.''s namesake beverage in October. Mexico City-
based KOF''s profit rose 6.9 percent to 3.02 billion pesos in the
fourth quarter. </p>
<p>This is about taking advantage of the market in regards
to rates and the spread, Eduardo Uribe, an analyst with
Standard  Poor''s in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican dollar
bonds instead of Treasuries fell 3 basis points to 126,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>Credit-Default Swaps </p>
<p>The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years fell four basis points to 97, according to CMA prices
in New York. Brazilian credit-default swaps dropped three basis
points to 107 and the U.S. swaps were little changed at 41.1
basis points. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or cash equivalent if the
issuer fails to comply with debt agreements. </p>
<p>The peso gained 0.4 percent to 11.73050 per dollar. The
currency is up 5.2 percent this year. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa shares were little changed at 94.99 pesos.
Its parent company, Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, whose
holdings include the Oxxo convenience store chain and Dos Equis
beer, rose 0.3 percent to 71.36 pesos. </p>
<p>Mexican companies sold 62.8 billion pesos in local bonds in
the first quarter, the fastest start on record. </p>
<p>There''s a sense that this is the floor for interest
rates, said Luna, the economist. From the point of view of
the corporate market, it''s a good time to sell debt. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software company, sued a unit of the U.K.''s Amphion Innovations
Plc (AMP), seeking a court declaration that two patents are invalid. </p>
<p>According to the complaint filed yesterday in federal court
in Manhattan, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said Aphion''s
DataTern unit has sued other companies for infringing the
patents and, in their court papers, referenced Microsoft
software. </p>
<p>In dispute are patents 5,937,402, issued in August 1999,
and 6,101,502, issued in August 2000. Both patents deal with
relational databases and software. On April 4, DataTern filed a
patent infringement suit in federal court in Marshall, Texas,
accusing 11 companies in a variety of industries of infringing
one of the two patents that is the subject of the Microsoft case
against DataTern. </p>
<p>Among the companies DataTern sued in that case are General
Mills Inc. (GIS), Hewlett-Packard Co. and Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) </p>
<p>In its suit against DataTern, Microsoft said that some of
the defendants sued by DataTern have asked Microsoft to defend
them in the patent-infringement case, or to provide them with
indemnification. This has placed a cloud over Microsoft and
its products and has injured the Redmond, Washington-based
company''s business and business relationships, Microsoft said in
its pleadings. </p>
<p>DataTern has filed four additional infringement suits since
June 2009 relating to one or both of the patents that are the
subjects of Microsoft''s suits, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Microsoft claims a large number of defendants have been
dismissed from those cases, which, the software company says,
resulted in payment to DataTern. </p>
<p>Microsoft argued in its court papers that both patents are
invalid because elements of each invention were not new. </p>
<p>It asked the court to declare it hasn''t infringed either
patent or induces others to infringe them. It also asked for
awards of attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>Microsoft is represented by Dale M. Heist, Steve J. Rocci
Aleksander J. Goranin and Daniel J. Goettle of Woodcock Washburn
LLP of Philadelphia, and Danielle L. Rose, Michael S. Kim and
Carrie A. Tendler of Kobre  Kim LLP of New York. </p>
<p>The case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. DataTern Inc., 1:11-cv-
02365, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>ZTE Says Ericsson Lawsuit Won''t Have Adverse Impact on Business </p>
<p>ZTE Corp. (763), a Chinese telecommunications equipment maker
that''s being sued by Ericsson AB for alleged patent
infringement, said the lawsuit won''t have any material and
adverse impact on the company''s financial conditions and
operations. </p>
<p>Business in the U.K. accounted for a very small share
of ZTE''s overall operating revenue, the company said in a

<p>Todd Thomson''s Headwaters Sued For Trademark Infringement </p>
<p>Headwaters Capital LLC, the private-equity fund begun in
2007 by Todd Thomson, the former chief financial officer of
Citigroup Inc. (C), was sued for trademark infringement by a Denver-
based merchant bank. </p>
<p>Headwaters MB LLC, which registered its name as a trademark
in July 2001, said it has invested almost $2.5 million in
advertising and promotion of its mark. The company claims that
consumers associate Headwaters as a provider of top-level
investment and merchant banking and private-equity investment
services. </p>
<p>According to the complaint filed April 5 in federal court
in Nashville, Tennessee, the Colorado company became aware of
Headwaters Capital in August 2010, and the company claims it
received numerous calls and e-mails from people who mistakenly
believe the entities are connected. </p>
<p>The company sent Headwaters Capital a cease-and-desist
letter in October 2010, and, in a Nov. 2 letter, demanded that
the New York-based company agree to a three-month phase-out of
its use of the Headwaters trademark. </p>
<p>The two companies'' names and Internet domain names are so
similar in terms of appearance, sound, meaning and connation
that consumers are confused, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Headwaters MB asked the court to bar the New York company''s
use of the name, and for awards of money damages, profits
derived from Headwater Capital''s alleged infringement, extra
damages to punish the New York company for its actions, and
awards of attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>Andy Merrill, a spokesman for Thomson, said in an e-mail
statement that the allegations contained in the complaint are
entirely without merit and we look forward to addressing them in
court. </p>
<p>Headwaters MB is represented by Paige Waldrop Mills of Bass
Berry  Smims PLC of Nashville. </p>
<p>The case is Headwaters MB LLC v. Headwaters Capital LLC,
3:11-cv-00333, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee
(Nashville). </p>
<p>American Eagle Outfitters Sues Furniture Chain for Infringement </p>
<p>American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO), a Pittsburgh-based clothing
chain with more than 900 retail outlets, sued a Chicago
furniture company for trademark infringement. </p>
<p>The complaint, filed April 1 in federal court in Chicago,
accuses American Eagle Furniture Inc., of infringing trademarks
by moving into retail operations in shopping malls beginning in
February 2010. Before that, the furniture company had
historically operated as a wholesale vendor and hadn''t used
American Eagle Furniture as a service mark or a trademark,
according to court papers. </p>
<p>The clothing company says it sent multiple cease-and-desist
letters to the furniture company and received no response. It
claims that the furniture company is using American Eagle
Furniture in a deliberate and willful attempt to draw on the
goodwill and commercial magnetism of the clothing stores''
marks. </p>
<p>It asked the court to order the furniture company to quit
using American Eagle Furniture and to cancel any advertising
in which it uses that mark. Additionally, it asked for an award
of three times the profits the furniture company derived from
its alleged infringement, plus money damages, and asked that the
damages be tripled. </p>
<p>American Eagle also asked for awards of attorney fees and
litigation costs. </p>
<p>American Eagle Furniture didn''t respond immediately to an
e-mailed request for comment. </p>
<p>American Eagle Outfitters is represented by Debra R.
Bernard and Jeremy L. Buxbaum of Seattle''s Perkins Coie LLP. </p>
<p>The case is American Eagle Outfitters Inc., v. American
Eagle Furniture Inc., 1:11-cv-02242, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). </p>
<p>Cleveland Woman Acquitted of Criminal Trademark Infringement </p>
<p>A Cleveland, Ohio, resident was acquitted of a criminal
trademark case, WFMJ.com television news reported. </p>
<p>Valerie Edwards was charged with criminal infringement
after police found counterfeit DVDs in the trunk of her car
during a traffic stop, according to WFMJ.com. </p>
<p>Edwards said she was given the videos to be donated to the
Boys Club of Cleveland, WFMJ.com reported. </p>
<p>Louboutin Sues Yves Saint Laurent Over Red-Sole Shoes </p>
<p>Christian Louboutin SA, the designer of expensive red-sole
women''s shoes popularized by characters on Sex and the City,
sued Yves Saint Laurent America Inc., alleging it violated
Louboutin''s trademark for the footwear. </p>
<p>Louboutin, based in Paris, said Yves Saint Laurent is
selling shoes with red soles that are virtually identical to
its own, according to a suit filed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan. It seeks a court injunction against the sale of the
shoes and damages of at least $1 million. </p>
<p>Saint Laurent has been selling red-sole shoes under brand
names such as Tribute, Palais and Woodstock at high-end fashion
stores that also sell Louboutin footwear, including Saks Fifth
Avenue, Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>Defendants'' use of a red sole on their infringing
footwear threatens to mislead the public, and has impaired
plaintiffs'' ability to control their reputation, Louboutin
said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Bridget Helene, a spokeswoman for New York-based Yves Saint
Laurent America, said in an e-mail that the company had no
comment. </p>
<p>The designer Louboutin got the idea for the red-sole shoes
when he painted red nail polish on the black soles of a pair of
women''s shoes, the complaint states. He introduced the red soles
in 1992 and since then they have been on all of the company''s
luxury shoes, according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>On Barneys'' website, Louboutin red-sole shoes are priced
from $445 to more than $4,000 a pair. Vanity Fair magazine
reported in May 2010 that San Francisco-based romance writer
Danielle Steel owns 6,000 pairs of Louboutin shoes, buying every
item in his collection each season. </p>
<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded Louboutin a
trademark for the red sole in 2008, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Louboutin was informed by Yves Saint Laurent executives by
letter in January that they planned to continue to sell the
infringing footwear, the lawsuit states. </p>
<p>Yves Saint Laurent is a unit of Paris-based PPR (PP), which owns
Gucci and other luxury brands. </p>
<p>Saint Laurent, the Algeria-born French fashion designer,
died in 2008. </p>
<p>Louboutin has filed three other trademark infringement
suits in federal court in Manhattan since December 2009,
according to Bloomberg data. All three have been dismissed, with
permanent court orders against the defendants barring future
infringement. None of those suits was against a well-known
couture house such as Saint Laurent.      The new case is
Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves Saint Laurent America Inc., 11-
2381, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and its state-owned
China partner will invest about $4.4 billion building a resort
in Shanghai, the entertainment company''s second amusement park
in the world''s most-populous nation. </p>
<p>The Shanghai Disney Resort will open in about five years
and be the first in mainland China for the world''s biggest
theme-park operator, which opened Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005.
Shanghai Shendi Group Co. will own 57 percent of the resort with
Disney owning the rest, and financing will be proportional to
ownership, according to a statement today. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger called the investment a
defining moment as Disney bets on China''s rising middle
class to fuel growth, three years after the global financial
crisis hurt spending in the U.S. and Europe. The company
increased film production in the world''s fastest-growing major
economy and plans to open Disney stores there by 2012. </p>
<p>Disney has the strongest China strategy of all the media
companies, said Alan Gould, an analyst with Evercore Partners
in New York who recommends the stock. A longer-term goal is to
negotiate wider distribution of films in China and the creation
of a 24-hour television channel, he said. </p>
<p>Most Significant'' </p>
<p>The entertainment company may collect more than $200
million in annual management fees in a decade, plus licensing
revenue, Gould estimated. The park will attract 7.3 million
visitors annually, the Shanghai government said March 3. </p>
<p>Disney will hold a 70 percent stake in the management
company that will develop the resort and collect operating fees,
with Shanghai Shendi owning the rest. </p>
<p>This is our most significant investment in a market that
is experiencing dynamic growth, Iger, 60, said in a separate
phone interview. </p>
<p>Disney declined 23 cents to $42.04 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. The stock has gained 12
percent this year. </p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing area by
sales for the Burbank, California-based company, expanding 25
percent to $2.3 billion, which is 6.1 percent of total revenue,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Initial Investment </p>
<p>Disney and Shanghai Shendi today started building the
resort, which will occupy 963 acres (3.9 square kilometers) with
room to expand, the statement said. </p>
<p>The initial investment in the theme park will be about 24.5
billion yuan ($3.7 billion), according to the statement. Another
4.5 billion yuan will be spent building the rest of the resort,
which will include two hotels and retail, dining and
entertainment areas. </p>
<p>Shanghai Disneyland may be the first of three theme parks
on the resort''s 7 square kilometers (1,730 acres), according to
a local government website. </p>
<p>About 330 million people live within three hours by car or
train from the site, Disney said. Spending on domestic leisure
travel in China may double to more than $200 billion by 2015,
according to Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks  Resorts. </p>
<p>China is the most exciting opportunity we''ve had since
Walt first bought land in Florida in 1964, Staggs, 50, said at
a Feb. 17 investor presentation. </p>
<p>About 30 million Chinese enter the middle class each year,
he estimated. </p>
<p>Shanghai Expo </p>
<p>Hong Kong Disneyland, part-owned by the city government,
missed its forecast to attract 5.6 million visitors in its first
year and has yet to make a profit. The park, which narrowed its
annual loss to HK$720 million ($93 million) in the 12 months
ended Oct. 2, has been criticized for its small size, with
Disney saying it fell short of expectations. </p>
<p>Tourism growth in China and Asia will support both parks,
said Andrew Kam, managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland. </p>
<p>Every park has to go through its learning process, he
said today when asked if he had any advice to give to the
management of Shanghai park, which Staggs said will be larger. </p>
<p>Shanghai''s $44 billion World Expo attracted 73 million
visitors from May 1 to Oct. 31 last year, with its 5.28 square-
kilometer park drawing 1 million visitors on a single day, local
media reported. </p>
<p>What we saw at the Expo was a major learning process for
us, Iger said. Disney has been in communication with
China''s government for more than a decade, Iger said. </p>
<p>Absorb Large Crowd'' </p>
<p>Disney''s Shanghai park was designed around how to absorb
a large crowd and still give them a good experience, Staggs
said. </p>
<p>The Shanghai project will be financed 30 percent with debt
and 70 percent with equity, with the companies making
proportional investments based on ownership, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>Shanghai Disneyland may generate management fees of
$65 million-$70 million for the company in the first year and
more than $200 million annually within a decade, Gould said. </p>
<p>Disney also will collect a license fee of about 6 percent
on ticket sales, revenue for the use of its name on hotels and a
separate fee on merchandise, he said. </p>
<p>Theme parks contributed 28 percent of Disney''s $38.1
billion in full-year revenue and 17 percent of its $7.59 billion
in operating income. </p>
<p>Shanghai also plans to spend 4 billion yuan ($611 million)
on a 9.2-kilometer (5.7-mile) subway line to the theme park in
the city''s Pudong area. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) paid $421,458
in expenses related to the sale of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon''s Chicago house, which went under contract in September
after more than three years on the market. </p>
<p>The total includes $306,000 for real estate commissions and
fees for the eight-bedroom mansion, the New York-based bank said
in a regulatory filing yesterday. The home, located in Chicago''s
Gold Coast neighborhood, sold for $6.8 million, according to
documents on the website of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds. </p>
<p>The payment was made in accordance with the firm''s
general policy on relocation expenses, applicable to all
eligible employees who relocate at the request of the firm,
according to the JPMorgan filing. </p>
<p>Dimon, 55, moved to New York after JPMorgan''s 2004 purchase
of Bank One Corp., and kept the Chicago house while his children
completed high school, according to the filing. He listed the
property for $13.5 million in April 2007 before cutting the
asking price multiple times to as low as $6.95 million. </p>
<p>Chicago-area home prices declined 25 percent from April
2007 through September, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index
of values in the region. </p>
<p>Dimon and his wife, Judith, bought the 15,000-square-foot
(1,390-square-meter) property in 2000 for $4.7 million,
according to county records. The mansion, which has nine full
bathrooms and a 900-square-foot terrace, was built in the late
1800s and is near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) agreed to
acquire a stake in its proposed A$20 billion ($21 billion)
Wheatstone natural gas project in Western Australia. </p>
<p>Shell, Europe''s largest oil company, will gain 6.4 percent
of the liquefied natural gas plants and 8 percent of the fields
off northwest Australia that will supply the Wheatstone
development, Chevron said in an e-mailed statement today.
Financial terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Chevron has called the Wheatstone venture and the A$43
billion Gorgon LNG project the centerpieces of its global
growth plans. The Hague-based Shell also owns 25 percent of
Chevron-led Gorgon on Barrow Island, the largest of more than a
dozen LNG projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea seeking to
tap Asian demand for cleaner-burning alternatives to coal. </p>
<p>The Wheatstone venture initially will produce 8.9 million
metric tons of the fuel a year from two processing units, or
trains, when it begins in 2016, the company said last month. The
project may have as many as six units and produce as much as 25
million tons of LNG annually, Chevron said last July. </p>
<p>Chevron plans to make a decision in the second half of this
year to proceed with the project, it said today. Wheatstone is
estimated by Deutsche Bank AG to cost A$20 billion. </p>

<p>Doctors treating diabetes patients
for nerve-pain symptoms should consider Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Lyrica,
the best-studied drug for the condition, among 13 underutilized
treatments, new guidelines suggest. </p>
<p>Lyrica, with sales topping $3 billion last year, was the
only medicine that ranked in the top tier of the recommendations
as having very strong research supporting it, according to
the first guidelines for the condition issued today by the
American Academy of Neurology. Twelve additional treatments were
probably effective and should be weighed by physicians to
meet the individual needs of each patient. </p>
<p>About 16 percent of people with diabetes develop pain and
numbness from nerve damage caused by high blood-sugar levels,
according to the report. About 40 percent of patients with nerve
pain aren''t being treated for it, said guideline author Vera
Bril, professor of medicine at the University of Toronto. </p>
<p>The whole field has so many options, it gets confusing,
Bril said in a telephone interview from Honolulu, where the
guidelines were presented at the neurology academy''s annual
meeting. You have to choose the treatment that''s most suitable
for the patient. </p>
<p>Researchers combed through 2,234 research reports to find
the 79 most relevant studies, Bril said. One of the 13
recommended medicines with the greatest potential benefit is a
50-year-old depression treatment called amitriptyline. The drug
wasn''t included in the top level of recommendations because the
studies for it weren''t as comprehensive as more recent clinical
trials, Bril said. </p>
<p>The guidelines also identified nine treatments that aren''t
recommended to treat the nerve pain, including the epilepsy
drugs Trileptal, made by Novartis AG (NOVN), and Lamictal, by
GlaxoSmithKline, as well as magnetic-field treatment and low-
intensity laser therapy. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asked a judge
to dismiss claims filed by three retirement funds alleging the
company, with the complicity of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, ignored its duty to protect $500 million in notes while
gaining $1.7 billion in profits from secured investments. </p>
<p>JPMorgan knowingly and intentionally enriched itself
despite having actual knowledge that its actions would
substantially impair the financial interests of noteholders,
three pension plans contend in court papers filed in federal
court in Manhattan as part of a 2009 lawsuit. </p>
<p>The bank''s decision to enrich itself included direct
involvement by Jamie Dimon, the funds'' lawyers said in a March
31 brief. </p>
<p>These accusations are false and have no basis in fact,
Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, said today in an e-
mail. </p>
<p>The undisputed evidence shows that JPMorgan Chase''s
commercial and fiduciary businesses were separated, thus
preventing any arguable conflict, the bank''s lawyers wrote
in a brief seeking judgment in their favor. </p>
<p>The lawsuit centers on JPMorgan''s 2007 purchase for the
funds of $500 million in medium-term notes secured by assets of
Sigma Finance, an offshore investment vehicle. The bank is
accused by the plaintiffs, who ended up with about 6 cents on
the dollar, of knowing Sigma would fail. </p>
<p>Deep Discounts </p>
<p>They allege JPMorgan made money in another deal by
secretly providing repurchase financing to Sigma secured by
high-quality assets in large blocks at deep discounts to
capitalize on very big money making opportunities as the
market deteriorates, according to court papers. </p>
<p>From the start, Dimon was keenly interested in Sigma''s
assets, and sought a very real picture of the assets that
will be unwound, according to one JPMorgan employee''s e-mail
cited in the funds'' brief. </p>
<p>In another e-mail between senior JPMorgan officials,
the company acknowledged before the repurchase completion that
Sigma is unlikely to continue as a going concern, according
to court papers. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was unchanged at $46.84 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 3:35 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-00686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>China''s economic growth will spur
gains for upstream commodity producers, consumer companies
and banks, according to Jing Ulrich, chairwoman of China
equities and commodities at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>China will continue to lead the developing world and fuel
the need for raw materials, Ulrich told reporters today in
Shanghai. Commodities will be a bright spot for the
foreseeable future. </p>
<p>China''s increasing dependence on commodity imports like
iron ore, coal, copper and oil will drive global demand, Ulrich
said. This will benefit natural resource producers in Australia
and Latin America, while the government''s plan to expand
spending in infrastructure and affordable housing will help
boost the earnings of cement producers including Anhui Conch
Cement Co. </p>
<p>Consumer companies such as Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding
Corp., China''s biggest maker of packaged food, will maintain
profit margins even as they face pressure from higher wage costs
given the outlook for consumption growth over the next five
years, Ulrich said. China''s lenders will benefit from higher net
interest margins as borrowing costs rise, she said. </p>

<p>For Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
is ramping up efforts to arrange takeovers and stock sales in
India, progress can be slow and profit from deals elusive. </p>
<p>The New York-based company that dominated global merger
advisers for most of the past decade spent three years working
on the transaction that vaulted it to second from ninth place in
India. Its first share sale in India this year may be a $1.3
billion offer from state-owned Power Finance Corp., for which it
will split a fee of 1 rupee (2 cents) with three other banks. </p>
<p>It''s a hugely competitive market, Manisha Girotra,
chief executive officer of UBS AG (UBSN)''s India operations, said in an
interview. There are too many local and international banks.
Everyone is here because the promise is huge. </p>
<p>India is a proving ground for Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein''s strategy to be Goldman Sachs in more places. One
roadblock: The firm lacks licenses that will allow it to trade
currencies and underwrite government bonds in India. Goldman
Sachs also has to figure out how to squeeze profit from a market
where companies are reluctant to pay for advising on mergers and
banks accept near-zero fees for taking state enterprises public. </p>
<p>Indian clients are very cost-sensitive when it comes to
fees, said Joel Perlman, president of London-based Copal
Partners, which provides research for investment banks and
private-equity firms. The fee percentage in India is going to
remain relatively small. </p>
<p>Chatterjee Appointment </p>
<p>To boost business, Goldman Sachs appointed Sonjoy Chatterjee, 42, as chairman of India operations in March. Having
joined last June from ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC), the nation''s second-
largest lender, Chatterjee is the first Indian-born banker to
lead the firm in the country since it ended a venture with Kotak
Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB) in 2006. Vijay Karnani, a 13-year Goldman
Sachs veteran, was promoted to co-CEO along with Chatterjee. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has climbed to No. 2 in mergers and
acquisitions and to 13th in arranging local equity sales in the
past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with ninth place in advising on MA involving Indian
companies and 16th in domestic equity underwriting in the four
years starting April 1, 2006, just after the firm ended its
partnership with Kotak Mahindra, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The firm''s advance in MA was helped by its role advising
Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL), headed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani.
Reliance, based in Mumbai, sold stakes in 23 oil and gas areas
in India to London-based BP Plc in February for $7.2 billion.
Goldman Sachs worked for three years on the deal, which was
delayed by a BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a person with
knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The relationship could lead to more MA work for Goldman
Sachs: Reliance was India''s most acquisitive company last year,
with nine deals totaling $2.2 billion, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Power Grid </p>
<p>The bank also agreed in the past year to manage a share
sale for state-owned Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. for about 4
cents in fees and to help finance Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)''s
acquisition of oil operator Cairn Energy Plc''s Indian unit for
as much as $9.6 billion, a deal in which Vedanta used its own
mergers team. </p>
<p>UBS''s Girotra estimates that total investment-banking fees
in India were about $550 million last year. Freeman  Co. LLC, a
New York-based research firm, puts the fee pool at $1 billion,
about one-fifth of the $4.9 billion for China. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s annual revenue in India is about $100
million, according to a March 21 report by Guy Moszkowski and
Steven J. Chubak, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) analysts who met in Hong
Kong last month with the firm''s senior management team for Asia.
That''s a quarter of a percent of the firm''s $39.2 billion of
revenue worldwide last year. </p>
<p>Banking License </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is the only major foreign securities firm in
India without either a commercial-banking license needed to
engage in currency transactions or a permit to underwrite
government bonds, known as a primary dealership license. Bank of
America, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and UBS
have banking licenses in India. Morgan Stanley has applied for
one and has obtained a primary dealer permit. </p>
<p>Executives at Goldman Sachs told the Bank of America
analysts that the firm applied for a banking license and expects
to receive one in three to six months, according to the report.
The bank also is seeking a primary dealership permit, the former
head of the India unit, L. Brooks Entwistle, told Mint newspaper
last year. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Hong
Kong, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Growth in Asia </p>
<p>India, where economic expansion and stock-market gains
drove mergers and equity issuance to records last year, is among
emerging markets that Goldman Sachs is targeting as the firm
faces more restrictive rules in the U.S. and Europe on how it
can deploy capital. The bank aims to double revenue from Asia
outside Japan over the next few years to $10 billion, the
Bank of America analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Asia accounted for 21 percent of pretax earnings and 18
percent of revenue in 2010, compared with 18 percent of both for
2009, according to the firm''s annual filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Goldman Sachs doesn''t disclose how much
revenue or profit comes from India. </p>
<p>India is among countries -- including Brazil, China, Russia
and Saudi Arabia -- where Goldman Sachs''s payroll has grown by
at least 25 percent a year since 2005, according to a company
presentation. The firm has about 100 people in its Mumbai office
and employs 3,500 in Bangalore to provide back-office support
and services to its global operations. </p>
<p>Revenue Opportunities'' </p>
<p>We believe that both GDP growth and the relative fiscal
stability of many growth countries are trends that could drive
revenue opportunities across all of our businesses, Blankfein,
56, said at a conference in New York in November. Over the
past five years, we''ve seen nearly three times the number of
capital-raisings in India than we saw in the previous 10. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs units have invested about $2 billion in
India, most of it since 2005, buying stakes in companies
including Mahindra  Mahindra Ltd. (MM), Max India Ltd. and TVS
Logistics Services Ltd. Ankur Sahu, 41, will move to Mumbai this
year from Japan to run the Indian principal-investing operations
with Sanjeev Mehra, according to an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News in February. </p>
<p>The firm agreed to buy Mumbai-based Benchmark Asset
Management Co. last month, giving it access to a market where
assets managed by mutual funds more than tripled to 6.8 trillion
rupees in the five years ended Dec. 31, according to the
Association of Mutual Funds of India. Terms weren''t disclosed.
Goldman Sachs, which set up its local fund unit in 2008, had no
assets under management as of Dec. 31. </p>
<p>The bank also sees significant opportunity in private
banking for the wealthy, Moszkowski and Chubak wrote. </p>
<p>Drums, Boxing </p>
<p>Chatterjee, who worked 16 years at Mumbai-based ICICI Bank,
where he was in charge of corporate and investment banking,
government banking and international banking, declined to
comment. The father of two girls, he played drums in a Mumbai
rock band called Infrared and kept fit in London, where he lived
from 2003 to 2007, by boxing in a gym near Baker Street,
according to people who know him. </p>
<p>He''ll need to show off some of that footwork to persuade
local companies to pay for advisory work when rival firms are
willing to sacrifice fees to gain market share. The top-ranked
bank worldwide in MA and equity underwriting over the past
decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs
pitched for seven stock offerings of government-controlled
companies in India in the past year. It got picked for two. </p>
<p>4-Cent Fee </p>
<p>The first was the $1.8 billion offer in August by Power
Grid Corp., India''s largest electricity-transmission company.
Goldman Sachs and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. offered to accept a
fee equivalent to about 4 cents each to work on the transaction,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The firm also was selected to help manage Power Finance''s
sale of a 20 percent stake that could raise 57.5 billion rupees,
based on current market valuation. The sale by the New Delhi-
based lender to Indian utilities is likely to open in May, and
Goldman Sachs has agreed to split a fee of 1 rupee with three
banks to manage it, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter who asked not to be identified because they weren''t
authorized to discuss the deal. </p>
<p>The other firms are Bank of America, ICICI Securities Ltd.
and JM Financial Ltd. (JM), according to a March 18 document
submitted to the Securities and Exchange Board of India. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Bank AG also worked on state deals yielding near-zero fees last
year, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Vedanta Loan </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was among eight banks that provided a
combined $6 billion of loans for Vedanta, the London-based
mining company controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, when it
offered to buy control of Cairn India Ltd. The deal didn''t
generate advisory fees since Vedanta used its own team to
negotiate the purchase, bankers familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Balance-sheet support can be critical to winning large
outbound deals, though clients are also looking for ideas and
deal-execution capability, Frank Hancock, managing director of
corporate finance in India at Barclays Plc, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Chatterjee replaced Entwistle, who had run Goldman Sachs in
India since 2006, when the firm ended its venture with Kotak
Mahindra. Entwistle, 43, is moving to Singapore to become
chairman and head of investment banking for Goldman Sachs in
Southeast Asia, according to a March 18 internal memo. </p>
<p>Mallya Ties </p>
<p>The appointment of Chatterjee, who has a master''s degree in
business administration from the Indian Institute of Management
in Bangalore, made Goldman Sachs the last major foreign bank in
the country to name an Indian to the top spot. </p>
<p>While at ICICI Bank, Chatterjee developed ties with Vijay Mallya, head of India''s Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. and chairman of
United Spirits Ltd. (UNSP), which bought Scottish liquor maker Whyte 
Mackay Ltd. for 595 million pounds ($968 million) in May 2007.
ICICI Bank helped finance the transaction. </p>
<p>What Sonjoy brings is long-term relationships with
corporates, said Girotra. ICICI has a strong brand, and he
was a carrier of that. He brings a lot of credibility. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs trailed Wall Street rivals such as Citigroup,
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America in mergers advisory after its
split from Kotak. UBS, based in Zurich, was first in MA in the
four years ended April 1, 2010, and Citigroup was the top share
underwriter, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Trailing Morgan Stanley </p>
<p>In the 10 months since Chatterjee began working at Goldman
Sachs, only Morgan Stanley ranked higher in MA in India,
working on 11 deals valued at a combined $20.7 billion, compared
with three transactions totaling $15.6 billion for Goldman
Sachs, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>In stock sales, Goldman Sachs''s gains have been slower. It
completed two offerings in the past year: Power Grid''s and an
October initial public offering by Orient Green Power Co., a
developer of renewable-energy projects. Citigroup worked on 13
deals, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs hasn''t arranged a bond sale in India since
2005, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>One of Chatterjee''s first tasks may be finding an
investment-banking chief. Sunil Sanghai, co-head of investment
banking with Entwistle, quit last June and joined HSBC Holdings
Plc as head of global banking for India. Chatterjee now holds
the title of investment-banking head in addition to his chairman
role. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, all based in New
York, have separate investment-banking chiefs in India, as does
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America. </p>
<p>Fierce Competitors'' </p>
<p>Another challenge comes from Indian firms expanding into
investment banking to compete for advisory business. </p>
<p>We see the likes of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank
getting rapidly geared up to become fierce competitors,
Barclays''s Hancock said. </p>
<p>Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB), India''s top-ranked manager of debt sales,
in November agreed to buy Enam Securities Pvt. in a deal valued
at 20.7 billion rupees to bolster its equity-underwriting
operations. Enam was the third-biggest arranger of stock sales
last year and Axis was 19th, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Mumbai-based HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB), India''s second-largest
privately owned lender, hired Rakesh Singh from N M Rothschild 
Sons (India) Pvt. to head investment banking in India, two
people with knowledge of the matter said. Singh will join HDFC
Bank this month, they said. </p>
<p>We are committed to beefing up our capabilities
substantially, HDFC Bank Executive Director Paresh Sukthankar
said in an interview. We hope to make our presence felt in
coming months. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) won a U.S. panel''s
backing to expand marketing of a cancer drug for patients with
the rare type of pancreatic tumor diagnosed in Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s
Steve Jobs in 2004. </p>
<p>The medicine, Sutent, works sufficiently to outweigh
potential risks, outside advisers to the Food and Drug
Administration said today in an 8-2 vote in White Oak, Maryland.
The panel concluded earlier today that Swiss drugmaker Novartis
AG (NVS)''s Afinitor is effective for the same illness. The FDA usually
follows its advisory committees'' recommendations. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, and Novartis want to sell their
kidney-cancer drugs for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that
strike about 2,500 people a year in the U.S., according to the
University of Southern California Center for Pancreatic and
Biliary Diseases in Los Angeles. Both medicines, which target
cancer at the molecular level, helped slow progression of the
disease in clinical trials. </p>
<p>There is a benefit that we can''t really determine the
magnitude of, panel member Ralph Freedman, a professor of
gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston, said after voting in favor of Pfizer''s
drug. On the other hand, this is a rare disease and there is
an unmet need here. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
first-quarter earnings estimate for Morgan Stanley by 60 percent
on expectation of lower interest rate, credit and currency
trading revenue. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, had
its earnings estimate lowered to 32 cents from 80 cents,
analysts Daniel Harris and Richard Ramsden said today in a note.
Full-year estimates for 2011 and 2012 were cut to $2 per share
from $2.75 and $2.65 from $3.05, respectively. The average
first-quarter estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is
38 cents. </p>
<p>Revenue from interest rate, credit and currency trading
will be $1 billion, down from the previous estimate of $1.7
billion, as charges from its hedging of exposure to monoline
insurers affect results by $400 million to $500 million,
according to the note. New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) will also
face a $300 million charge related to the narrowing of its
credit spreads, the note said. </p>
<p>Investment-banking revenue will be $100 million lower than
previously estimated, according to the note. Merger and
acquisition advisory revenue will be down 14 percent from the
fourth quarter. Global wealth-management revenue of $3.3 billion
in the fourth quarter will be flat because of a decline in
client activity, Harris and Ramsden said in the note. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 24 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $26.67 at
10:55 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest
electronic payments network, plans to grow the number of point-
of-sale terminals in Kenya threefold over the next three years. </p>
<p>Kenya, East Africa''s biggest economy, currently has 9,000
terminals and 22 partner banks, Gerald Hawkins, group general
manager for Africa, said today in an interview in Nairobi, the
capital. </p>
<p>The terminals should be increased by a factor of two or
three, Hawkins said. Traditionally, the banks start by
issuing their own cards. </p>
<p>Kenya had 55,235 credit card transactions and 466,523
point-of-sale machines in October compared with 54,353
transactions and 443,633 units a month earlier, according to the
Central Bank of Kenya''s website. The value of credit card
transactions in October was 314 million shillings ($3.7 million)
compared with 323 million shillings the previous month,
according to the central bank. </p>
<p>NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB), one of Visa''s partners in Kenya, plans to
double its number of credit card customers over two years, James
Wainaina, director for personal banking, said today, without

credit card services in 2005, has recorded between 15 percent
and 20 percent growth of its credit card business year-on-year
for the last three years, Wainaina said. </p>
<p>The intent is for us to bring on board our customers who
don''t have cards, he said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
are due for a pullback, suggesting the two largest U.S. energy
companies may turn from leaders into a soft patch in the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, said Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. </p>
<p>Exxon, the stock with the highest market value in the
world, produced a negative divergence, failing to keep up
with the rally in oil prices and surpass February highs.
Chevron, the third-biggest U.S. company after Exxon and Apple
Inc., rose to highest level relative to its 30-week moving
average since July 2007, a sign that the stock may be poised to
drop, said Dan Wantrobski, the director of technical research at
Janney. </p>
<p>Chevron is in a vulnerable position, Wantrobski said in
an interview from his office in Philadelphia. If this comes in
and Exxon doesn''t recover, it could weigh on the SP 500. </p>
<p>Energy shares have performed the best among 10 industry
groups in the SP 500 this year as anti-government protests
erupted in the Middle East and northern Africa, pushing crude-
oil prices to a 30-month high. The SP 500 Energy index rallied
15 percent, compared with a 5.3 percent gain in the benchmark
gauge. Exxon and Chevron together have a 5.3 percent weighting
in the SP 500, so a pause by them would hold back any gains in
the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks. </p>
<p>Exxon''s advance since March 16 stalled at an intraday level
of $86.22 last week, short of exceeding its Feb. 23 intraday
high of $88.23. That marks a lower high that tends to signal
a downtrend, Wantrobski said. </p>
<p>Shares of Chevron climbed to a closing level of $109.66 at
the end of last week, 21 percent above their average price over
the past 30 weeks, according to Janney and Bloomberg data. The
last time the stock posted a bigger gap -- July 13, 2007 -- the
shares fell 9.6 percent through Aug. 15. </p>
<p>That''s a sign of potential exhaustion, Wantrobski said.
It''s going to trap somebody. </p>

prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or

<p>U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) may report weak revenue for the
first quarter after lending by the industry dropped in almost
every category. </p>
<p>Bank loans and leases fell $87.4 billion to $6.97 trillion
from the end of 2010 through March 30, or 1.3 percent, according
to Federal Reserve data. Deposits at U.S. banks rose the same
percentage to $7.97 trillion, showing households and businesses
are still hoarding cash instead of borrowing, analysts said. </p>
<p>While loan growth tends to be seasonally weak in the
first quarter, this quarter is tracking worse than seasonality
would suggest, Barclays Capital Inc. analysts led by Jason Goldberg wrote in an April 8 report. We fear companies have
been disappointed. </p>
<p>Investors will get their first look at the quarter''s
results tomorrow when New York-based JPMorgan, ranked second by
assets in the U.S., is scheduled to report. The biggest lender,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, will report
April 15, followed next week by New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C)
and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), ranked third and
fourth by assets. </p>
<p>Profits may have increased even with declining revenue as
lenders set aside fewer funds to cover loan losses and in some
cases released reserves they''ve already built up, said Matt
Burnell, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo. Cost reductions may
also help the bottom line in a smaller way, Burnell said. </p>
<p>New Regulations </p>
<p>Lack of loan demand is just one of the constraints on
revenue facing banks as new regulations limit proprietary
trading and fees on overdrafts and debit cards. Bank stocks
trailed this year''s 5.3 percent rise in the Standard  Poor''s
500 Index, with the 24-company KBW Bank Index (BKX) little changed. </p>
<p>While trading revenue was credited for bolstering last
year''s profit, lenders still depend on net interest income, the
money made on lending and securities investment. That accounted
for 46 percent of 2010 revenue at Bank of America and 53 percent
at Wells Fargo. The figure was 50 percent for JPMorgan and 63
percent for Citigroup. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55,
may report adjusted net income rose 41 percent over the year-
earlier quarter to $4.68 billion, according to the median
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue probably
declined 9.5 percent to $25 billion, analysts estimate. </p>
<p>Profit Estimates </p>
<p>Bank of America, headed by CEO Brian T. Moynihan, 51, may
report a 2.8 percent decline in profit to $3.09 billion on a 19
percent decline in revenue to $26.5 billion, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts. The bank told investors in
January that net interest income would decline in the first
quarter from the last period of 2010, and then level off
sometime in the second. </p>
<p>Revenue may fall 20 percent at Citigroup, led by CEO Vikram Pandit, 54, and 1.3 percent at Wells Fargo, headed by John Stumpf, 57, according to Bloomberg''s survey. First-quarter
profit may rise 41 percent to $3.56 billion at Wells Fargo, and
decline 36 percent to $2.84 billion at Citigroup, according to
Bloomberg''s survey. Spokesmen for all four banks declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Oppenheimer  Co. analyst Chris Kotowski estimates that
banks in his coverage universe, which includes the four largest,
will say loans outstanding declined by about 1.5 percent,
according to a March 24 report. </p>
<p>Weak spots include U.S. consumers, who are cutting credit-
card use and slowing home purchases. Closed-end residential
mortgage loans fell 3.3 percent in the first quarter, while
credit-card and other revolving loans fell 1.2 percent,
according to the Fed. Consumer and residential home loans
account for about 54 percent of total defined bank lending, Fed
data shows. </p>
<p>Commercial Lending </p>
<p>Some of the biggest banks are still constrained by weak
balance sheets or aren''t replacing loans with new ones when they
mature, CreditSights Inc. analysts led by David Hendler wrote in
an April 10 note. For example, JPMorgan may cut as much as $10
billion from its credit-card portfolio in the first quarter, and
said its residential real-estate book may decline as much as 15
percent per year, Hendler wrote. </p>
<p>Lenders may not get much help this time from investment-
banking and trading revenue, which analysts are predicting may
fall for the fourth straight year-over-year quarter.  Guy Moszkowski at Bank of America lowered first-quarter earnings
estimates last month at Citigroup and JPMorgan, as well as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, saying trading
revenue won''t rebound as much as he had expected from a weak
fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Commercial Lending </p>
<p>One area of strength may be commercial and industrial
loans, used by companies to purchase inventory or improve
technology and other capital-intensive parts of their business.
Total CI loans increased to $1.25 trillion in the week ended
March 30, the seventh week of increases in the last nine, Fed
data show. Wells Fargo''s average loan balance advanced 1 percent
in the first quarter, fueled by CI lending, Goldberg estimates. </p>
<p>That''s likely to continue; the business sector is doing
well in general, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at
Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut, and a former
Fed economist. Demand isn''t stronger because the cash hoard held
by U.S. corporations limits their appetite for bank loans,
Stanley said. </p>
<p>Nonfinancial corporations based in the U.S. held $1.89
trillion in liquid assets, including cash, at the end of
December, according to the Internal Revenue Service. </p>
<p>That seems to be the one bright spot, said Burnell at
Wells Fargo. For everything else, you''re still looking for
negative loan growth. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) designed,
marketed and sold collateralized debt obligations that misled
investors and created conflicts of interest as the company built
short positions before the U.S. housing market collapsed, a
Senate panel said in its report on the financial crisis. </p>
<p>In the case of one CDO, Hudson Mezzanine, Goldman Sachs
told investors its interests were aligned with theirs while the
firm held 100 percent of the short side, according to the report
released today by the Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
leads the panel, urged regulators to review all of the
structured finance transactions described in the report. </p>
<p>At a briefing today, Levin said he believed Goldman Sachs
executives weren''t truthful about the company''s transactions in
testimony before the subcommittee at an April 2010 hearing. He
said he would refer the testimony to the Justice Department for
possible perjury charges. </p>
<p>In my judgment, Goldman clearly misled their clients and
they misled the Congress, Levin said. </p>
<p>With today''s release, the Senate panel completes a two-year
investigation of mortgage firms, federal regulators and Wall
Street banks highlighted by the expletive-laden interrogation of
Goldman Sachs executives including Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein a year ago this month. </p>
<p>Our investigation found a financial snake pit rife with
greed, conflicts of interest, and wrongdoing, Levin told
reporters today. </p>
<p>Public Hearings </p>
<p>Levin and Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the panel''s top
Republican, held four public hearings on the financial crisis
last year, examining regulatory failures, the collapse of
Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), the role of credit-rating firms in
fueling bets on high-risk debt and the business practices of
Goldman Sachs and rival investment banks. </p>
<p>The report comes less than a year after Goldman Sachs paid
$550 million to resolve Securities and Exchange Commission
claims that it misled investors in a collateralized debt
obligation and its executives were called to testify before two
congressional panels and a commission formed to investigate the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. A committee
of Goldman Sachs employees led by E. Gerald Corrigan and J.
Michael Evans released 39 recommendations on Jan. 11 for the
company to reform its business practices. </p>
<p>The Senate report also faults Deutsche Bank AG (DB), saying the
Frankfurt-based company created a $1.1 billion CDO with assets
that its traders referred to as crap and then attempted to
sell before the market falls off a cliff. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said profit rose 67 percent to a
second straight record as provisions for bad mortgages and
credit-card loans tumbled. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income climbed to $5.56 billion, or $1.28
a share, from $3.33 billion, or 74 cents, in the same period a
year earlier and from $4.83 billion, or $1.12, in the fourth
quarter, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
The results beat the average per-share estimate for adjusted
earnings of $1.15 by 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Reserve releases, money the bank decides it no longer needs
to hold against future losses, accounted for $2.55 billion, or
almost half, of the profit. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
55, has said he doesn''t consider reserve releases as quality
earnings because they don''t represent growth in the bank''s
businesses. </p>
<p>I thought it was a good quarter, but it''s just not a
quarter that''s going to get people excited, said Paul Miller,
a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. It
was very noisy, he said, referring to the earnings attributable
to the reserve releases, which accounted for more than 40 cents
of the per-share profit. </p>
<p>Share Performance </p>
<p>Shares of JPMorgan fell 47 cents, or 1 percent, to $46.17
at 2:53 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock was up 10 percent this year before today. </p>
<p>About 29 cents of the per-share earnings were from the
bank''s $2 billion draw on credit-card reserves. JPMorgan may
record one more strong quarter of reserve releases from its
credit-card division before they taper off in the third quarter,
said Shannon Stemm, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in St.
Louis who rates the stock buy. </p>
<p>Provisions for credit losses dropped 83 percent to $1.17
billion as defaults and late payments declined. JPMorgan posted
a record $17.4 billion in earnings last year in part by
releasing about $7 billion of reserves against bad loans back
into income as the U.S. economy improved. </p>
<p>Almost 43 percent of JPMorgan''s net income in the first
quarter came from its investment bank, where earnings fell 4
percent to $2.37 billion. Those results were up from $1.5
billion in the fourth quarter as the bank took advantage of
volatility in the market caused by the European debt crisis and
turmoil in the Middle East. </p>
<p>Fixed Income </p>
<p>First-quarter revenue fell 8 percent to $25.8 billion.
Fixed-income and equity markets revenue was $6.6 billion,
compared with $6.9 billion a year earlier and $4 billion in the
fourth quarter. </p>
<p>The retail bank posted a $208 million loss. Dimon said in
the statement that the business had good underlying
performance that was more than offset by the extraordinarily
high losses we still are bearing on mortgage-related issues.
Unfortunately, these losses will continue for a while. </p>
<p>The bank took a $1.1 billion charge and may add as many as
3,000 employees to comply with a consent agreement with federal
bank regulators over JPMorgan''s foreclosure practices announced
today, Dimon and Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein told
reporters on a conference call. </p>
<p>Although the expense was a one-time charge, that''s an
asset that''s continually fair-valued, so we could see further
charges or gains from that line item in the future, Stemm
said. We absolutely could see further charges over the next
couple of quarters on mortgage issues. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest behind JPMorgan and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), may report first-quarter profit of $2.78
billion when it releases results on April 18, the survey of
analysts shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
may report a profit of $2.99 billion on April 15. </p>
<p>Thirty-day delinquency rates on credit cards dropped to
3.57 percent from 5.6 percent in the same quarter in 2010 and
4.1 percent in the fourth quarter. The rate of credit cards
charged off as bad debt also fell, to 7 percent from 11.8
percent the prior year and 7.9 percent in the previous quarter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s credit-card division, which lost money for all
of 2009, generated $1.34 billion in profit, or 24 percent of net
income for the quarter. </p>
<p>Retail Banking </p>
<p>The loss in retail banking, which includes home loans and
checking accounts, compared with $708 million of profit during
the fourth quarter and a $131 million loss a year earlier. The
division benefited from a $2.4 billion reduction in provisions
to $1.3 billion, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>Home prices, which stabilized early last year, have fallen
every month since the middle of 2010 and may slow reserve
releases, which are determined in part by economic forecasts,
said Jason Goldberg, a senior analyst with Barclays Capital in
New York. </p>
<p>The most important things should be moving in the right
direction, but you''re not yet firing on all cylinders,
Goldberg said. </p>
<p>Loan growth remains slow and net interest margins, which
measure the profitability of lending, continue to narrow at U.S.
banks. Bank loans and leases fell $87.4 billion to $6.97
trillion from the end of 2010 through March 30, or 1.3 percent,
according to Federal Reserve data. </p>
<p>Net Interest Margin </p>
<p>JPMorgan and other large banks, which have benefited from
record low costs of funding mortgages and other assets, face a
squeeze on net interest margins -- the difference between what
they pay to borrow money and what they get for loans and on
securities. </p>
<p>The net yield on interest-earning assets -- what the bank
collects on interest on loans and securities minus what it pays
out on deposits and other borrowings -- rose to 2.89 percent in
the first quarter, from 2.88 percent in the fourth quarter and
3.32 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>In aggregate, it''s kind of lackluster, said Moshe Orenbuch, a bank analyst for Credit Suisse Group AG in New York.
Net interest is still declining. Mortgage-banking revenues are
going to be under pressure because volumes are under pressure
and spreads are under pressure. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may settle an investigation into
the bank''s foreclosure practices by federal regulators as early
as today, executives said. </p>
<p>The bank took a $1.1 billion charge and may add as many as
3,000 employees to comply with the consent agreement, Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein told reporters on a conference call today after the
bank reported a 67 percent increase in net income. The accord
involves the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the
Federal Reserve, the bankers said. </p>
<p>They are going to issue some very significant changes,
Braunstein said. The agreement will address weaknesses with
our processes and controls when the bank forecloses on overdue
homeowners and cover the New York-based company''s use of
affidavits, fees and documentation, he said. </p>
<p>The $1.1 billion writedown on mortgage-servicing rights led
the retail-banking division to post its first loss in a year.
Revenue from mortgage fees and related income was negative $489
million, the first time the lender has had negative revenue in
that business since at least its merger with Bank One Corp. in
2004. The writedown represented about 8 percent of the $13.6
billion total carrying value of the bank''s MSRs at Dec. 31. </p>
<p>While the agreement doesn''t include fines, Dimon said
regulators reserved the right to levy penalties in the future. </p>
<p>There are a lot of interested parties, it''s complex and
eventually there will be penalties and fines paid and other
changes made to things. So we just don''t know yet, Dimon said. </p>
<p>Cummings''s Request </p>
<p>Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland,
sent a letter to the OCC, calling on the regulator to postpone
the consent agreement and brief Congress on its investigation
into foreclosure processes, the lawmaker said today in a
statement. The OCC agreed to brief Cummings on the
investigation, the statement said. </p>
<p>I remain deeply concerned with any proposed consent
orders that would allow mortgage servicers to continue
disregarding their legal and contractual obligations, and that
fail to rectify the damage that servicers have inflicted on
borrowers, investors, communities, and the U.S. economy,
Cummings said in the letter dated yesterday. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the third-largest servicer in the U.S.,
trailing Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. Servicers
collect payments from borrowers and pass them on to mortgage
lenders or investors, less fees. They also keep records, manage
escrow accounts and contact delinquent debtors. </p>
<p>Under U.S. accounting rules in place since 1995, banks
should report the value of mortgage-servicing rights on a fair-
market basis, or roughly what they would bring in a sale. A bank
must record a loss whenever it sells MSRs for a price below
where they''re marked on the books. </p>

<p>U.S. regulators, as part of a broad
probe of how Wall Street firms bundled mortgage-linked financial
products as the housing crisis worsened, notified a former
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executive he may be sued for his role in
selling the securities. </p>
<p>Michael Llodra, who was global head of structured-product
collateralized debt obligations when he left JPMorgan, received
a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Jan. 4 saying investigators planned to pursue civil claims
against him related to the sale of a 2007 product, according to
Llodra''s broker registration filings. The SEC also gave a Wells
notice on Jan. 14 to Edward Steffelin, a former executive at a
firm that helped manage JPMorgan''s 2007 Squared CDO, his
brokerage records show. </p>
<p>The SEC has been probing whether JPMorgan, the second
biggest U.S. bank by assets, and Steffelin''s former firm, GSC
Group, misled investors about hedge-fund Magnetar Capital LLC''s
possible role in selecting underlying assets in the $1.1 billion
Squared deal, according to a person briefed on the matter who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe isn''t public. </p>
<p>Magnetar has said it bought the junior-most slice of the
Squared CDO as part of its strategy of investing in some
mortgage-linked securities while betting against other housing
debt, sometimes including bonds from the same deals. CDOs
package assets such as mortgage bonds and buyout loans into new
securities with varying risks. </p>
<p>Llodra, who joined JPMorgan in 2006, began working at
Harvard Management Co. in 2008 and then went to Sunrise
Securities Corp. through last November, his records at the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show. He has since left
Sunrise, a woman who answered the phone there today said. </p>
<p>Steffelin, 41, is now director of institutional sales and
research at Walton International Group, which acquires and
manages land in North America, according to his profile at the
Linkedin business-networking website. </p>
<p>SEC Investigation </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti declined to comment.
Llodra and Steffelin declined to comment, as did Steven Lipin, a
spokesman for Magnetar, and SEC spokesman John Nester. </p>
<p>The SEC''s investigation has focused on the role of each of
the three firms involved in the transaction, a person familiar
with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity because
the matter isn''t public. </p>
<p>Squared was sold in April 2007, with GSC Group serving as
the CDO''s manager and JPMorgan underwriting the deal, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its collateral consisted partly
of other CDOs tied to bonds backed by assets such as mortgages,
with the initial holdings including credit-default swaps
referencing $968 million of those CDOs, according to an offering
document. CDOs backed by other CDOs were commonly referred to as
CDOs squared. Squared went into default the following
January. </p>
<p>Magnetar </p>
<p>The probe is part of the SEC''s wider investigation of how
banks packaged and sold mortgage-linked investments as the
housing market unraveled in 2007. The agency has targeted firms
at various stages of that process, ranging from loan originators
such as Countrywide Financial Corp., to underwriters including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which agreed to pay $550 million last
year to resolve claims it misled investors in a subprime-linked
CDO. </p>
<p>Evanston, Illinois-based Magnetar told investors in an
April 2010 letter that it didn''t help banks create CDOs that
were built to fail on a bet that homeowners with bad credit
would default on their loans. The firm offered limited input on
the creation of CDOs, and made bets that would pay off if they
soured as part of a market neutral portfolio designed to
profit no matter what happened, Magnetar said in the letter. </p>
<p>Magnetar said in its letter that it didn''t select specific
securities to be included in its CDOs. </p>
<p>Magnetar was started in late 2005 by Alec Litowitz, who
previously worked at Ken Griffin''s Citadel Investment Group LLC.
He specialized in trading the stocks of merging companies. </p>
<p>GSC Bankruptcy </p>
<p>GSC, based in Florham Park, New Jersey, filed for
bankruptcy last year, blaming losses in its funds caused by the
credit crisis and an extremely unfavorable global business
environment. The investment firm, founded by former Goldman
Sachs partner Alfred Eckert III, managed $28 billion at its
peak, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Black Diamond Capital Management LLC won a bankruptcy
auction for its assets. </p>
<p>GSC, which entered into the business of managing CDOs tied
to asset-backed securities in 2006, ran $8.1 billion of them by
the time the market collapsed the next year, according to a
Standard  Poor''s report at the time. The company ranked as the
No. 17 manager of such CDOs, SP said. </p>
<p>The firm''s name surfaced last year in e-mails released by a
U.S. Senate panel investigating the financial crisis. Goldman
Sachs employee Fabrice Tourre, who helped arrange the CDO that
would later force Goldman Sachs to pay the record fine, wrote in
a January 2007 e-mail that GSC Group had turned down a request
that it serve as collateral manager for that deal, which hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped select assets for and bet against. </p>
<p>GSC had declined given their negative views on most of
the credits that Paulson had selected, Tourre wrote, after
discussing the Abacus CDO again with Steffelin that day,
according to the e-mail. </p>
<p>Tourre, who has denied wrongdoing, is litigating the SEC''s
case against him. </p>
<p>The Senate panel, the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, held a series of hearings about the financial
crisis last year, including a full day questioning Goldman Sachs
executives about the company''s business practices. It is
scheduled to release its findings today. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) missed out
on arranging Glencore International AG''s initial public
offering, which may be the world''s largest this year. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Morgan Stanley (MS)
will manage the IPO in London and Hong Kong, which may raise as
much as $11 billion. All nine banks together will earn as much
as $250 million in fees, excluding the so-called incentive fees,
according to New York-based consulting firm Freeman  Co. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs missed out because it doesn''t
have a long-term relationship with the commodities trader, said
a person with knowledge of the situation, who declined to be
identified because the details are private. Goldman didn''t
manage the 10 largest Glencore mergers and acquisitions, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The way to contribute to a deal like this is to develop
relationships with clients over many years, said Scott Moeller,
a professor at Cass Business School in London and a former
investment banker. Everyone has known for a long time that
Glencore will go public. You have to make sure you are on board
with them and you need to be connected and make the effort over
the long term and not just on your reputation. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) misled
clients and Congress about the firm''s bets on securities tied to
the housing market, the chairman of the U.S. Senate panel that
investigated the causes of the financial crisis said. </p>
<p>Senator Carl Levin, releasing the findings of a two-year
inquiry yesterday, said he wants the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to examine whether Goldman
Sachs violated the law by misleading clients who bought the
complex securities known as collateralized debt obligations
without knowing the firm would benefit if they fell in value. </p>
<p>The Michigan Democrat also said federal prosecutors should
review whether to bring perjury charges against Goldman Sachs
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and other current and
former employees who testified in Congress last year. Levin said
they denied under oath that Goldman Sachs took a financial
position against the mortgage market solely for its own profit,
statements the senator said were untrue. </p>
<p>In my judgment, Goldman clearly misled their clients and
they misled the Congress, Levin said at a press briefing
yesterday where he and Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma
Republican, discussed the 640-page report from the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. </p>

<p>The U.S. Justice Department and
regulators will have to determine whether employees and
executives of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) violated any laws when
they traded securities tied to the housing market and testified
to Congress about the transactions, Senator Carl Levin said. </p>
<p>The Michigan Democrat, who released the findings of a two-
year inquiry into the 2008 financial crisis yesterday, said
today in an interview with Bloomberg Television''s Street
Smart with Carol Massar and Matt Miller that he wanted to send
the report to federal prosecutors and the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Lawmakers don''t have the authority to
declare whether the activities were illegal, he said. </p>
<p>That is not for Congress to determine whether or not a
crime was committed or whether or not he violated the security
laws, Levin said, referring to Goldman Sachs Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein. That is for the Justice Department
and that is for the SEC to make those determinations. </p>
<p>Levin, who is chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, said he also wants to forward all of the
testimony that Goldman Sachs executives gave before his panel so
the Justice Department can determine whether any statements
constitute perjury. </p>
<p>We''re not going to make the determination as to whether
or not he committed perjury, Levin said, after explaining that
he thought Blankfein attempted to mislead the Congress and I
believe they did mislead their clients in very significant
ways. </p>
<p>Truthful and Accurate'' </p>
<p>In a statement, Goldman Sachs denied that it had misled
anyone about its activities. The testimony we gave was
truthful and accurate and this is confirmed by the
subcommittee''s own report, Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said yesterday. </p>
<p>Levin doesn''t have the power on his own to formally refer
the report''s allegations to federal authorities. The
subcommittee has a process for making such referrals that
requires Levin to obtain the support of the senior Republican on
the panel, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. </p>
<p>Levin is going to recommend that the subcommittee make
formal referrals, though he has not done it yet, staff members
said. </p>
<p>Coburn Statement </p>
<p>Coburn issued a statement today saying committee members
have yet to decide whether to make formal referrals. </p>
<p>There has been a lot of speculation about the nature of
any possible referrals that may result from our financial crisis
investigation, Coburn said. At this point, no final
decisions have been made regarding this issue. </p>
<p>The 640-page report issued yesterday by the subcommittee
found that Goldman Sachs peddled mortgage-related securities to
its clients while failing to disclose that the firm had bet that
those instruments would lose value. </p>
<p>The report also said the firm acted against its clients''
interests by attempting to profit more generally from the
housing-market decline. </p>
<p>During a subcommittee hearing last year, Blankfein
testified that Goldman Sachs never bet against its clients for
its own profit. </p>
<p>The bipartisan report also examined the role of credit-
rating firms in the meltdown, lax oversight by Washington
regulators and the drop in lending standards that fueled the
mortgage bubble and ultimately caused hundreds of bank failures. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it plans to win the race
against rival Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) to bring microchip-embedded
credit cards to the wealthiest consumers. </p>
<p>Absolutely, we would beat Wells Fargo to market, David
Porter, general manager for Chase Card Services, said in an
interview yesterday, after Wells Fargo announced its plan to
distribute chip cards later this year. </p>
<p>Both banks are courting U.S. clients who have encountered
problems using their cards while traveling abroad. The EMV-chip
technology, which is more secure than the magnetic-stripe that
stores account data on U.S.-issued cards, has become a standard
in Europe and much of the rest of the world. The chip cards may
boost transaction revenue and help JPMorgan lure affluent
customers from rivals such as American Express Co. (AXP), Porter said. </p>
<p>Clearly there are customers at American Express that we
would hope could benefit from this technology, Porter said.
And we obviously pick up more transactions as some kiosks
and vendors won''t take Chase cards with only a magnetic stripe,
Porter said. </p>
<p>Almost 10 million U.S. consumers experienced credit-card
acceptance problems abroad in 2008, costing about $4 billion in
lost transactions for merchants and $447 million in revenue for
card issuers, according to a 2009 study by Aite Group, a Boston-
based research firm. </p>
<p>We Welcome Competition'' </p>
<p>Wells Fargo said yesterday it planned to be the first major
U.S. bank to deploy Visa Inc. (V) credit cards with EMV-chip
technology. The San Francisco-based lender plans to invite
15,000 customers to use the cards, beginning in the middle of
this year. The pilot program will include frequent travelers
such as private-banking clients and college students, the
company said. </p>
<p>We welcome competition and believe it''s good for the
marketplace, Lisa Westermann, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said
today in an e-mail. Our first priority is helping our
customers succeed. </p>
<p>Joanna Lambert, a spokeswoman for New York-based American
Express, didn''t comment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will first offer the card exclusively to affluent
customers. Clients with a JPMorgan Palladium credit card, which
has a $595 annual fee, will receive a chip card by June, the
company said. </p>
<p>Initially, we are targeting the technology to our
highest-spend clients, Porter said. Months after that we
will issue the card to Chase-branded products. </p>
<p>Makes Sense'' </p>
<p>Issuing chip cards to affluent travelers makes sense as
new U.S. regulations, including pending caps on debit-card
transaction fees, threaten to crimp bank revenue, according to
John T. Williams, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Every transaction is vital, Williams wrote today in a

San Francisco-based Visa. AmEx, the biggest U.S. credit-card

<p>The cost to protect debt issued by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) jumped to the highest level in almost a
month after the chairman of the Senate panel that investigated
the financial crisis said the bank misled clients and Congress
about investments in securities tied to mortgages. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the U.S. bank that makes the most
revenue from trading climbed 4.2 basis points to 115.5 basis
points, according to data provider CMA. That''s the highest level
since 118.1 basis points on March 17. </p>
<p>Senator Carl Levin said he wants the Justice Department and
the Securities and Exchange Commission to examine whether
Goldman Sachs violated the law by misleading clients who bought
collateralized debt obligations without knowing the firm was
betting they would fall in value. </p>
<p>In my judgment, Goldman clearly misled their clients and
they misled the Congress, Levin said at a media briefing
yesterday where he and Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma
Republican, discussed a 640-page report from the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. </p>
<p>In a statement, the New York-based bank denied that it had
misled anyone about its activities. The testimony we gave was
truthful and accurate and this is confirmed by the
subcommittee''s own report, Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on other major U.S. banks also rose,
with contracts on Morgan Stanley adding 3.6 basis points to
140.6 and those on JPMorgan Chase  Co. climbing 2.8 basis
points to 74.5, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. </p>
<p>Corporate Bonds </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>
<p>Contracts on Citigroup Inc. increased 1.5 basis points to
120.9, and those on Wells Fargo  Co. added 1.2 basis points to
79.4. Default swaps on Bank of America Corp. climbed 2.7 basis
points to 132.5, the data show. </p>
<p>The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default in the
U.S. fell for the first time in four days as the House approved
a spending bill to avert a government shutdown. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, declined 0.4 basis point to a
mid-price of 94.6 basis points as of 4:56 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>The credit swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. It''s risen
from 93.6 at the end of last week. Credit swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s U.K.
unit was sued by an executive search firm in London that said it
wasn''t paid after recruiting a banker from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) in
Poland. </p>
<p>Cazar Search Ltd., which says it specializes in hiring
investment bankers across Europe, introduced Mirek Urbanski at
Deutsche Bank in Warsaw to Goldman Sachs. When he was later
hired, the search firm didn''t receive a fee and was told it
wasn''t entitled to one, according to the lawsuit filed in
February in London which became public this week. </p>
<p>Cazar had an agreement with Goldman to recruit candidates
in exchange for a fee of 30 percent of their compensation, as
much as 100,000 pounds ($163,000) for revenue-generating
divisions, and 125,000 pounds for investment banking and non-
revenue-generating divisions, according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Although the claimant does not know Mr. Urbanski''s
compensation, it is likely that it is sufficiently high that the
fee will be 100,000 pounds, Cazar said in the suit. </p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment. Urbanski
didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>In a similar case, settled confidentially last year,
executive-search firm Hogarth Davies Lloyd sued Nomura Holdings
Inc. over fees for recruiting Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)
bankers after it collapsed in late 2008. In that case, the firm
sought as much as 35.1 million pounds. </p>
<p>Key Players'' </p>
<p>Cazar was instructed in August 2009 by Halil Emecen and
Leon Ceder, of Goldman''s fixed income, currency and commodities
division to identify key players in Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia, particularly at Deutsche Bank,
according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The firm says it was told by Goldman after Urbanski met
with Ceder that the interview process was put on hold. It later
found out that Urbanski was hired by Goldman in July last year
in its securities department to expand operations in Eastern
Europe. </p>
<p>Ross Nolan of Cazar Search said in the suit he was told
they weren''t entitled to a fee. They had previously placed four
employees with the New York-based bank. </p>
<p>The case is Cazar Search Ltd. v. Goldman Sachs
International, case no. 11-535, High Court of Justice, Queen''s
Bench Division (London). </p>

<p>Federal prosecutors said they were
prepared to summon Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President Gary Cohn
as a witness to rebut Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam''s defense in his insider-trading trial. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told U.S. District
Judge Richard Holwell in Manhattan on April 12 that the
government would call Cohn to testify if a defense witness,
former Galleon U.S. President Richard Schutte, was permitted to
tell jurors about comments Cohn made at a meeting with
Rajaratnam on July 31, 2008. </p>
<p>That''s hearsay and shouldn''t be allowed as evidence,
Brodsky told the judge, according to a transcript of a
sidebar conference that jurors and others in the courtroom
couldn''t hear. If the defense witness testified about Cohn''s
comments, Brodsky said, We are prepared to call Mr. Cohn, and
we would be allowed to do that as part of our rebuttal case. </p>
<p>Schutte, who completed his testimony yesterday, wasn''t
asked by Rajaratnam''s lawyers about Cohn''s comments at the
meeting. Rajaratnam''s attorneys may finish their defense of the
billionaire hedge fund manager on April 18. Brodsky told Holwell
yesterday that prosecutors intended to present a rebuttal case.
He didn''t mention Cohn or identify other potential witnesses. </p>
<p>We have a bit of a rebuttal case we''re still preparing,
Brodsky said. </p>
<p>Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Intel, Clearwire </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 53, has been on trial since March 8 in the
largest crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
The Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of gaining
$63.8 million from tips leaked by corporate insiders and hedge-
fund traders about a dozen stocks, including Goldman Sachs,
Intel Corp. (INTC), Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) and Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) He
denies wrongdoing, saying he based his trades on research. </p>
<p>Summations in the case may begin next week, the judge said. </p>
<p>Gregg Jarrell, the top economist for the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission from 1984 to 1987, testified today as an
expert witness for Rajaratnam. Jarrell, who now teaches at the
University of Rochester''s graduate school of business in New
York, said the tips Rajaratnam allegedly received weren''t
material to Galleon or didn''t comprise inside information. </p>
<p>Certainty, Uncertainty </p>
<p>Jarrell showed jurors charts displaying press articles and
analyst reports about the stocks Rajaratnam is accused of
trading based on inside information. </p>
<p>On cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Streeter, Jarrell testified that mergers and acquisitions are
almost always preceded by analysts and journalists speculating
on whether the deal will go through. </p>
<p>Streeter asked Jarrell if a trader with access to accurate
information from a corporate insider has an advantage. </p>
<p>If you have certainty, in a world of uncertainty, that''s
an advantage, Jarrell said. </p>
<p>Jarrell''s testimony will continue April 18. </p>
<p>The discussion about Cohn came on April 12 as prosecutors
objected to Schutte''s testimony about a meeting he and
Rajaratnam had with Cohn. At that July 31, 2008, meeting, the
Galleon and Goldman Sachs executives discussed the potential
that the New York-based investment bank would combine with an
entity that had a large deposit base, including a commercial
bank or insurance company, Schutte testified. </p>
<p>Goldman Tip </p>
<p>The defense offered Schutte''s testimony to respond to the
government''s claim that Rajat Gupta, then a Goldman Sachs board
member, tipped Rajaratnam two days before that meeting that the
bank was considering buying American International Group Inc. (AIG) or
Wachovia Corp. Through Schutte''s testimony, the defense may have
been trying to show that the alleged tip from Gupta didn''t
involve confidential information. </p>
<p>Brodsky objected, according to the transcript of the
sidebar conference with the judge, saying defense lawyers wanted
to elicit a hearsay statement that Mr. Cohn made at the
meeting about Goldman Sachs possibly making a certain
plan. Brodsky then said the government would summon Cohn on
rebuttal if there was such testimony, according to the
transcript. </p>
<p>Cross-Examination </p>
<p>In the end, Schutte didn''t testify about Cohn''s comments at
the July 2008 meeting. Under cross-examination by Brodsky,
Schutte said he didn''t ask Cohn at the meeting whether Goldman
Sachs was planning to buy a bank imminently and that Cohn didn''t
address the issue. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
testifying at the trial on March 23, said Gupta violated the
firm''s confidentiality policies by allegedly telling Rajaratnam
about its earnings and strategic plans. Rajaratnam is accused of
earning $4.6 million by trading on tips about the New York-based
investment bank. </p>
<p>Gupta denies wrongdoing and hasn''t been criminally charged.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has brought an
administrative action against him. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, said its experimental rheumatoid arthritis pill
reduced symptoms of the disease in a study that may help it
wrest part of a $12 billion market from rivals. </p>
<p>The drug, tofacitinib, led to statistically significant
improvements for patients at six months compared with a
placebo, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement today. The
pill met the primary goals of the study when given in a 10-
milligram dose, while missing on a measure for reducing the
progression of structural damage in a 5-milligram dose, the
statement said. </p>
<p>Pfizer is competing with biotechnology companies to develop
the first pill in a decade for rheumatoid arthritis, which
destroys joints in 1.3 million Americans. The drug may bring
annual sales of $1.4 billion to treat the disease in 2015, said
Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in San
Francisco, in a March 21 note. If approved, it would compete
with Abbott Laboratories (ABT)'' Humira, Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)''s Remicade
and Amgen Inc. (AMGN)''s Enbrel, injectable drugs that now dominate the
market. </p>
<p>The results were mixed for Pfizer, since the ability to
prevent structural damage is an important attribute for
arthritis drugs, Lawrence Biegelsen, a Wells Fargo Securities
analyst in New York, said in a note to clients today. We do
not believe this is a major issue for tofacitinib as long as
the structural data is better at one year, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer Shares </p>
<p>Pfizer gained 4 cents to $20.53 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares rose 20 percent in the 12
months before today. </p>
<p>The study, dubbed Oral Scan Phase 3, followed 800 patients
with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Pfizer said
researchers found no new safety concerns for the pill, which was
formerly known as tasocitinib. An analysis of the results will
be submitted to a future scientific meeting, the company said. </p>
<p>The drug is the most-advanced pill in a family of
experimental treatments targeting a protein called JAK that
leads to joint destruction. </p>
<p>The study may lessen worries about the future of Humira,
which generated one-fifth of Abbott''s sales last year, said
David Lewis, a Morgan Stanley analyst in San Francisco, in a
note to clients. </p>
<p>Reports of Humira''s death are greatly exaggerated, he
wrote. Our sense is that expectations for tofacitinib are
optimistic. </p>
<p>Abbott rose 75 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.75 at 12:51
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of the
Abbott Park, Illinois-based company fell 2.5 percent in the 12
months before today. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) received
approval from India''s central bank to become a primary dealer,
allowing it to underwrite government bonds in the world''s
second-fastest growing major economy. </p>
<p>The investment bank, based in New York, will be able to
start the operations on April 18, according to a statement on
the website of the Reserve Bank of India. </p>
<p>The permit will let Goldman Sachs compete to help the
finance ministry raise an estimated 4.17 trillion rupees ($94
billion) from debt in the year ending March 31. The U.S. firm,
which lacks a license that would enable it to trade currencies
in India, trailed rivals including Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup
Inc. (C) in entering the nation''s primary dealership business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs expects to receive a banking license in the
nation in three to six months, according to a March 21 report by
Guy Moszkowski and Steven J. Chubak, analysts at Bank of America
Corp. who met with the investment bank''s Asian senior management
team in Hong Kong last month. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The investment bank currently employs about 100 people in
its Mumbai office and another 3,500 in Bangalore to provide
back-office services for its global operations. It has invested
about $2 billion in India, most of it since 2005, buying stakes
in companies including Mahindra  Mahindra Ltd. (MM), Max India Ltd.
and TVS Logistics Services Ltd. </p>
<p>Last month, Goldman Sachs agreed to buy Mumbai-based
Benchmark Asset Management Co. for an undisclosed amount. That
transaction gives it access to a market where assets managed by
mutual funds more than tripled to 6.8 trillion rupees in the
five years ended Dec. 31, according to the Association of Mutual
Funds of India. </p>

below cost, according to a supplement released April 13 along
with the New York-based company''s earnings. The cost of the
portfolio was listed at $10.8 billion, an 8.2 percent increase
in three months. Compared with a year earlier, the carrying
value rose 39 percent and the cost by 24 percent. </p>
<p>Private-equity managers have been marking up holdings as
stock markets rose, with the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index posting
a 21 percent return including dividends since the start of 2010.
KKR  Co., founded by billionaires Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, said last quarter that all except one of its private-
equity funds were marked above cost. All the private-equity

<p>JPMorgan told investors that future returns will be
volatile, according to a slide presentation accompanying

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s
largest software maker, needs to accelerate the pace of
product development to compete with Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple
Inc. (AAPL), co-founder Paul Allen said in an interview. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Windows 7 phone software and XBox Kinect
sensors, which help people play video games using physical
motion instead of controllers, are resonating with a younger
audience as the company tries to get more momentum in new
technology markets, said Allen, 58, who spoke at an event at the
92nd Street Y in New York last night. </p>
<p>Allen, whose memoir, Idea Man, will be released this
week, co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975. He left the
company in 1983 after being diagnosed with Hodgkin''s lymphoma
and resigned from the board in 2000. He is the 17th-wealthiest
American with a net worth of about $13 billion, according to
Forbes magazine, and currently owns the National Basketball
Association''s Portland Trail Blazers and the National Football
League''s Seattle Seahawks. </p>
<p>Microsoft has struggled to compete with mobile devices from
Apple, which has supplanted Microsoft as the largest technology
company by market value. Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs''s
transformation of Apple since his return in 1997 has been
unbelievable, Allen said. Microsoft, Google and Apple may be
in a three-horse race to innovate and win consumer approval
on new platforms including smartphones and tablet computers, he
said. </p>
<p>What he''s done with the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad --
what a triple play there, Allen said. </p>
<p>Health Disclosures </p>
<p>Like Jobs, Allen is again dealing with health issues. After
surviving Hodgkin''s lymphoma, Allen was diagnosed with non-
Hodgkin''s lymphoma in 2009. He said it was important for
companies to disclose some level of detail about their
executives'' health conditions for transparency. </p>
<p>Allen declined to comment on the NBA and NFL labor
situations, and he wouldn''t say if he would vote for the
Sacramento Kings to move to Anaheim, California. One of the
NBA''s biggest challenges was to come up with a financially
feasible revenue sharing plan so that midsize market
organizations can field competitive teams, he said. </p>
<p>No one likes teams moving around, but we all face the
financial consequences, too, Allen said. No owner enjoys
losing money. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named
Leslie A. Biddle, the firm''s global head of commodities sales,
to a new merchant-investing unit that will focus on the mining
industry. </p>
<p>As chief financial officer of the new business, Biddle
will focus on the evaluation, structuring and financing of new
opportunities and work closely with the Global Commodities
Principal Investing business, according to a memo today from the
co-heads of the securities unit, Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz. Biddle will
continue to report to Isabelle Ealet, Goldman Sachs''s global
head of commodities. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
continues to pursue opportunities to invest the firm''s own money
in companies and other assets even as the Dodd-Frank Act passed
last year prohibits banks from risking capital by betting for
their own accounts. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank provision known as the Volcker rule limits
banks that get federal support, such as deposit insurance, from
proprietary trading or investing in private equity or hedge
funds. The rule, which is still being interpreted by regulators,
doesn''t explicitly prevent banks from using their own money to
make long-term investments that are similar to those made by
private-equity firms. </p>

<p>Biddle joined the New York-based company in 2002 as vice
president in U.S. power sales and was promoted to managing
director in 2004 and to partner in 2006, the memo said. She is a

the finance committee, according to the memo. </p>
<p>As global head of commodities sales, Biddle has driven
some of our most important private-equity relationships and has
played a large role in expanding our commodities growth markets

<p>Biddle will be replaced as global head of commodities by L. Peter O''Hagan, who was a partner in the commodities unit before
becoming chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the
deposit-taking unit, in 2008, according to a separate memo
today. </p>
<p>The content of both memos was confirmed by Stephen Cohen, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, who declined to comment

<p>John F. W. Rogers, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)''s chief of staff, has $33.6 million of the firm''s
stock, according to a regulatory filing that disclosed his
holdings for the first time. </p>
<p>Edith W. Cooper, the global head of human capital
management, held stock worth $19.4 million, according to a
separate filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The values are based on the company''s closing stock
price of $155.13 on April 15 in New York. </p>
<p>Cooper and Rogers, who each have worked at Goldman Sachs
for more than 14 years and were promoted to partner in 2000, had
to disclose their holdings because they became executive
officers this month. They''re among 12 executive officers,
including Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn. </p>
<p>Cooper, 49, and Rogers, 55, already were on the firm''s
management committee and Rogers is chairman of the boards of the
Goldman Sachs Foundation and Goldman Sachs Gives, both
philanthropies. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on behalf of Rogers and Cooper, and the firm. </p>
<p>In addition to stock the executives already own, the
documents filed April 13 show Rogers has options to buy 444,503
shares and Cooper has options to buy 133,147. </p>
<p>Reagan, Bush </p>
<p>Rogers, who worked in the administrations of presidents
Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush before joining Goldman Sachs
in 1994, directly owns 103,950 shares and 91,668 restricted
stock units, the filing shows. A family trust also holds 21,113
shares of Goldman Sachs stock. His options have strike prices
ranging from $78.78 to $204.16 and exercise dates from Nov. 25,
2011, through December 2018. </p>
<p>Cooper, who joined the firm''s commodities unit in 1996 and
worked in futures and sales before taking over the personnel
division in 2008, has 20,869 shares and 98,169 restricted stock
units. A family trust owns 5,710 shares. Her options can be
exercised at prices ranging from $78.78 to $91.61 from Nov. 25,
2011, through the end of 2018. </p>
<p>Shares of New York-based Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services provider, boosted
its full-year profit forecast as companies buy more software and
equipment. </p>
<p>Operating earnings will be at least $13.15 a share this
year, higher than a previous projection of at least $13 and the
$13.08 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
First-quarter services signings fell 14 percent from a year
earlier, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today, erasing a gain
in the shares in extended trading. </p>
<p>The contract signings were a blemish, although they
aren''t a good indicator of future revenue, said Chris Whitmore,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in San Francisco who recommends
buying the stock. For the first quarter, IBM reported a solid
revenue beat, driven by improvement in services and strength in
hardware. </p>
<p>Sales last quarter climbed 7.7 percent to $24.6 billion,
topping projections, as software, hardware and services revenue
jumped. Equipment sales climbed for the fifth straight quarter
as customers continued to upgrade after IBM released its Power7
server-computer system and a new mainframe last year. </p>
<p>IBM slid $4 to $161.40 at 6:17 p.m. after rising to $170 in
extended trading. Before the earnings'' release, the stock fell
54 cents to $165.40 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 13 percent this year. </p>
<p>Volatile'' Signings </p>
<p>Signings -- the value of new contracts signed during a
specific quarter -- declined to $10.5 billion. It''s the fourth
time in five quarters that a drop in new contract signings
overshadowed an improved profit forecast. </p>
<p>The signings figure is volatile and not as accurate a
predictor of sales as the backlog, which includes contracts
accumulated over time, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said on a conference call today. Backlog climbed 5.6 percent to
$142 billion last quarter. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income rose 10 percent to $2.86 billion,
or $2.31 a share, from $2.6 billion, or $1.97, a year earlier. </p>
<p>Profit on an operating basis was $2.41 a share, compared
with analysts'' average estimate of $2.30. This is the first year
IBM is reporting on an operating format, which excludes
acquisition and some retirement costs. </p>
<p>Hardware sales climbed 19 percent to $4.02 billion, the
largest jump of any segment. Software revenue rose 5.8 percent
to $5.31 billion. Sales from emerging markets, which IBM expects
to make up almost 30 percent of revenue in 2015, advanced 18
percent. </p>
<p>Gross profit margin expanded to 44.1 percent last quarter,
from 43.6 percent a year earlier. The company had about $220
million in workforce restructuring costs, Loughridge said. </p>
<p>Limited'' Japan Effect </p>
<p>IBM, which gets about 11 percent of its sales from Japan,
saw a limited effect from last month''s earthquake, Loughridge
said on the call. The company''s infrastructure in the country,
which is in very good shape, had about $20 million in
damages. The company doesn''t expect appreciable impact on
its supply chain, he said. </p>
<p>Operating earnings will be at least $20 a share in 2015,
IBM said last month, reiterating a forecast from a year ago. </p>
<p>The company is investing in cloud-computing and analytics-
software businesses, which the company predicts will generate $7
billion and $16 billion in revenue, respectively, by 2015. Those
initiatives, along with investments in emerging markets and
Smarter Planet -- IBM''s plan to digitize physical infrastructure
-- will help add on about $20 billion in sales through 2015, the
company said last month. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano also plans to make
about $20 billion in acquisitions in the same period, a
projection he first gave last year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) declined
in New York trading after first-quarter profit fell 21 percent
and analysts said the fifth-biggest U.S. bank relied on
unpredictable investment gains to beat estimates. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs dropped $1.92, or 1.3 percent, to $151.86 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest closing
price since Oct. 15. Net income slid to $2.74 billion, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
56, depended on trading and investments with the firm''s own
money to generate 79 percent of first-quarter revenue. The
investing and lending segment, which accounted for 23 percent of
revenue, is unreliable because results are tied to market moves
and because regulators might add restrictions to the business,
said some analysts and investors. </p>
<p>A large part of that beat was driven by larger-than-
expected investment gains, which are volatile and could easily
fall sharply into the next quarter, said Richard Staite, an
analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London who rates the stock
neutral. It is still unclear under the new regulations
just how much proprietary trading and investing Goldman can
do. </p>
<p>Earnings per common share, which includes the cost of
preferred dividend payments to Warren Buffett''s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., dropped to $1.56 from $5.59, beating the 81-cent
average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Basel, Dodd-Frank </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s biggest businesses, trading and investing,
are the ones most affected by new capital requirements drawn up
by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and by limits on
the firm''s proprietary trading and investments in hedge funds
and private-equity funds imposed by the U.S.''s Dodd-Frank
financial-overhaul law. </p>
<p>Results from the other main businesses, investment banking
and asset management, were disappointing, according to analysts
including Glenn Schorr at Nomura Holdings Inc. and Richard Bove
at Rochdale Securities LLC. </p>
<p>The results show solid trading, better-than-expected
Investing  Lending, and some softness in investment banking and
asset management, Schorr, who rates the company''s shares a
buy, said in a note to investors. Some may question the
sustainability of some of the gains in Investing  Lending. </p>
<p>Bove cut his rating on Goldman Sachs stock to neutral
from buy even as he raised his earnings estimates. </p>
<p>Particularly Disappointing'' </p>
<p>Particularly disappointing were the advisory results,
Bove wrote in a note to investors, referring to Goldman Sachs''s
revenue from providing takeover advice. Investment management
activity was weak. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s overall net revenue fell 7 percent to $11.9
billion, the company said. Compared with last year''s fourth
quarter, revenue increased 38 percent. Annualized return on
average common shareholders'' equity, a measure of how well the
firm reinvests earnings, decreased to 12.2 percent from 20.1
percent in the first quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>First-quarter revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies
and commodities, the firm''s biggest source of revenue, dropped
28 percent to $4.33 billion from $6.02 billion a year earlier,
and more than doubled from $1.64 billion in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Looking ahead, we continue to see encouraging indications
for economic activity globally, Blankfein said in the
statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, reported last week that its fixed-income trading revenue
fell 4 percent to $5.24 billion from a year earlier, and was up
82 percent from the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Equities-trading revenue at Goldman Sachs fell 7 percent to
$2.32 billion from $2.49 billion a year earlier and was up from
$2 billion in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Revenue from investing and lending, the firm''s second-
biggest segment after trading last year, climbed 37 percent to
$2.71 billion from $1.97 billion a year earlier and compared
with $1.99 billion in the fourth quarter. The business includes
Goldman Sachs''s holding in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (1398)
Ltd. as well as stakes in companies and other assets held by
units like the Special Situations Group or Principal Investment
Area. </p>
<p>David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial officer,
told analysts on a conference call that about 20 percent to 25
percent of the investing and lending segment''s revenue is from
interest on loans. </p>
<p>So that is going to be recurring, but that''s a small part
of it, he said. </p>
<p>Trading, Investing </p>
<p>Without the better-than-expected trading and investing
lines, Goldman Sachs wouldn''t have been able to exceed
estimates, said Benjamin Wallace, analyst at Grimes  Co. in
Westborough, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>The beat that was delivered was from things people look
at as less predictable, said Wallace, whose firm manages about
$1 billion and doesn''t own Goldman Sachs stock. It goes back
to the grand point that Goldman still relies on its trading
operations. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits, the company''s largest expense,
fell 5 percent to $5.23 billion from $5.49 billion a year
earlier and accounted for 44 percent of revenue. </p>
<p>Non-compensation expenses rose 23 percent to $2.62 billion,
driven in part by an impairment charge of about $220 million on
assets held for sale, the firm said. The primary cost related to
the firm''s Litton Loan Servicing LP unit, a residential
mortgage-servicing company that the firm has said it is trying
to sell. </p>
<p>Advisory Revenue </p>
<p>Investment-banking revenue increased 5 percent to $1.27
billion from $1.2 billion. Advisory revenue, which includes fees
for takeover advice, declined 23 percent to $357 million from
$464 million a year earlier, while fees from debt underwriting
climbed 32 percent to $486 million and equity underwriting
revenue advanced 15 percent to $426 million. </p>
<p>The firm ranks third this year among advisers on announced
mergers, down from the top spot at the same point last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs''s
advisory revenue fell short of JPMorgan''s $429 million in the
quarter. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs tops underwriters of equity and equity-linked
offerings globally so far this year and is fifth among managers
of high-yield debt sales worldwide, up from seventh at the same
point last year, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Backlog Grows </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s backlog of investment-banking transactions
increased compared with the end of 2010, the company said. </p>
<p>Revenue from investment management rose 16 percent to $1.27
billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier. Assets under
management were unchanged at $840 billion as clients withdrew
$12 billion from Goldman Sachs''s funds and market gains
increased the value of the assets by an identical amount, the
firm said. </p>
<p>That''s going to be a business where they don''t have the
kind of competitive advantage that they do in the others, said
David Trone, head of U.S. banks and brokerage research for JMP
Securities LLC in New York, who recommends buying Goldman Sachs
shares. You''re as good as your last performance, not your
brand name. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and
Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. (ENDP) will have to train doctors
before they can give patients extended-release painkillers under
a U.S. plan aimed at reducing prescription drug abuse. </p>
<p>Sixteen companies that make 25 pain patches and pills must
create a program to teach medical professionals when these drugs
should be used to combat pain and how to recognize signs that
the treatments are being misused, the Food and Drug
Administration said today. The Obama administration is urging
Congress to mandate the training as part of licensing required
by the Drug Enforcement Administration every three years. </p>
<p>The FDA began discussing in February 2009 how best to
prevent deaths and side effects from overdose or tampering of
long-acting painkillers to get high. While the agency has
stopped short of restricting drug distribution, tougher controls
may follow if abuse isn''t curbed, said Janet Woodcock, director
of the FDA''s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. </p>
<p>There''s an epidemic of prescription drug abuse that is
beginning to rival that of illegal drug abuse, Woodcock said
in a telephone interview. It''s either the kids who get it out
of their medicine cabinet or someone who gets multiple
prescriptions. </p>
<p>The medicines cited by the FDA include New York-based
Pfizer''s Avinza and Embeda morphine capsules; Duragesic, a
fentanyl patch made by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ and
generic competitors; Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania-based Endo''s
Opana oxymorphone tablets; and OxyContin, an oxycodone tablet
made by closely held Purdue Pharma LP of Stamford, Connecticut. </p>
<p>High-Dose Painkillers </p>
<p>The drugs are sustained-release, high-dose painkillers
derived from the opium poppy, also known as opioids. Doctors
considered these medicines to be a major breakthrough for cancer
and chronic pain when they were introduced in the mid-1990s,
though it became clear the drugs were easy to manipulate. Purdue
agreed in 2007 to pay $634.5 million to settle claims that
promotions for OxyContin from 1996 to 2001 misled doctors about
the drug''s risks. </p>
<p>The risk-minimization program is the largest ever imposed
by FDA, Woodcock said. The agency gained the authority to
require these types of plans as a condition for marketing under
2007 legislation. An estimated 23 million prescriptions for
extended-release opioid drugs are written annually, representing
about one-tenth of prescription painkillers, according to the
FDA. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s King Pharma division, acquired last month, has
been developing drugs with physical and chemical properties to
resist tampering. Embeda, the first of these medicines, is
included in the training program because it hasn''t been proven
to be safer than the older medicines, Woodcock said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the

pay employee salaries, bonuses and benefits in the first

<p>The compensation and benefits expense, the firm''s biggest
cost, is enough to pay each employee $147,825 for the quarter,
down 11 percent from $165,952 a year earlier, New York-based
Goldman Sachs said today in a statement. The bank employed
35,400 people at the end of March, up 7 percent from a year
earlier even after the firm cut 300 jobs in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has reduced pay since 2007, when Chairman and

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank, posted a 21 percent drop in first-
quarter profit, a smaller decline than analysts estimated, as
fixed-income trading revenue more than doubled from a weak
fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Net income fell to $2.74 billion from $3.46 billion a year
earlier, the New York-based firm said today in a statement.
Earnings per share, which includes the cost of preferred
dividend payments to Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
dropped to $1.56 from $5.59. The average estimate of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for 81 cents. </p>
<p>Under Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, Goldman Sachs has relied on fixed-income,
currencies and commodities trading for the biggest piece of its
revenue. After reaching a record in 2009, earnings failed to
attain their year-earlier mark in the last four quarters as
competition and regulation increased. Wall Street''s fixed-income
trading revenue in the fourth quarter dropped to the lowest
level since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Trading was good this quarter, not bad, Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. who recommends buying
Goldman Sachs shares, said before the earnings were reported.
There''s been a lot of concern in the marketplace about whether
what we saw in the fourth quarter was an early warning of a
continuing slowdown in fixed income. </p>
<p>Share Performance </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs rose to $155.80 at 8:15 a.m. in New York
trading, from $153.78 at the close yesterday. The stock has
performed worse this year than rivals including New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) and Zurich-based Credit
Suisse Group AG. (CSGN) </p>
<p>Net revenue fell 7 percent to $11.9 billion, the statement
showed. Compared with last year''s fourth quarter, revenue
increased 38 percent. Annualized return on average common
shareholders'' equity, a measure of how well the firm reinvests
earnings, decreased to 12.2 percent from 20.1 percent in the
first quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>First-quarter revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies
and commodities dropped 28 percent to $4.33 billion from $6.02
billion a year earlier, and jumped 164 percent from $1.64
billion in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Looking ahead, we continue to see encouraging indications

statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported
last week that its fixed-income trading revenue fell 4 percent
to $5.24 billion from a year earlier, and was up 82 percent from
the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Equities-trading revenue at Goldman Sachs fell 7 percent to
$2.32 billion from $2.49 billion a year earlier and was up from
$2 billion in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Revenue from investing and lending, the firm''s second-
biggest segment after trading last year, climbed 37 percent to
$2.71 billion from $1.97 billion a year earlier and compared
with $1.99 billion in the fourth quarter. Investing and lending
includes Goldman Sachs''s holding in Industrial  Commercial Bank
of China (1398) Ltd. as well as stakes in companies and other assets
held by units like the Special Situations Group or Principal
Investment Area. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits, the company''s largest expense,
fell 5 percent to $5.23 billion from $5.49 billion a year
earlier and accounted for 44 percent of revenue. </p>
<p>Litton Business </p>
<p>Non-compensation expenses rose 23 percent to $2.62 billion,
driven in part by an impairment charge of about $220 million on
assets held for sale, the firm said. The primary cost related to
the firm''s Litton Loan Servicing LP unit, a residential
mortgage-servicing company that the firm has said it is trying

includes fees for takeover advice, declined 23 percent to $357
million from $464 million a year earlier, while fees from debt
underwriting climbed 32 percent to $486 million and equity
underwriting revenue advanced 15 percent to $426 million. </p>
<p>The firm ranks third this year among advisers on announced

increased compared with the end of 2010, the company said. </p>
<p>Revenue from investment management rose 16 percent to $1.27
billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier. Assets under
management were unchanged at $840 billion. </p>
<p>Blankfein, who is approaching his fifth anniversary as
Goldman Sachs''s chairman and CEO, is grappling with new capital
requirements drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision along with limits on the firm''s proprietary trading

<p>In a filing on March 1, Goldman Sachs estimated its
reasonably possible losses from legal claims could reach
$3.4 billion as the firm faces suits related to its activities
before, during and after the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Last week, Senator Carl M. Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
leads the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, issued a
report based on two years of investigation into the financial
crisis and accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients and
Congress. Goldman Sachs has denied that it misled anyone. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to supply
films online to U.K. customers of Lovefilm, the Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).-
owned company that operates a subscription-based movie-rental
service in Europe. </p>
<p>Lovefilm will add more than 50 Disney titles including
Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Dead Poets Society to
movies it offers online to U.K. subscribers paying 5.99 pounds
($9.74) and up per month, according to a statement today. The
company, which claims 1.6 million customers, also offers DVDs by
mail, like Netflix Inc. (NFLX) in the U.S., as well as video games. </p>
<p>The Disney agreement also provides Lovefilm with newer
movies like Tron: Legacy to offer for a pay-per-view fee,
the company said. Seattle-based Amazon, which acquired Lovefilm
in January, started a  U.S. service to compete with Netflix in

service is an add-on to Amazon Instant Video, which offers more
than 90,000 movies and TV shows to buy or rent. </p>
<p>Lovefilm''s U.K. subscribers pay as much as 19.39 pounds a
month for unlimited mail and streaming viewing of films, TV
shows and games. The company also operates in Germany, Sweden,
Denmark and Norway. </p>
<p>Amazon, the world''s largest online retailer, fell $1.67 to

<p>Kevin Turner, chief operating
officer of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), comments on the world''s biggest
software maker''s business performance in Japan and other markets
and its plans to invest in cloud computing. Turner spoke to
reporters in Singapore today. </p>
<p>On business performance: </p>
<p>Our business in Japan has been really strong. We''re
certainly working through the national disaster that they''re
dealing with in their economy. We don''t know what''s going to
happen there. But certainly, we''ve had a very good and a very
healthy business for a very long time and certainly year to
date, it''s been very strong. </p>
<p>If you look across markets like Singapore, our business
is growing extremely well and very rapidly. The beautiful thing
about the global economy is that there''re always some strong
markets and always some markets that are going through
opportunity. </p>
<p>Our developed markets have been really, really strong all
out as a company. In emerging markets, it''s really relative to
what''s going on in the various environments, some are really off
the charts and some are going through an opportunity to
correct. </p>
<p>On cloud technology, or computing delivered over the Internet: </p>
<p>Office 365 is a game changer for our customers. Our plan
is to continue to invest in our cloud capabilities. Today more
than 75 percent of Microsoft''s RD engineering talent is devoted
to cloud-related services and products. Over the next year, we
expect that number to grow in excess of 90 percent. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) agreed to convert
most of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)''s preferred stock in
the company, paying a premium of about $2 billion to eliminate
annual dividend payments of $784 million. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ will exchange the $7.8 billion of
convertible preferred stock, which had a 10 percent dividend,
for 385 million shares of Morgan Stanley common stock, the banks
said in a statement yesterday. The move increases Morgan
Stanley''s Tier 1 common ratio by about 2.7 percentage points to
14.5 percent, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Without a deal, Morgan Stanley could have only forced a
conversion if its share price climbed to more than $37.875, 45
percent higher than the April 20 closing price, and traded above
that level for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. Mitsubishi
UFJ acquired the stake when it invested $9 billion in Morgan
Stanley in October 2008, as the New York-based firm''s stock
price tumbled after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>What we have spent the last couple of years doing is
clearing up a number of uncertainties that impact our future,
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on a
conference call with analysts. This was frankly No. 1 on my
list for this year. And we had a window of opportunity here to
get this off the list and obviously we had to pay a premium. </p>
<p>Shares Rise </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley rose 44 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $26.48 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday after
posting first-quarter profit that beat analysts'' estimates. Net
income was $968 million, or 50 cents a share, and adjusted
earnings of 46 cents topped the average projection of 40 cents. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan''s biggest publicly traded bank, rose
0.5 percent to 376 yen at 12:49 p.m. today in Tokyo. </p>
<p>The agreement provides Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ with a 22
percent ownership interest in the U.S. investment bank, making
it the biggest common shareholder. It was also given a second
seat on Morgan Stanley''s board. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ seems to be betting more on Morgan
Stanley''s business performance given that Morgan Stanley''s
earnings have improved in the last few years, said Takehito Yamanaka, a Tokyo-based analyst at MF Global FXA Securities Ltd.
For Morgan Stanley, this will clearly help to boost its core
Tier 1 capital ratio. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ Deputy President Nobuyuki Hirano said the
companies will expand their alliance in Asian markets as well as
further strengthen their respective areas of expertise. </p>
<p>Ties for Decades'' </p>
<p>MUFG''s core area for overseas business is commercial
banking while Morgan Stanley is competitive in areas such as
mergers and acquisitions and retail brokerage services, Hirano
said at a press briefing in Tokyo today. When asked whether
Mitsubishi UFJ would consider selling its stake in Morgan
Stanley, he said the banks will maintain ties for decades. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley increased the number of common shares
Mitsubishi UFJ would receive by 75 million to reach the
agreement. That represents a premium of about $2 billion,
leading to a charge in the third quarter when the conversion is
expected to be completed, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer
Ruth Porat said on yesterday''s call. </p>
<p>Given the fact that it accelerates the cleanup of this
issue, I think it''s a fair price to pay, said Shannon Stemm,
an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis who rates the
stock buy. We definitely view this as a positive. </p>
<p>Ancillary Benefits'' </p>
<p>The increase in shares outweighs the reduction in preferred
dividends, diluting normalized earnings per share by 4
percent, Mike Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities
USA in New York, said in a note to investors. Mayo wrote that
he''s not yet reducing his estimates because of potential
ancillary benefits, including lower funding costs and a
stronger balance sheet. </p>
<p>The conversion would reduce book value to $29.36 a share,
from $31.45 and tangible book value to $25.78 from $26.97,
including the impact of the premium, Porat said on the call. The
firm is very comfortable with its goal of return on equity
in the mid-teens even with the higher equity base, Porat
said. Morgan Stanley had ROE of 6.2 percent in the first quarter. </p>
<p>That''s higher than we are predicting, Stemm said. The
mid-teens ROE target might be a little bit lofty, but certainly
moving higher from here is reasonable. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ still holds about $500 million of non-
convertible preferred stock with a 10 percent dividend. Morgan
Stanley can buy back that stake for about $572 million beginning
on Oct. 15, 2011, according to the firm''s annual 10-K filing. </p>
<p>Joint Venture Loss </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., one of two
Japanese joint ventures between the two banks and the one MUFG
controls, yesterday posted a loss of 145 billion yen ($1.8
billion) in the year ended March 31 that was fueled by wrong-way
bets on fixed-income products. </p>
<p>The tie-up is 40 percent owned by Morgan Stanley. MUFG will
contribute about $370 million of capital this month to the
venture. That contribution won''t dilute Morgan Stanley''s
ownership and is expected to reduce the U.S. bank''s loss by
about $145 million, which will be reflected in second-quarter
earnings, Porat said on the call. </p>
<p>Fumiyuki Akikusa, president of the joint venture, plans to
resign after the investment bank''s loss, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified
because the information isn''t public. A portion of the fixed-
income portfolio that drove the losses will be transferred to
the joint venture controlled by Morgan Stanley, Porat said. </p>

<p>One of four deaths during a trial
of Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s experimental rheumatoid arthritis pill can be
linked to the drug, the company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The New York-based drugmaker''s shares fell the most since
August after a study summary published online showed four deaths
and four infections among patients taking tofacitinib. There
were no serious adverse events in the group given a placebo,
according to the abstract of the study being presented at the
European League Against Rheumatism meeting in London. </p>
<p>It''s a big overreaction, said David Maris, an analyst
with CLSA in New York, in a telephone interview today. Investors
saw four deaths and flipped out, and as they start to digest
this a little more they''ll realize it doesn''t appear to be as
bad as people thought. </p>
<p>One of the four deaths was from respiratory failure related
to tofacitinib, Pfizer said in a press release. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 60 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $19.79 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the
biggest decline since August 11. Abbott Laboratories, whose
Humira injectable drug would face competition from Pfizer''s
pill, rose $1, or 2 percent, to $51.80. </p>
<p>Biotech Rivals </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, is competing with
biotechnology companies to develop the first pill in a decade
for rheumatoid arthritis, which destroys joints in 1.3 million
Americans. By 2015, Pfizer''s drug was expected to reach $1.18
billion in annual sales, the average estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>There are no serious events in the control arm, and then
you have a bunch of adverse events; people are going to question
the safety of the drug, said Les Funtleyder, a New York-based
fund manager at Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, said in a
telephone interview. Really we need to get more data. It may
not be statistically significant. But that may not even matter
because people are so sensitive about safety concerns these
days. </p>
<p>The study followed 792 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
who failed to improve after taking other treatments. The other
deaths involved a case of brain injury after trauma, a case of
worsening rheumatoid arthritis after discontinuing the drug and
a case of acute heart failure, Pfizer said in the statement. </p>
<p>The drug is the most advanced pill in a family of
experimental treatments targeting a protein called JAK that
leads to joint destruction. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), one of the
lenders criticized over improper foreclosures on military
families'' homes, agreed to pay $56 million to settle claims it
overcharged service members on their mortgages. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will pay $27 million in cash to about 6,000
active-duty military personnel who were overcharged on their
mortgages, cut interest rates on soldiers'' home loans and return
homes that were wrongfully foreclosed upon, according to
settlement terms filed in federal court in Beaufort, South
Carolina. </p>
<p>JPMorgan officials said three months ago that one of the
bank''s units had made errors in the handling of mortgages
covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. That law was
enacted in 1942 to shield deployed military personnel from
financial stress. </p>
<p>We are sorry and regret the mistakes our firm made on
mortgages for members of the military, Frank Bisignano, a
JPMorgan official appointed to oversee the company''s home-
lending unit in February, said in an e-mailed statement. We
hold ourselves accountable and responsible for these mistakes. </p>
<p>In February, JPMorgan officials said they returned 10 homes
to families protected by the law that were found to have been
taken improperly in foreclosure actions. The servicemembers law
requires enhanced reviews of soldiers'' mortgages and payment
histories before such actions are undertaken. </p>
<p>JPMorgan officials said at the time that its mortgage unit
didn''t provide the required review to a total of 18 military
families whose homes were foreclosed upon. </p>
<p>Painful Aberration'' </p>
<p>This company has a great history of honoring military and
veterans, and the mistakes we made on military foreclosures are
a painful aberration on that track record, Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said in a February statement. </p>
<p>The bank said in January it would pay about $2 million to
about 4,500 service members after discovering they''d been
overcharged on their JPMorgan mortgages. </p>
<p>The servicemembers law allows soldiers to demand mortgage
interest rates be set at 6 percent while on active-duty status.
The law applies to current loans and those taken out by troops
prior to being deployed. </p>
<p>JPMorgan executives discovered the errors after Marine
Captain Jonathon Rowles, a fighter pilot, sued the bank in
federal court in South Carolina last year over the mortgage
unit''s handling of his $255,000 loan. </p>
<p>Interest-Rate Reduction </p>
<p>Rowles contends Chase Home Finance LLC officials originally
failed to heed his interest-rate reduction request, according to
court filings. After agreeing to comply with the law, the lender
required him to reapply for the protections four times in a
year. </p>
<p>The bank also failed to credit Rowles'' payments based on
the mandated 6 percent interest rate and began a round of
aggressive collection methods for what it characterized as a
past-due balance on the account, according to court filings. </p>
<p>The bank threatened to report Rowles to credit bureaus and
start foreclosure proceedings against his home, the captain said
in his lawsuit. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement, Rowles and an estimated
6,000 other service personnel whose mortgage accounts were
mishandled will split $27 million in cash, according to court
filings. That will provide an average payout of $4,500 per
soldier. Recoveries in the cases will vary based on service
member''s individual damage claims. </p>
<p>Rowles, now stationed in South Korea, will become an
informal advisor to a veterans advisory council JPMorgan has
created, according to court filings. </p>
<p>Interest-Rate Cut </p>
<p>The accord also calls for JPMorgan to cut interest rates on
all mortgages held by deployed troops to 4 percent for one year,
the filing shows. </p>
<p>The lender has agreed to return houses that have been
improperly foreclosed upon and not yet sold and to pay fair
market value for those already auctioned off, according to the
filing. It also will forgive any remaining mortgage debt of
military borrowers who were protected by the law and mistakenly
foreclosed upon. </p>
<p>JPMorgan officials said in today''s statement they''ve
already made $6 million in payments to military borrowers who
were overcharged. Under the settlement, the bank also will
provide an estimated $6.4 million in additional benefits to
soldiers who may have been subjected to wrongful foreclosure
practices. </p>
<p>Finally, the company will pay $8 million in legal fees for
Rowles and other affected military personal who sued over the
mishandled mortgages, according to court filings. </p>
<p>Judge Must Approve </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Margaret B. Seymour still must approve
the class-action settlement before it becomes final.
We are very satisfied with this negotiated settled as are our
clients, Richard Harpootlian, a Columbia, South Carolina-based
lawyer representing soldiers who sued the bank over the mortgage
miscues, said in an interview. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation
of lenders'' handling of service members'' mortgages in the wake
of disclosures about mistakes. </p>
<p>Units of Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest U.S. bank by
assets, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) are being probed over alleged
violations of the servicemembers law, Justice Department
officials said last month. </p>
<p>A Michigan judge found in 2009 that Saxon Mortgage, the
Morgan Stanley unit, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas
violated the servicemembers law by foreclosing on a U.S. Army
sergeant''s home in Michigan. The case later settled and terms of
the accord weren''t made public. </p>
<p>The South Carolina case is Rowles v. Chase Home Finance
LLC, 10-1756-MBS, U.S. District Court, District of South
Carolina (Beaufort Division). </p>

<p>The abstract notes that one of the deaths was due to

<p>Morgan Stanley, operator of the
world''s largest brokerage, rose in New York trading after
reporting profit that beat analysts'' estimates and saying a
Japanese bank agreed to convert a preferred stake in the firm. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income was $968 million, or 50 cents a
share, and adjusted earnings of 46 cents topped analysts''
average estimate of 40 cents. Net income included a 26-cent loss
tied to a joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., which agreed to convert $7.8 billion of preferred stock
and eliminate $784 million in annual dividend payments for
Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Trading revenue almost tripled from the fourth quarter,
bolstering Chief Executive Officer James Gorman''s efforts to
rejuvenate the New York-based firm''s fixed-income business,
which generated less than a third of the revenue Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. produced in the past two years. MUFG''s conversion
will add about 2.7 percentage points to Morgan Stanley (MS)''s Tier 1
common ratio and eliminates what Gorman, 52, called the No.
1 uncertainty for the firm. </p>
<p>There''s evidence of improvement in their trading
operations, especially with equity trading, which was very
strong, said Shannon Stemm, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co.
in St. Louis who rates the stock buy. The conversion
improves their capital position, and it removes those preferred
dividend payments. So while the share count will go up, it adds
some flexibility. </p>
<p>Share Performance </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley rose 44 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $26.48 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It
earlier jumped as much as 5.2 percent, the biggest intraday
climb since January. The stock was down 4.3 percent this year
through yesterday, after falling 8.1 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>Earnings fell 45 percent from the $1.78 billion the firm
reported in last year''s first three months, when Wall Street
posted the best fixed-income trading quarter since the financial
crisis. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the 26-
cent joint venture loss and a 30-cent tax gain, beat the average
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., which is 40
percent owned by Morgan Stanley, said today it will cut jobs and
raise capital after posting a loss of 145 billion yen ($1.8
billion) last year that was fueled by wrong-way bets on fixed-
income products. </p>
<p>Committed'' to Japan </p>
<p>While the loss at our joint venture with MUFG is
disappointing, we remain strongly committed to the Japanese
market and our strategic partners at MUFG, Gorman said in the
statement. This loss does not impact the progress we are
making in pursuing our own strategic priorities. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ will exchange the convertible preferred
stake, which had a 10 percent dividend, for 385 million shares
of Morgan Stanley common stock. That included 75 million
additional shares Morgan Stanley agreed to issue in order to
reach the agreement. </p>
<p>The move provides Mitsubishi UFJ with a 22 percent
ownership interest in the U.S. investment bank and a second seat
on its board of directors. Mitsubishi UFJ still holds $500
million of non-convertible preferred stock with a 10 percent
dividend. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell 1.3 percent on April 19 in New York
trading after first-quarter profit declined 21 percent and
analysts said the bank relied on unpredictable investment gains
to beat estimates. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) exceeded estimates last
week as investment-banking revenue jumped 33 percent from the
fourth quarter. Both companies are based in New York. </p>
<p>Book Value </p>
<p>Revenue at Morgan Stanley dropped to $7.64 billion from
$9.07 billion a year earlier. Book value per share fell to
$31.45 from $31.49 at the end of December. The firm''s return on
equity from continuing operations, a measure of how well it
reinvests earnings, was 6.2 percent. </p>
<p>In the first quarter, Morgan Stanley''s revenue from fixed-
income sales and trading was $1.77 billion, compared with
negative revenue of $29 million in the fourth quarter and $2.72
billion in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding gains or losses
from its own credit spreads, fixed-income revenue was $1.93
billion, compared with $4.3 billion at Goldman Sachs and $5.2
billion at JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Gorman said in February that his No. 1 priority is
turning around the firm''s fixed-income trading unit, hoping to
capture a 2 percentage-point gain in market share this year.
Excluding gains and losses tied to their own debt, Morgan
Stanley had about a 6 percent market share in 2010 among 11 of
the largest U.S. and European banks, according to data compiled
by analysts at JPMorgan and Nomura. </p>
<p>DiMaio, deRegt </p>
<p>Gorman replaced fixed-income trading head Jack DiMaio with
Ken deRegt, and the firm hired Glenn Hadden from Goldman Sachs
as global head of interest rates. </p>
<p>This is the first time that I have felt comfortable with
the leadership across all of our fixed-income businesses,
Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. You''ve got to
have that ability at the top and the investment we made in
hiring people combined with the leadership at the top is what
has moved the needle. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is looking to gain market share in rates,
where it increased staff by about 20 percent, and foreign
exchange, where it added 40 percent more people, Gorman said in
February. </p>
<p>The firm saw particular strength in those areas in the
first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an
interview today. </p>
<p>MBIA Hedges </p>
<p>Hedges against exposure to bond insurers including MBIA
Inc. resulted in net losses of about $318 million, which were
included in fixed-income results. Porat said today that the
hedges are not closed out and said some of them have been
adjusted. </p>
<p>In equities trading, Morgan Stanley''s first-quarter revenue
rose to $1.7 billion, up 57 percent from the fourth quarter and
20 percent higher than a year earlier. The unit''s revenue
compares with $2.3 billion at Goldman Sachs and $1.4 billion at
JPMorgan. </p>
<p>We think Morgan''s investment bank posted solid results,
with clear improvement in trading, particularly in equities,
Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a
note to investors. Trading improvement is one of the clear
issues investors have been waiting for. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $1.01 billion in revenue from
investment banking in the quarter, up 14 percent from a year
earlier. That included $385 million from financial advisory,
$285 million from equity underwriting and $338 million from debt
underwriting. </p>
<p>Merger Rankings </p>
<p>The firm was the second-ranked adviser on mergers announced
in the quarter, as well as the fourth-ranked underwriter of
stock offerings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
finished 2010 as both the top underwriter of equity offerings
and the top adviser on announced mergers and acquisitions
globally for the first time since Bloomberg began compiling data
in 1999. </p>
<p>Global wealth management, which includes Morgan Stanley''s
brokerage joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney,
posted pretax income of $348 million, up from $278 million in
the first quarter of 2010. The division''s pretax profit margin
fell to 10 percent from 12 percent in the fourth quarter. The
unit had $11.4 billion of net new assets. </p>
<p>Asset management reported a pretax gain of $127 million,
compared with $174 million in the previous year''s period. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits decreased 2 percent from the
year-earlier quarter to $4.33 billion, or 57 percent of the
firm''s overall revenue. The ratio was higher than in the first
quarter of 2010, when the bank set aside 49 percent of revenue. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said that cash will
play a larger role in employee compensation amid stiffening
competition for valuable workers. </p>
<p>For all employees, we will shift a portion of stock award
targets into base salary, providing more cash up front, Steve Ballmer, Chief Executive Officer of Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, wrote today in a memo, which was obtained by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Ballmer said he''s making the shift to improve how the
world''s biggest software maker rewards staff. As economic growth
rebounds, technology companies are adding employees, touching
off a tussle for engineers and computer scientists among such
companies as Microsoft, Google Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. More cash
may be a more alluring reward than Microsoft''s shares, which are
lower now than they were a decade ago. </p>
<p>The newer companies may be more attractive, because of
thinking there might be better stock options with them, Denise
Lidell, CEO of High-Tech Professionals, a technology recruiter
based in San Diego, whose clients have included Intel Corp. (INTC) and
Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) </p>
<p>Companies are courting prospective employees with
everything from coffee with the CEO to piles of cash. The
competition for talent is especially fierce among social media
and other Internet companies as well as computer systems
manufacturers. </p>
<p>Bonus, Stock Awards </p>
<p>Ballmer said Microsoft also will increase funding for bonus
and stock awards so that it can give full awards to 80 percent
of eligible employees, compared with about 50 percent in
previous years. The company will increase compensation for
workers involved in certain geographies and other business
areas, such as research and development. </p>
<p>Through our history, we have been the place people came
when they wanted to make a difference in the world through
software, hardware and services, Ballmer wrote. The changes
we''re rolling out today will help ensure Microsoft continues to
be the place that top talent comes to change the world. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), operator of the
world''s largest brokerage, agreed to buy back $323 million of
auction-rate securities from New Jersey customers to settle
state allegations that it misled investors. </p>
<p>The market for the securities collapsed during the
financial crisis of 2008 when banks stopped using their own cash
to support the market, leaving investors stuck with bonds they
couldn''t sell. The securities were marketed to investors as a
higher-yielding alternative to cash because, until the market
froze, they could be sold at periodic auctions run by banks. </p>
<p>Banks have agreed to buy back securities from individual
investors to settle state and federal regulatory inquiries into
whether they misled investors about risks associated with the
investments. </p>
<p>In 2008, Morgan Stanley agreed to repurchase $4.5 billion
of the securities under a settlement with state regulators. The
company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>This is nothing new, Christy Pollak, a Morgan Stanley
spokeswoman, said today. It''s simply New Jersey''s portion of
the settlement. </p>

General''s office, didn''t return a message seeking comment. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), this year''s top
merger adviser, set aside $1.95 billion to pay investment bank
employee salaries, bonuses and benefits in the first quarter,
down 10 percent from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Pay at the institutional-securities unit, which employs
traders and bankers, was 54 percent of revenue, compared with 41
percent in the first quarter of 2010, according to the New York-
based company''s website. The unit''s revenue fell 33 percent to
$3.59 billion. For the company as a whole, compensation and
benefits totaled $4.33 billion, down 2 percent. </p>
<p>James Gorman, who became Morgan Stanley''s chief executive
officer last year, promised to reduce the portion of overall
revenue awarded in compensation after it surged to 62 percent in
2009. The companywide compensation ratio for the quarter was 57
percent. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley didn''t take into account a $655 million
pretax loss from a Japanese joint venture when determining the
amount to accrue for compensation, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said today in an interview. Excluding the loss and a
charge tied to a narrowing of the firm''s own credit spreads, the
investment bank''s compensation ratio was 44 percent and the
firm-wide ratio was 51 percent, Porat said. </p>
<p>Employee Pay </p>
<p>Companywide compensation, the firm''s largest expense, was
enough to pay each of its 62,494 employees $69,335 for the three
months, down from $71,998 for each of the 61,335 employees at
the end of the first quarter of 2010, according to the figures
released today. The New York-based bank doesn''t report
headcounts for its three divisions. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside $5.23 billion for
compensation and benefits expense, enough to pay each employee
$147,825 for the quarter, down 11 percent from $165,952 a year
earlier, the New York-based firm said earlier this week. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, set aside $3.29 billion in the quarter to compensate
employees at its investment bank, or an average $124,300 per
person, according to the New York-based bank''s earnings report
last week. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees, awarding most of the money as
year-end bonuses. Average pay per worker doesn''t reflect the
amount of money employees actually receive. Top executives and
revenue producers sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards,
while clerical workers get smaller salaries. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
will buy back at a premium warrants that were suspended from
trading in Hong Kong because of a misprinted settlement formula. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank is offering 110 percent of the
higher of either the total net purchase price paid or the total
buyback value, according to a statement filed to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today. It will also pay investors agreeing to the
repurchase a one-off fixed administrative fee of HK$5,000
($643.5) each. </p>
<p>The buyback value has been calculated using the highest
level of the index on each trading day during the March 30 to
April 21 period for the call warrants, and the lowest level for
the put warrants, the statement said. The bank also took into
account swings in the index level and the passage of time, it
said. </p>
<p>The calculation method is to ensure existing investors
get the benefit but not the downside of any market movements
in the index during the relevant period, it said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said on April 7 that it''s in talks with
regulators about warrants linked to the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
that were suspended from trading in Hong Kong on March 31.
Trading in the warrants will be halted until further notice,
Goldman Sachs said at the time. </p>
<p>The formula for the cash settlement amount per board lot
for European-style put and call warrants due Sept. 9 and Dec. 9
was wrong in the listing and announcement documents, Goldman
Sachs said on March 31. </p>
<p>Take Responsibility </p>
<p>According to the original document, the formula for
calculating the cash settlement included multiplying by the
exchange rate. In the amendment, the formula is calculated by
dividing by the exchange rate. </p>
<p>The four warrants at least doubled on the exchange on March
31 before being suspended. </p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchanges  Clearing Ltd. Chief Executive Charles
Li said he hopes that the group that amended the warrant
contracts will take responsibility for compensating investors,
the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported on April 19. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said today it will issue new warrants with
the same key economic terms to investors who wish to retain such
investments. The buyback value of the existing warrants will be
39 percent to 106 percent higher than the issue price of the new
warrants, the statement said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest publicly traded oil company, plans to halt its Sriracha
refinery in Thailand as it modifies units to reduce sulfur in
fuels, according to two people with knowledge of the work. </p>
<p>The shutdown will start in September and last about five
weeks, the people said, declining to be identified because the
information hasn''t been made public. Kevin Allexon, a Fairfax,
Virginia-based Exxon spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The shutdown will enable work to be completed and enable
Exxon to produce low-sulfur fuels before Thailand''s switch to
Euro-4 standards next year, which will limit allowable sulfur
content in gasoline and diesel to 50 parts per million or less. </p>
<p>Exxon said on July 29 that it began work on a clean-fuels
project at the plant, with commissioning expected by the end of
2011. The company said on July 16 it would modify existing
hydrotreating units to cut sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel
to 50 parts per million and build a facility to reduce benzene
in gasoline to 1 percent to meet stricter fuel specifications
that will take effect on Jan. 1, 2012. </p>
<p>The project, which the company estimates will cost $394
million, is progressing as planned, Kitiyavadee Nilavan, an
Exxon communications manager in Bangkok, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Sriracha refinery has the capacity to process
170,000 barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It uses crude oil from the Middle East, Far East Asia
and West Africa, according to the company''s website. </p>
<p>Removing Sulfur </p>
<p>Exxon is building a diesel hydrotreater at its Singapore
refining complex, which will boost production of ultra-low-
sulfur diesel, according to a statement in November. The company
also has inaugurated a hydrotreater at its refinery in Antwerp,
Belgium, with annual output equivalent to the yearly consumption
of 2 million diesel-powered cars. The unit has been operating
since the end of January, Johan Scharpe, a company spokesman in
Antwerp, said on April 8. </p>
<p>Hydrotreaters remove sulfur from fuels allowing them to
burn more cleanly. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and other
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) creditors, including Morgan
Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), filed a liquidation plan for
the defunct company that would give their group more money than
two other proposals for allotting $61 billion among creditors. </p>
<p>The rival plan, filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan, is the second that Lehman Chief Executive Officer
Bryan Marsal must contend with as he tries to end the 2 1/2-
year-old bankruptcy case. The group, which includes Silver Point
Capital LP and banks with derivatives claims on Lehman, filed
its plan about four months after bondholders including Paulson 
Co. and the California Public Employees'' Retirement System
submitted a competing proposal. </p>
<p>Under the Goldman Sachs group''s plan, derivatives creditors
of Lehman''s special financing unit would get 26 cents on the
dollar, up from 22.3 cents in Lehman''s proposal. They would
boost their payout by another 15 cents after claiming more money
under a guarantee from the Lehman parent. The losers would be
senior bondholders, who would get 21.4 cents from Lehman and 16
cents from the group including Goldman Sachs, which is the
fourth-largest U.S. bank. </p>
<p>The plan fully respects the best view of the legal rights
and obligations of all entities and constituencies, the group
said in the filing. It also provides the only practical path
toward confirmation. </p>
<p>Bondholder Windfall'' </p>
<p>Lehman''s plan would give bondholders more than they''re
entitled to, the group said. This windfall is unprincipled,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>Dan Kamensky, a senior vice president at Paulson, a New
York-based hedge fund, declined to comment. Kimberly Macleod, a
Lehman spokeswoman, said the company is reviewing the Goldman
Sachs group filing. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The group of about 19 Lehman creditors includes State
Street Bank  Trust Co., Oaktree Capital Management LP, Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs filed two claims totaling $2.5 billion
against a Lehman unit that financed derivatives transactions,
according to claims records. </p>
<p>Lehman, which collapsed in 2008 in the biggest bankruptcy
in U.S. history, faces opposition to the way it will apportion
among creditors the $61 billion it aims to raise as it
liquidates assets. It amended its plan in January, taking money
from derivatives creditors to pay bondholders more after the
group including Paulson filed a rival proposal. </p>
<p>Allowable Claims </p>
<p>Marsal seeks to reduce allowable claims to $322 billion,
according to court filings. That would give the average Lehman
creditor 18.6 cents on the dollar. Lehman, once the fourth-
largest investment bank, aims to win a bankruptcy judge''s
approval for a plan in November. </p>
<p>Offering its plan, the Goldman-Morgan Stanley (MS) group said
Lehman was run through separate subsidiaries whose borrowing
arrangements -- including guarantees -- should be preserved in a
liquidation. The Paulson-Calpers group would treat Lehman more
like a single company, canceling parent guarantees and inter-
company debt and paying creditors more equally. </p>
<p>Discussing the prospect of a Goldman Sachs plan last month,
John Beiers, chief deputy county counsel for San Mateo County in
California, told Bloomberg that big banks were taking a
position that adversely impacts bondholders such as San Mateo
County, which is owed $155 million by Lehman. </p>
<p>The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services provider, increased its
quarterly dividend 15 percent and set aside more money for share
buybacks, sending the stock to a record. </p>
<p>The quarterly payout will rise by 10 cents for the second
straight year, to 75 cents a share, IBM said today in a
statement. IBM added $8 billion to the stock-repurchase plan,
bringing the total authorized by the board to $12.7 billion. </p>
<p>IBM last week said earnings will be at least $13.15 a share
this year, topping estimates, as it works toward a goal of at
least $20 a share in earnings by 2015. Today''s increases keep
the company on schedule for a goal to spend about $20 billion on
dividends and $50 billion on buybacks through 2015, IBM
Treasurer Martin Schroeter said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 82 cents to $168.49 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the highest
closing price in the 100-year-old company''s history. The shares
have climbed 15 percent this year. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, also plans to use
about $20 billion on acquisitions through 2015 to focus on IBM''s
four revenue-growth initiatives: cloud computing, analytics,
emerging markets and Smarter Planet, the concept that
infrastructure can be digitized to be made more efficient. </p>
<p>The company''s a cash flow machine, said Chris Whitmore,
a San Francisco-based analyst for Deutsche Bank. It''s giving
people a little added confidence. </p>
<p>$100 Billion </p>
<p>Palmisano, who took over in 2002, has increased earnings by
steering the company toward software and services. IBM has spent
more than $100 billion on dividends and buybacks since 2003, the
year Palmisano also became the chairman. </p>
<p>It''s the 16th year in a row that IBM has increased its
dividend. The company has boosted the payout by 10 cents each
year since 2006, except for 2009, when it halved the increase
amid the recession. The dividend is payable June 10 to
shareholders of record May 10. </p>
<p>The company ended last quarter with $13.2 billion in cash
and short-term investments. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, posted first-quarter profit that fell short of
analysts'' projections as earthquake damage squeezed margins in
Japan and total revenue trailed expectations. </p>
<p>Excluding items such as restructuring costs, earnings were
86 cents, compared with the 87-cent average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Damage from the March earthquake in Japan
cut 1 cent from profit, the Atlanta-based company said today in
a statement. </p>
<p>Sales climbed to $10.5 billion, short of the average
analyst estimate of $10.7 billion. Revenue suffered partly from
discounting at retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), which ate
into Coca-Cola''s gains from volume sales, said Kaumil Gajrawala,
an analyst with UBS Investment Bank in New York. </p>
<p>Revenues were below expectations in all regions but Latin
America, Gajrawala said today in a note. Much of the profit
miss was driven by North America. He advises investors to buy
the shares. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola declined 81 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $66.93 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest
drop in more than a month. Coca-Cola has gained 1.8 percent this
year, while rival PepsiCo Inc. has increased 3.6 percent. </p>
<p>Japan Disaster </p>
<p>Some Coca-Cola manufacturing and vending operations in
Japan, which represents more than one-10th of operating profit,
were disrupted following the March 11 earthquake and ensuing
tsunami. Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has pledged more
than $30 million in relief for the region. </p>
<p>Kent has expanded further in developing countries to widen
Coca-Cola''s market-share lead. The beverage maker generated
almost one-third of its sales in the U.S. and Canada last year,
compared with 11 percent for the Latin America unit and 14
percent for Europe. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola boosted sales volumes in the U.S. and Canada for
the fourth consecutive quarter, following his decision to take
control of 90 percent of the company''s North American
distribution system. Global sales by volume jumped 6 percent,
with a matching increase in North America. </p>
<p>Carbonated soft-drink volume in Mexico rose 11 percent,
while China posted a 14 percent gain. Net income advanced 18
percent to $1.9 billion, or 82 cents a share, from $1.61
billion, or 69 cents. Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo, the
second-biggest soft-drink company, plans to report first-quarter
results this week. </p>
<p>Commodity Surge </p>
<p>Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo face rising costs for
ingredients and packaging as commodity prices advance and crude
oil for June delivery touched $113.48 yesterday, the highest
intraday price since Sept. 22, 2008. </p>
<p>Commodity costs for the year may rise by as much as $700
million, according to estimates provided by Chief Financial
Officer Gary Fayard during a conference call. That''s higher than
the $300 million to $400 million he estimated in February. The
increase is fueled by the higher cost of plastic for bottles,
which is made from oil. Almost all of the commodity gain will be
offset by supply savings, higher pricing and a currency benefit,
Fayard said. </p>
<p>Note that we are continuing to actively hedge our
commodity and currency exposure, Fayard said. </p>
<p>PepsiCo, which gets about two-thirds of sales come from
snacks, has said total commodity costs may increase $1.4 billion
to $1.6 billion this year. </p>

<p>A payment plan sponsored by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley and other creditors of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. treats pension funds and retirees
who own Lehman bonds unfairly, the California Public
Employees'' Retirement System said. </p>
<p>The creditors, which also include Credit Suisse Group AG,
filed a liquidation plan for the defunct company yesterday that
would give their group more money than two other proposals for
allotting $61 billion among creditors. </p>
<p>This plan treats members of pension funds, including
retirees who hold LBHI bonds through their pension plans,
unfairly, Calpers Chief Investment Officer Joseph Dear said in
a statement. We''re disappointed that Goldman Sachs and other
big banks are proposing to reward themselves at the expense of
bondholders. </p>
<p>Calpers, the largest U.S. pension fund, paid 86 cents to
$1.04 on the dollar for $90.1 million of Lehman''s senior bonds
between July 2006 and December 2007, according to a court
filing. It would get 16 cents on the dollar from the group
including Goldman Sachs, the fourth-largest U.S. bank. </p>
<p>Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to immediately comment. Lehman spokeswoman
Kimberly Macleod declined to comment. </p>
<p>Paulson Plan </p>
<p>Calpers is a member of a rival group with hedge fund
Paulson  Co. The Paulson-Calpers plan, which transfers money to
bondholders from Goldman Sachs and other derivatives creditors
of Lehman, represents a fair outcome for all stakeholders,
it said in the statement. </p>
<p>Senior bondholders would get 24.5 cents on the dollar under
the Paulson-Calpers plan, compared with 21.4 cents if Lehman''s
plan prevails. </p>
<p>Rival plans for Lehman are due to be discussed at a June 28
court hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in New
York. The Paulson-Calpers groups wants to reduce inequalities
among creditors, while the Goldman-Morgan Stanley group says
Lehman made a variety of deals with lenders that should be
preserved. </p>
<p>The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, is hiring about 250 small-business
bankers this year to keep pace with a pickup in loan demand and
an expanded lending goal. </p>
<p>The bank is bolstering staff to accommodate customers in
California and Florida who were added after the firm''s 2008
acquisition of Seattle-based thrift Washington Mutual Inc., said
Michael Cleary, head of small-business lending. The unit
provides direct loans, lines of credit and credit cards to
companies with less than $20 million in revenue. </p>
<p>Cleary hired 450 new bankers in 2010 and added about 100
more so far this year. By December, JPMorgan will have about 40
percent more small-business specialists than the 1,950 who
worked for the unit in 2009, excluding support staff, he said.
The unit increased its lending commitment to small businesses to
$12 billion this year from $10 billion in 2010 as applications
and approval rates have climbed, he said. </p>
<p>There''s some pent-up demand, they want to invest and the
quality of the borrower is improving, Cleary said in an
interview yesterday. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s appeal of an 899

<p>The EU General Court, the 27-nation region''s second-highest

according to the court''s online calendar. Microsoft, the world''s
largest software maker, is seeking to overturn or cut the fine
levied by the European Commission in 2008. </p>
<p>Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of EU
competition policy to face a penalty for failing to comply with
an EU order. The commission in 2004 found that Microsoft
overcharged for patent licenses that rivals needed to connect
products to the Windows operating system. The additional fine in
2008 brought the total penalty against Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft to 1.68 billion euros. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD), the maker
of Abrams battle tanks and Gulfstream jets, said first-quarter
profit rose 3.5 percent, aided by higher margins at the
business-jet unit. </p>
<p>Net income increased to $618 million, or $1.64 a share,
from $597 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier, the Falls
Church, Virginia-based company said today in a statement. The
average of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for $1.61 a
share. Sales gained less than 1 percent to $7.8 billion. </p>
<p>General Dynamics''s defense business was dealt a setback
after U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed in January to
cancel the company''s Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle it was
building for the Marine Corps. The loss may be offset with
Gates''s proposal to upgrade Abrams tanks and the Army''s Stryker
vehicles, both made by the company. </p>
<p>With U.S. defense spending coming under pressure, Chief
Executive Officer Jay Johnson has said the Gulfstream unit will
remain the company''s growth engine. </p>
<p>In this pressured budget environment, it is very likely
the case the defense top line spending will begin a slow steady
decline, Johnson said on a conference call today. The
programs most at risk are likely to be the new development
programs and the company is well positioned to sustain
business in Army and Navy programs as well as in its Aerospace
unit, he said. </p>
<p>Profit Forecast </p>
<p>General Dynamics, which also makes Virginia-class nuclear
submarines, in January forecast full-year profit of $7 to $7.10
a share. Analysts'' average estimate is for profit of $7.12 a
share on sales of $33.8 billion. </p>
<p>General Dynamics rose 8 cents to $72.72 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 2.5 percent
this year. The Standard and Poor''s Supercomposite Aerospace 
Defense Index has gained 10.5 percent in the same period. </p>
<p>Operating profit at the Aerospace unit, maker of the
Gulfstream jets, rose 5.5 percent to $230 million, General
Dynamics said. Sales at the unit declined less than 1 percent to
$1.35 billion. </p>
<p>An April 2 crash of the company''s new G650 model jet during
a test flight that killed its four-member crew has led to
suspension of all tests while U.S. agencies investigate. </p>
<p>Combat Systems sales fell 2.3 percent to $1.96 billion and
operating profit gained 3 percent to $277 million. Revenue at
the Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology units
rose 2.3 percent each to $1.68 billion and $2.82 billion
respectively. </p>
<p>Profit at the Information Systems unit fell 4.8 percent to
$276 million and Marine profits increased 3 percent to $167
million, the company said in the statement. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley is tapping the bond
market for $4.5 billion as derivatives show traders perceive it
to be the riskiest of Wall Street''s six biggest banks. </p>
<p>The firm sold $2.5 billion of 3.8 percent, five-year notes
yesterday to yield 180 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In
February, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) issued $3 billion of notes due in
2016 that paid a 120 basis-point spread, while Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) raised $2.5 billion of five-year debt that month at a
158 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who took charge last
year, is seeking to restore bondholder confidence by
rejuvenating a fixed-income division that contributed to $23.4
billion of losses and writedowns during the financial crisis,
eliminating dividend payments to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. and increasing profitability of its retail brokerage unit.
While the cost to protect Morgan Stanley (MS)''s debt from losses has
plunged in the past year, it remains higher than its peers. </p>
<p>We''re still in a show-me situation as far as their risk
management is concerned, said Marc Beulke, an analyst at
Minneapolis-based Thrivent Financial, which oversees $73.1
billion, including Morgan Stanley bonds. It''s obvious it
needed some improvement if you go back to 2008 and the losses
they recorded compared with their competitors. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Credit Swap Prices </p>
<p>While credit-default swaps tied to the debt of the New
York-based bank have declined to 142.4 basis points from 307.5
basis points in June, they are still higher than Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. (C), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Goldman
Sachs, according to data provider CMA. </p>
<p>The gap between contracts on Morgan Stanley and the average
of the six biggest U.S. banks has shrunk to 31.7 basis points
from as wide as 108.8 basis points in June. The difference was
as narrow as 19.4 basis points in October, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>Swaps on Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by
assets, were trading at the same level as Bank of America Corp.
as recently as March 2, when contracts on each cost 140 basis
points. Those on Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
have declined to 132.8 from 175.3 in June. </p>
<p>Contracts on Citigroup are priced at 122; those on San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo cost 78.5 and swaps on JPMorgan,
considered the most creditworthy of the banks, cost 74.3 basis
points. </p>
<p>Implied Credit Rating </p>
<p>Even with the improvement, the price traders are paying to
protect against losses in Morgan Stanley bonds implies a credit
rating of Baa3, the lowest investment grade, compared with the
company''s actual grade of A2, according to Moody''s Corp.''s
capital market research group. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s market signals improved only modestly
over the last 12 months, Allerton Smith, senior director in
the group at Moody''s in New York, wrote in a note today. The
derivatives show investors remain cautious about the
reorientation and transition of the franchise. </p>
<p>Credit swaps, which typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves, pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s bond sale, which included $2 billion of
two-year floating-rate debt, came after it reported first-
quarter net income last week of $968 million, or 50 cents a
share, and adjusted earnings of 46 cents, which topped analysts''
average estimate of 40 cents. The securities pay 98 basis points
more than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>More Attractive </p>
<p>The $2.5 billion of 3.8 percent notes issued yesterday
declined 0.1 cent to 99.8 cents on the dollar, as of 11:37 a.m.
in New York, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>The bank issued $1.5 billion of five-year, 3.45 percent
notes that paid a spread of 225 basis points in October,
Bloomberg data show. That followed a $1.25 billion offering of 4
percent securities in July that paid a spread of 245 basis
points, or 2.45 percentage points. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bonds are more attractive than those from
firms including Bank of America and JPMorgan as yields on
investment-grade debt decline, said Mirko Mikelic, a money
manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, which oversees $17.7. </p>
<p>Investment-grade U.S. corporate bond yields fell to 3.91
percent on average yesterday, while bank bond yields are at 3.78
percent, both the lowest since November, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. Financial company debt yields
have declined from 10.37 percent in March 2009. </p>
<p>No. 1'' Priority </p>
<p>After we survived through 08 and 09, everyone''s kind of
ridden the wave and is looking for spreads that are a little bit
wider, Mikelic, who''s based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said in
a telephone interview. You want stuff like that. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said last week it agreed to convert $7.8
billion of preferred shares held by Mitsubishi UFJ to common
equity, paying a premium of about $2 billion to eliminate annual
dividend payments of $784 million. </p>
<p>This was frankly No. 1 on my list for this year, Gorman
said in an April 21 conference call with investors. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley posted its first quarterly loss as a public
company in the fourth quarter of 2007 as it wrote down mortgage
holdings by $9.4 billion and took a $5 billion cash infusion
from sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. </p>
<p>Work in Progress'' </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley converted into a bank holding company in
September 2008, after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. The firm borrowed as much as $97.3 billion from the Federal
Reserve''s emergency lending programs that month. Over the next
month, it received a $9 billion injection from Mitsubishi UFJ
and agreed to take a $10 billion bailout from the U.S. Treasury. </p>
<p>It will take some time before we have everybody as true
believers, Gorman said during a February investor conference,
in response to why Morgan Stanley''s debt spreads are wider than
competitors. We''re getting further from the financial crisis,
and we''re demonstrating that we''re not making new mistakes,
which has been one of our mantras. </p>
<p>Last quarter''s profit included a 26-cent loss tied to a
joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ. </p>
<p>We view them as much more of a work in progress, as
relatively new management figures out where they want to take
the business, said Joel Levington, managing director of
corporate credit at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New
York. If one believes in the turnaround, it offers an
opportunity. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
No. 2 U.S. mall owner, said funds from operations gained in the
first quarter as mall occupancies climbed amid an increase in
consumer spending. </p>
<p>Funds from operations were $306.1 million, or 30 cents a
share, compared with $248.2 million, or 76 cents, a year
earlier, the Chicago-based company said yesterday in a
statement. The per-share figure declined as the number of the
shares outstanding increased. </p>
<p>U.S. retail sales gained in March for a ninth consecutive
month, the Commerce Department reported April 13. Occupancies at
General Growth''s malls rose 40 basis points to 92.4 percent, and
tenant sales climbed 7.3 percent to $457 a square foot. </p>
<p>General Growth''s core FFO, which excludes such items as
results from discontinued operations and interest expense on
repaid debt, totaled 22 cents a share. The company was expected
to have FFO of 23 cents a share, the average estimate of 10
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>FFO, a cash-flow measure used by real estate investment
trusts, excludes depreciation and other items and doesn''t
conform to generally accepted accounting principles. </p>
<p>General Growth filed for Chapter 11 protection in April
2009 after weighing itself down with $27 billion in debt that it
was unable to refinance because of the credit crisis and
collapse of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. It
emerged from bankruptcy in November. </p>
<p>Shares Rise </p>
<p>First-quarter results were announced yesterday after the
close of regular U.S. trading. General Growth shares rose 5
cents to $15.99 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The company has investment and management stakes in 169
malls in 43 U.S. states. </p>
<p>Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, plans to report its first-quarter results
on April 29. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s top
software maker, reported third-quarter sales in the Windows
division that missed analysts'' predictions as consumers shunned
its products in favor of tablets such as Apple Inc.''s iPad. </p>
<p>Revenue in the unit that includes Windows fell to $4.45
billion, Microsoft said in a statement today. That was shy of
the $4.6 billion average prediction of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Shares slipped in late trading. </p>
<p>Personal computer shipments unexpectedly fell 3.2 percent
in the quarter as consumers held off purchases and shifted to
tablet computers, IDC said. Multiyear contracts with
corporations and robust demand for Office business software
couldn''t make up for consumers who are choosing iPads over a new
laptop with Windows. </p>
<p>PCs aren''t being bought and if you are going to buy a
laptop you''ll look at an iPad, said Kim Caughey Forrest, an
analyst at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc. which
manages $1.1 billion, including Microsoft shares. That''s where
some of those Windows sales went. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, declined as much
as 74 cents to $25.97 in extended trading, after gaining 33
cents to $26.71 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. The shares dropped 9 percent last quarter, while the
Standard and Poor''s 500 Index rose 5.4 percent. </p>
<p>Overtaken By Apple </p>
<p>The results underscore the ascendance of Apple, which
surpassed Microsoft as the world''s most valuable technology
company in May. Apple''s profit in the period that ended in March
almost doubled to $5.99 billion, compared with $5.23 billion for
Microsoft in the same period. That was the first time Apple''s
profit topped Microsoft''s in two decades. </p>
<p>Industrywide shipments of consumer PCs dropped 8 percent in
the quarter while shipments to corporate customers rose 9
percent, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an
interview. Netbooks dropped 40 percent. </p>
<p>It''s fair to say tablet is some of that, he said. </p>
<p>Revenue in the Windows division fell 4.4 percent, the
second quarter in a row that sales in that unit fell short of
projections. Microsoft said in a slide presentation on its
website that overall PC sales declined 2 percent last quarter. </p>
<p>They are growing slower than PCs now, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who rates
Microsoft sector perform. That''s suggesting some market
share loss, some real deterioration. </p>
<p>Office, Servers Gain </p>
<p>Net income rose to 61 cents a share, from $4.01 billion, or
45 cents, Microsoft said today. Excluding a 5-cent per-share tax
benefit, earnings matched the 56-cent average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sales rose to $16.4 billion, compared with the $16.2
billion average projection. That reflects demand for such
products as Office business-productivity software and the
programs that run servers, computers that run networks. </p>
<p>For a long time, I''ve been looking at Microsoft as an
enterprise play, rather than consumer, and in that area they
didn''t disappoint, Caughey Forrest said. Office was good.
Servers weren''t bad. </p>
<p>Sales in the business division, which sells Office software
and is the company''s biggest, rose to $5.25 billion, compared
with the $4.9 billion average estimate of analysts. Server and
Tools unit sales were $4.1 billion, compared with the $4 billion
analysts expected. </p>
<p>Yahoo Integration Stumbles </p>
<p>We are seeing businesses invest in technology, Klein
said. They are buying hardware and they are buying Microsoft
software. Microsoft expects corporate PC shipments to outpace
those for consumers for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>The company is also getting less revenue than expected on a
per-search basis from its partnership with Yahoo! Inc.,
Microsoft''s Klein said. The companies still face integration
complications and expect to fix them by year end, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft said operating expenses in the year that starts
July 1 will rise to $28 billion to $28.6 billion. In the current
fiscal year they will be $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion, the
company said, reiterating a previous forecast. </p>
<p>Unearned revenue, a measure of future sales, was $13
billion, above the average analysts'' estimate of $12.8 billion,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Apple''s iPad is luring customers from Windows-based PCs as
Microsoft tarries in furnishing computer makers with a Windows
operating system that''s capable of challenging the iPad.
Microsoft won''t release a viable competitor to the Apple and
Google Inc. tablet operating systems until the second half of
2012, people with knowledge of the plans said in March. </p>
<p>Everyone is worried about the Windows numbers, said
Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco. That''s the
cash cow and everyone is worried the cow is running out of
milk. </p>

restore power to this facility. </p>
<p>Both mines are in Tuscaloosa County, which suffered some of
the worst damage from the tornadoes. Walter said this month that
it plans to sell as much as 8 million tons of metallurgical
coal, used to make steel, from the operations this year. </p>
<p>At least 269 people have died in six states as a result of
the storms. As many as a million people were without power in
Alabama, according to its governor. </p>
<p>Walter, based in Tampa, Florida, said its Taft Choctaw
surface mine near Jasper, Alabama, incurred superficial
damage and that the storm cut power to the operation and its
dragline. The company said that it plans to sell 1.4 million to
1.6 million tons of thermal coal, used by power plants, from its
surface mines. </p>
<p>The company had one injury at a surface mine that required
first aid treatment, it said. </p>
<p>Walter fell 59 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $133.65 a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 45 percent in the past year. </p>

<p>Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the world''s
largest consumer-products company, reduced the top end of its
annual profit forecast after higher raw-material costs and slow
growth in Europe and North America ate into income. </p>
<p>PG cut the top of its forecast range by 5 cents. It now
predicts profit this year of $3.91 to $3.96 a share, excluding
the impact of legal costs and taxes. Twenty-five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimated an average profit of $3.96. </p>
<p>Like other consumer-products companies, the maker of
Gillette razors and Olay skin care continues to cope with higher
costs for wood pulp, resins and other raw materials. Commodities
cost increases are about $1.8 billion this fiscal year, triple
what the company expected, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller
said during a media call today. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald is raising some U.S.
prices and expanding in emerging markets to boost revenue. </p>
<p>The rate of improvement in developed markets is obviously
slower than we had originally forecast, McDonald said on the
call. Almost two-thirds of the company''s sales last year came
from North America and Western Europe. </p>
<p>Profit rose 11 percent to $2.87 billion, or 96 cents a
share, in the period ended March 31, from $2.59 billion, or 83
cents a share, a year earlier, the Cincinnati-based company said
today in a statement. Twenty-three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg estimated profit of 97 cents a share on average,
excluding such items as legal costs and taxes. Revenue rose 5.5
percent to $20.23 billion. </p>
<p>Competitive Environment'' </p>
<p>PG rose 48 cents to $64.50 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares are about unchanged this
year. </p>
<p>Toothpaste maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) said today its
first-quarter profit excluding some items fell amid higher
material costs and what CEO Ian Cook called an intense
competitive environment globally. </p>
<p>Sales rose 4.3 percent to $3.99 billion. Net income
increased to $576 million, or $1.16 a share, compared with $357
million, or 69 cents a share, in the year-ago period. That
included an after-tax charge in the year-ago quarter of $271
million for accounting changes in Venezuela. The shares of New
York-based Colgate have gained 0.9 percent this year. </p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) earlier this week reduced the bottom
end of its full-year profit forecast and reported earnings below
analysts'' expectations after raw-materials costs jumped more
than anticipated. The Dallas-based maker of Huggies diapers and
Kleenex tissues says it''s raising prices on most of its North
American goods. </p>
<p>PG is raising U.S. prices on Charmin toilet paper, Pampers
diapers and Bounty paper towels, spokesman Paul Fox said in an
April 26 e-mail. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest company by market value, posted its largest profit in
almost three years as soaring gasoline prices fueled discontent
among consumers and policymakers. </p>
<p>With U.S. motorists paying the most for gasoline since
prices reached a record $4.11 a gallon in the summer of 2008,
Exxon said today that its first-quarter net income jumped 69
percent to $10.7 billion. The Irving, Texas-based company is
sitting on a cash pile of $13.2 billion, even after distributing
more than $7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama has called for an end to decades-old
tax breaks for domestic oil and natural-gas drilling, and urged
Saudi Arabia, the world''s largest crude exporter, to help rein
in surging world crude prices by boosting output. Exxon said
inflicting higher taxes would drain funds the company needs to
find new oil and gas fields. </p>
<p>Over the past five years, we incurred a total U.S. tax
expense of almost $59 billion, which is $18 billion more than we
earned in the United States during the same period, Kenneth
Cohen, Exxon''s vice president of public and government affairs,
said yesterday in a blog post on the company''s website.
Critics often try to ignore these facts by saying the oil and
gas industry receives subsidies.'' But what they really mean is
that they want to increase our taxes by taking away long-
standing deductions for our industry while leaving these same
deductions in place for other sectors of the economy. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest company by market value, posted its biggest first-
quarter profit increase in eight years as surging energy demand
and supply concerns pushed crude prices to a 30-month high. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income rose 69 percent to $10.7 billion,
or $2.14 a share, from $6.3 billion, or $1.33, a year earlier,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said today in a statement. Per-share
profit was 10 cents higher than the average of five analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon''s profit from selling oil and natural-gas rose 49
percent to $8.7 billion as Brent oil futures, the benchmark
price for two-thirds of the world''s crude, averaged more than
$105 a barrel. Soaring demand for fuels to run trains, trucks,
cars and airplanes coincided with civil unrest that disrupted
exports from Libya, home to Africa''s largest reserves. </p>
<p>Sales rose 26 percent to $114 billion. Three-fourths of
Exxon''s sales come from outside the U.S. </p>
<p>In China, the world''s second-largest consumer of oil and
gas after the U.S., demand for oil-based fuels such as diesel
rose 11 percent during the first three months of this year,
almost seven times the U.S.''s 1.6 percent growth rate, according
to the International Energy Agency. Brazilian and Indian demand
expanded by 5 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. </p>
<p>Refining Improves </p>
<p>Exxon fell 80 cents to 86.98 at 9:30 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has 10 buy ratings from
analysts, 12 holds and one sell. </p>
<p>The company''s refining business earned $1.1 billion. In
Exxon''s chemicals division, net income rose 21 percent to $1.52
billion, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Exxon raised oil and gas production 10 percent to the
equivalent of 4.82 million barrels a day during the quarter as
new projects such as the West Qurna 1 field in Iraq came online. </p>
<p>Exxon plans to spend $34 billion this year on capital
projects such as new oil wells, pipeline repairs and refinery
upgrades. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told analysts
last month that he is targeting a 4 percent increase in oil and
natural gas production this year. </p>
<p>For Exxon and many of the integrateds, the growth is
international, said Eliecer Palacios, energy sector specialist
at Maxim Group, a boutique investment bank. Increased capital
expenditures are necessary to continue adding reserves. </p>
<p>Replacing Production </p>
<p>The company''s discoveries and acquisitions last year were
enough to replace 209 percent of the crude and gas pumped from
wells, boosting proved reserves to the equivalent of 24.8
billion barrels, which exceeded the crude reserves of nations
such as Algeria or Mexico. </p>
<p>Exxon, which traces its roots to the 1880s and John D. Rockefeller''s Standard Oil Trust, has exploration prospects from
Greenland to Madagascar to Vietnam. </p>
<p>Oil production in Libya dwindled to 390,000 barrels a day
in March, a 75 percent drop from the end of 2010, according to
Bloomberg estimates, as a rebellion against Muammar Qaddafi
prompted foreign energy companies to evacuate staff and the
country''s cities were put under siege. </p>

paragraph.) </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and 14 other investment banks face the first-ever
European Union antitrust probes into the swaps market, following
investigations by U.S. regulators. </p>
<p>The EU is examining whether 16 banks, including Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), colluded by giving market information
to Markit Group Ltd., a data provider majority-owned by Wall
Street''s largest banks. It will also check if nine of the firms
struck unfair deals with Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE)''s
European derivatives clearinghouse, shutting out rivals. </p>
<p>Lack of transparency in markets can lead to abusive
behavior and facilitate violations of competition rules,
Joaquin Almunia, the EU''s competition commissioner, said in an
e-mailed statement. I hope our investigation will contribute
to a better functioning of financial markets. </p>
<p>Global regulators have sought to toughen regulation of the
$30.3 trillion credit-default swap market, saying the trades
helped fuel the financial crisis. The EU''s probes add to
separate investigations in the U.K. and U.S. into whether banks
colluded to manipulate the London interbank offered rate. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said first-quarter profit rose 36 percent as
economic growth and supply disruptions drove crude prices above
$100 a barrel. </p>
<p>Net income rose to $6.21 billion, or $3.09 a share, from
$4.55 billion, or $2.27, a year earlier, San Ramon, California-
based Chevron said in a statement today. The company was
expected to report per-share profit of $2.99, based on the
average of two analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 25 percent to $60.3 billion. </p>
<p>Global demand for petroleum-derived fuels rose 2.9 percent
during the first quarter, led by growth in China, Brazil and
India, according to the International Energy Agency. Oil futures
traded in New York climbed 20 percent to average $94.60 a barrel
amid civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East that
imperiled crude supplies. </p>
<p>The company beat analysts'' estimates because of pricing,
so from the standpoint of earnings quality that''s not really a
great reason to beat, said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at
Raymond James  Associates Inc. in Houston who owns Chevron
shares and has an outperform rating on the company. </p>
<p>Chevron rose 63 cents to $109.44 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has gained 20
percent this year, has 19 buy ratings from analysts and six
holds. </p>
<p>Refinery Profit </p>
<p>Profit from the company''s oil and natural-gas business
increased 27 percent to $5.98 billion as higher commodity prices
offset a less than 1 percent decline in output. Chevron pumped
the equivalent of 2.76 million barrels of crude during the
period, down from 2.78 million a year earlier, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>Chevron''s refineries earned $622 million, more than three
times the profit of the first quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>Chevron plans to spend $26 billion in 2011 to explore for
crude, construct gas-export plants and repair oil refineries.
Chief Executive Officer John Watson has been reducing refining
and retail operations to concentrate on higher-profit ventures
such as deep-water exploration in places such as the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico and Australia. </p>
<p>Chevron announced two U.S. Gulf projects last year with a
combined value of $11.5 billion that will tap deep-water oil
fields, part of Watson''s plan to boost output by 20 percent by
the end of 2017. </p>
<p>Last month, the company received one of the first permits
to resume exploratory drilling in the Gulf since the U.S.
suspended such work in response to the Deepwater Horizon tragedy
that killed 11 rig workers and led to the biggest U.S. offshore
oil spill. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. oil company. Exxon yesterday reported a 69 percent rise in
net income for the first quarter, to $10.7 billion. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s Windows sales
slumped last quarter as the iPad crimped demand for consumer
laptops, marking the first time in 20 years that the software
maker reported a smaller quarterly profit than Apple Inc. (AAPL) </p>
<p>Revenue in Microsoft''s Windows division fell 4.4 percent to
$4.45 billion, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
yesterday in a statement. That missed the $4.6 billion average
prediction of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income was
$5.23 billion, eclipsed by the $5.99 billion reported by Apple
last quarter. </p>
<p>Consumer PC shipments dropped 8 percent in the quarter,
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said. Netbooks --
the cheap laptops that became popular during the recession --
plunged 40 percent, partially because of defections to tablet
computers, he said. The decline overshadowed a better-than-
anticipated performance from Microsoft''s Office unit and
increased PC demand from corporations. </p>
<p>You have to live underneath a rock not to know that the
iPad has taken share from the netbook, said Pat Becker Jr.,
principal of Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management
Inc., which holds Microsoft shares as part of its $2.5 billion
in assets. It''s a problem on the consumer side, and that''s a
market where Microsoft continues to give up territory to
Apple. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 79 cents, or 3 percent, to $25.92 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares have
declined 7.1 percent this year. </p>
<p>Less Than Apple </p>
<p>Net income rose to 61 cents a share, from $4.01 billion, or
45 cents, Microsoft said yesterday. Excluding a 5-cent per-share
tax benefit, earnings matched the 56-cent average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The results underscore the ascendance of Apple, which
surpassed Microsoft as the world''s most valuable technology
company last May. The last time Apple''s profit was bigger than
Microsoft''s was 1991. </p>
<p>While PC shipments to corporate customers rose 9 percent,
tablet competition accounted for some of the sluggishness in
consumer sales, Klein said in an interview. </p>
<p>It''s fair to say tablet is some of that, he said. </p>
<p>Total PC sales declined 2 percent last quarter, Microsoft
said. That the Windows business performed even worse adds to the
concern over Microsoft''s performance, said Brendan Barnicle, an
analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in Portland. </p>
<p>Office Sales </p>
<p>That''s suggesting some market share loss, some real
deterioration, said Barnicle, who rates Microsoft''s stock
sector perform. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s overall sales rose to $16.4 billion, compared
with the $16.2 billion average projection. That reflected demand
for such products as Office business-productivity software and
programs for servers -- the computers that run networks. </p>
<p>We are seeing businesses invest in technology, Klein
said. They are buying hardware and they are buying Microsoft
software. Microsoft expects corporate PC shipments to outpace
consumer sales for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>Sales in the business division, which sells Office software
and is the company''s biggest unit, rose 21 percent to $5.25
billion, compared with the $4.9 billion average estimate of
analysts. Revenue at the Server and Tools unit was $4.1 billion,
compared with the $4 billion analysts projected. </p>
<p>There is a tale of two cities going on here, said Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco, who recommends
buying Microsoft shares. You have consumers who say an iPad is
good enough for consuming data, but for the enterprise side,
those enterprises are continuing with Microsoft. The thing that
has hurt Microsoft is that tablets are no question the must-have
item for consumers. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE), the world''s
biggest maker of power-generation equipment, is creating a team
to study acquisition opportunities in Latin America as orders
grow at 30 percent rates on expanding regional economies. </p>
<p>GE will have a team of five people in Sao Paulo working on
analyzing acquisition targets, said Reinaldo Garcia, the
company''s chief executive officer for Latin America. The group
will be led by Fernardo Bertoni, a former GE Oil and Gas
executive, and will focus on infrastructure-related companies,
Garcia said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro today. </p>
<p>It''s a team that will look at companies and technologies
to buy, Garcia said. If there are interesting technologies
that would help us in complementing our business, we will be
seriously looking at that. </p>
<p>Latin America will grow 4.7 percent this year and 4.2
percent in 2012 helped by strong commodity export prices,
the International Monetary Fund said April 11 after raising its
forecasts. GE''s orders in the region are expected to increase
about 30 percent this year and at a pretty robust double
digit rate in 2012, Garcia, 51, said on the sidelines of the
World Economic Forum that takes place in Rio this week. </p>
<p>This is a region that has tremendous opportunities for
growth, he said. We like the growth rate and the margins
that we are getting. </p>
<p>$500-Million Expansion </p>
<p>GE in November said it will spend $500 million to expand
energy, transportation and health-care manufacturing in Brazil
while adding a fifth global research center as Chief Executive
Officer Jeffrey Immelt takes advantage of faster growth in
emerging markets. </p>
<p>The company is in the process of tapping what Garcia
described as tight markets for about 800 positions in the region
and wants to hire another 1,000 on top of that in the next year. </p>
<p>The market in Latin America is tight, Garcia said. In
Brazil it is extremely tight. Competition for talent is very
strong. </p>
<p>In the first three months of this year, revenue in GE''s
Brazilian operations rose 80 percent compared with the year-
earlier period, GE said when it reported first-quarter results
last week. It doesn''t disclose a dollar figure for the region. </p>
<p>While GE doesn''t break down total sales from Brazil or
Latin America, sales in the Americas excluding the U.S. were
$13.4 billion in 2010, up from $11.4 billion in 2009. </p>
<p>In December, GE''s wind turbine unit won orders for more
than 400 megawatts of wind turbines in Brazil as Immelt taps
growth in the region. The company''s energy division completed
its purchase of Wellstream Holdings Plc, an oil services
provider focused on Brazil, in March to expand presence. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)s revenue in Latin
America is growing as fast as 36 percent as rising incomes and
lower computer prices bolster demand, said Hernan Rincon, the
companys president for the region. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s sales surpassed the growth of the area''s
information technology industry, which is expanding at 12
percent, he said. </p>
<p>The cost of PCs and technology is declining and the
incomes in Latin America are rising, Rincon said in an
interview at the World Economic Forum on Latin American in Rio
de Janeiro. The combination of the two makes information
technology more accessible year after year. </p>
<p>The region, which is the fastest growing market for
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, also saw a decline in
software piracy, Rincon said. About 62 percent of software in
Latin America is illegally sold, down from 70 percent five years
ago, he said. </p>

<p>A former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) product
manager who once worked for Michael Dell''s hedge fund aims to do
for restaurants what Expedia Inc. (EXPE) does for airplanes: fill empty
seats during off-peak hours. </p>
<p>Dazhi Chen, a Harvard Business School alumnus, has amassed
a staff of 20 from postings on Craigslist.com and is betting
half a million dollars that his website, DailyGobble.com, can
challenge LivingSocial and Groupon Inc. to become a premier-
dining discount destination. The site is set to debut today. </p>
<p>Chen put up $100,000 of his own money to chase his cut of
the $385.5 billion diners spend at restaurants and bars each
year by offering food rebates on his site. He tried and failed a
decade ago, using $1 million in funding on an effort Chen says
was poorly timed to coincide with the dot-com crash. The rise of
smartphones and online marketing convinced him to try again. </p>
<p>There is very significant opportunity for new entrants to
come in with innovation and gain significant traction, but these
things are lightning in a bottle, said Lou Kerner, a social
media analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. Groupon has grown
dramatically faster than anyone thought they would. </p>
<p>Chen''s challenge is ensuring DailyGobble.com stands out
among hundreds of online coupon sites, led by Groupon and
LivingSocial. The 330 restaurants posting discounts on
DailyGobble.com so far are Chen''s proof his concept has
potential. Within a year, he projects quarterly revenue of as
much as $7 million and net income of $250,000. </p>
<p>Limit Discounts </p>
<p>DailyGobble''s pitch to restaurateurs is that they only pay
for coupons diners use, and they can limit discounts to specific
times of day when tables typically sit vacant. Many established
coupon sites, LivingSocial among them, charge up-front fees for
listings and don''t permit time restrictions. </p>
<p>We can use DailyGobble for times that the restaurant is
not full, said Darren Wan, 36, owner of Red Egg in New York,
which is offering a 20 percent rebate on Chen''s site on Tuesdays
and Sundays from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. </p>
<p>DailyGobble charges eateries fees of 5 percent of food
sales to list deals -- a smaller cut than most other coupon
sites take -- and requires discounts of at least 20 percent,
Chen said. Diners get rebate checks in the mail after spending
enough to amass $25 in savings or can send funds to a PayPal
account. </p>
<p>Rebates Versus Coupons </p>
<p>The refund model sets DailyGobble apart from Groupon and
LivingSocial, among other deal sites, where buyers purchase the
discounted items up front, then use coupons when they dine out. </p>
<p>I think there will be some resistance and hesitation in
getting the money back later, said Greg Sterling, an analyst
with Opus Research Inc. in San Francisco. There''s a trust
issue initially. If it''s easy to get the money, it will create a
lot of stickiness and loyalty. </p>
<p>Chen says diners will like avoiding the hassle and
potential embarrassment of coupons, particularly in the two
food-obsessed cities his site targets: New York and San
Francisco. </p>
<p>A sales force is paramount to make such sites viable, said
Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research. DailyGobble
has nine employees on its sales team so far, Chen said. </p>
<p>It''s very, very labor intensive, Mulpuru said. You
have to get the word out to customers and you have to do it in a
way that''s not predictable. </p>
<p>Smartphone Apps </p>
<p>The site now works through an iPhone application that lets
diners photograph receipts and e-mail them to DailyGobble.
Employees at the company''s one-room New York office verify the
bill and start a rebate tab for customers. </p>
<p>Apps for Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android software should be available
within a week, and software for Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM)''s
BlackBerry will be released in four to six weeks, Chen said. </p>
<p>Other deal companies offer businesses delayed returns,
usually giving the eatery 50 percent of its money within three
to 10 days and the rest as many as 40 days after the deal, said
Alberto Gonzalez, 46, owner of New York-based GustOrganics. They
also don''t let businesses pick the time customers can use the
deal, he said. A flood of coupon-carrying clients can overwhelm
an unprepared small business. </p>
<p>One of the issues we normally have with other deals is
all the people with the deals come when we''re the busiest,
Gonzalez said. We have to run the vouchers, and that takes
time, and sometimes it gets complicated. </p>
<p>Gonzalez, who is offering 25 percent off meals between 8
a.m. and 11 a.m. with DailyGobble, said other deal companies
he''s used, including Groupon, DailyCandy Inc. and Gilt Groupe
Inc.''s Gilt City, take as much as 25 percent of sales generated
through their sites, versus DailyGobble''s 5 percent. </p>
<p>Checkout, Tips </p>
<p>No coupons also means diners don''t have to slow the
checkout process while managers verify authenticity, and the
wait staff is tipped for the full amount of the bill, said Wan,
owner of Red Egg. </p>
<p>Wan said he tried Groupon in February because of the
breadth of its user base. The customers who came were the sort
who are always looking for deals and often tipped based on
the discounted price, he said. </p>
<p>It''s hard to keep the wait staff motivated when they''re
getting jerked on tips, he said. </p>
<p>Groupon spokeswoman Julie Mossler said the company puts a
note on vouchers reminding people to be good customers, and has
data that show customers are spending 60 percent to 80 percent
more than the face value of its coupons. </p>
<p>Wan says he has little to lose by trying DailyGobble. </p>
<p>Best-case scenario, we''re able to fill up empty seats
during specific times of the day when we don''t experience a lot
of diners, he said. Worst-case scenario, you lose a customer
that used to dine at your restaurant any time of the week, but
now only dines when there''s a special available. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Italy''s
largest insurer, said first-quarter gross premiums fell 8.3
percent, affected by a contraction of single premiums at its
life-insurance business. </p>
<p>Total premiums decreased to 19.1 billion euros ($28.3
billion) in the first three months of 2011, from 20.8 billion
euros a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto told a shareholders'' meeting today in Trieste,
where the company is based. Non-life premiums rose 2.1 percent
to 6.8 billion euros in the period. </p>
<p>Generali''s first-quarter net income and operating income
were higher than a year earlier, Perissinotto said, without
giving figures. We also expect 2011 earnings better than last
year after the good set of results seen in the first quarter,
he said. </p>
<p>The company, scheduled to release results on May 13, is
expanding in emerging markets, including China and the Middle
East, to boost profit following the global financial crisis.
Today''s meeting was overseen by Gabriele Galateri, who replaced
Cesare Geronzi as chairman on April 8 following clashes with
investors over governance. </p>
<p>Geronzi and the board reached an agreement on his severance
payment of about 16.7 million euros, Perissinotto told
shareholders. The settlement amount is in line with what Geronzi
should have received for his three-year mandate, Perissinotto
said, adding that the Italian market regulator has asked for
explanations about the amount paid. </p>
<p>PPF Joint Venture </p>
<p>A revision of Generali''s joint venture with PPF is not on
the agenda, Perissinotto told reporters following the meeting.
Generali, which hired Mediobanca as adviser to examine the
agreement, considers the venture strategic. According to the
preliminary conclusion of our adviser, the venture shouldn''t be
modified, he said. </p>
<p>Generali and PPF, an Amsterdam-based private-equity firm,
formed a joint venture in 2007 to combine their insurance assets
in eastern Europe to create a company with 9 million customers
in 12 countries. The Italian insurer, which makes about 6
percent of its sales in central and eastern Europe, aims to grow
in the region, expanding in Russia to boost profitability, the
CEO said. </p>
<p>The company, which owns a 4.7 percent stake in Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA, hasn''t decided yet if it will adhere to the 5
billion-euro rights offer announced by Italy''s second-biggest
bank. The holding isn''t a strategic investment and a decision
will be taken considering the added value from a financial point
of view Perissinotto said. Generali didn''t enter Commerzbank''s
share sale, he said. </p>
<p>Generali, which aims to cut costs this year, doesn''t plan a
capital increase, according to the CEO. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at its Joliet refinery in Channahon,
Illinois, according to a filing with state regulators. </p>
<p>The filing to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency said
malfunctioning equipment caused the flaring, which began at 2:45
a.m. yesterday and ended three minutes later. </p>
<p>Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. </p>
<p>The refinery has a processing capacity of 248,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
