&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) rose to a
record after Goldman, Sachs  Co. boosted its subscriber
estimates for the BlackBerry e-mail device and said the stock
price didn't reflect the company's growth potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;``We are still in the early days of wireless email adoption
and RIM is aggressively expanding business opportunities in key
emerging markets,'' Goldman analyst Brantley Thompson wrote in a
note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson raised Research In Motion's share-price estimate by
13 percent to $295 because the stock price reflects ``an overly
bearish view'' that subscriber growth will slow after 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion will sign up 1.375 million new users in
the fiscal second quarter, helped by strong sales in the U.S. and
international demand, Thompson said. That prediction was 19
percent higher than his previous estimate of 1.35 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Waterloo, Ontario-based Research In Motion
advanced $15.47, or 7 percent, to $235.99 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading in New York. The stock has climbed 85
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
