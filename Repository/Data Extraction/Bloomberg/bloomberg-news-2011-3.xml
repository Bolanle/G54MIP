<p> Chevron Corp. (CVX) won a bid to extend a
court order barring Ecuadorean residents from enforcing an $18
billion judgment against the oil company until its racketeering
case against the villagers and their lawyers is decided. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said in a
ruling today that Chevron faced imminent and irreparable
harm to its business relationships and reputation. </p>
<p>There is a significant risk that assets would be seized
or attached, thus disrupting Chevron''s supply chain, causing it
to miss critical deliveries to business partners, Kaplan said. </p>
<p>Kaplan granted a temporary restraining order Feb. 8 barring
residents of the Amazon River basin who have sued Chevron in
Ecuador and their U.S. lawyers from enforcing the judgment
awarded by a court there. The company made the request in a U.S.
racketeering lawsuit in which it accused the Ecuadoreans''
lawyers of conspiring to fabricate evidence. The attorneys said
the lawsuit is unjustified and the claims an attempt to derail
the pollution lawsuit damages. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the Ecuadoreans have argued that Kaplan can''t
prevent the plaintiffs from enforcing the judgment outside the
U.S. said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs. </p>
<p>This decision is a slap in the face to the democratic
nation of Ecuador and the thousands of Ecuadorian citizens who
have courageously fought for 18 years to hold Chevron
accountable for committing the world''s worst environmental
disaster, Hinton said. The trampling of due process in the
court''s refusal to consider key evidence or hold a hearing to
determine the facts is an inappropriate exercise of judicial
power. </p>
<p>Pollution Claims </p>
<p>Chevron says it cleaned up its portion of the oil fields
and was released from pollution claims against Texaco Inc. in an
agreement with the government of Ecuador. Chevron acquired
Texaco in 2001. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, was ordered
Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18 billion in compensatory and
punitive damages for Texaco''s alleged dumping of toxic drilling
wastes in the Ecuadorean jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The
ruling came in an 18-year-old lawsuit decided by a judge in Lago
Agrio, a provincial capital near the Colombian border. </p>
<p>Chevron and the plaintiffs have said they will appeal the
decision. </p>
<p>Bond, Deposit </p>
<p>Kaplan ordered Chevron to post a $21.8 million bond or
deposit that sum with the court to ensure payment of any damages
caused by the delay in enforcement of the judgment, if his
injunction turns out to be inappropriate, according to the
filing. </p>
<p>Chevron had $17.1 billion in cash and near-cash equivalents
at the end of December, the San Ramon, California-based company
said in a Jan. 28 statement. </p>
<p>Chevron welcomes the order of the Southern District of
New York, Kent Robertson, a Chevron spokesman, said in an
e-mail. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs'' lawyers should not be
allowed to benefit from an Ecuadorean judicial system that does
not provide due process and from a judgment that they have
procured through fraud and corruption. </p>
<p>The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court
of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. </p>

<p>Britain''s economy can withstand the
government''s budget squeeze and an interest-rate increase,
according to research published this week by Ben Broadbent, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) economist who will join the Bank of
England''s rate panel in June. </p>
<p>The fiscal adjustment that the government plans over the
coming years is undoubtedly severe, London-based economists
including Broadbent wrote in an e-mailed note dated March 6.
Nevertheless, we take a more sanguine view than many of its
impact over the medium term. </p>
<p>Broadbent, who previously worked at the Treasury and Columbia University, will replace Andrew Sentance on the central
bank''s Monetary Policy Committee on June 1, the Treasury said
yesterday. He sees investment driving U.K. economic growth this
year and his projections for expansion are above the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. </p>
<p>While it''s hard to see much growth in incomes and consumer spending this year, the economic impact from any
potential interest-rate increases by the Bank of England may be
limited, Broadbent wrote in the note with economists Kevin Daly
and Adrian Paul. </p>
<p>Investors are concerned that any increase in interest
rates would seriously threaten overall economic growth too, both
directly, via the effects of cash-flow on consumer spending, and
indirectly, by raising the rate of default in the mortgage
market, the economists said. This concern is understandable
but, in our view, it is routinely exaggerated. </p>
<p>Growth Forecasts </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sees a U.K. expansion of 2.4 percent this
year and 2.5 percent in 2012, according to the note. The median
estimate of 16 economists is for growth of 1.7 percent this
year. The economy may expand 2 percent next year, according to a
separate survey. </p>
<p>Goldman recently changed its U.K. rate forecast, and sees
the central bank raising its benchmark rate by a quarter point
in May and in each of the subsequent two quarters, having
previously expected the first increase in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Broadbent will join a committee that has split four ways on
policy for the first time since the central bank''s independence
in 1997. With inflation at twice the bank''s target and the
economic recovery threatened by the government''s fiscal squeeze,
policy makers are divided on whether to increase interest rates
or expand stimulus. </p>
<p>The bank''s rate-setting panel starts its next two-day
policy meeting tomorrow. Last month, Sentance voted to increase
the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points from a record low
of 0.5 percent. Martin Weale and Spencer Dale called for a 25
basis-point increase, while the remaining six opted to maintain
the current rate. Adam Posen voted to expand the bank''s bond-
purchase plan. </p>
<p>Sentance was at the extreme hawkish end of the MPC but we
do not think his loss will divert the focus of the committee,
said Jens Sondergaard, an economist at Nomura International Plc
in London who previously worked at the Bank of England. In our
view, Mr. Broadbent will join the hawkish end of the MPC. His
view has tended to be more optimistic than the consensus. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Ted Pick sole head of equities as his
co-chief, Luc Francois, concentrates on expanding the firm''s
equity-derivatives business. </p>
<p>David Russell, head of equities in Asia, will relocate to London to run European equities, New York-based Morgan Stanley
said today in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Gokul Laroia,
currently co-head of Asia-Pacific investment banking, will
replace Russell in Asia. Kate Richdale will become the sole head
of Asia-Pacific investment banking, according to the memo. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 52, has said he wants
to increase the bank''s market share in equity-derivatives, which
are financial instruments such as options or futures that derive
their value from underlying equities. Morgan Stanley had $4.96
billion in equity-trading revenue last year, excluding losses
tied to its own credit spreads, second to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) among U.S. firms. </p>
<p>This business is a key strategic focus for us and we will
continue to benefit from Luc''s considerable expertise as we seek
to maximize our revenue opportunities in this area, according
to the memo, which was written by Pick, 42, and co-heads of the
investment-banking division, Paul Taubman and Colm Kelleher. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, confirmed the memo''s
contents. </p>
<p>Area of Focus'' </p>
<p>Francois, Russell and Laroia will report to Pick, according
to the memo. Francois will remain on the firm''s management
committee. Pick joined Morgan Stanley in 1990, becoming a
managing director in 2002 and co-head of global equities in
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Francois joined
the bank in 2008 and previously was co-head of equity-
derivatives at Paris-based Societe Generale (GLE) SA. </p>
<p>The derivatives business has been an area of focus for
us, both for the institutional space, financial institutions,
for the hedge fund community and also for the individual
private-wealth clients that we have around the world, Gorman
said at a Feb. 1 conference. It continues to be a focus, it''s
not exactly where we want it to be and expect it to be, but it''s
a major focus for the management in our equities group. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano''s compensation
increased 30 percent last year as the company exceeded its four-
year earnings target. </p>
<p>Palmisano, 59, received $31.7 million in total
compensation, including salary, stock awards and incentives,
compared with $24.3 million a year earlier, the Armonk, New
York-based company said today in a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>The CEO''s non-stock incentive compensation almost doubled
to $9 million as IBM increased its full-year profit to $11.52 a
share, besting its goal of at least $10 set four years ago.
Palmisano set another long-term target for the company last
year, saying that operating earnings will almost double to $20 a
share in 2015. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider, fell
$1.90 to $159.93 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange

<p> Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will pay Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)
more than $1 billion to promote and develop Windows-based
handsets as part of their smartphone software agreement,
according to two people with knowledge of the terms. </p>
<p>Nokia will pay Microsoft a fee for each copy of Windows used
in its phones, costs that will be offset as Nokia curtails its
own budget for software research and development, said one of
the people, who declined to be identified because the final
contract hasn''t yet been signed. The agreement runs for more
than five years, the people said. </p>
<p>If it succeeds, the partnership may benefit both sides
financially while helping stave off a smartphone threat from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) Nokia shares have dropped 26 percent
since the accord was unveiled Feb. 11, reflecting doubts about
the move to adopt Microsoft''s operating system, which is less
than six months old and has just a few percentage points of
market share. </p>
<p>This gives Microsoft scale and allows Nokia to rip out
costs, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners in New
York, who recommends buying Microsoft shares. Microsoft is
getting the platform boost that comes from acquiring a Nokia for
about a billion dollars. </p>
<p>Shrinking Margins </p>
<p>Espoo, Finland-based Nokia needs to cut costs to keep 
operating margins from narrowing further, after they shrank to
4.9 percent last year from 19 percent a decade earlier. For 2011
and 2012, Nokia may cut its budget for research and development
in devices and services by about a third from last year''s
spending of about 3 billion euros, said Sami Sarkamies, a
Helsinki-based analyst with Nordea Bank. </p>
<p>Microsoft spokeswoman Melissa Havel declined to comment on
the specifics of the agreement. Laurie Armstrong, a spokeswoman
for Nokia, said the final contract hasn''t been signed and the
company will share further details when they are complete. </p>
<p>Nokia''s royalty payments will help Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft make a profit on the accord even after the
payments to Nokia, one person said. Some of the payment to Nokia
would be made before the company starts selling the phones,
meaning Microsoft bears some upfront cost in the partnership. </p>
<p>Ballmer Under Pressure </p>
<p>Microsoft shareholders want the company to salvage its
mobile-software business while also reining in costs. The
company doesn''t break out results for its mobile-software unit,
and instead groups them with the profitable Xbox video-game
business, making it difficult to evaluate the financial
performance of phone software. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has come under
pressure from investors and his own board to improve sales of
mobile software after the company lost market share to Google
and Apple. Microsoft stock has declined 7.8 percent so far this
year. </p>
<p>The agreement for the more than billion-dollar payment was
part of a campaign by Microsoft to keep Nokia from choosing
Google''s Android operating system, one of the people said. Nokia
also opted for Microsoft because Windows Phone software, which
is newer than Android and has a smaller number of handsets for
sale, gives Nokia a better chance to stand out, one of the
people said. </p>
<p>The agreement also has Microsoft paying Nokia for the right
to use its patent portfolio, one of the people said. </p>
<p>As part of the deal, Microsoft will use Nokia''s Navteq
mapping products for functions such as geolocation services and
selling local advertising and coupons tied to a user''s position.
If successful, that also could generate additional revenue for
Nokia, which will share in the sales. The two companies will
also divide revenue from services like search and advertising,
Microsoft President Andy Lees said last month. </p>
<p>Generating Profit </p>
<p>Peter Klein, Microsoft''s chief financial officer, said last
week at an investor conference that sales from these kinds of
services are important to generating profit from the deal. </p>
<p>In success, it is a very mutually beneficial deal
economically for both companies, Klein said. </p>
<p>Such tailored user services may provide billions of
dollars of revenue to Nokia over the term of the contract, one
of the people said. </p>
<p>Days after the agreement was announced, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop said the agreement will add billions of dollars in value to
Nokia, without specifying how much. Microsoft''s Lees said the
agreement involves funds changing hands for royalties, marketing
and ad-revenue sharing. Both companies have declined to provide
specific amounts. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Senior
European Economist Ben Broadbent was appointed to the Bank of
England''s Monetary Policy Committee to replace Andrew Sentance,
who has been calling for higher rates for the past nine months. </p>
<p>Broadbent will join when Sentance''s term ends on May 31,
the Treasury in London said in a statement today. His broad
professional experience in the financial sector and academia, as
well as his detailed knowledge of the U.K. economy, will be
extremely valuable, it said. </p>
<p>Broadbent, who has previously worked at the Treasury and
the Bank of England, will join a committee that has split four
ways on policy for the first time since the central bank''s
independence in 1997. With inflation at twice the bank''s target
and the economic recovery threatened by the government''s fiscal
squeeze, policy makers are divided on whether to increase
interest rates or expand stimulus. </p>
<p>Broadbent is likely to be less hawkish than Sentance,
who''s on an outlying path in the policy debate, David Tinsley,
an economist at National Australia Bank in London and a former
central bank official, said in an interview. Most incoming
members of the MPC will want to learn the ropes and the dynamics
of the committee and are likely to vote with the pack for at
least the first few months. </p>
<p>Divided Meeting </p>
<p>The bank''s rate-setting panel starts its next two day
policy meeting on March 9. At the last meeting, Sentance voted
to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points from
a record low of 0.5 percent. Martin Weale and Spencer Dale
called for a 25 basis-point increase, while the remaining six
opted to maintain the current rate. Adam Posen voted to expand
the bank''s bond-purchase plan. </p>
<p>Bank of England Governor Mervyn King welcomed Broadbent''s
appointment and said he is joining at a critical time. </p>
<p>I am sure will make a valuable contribution to policy
going forward, King said. </p>
<p>Broadbent and colleagues recently changed their U.K. rate
forecast and see the central bank raising its benchmark rate by
a quarter point in May and in each of the subsequent two
quarters, according to a March 6 report. They forecast that the
rate will be at 2.25 percent by the end of next year. Goldman
Sachs previously expected the first increase in the fourth
quarter. </p>
<p>Broadbent is the latest Goldman Sachs employee to enter
policy making, and the third with experience of working at the
New York-based firm to join the MPC. Former U.K. rate-setters
David Walton and Sushil Wadhwani both had Goldman Sachs on their
resume before joining the central bank. </p>
<p>Excellent Economist'' </p>
<p>New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley is
Goldman Sachs''s former chief U.S. economist and Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney is a former managing director. Bank of
Italy Governor Mario Draghi, the current frontrunner to become
the next president of the European Central Bank, is a former
vice chairman of its international arm. </p>
<p>Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin both headed the bank before
becoming Treasury secretaries, while other former leaders
include Stephen Friedman, who was an adviser to President George W. Bush and Jon Corzine, who governed New Jersey. </p>
<p>He''s an excellent economist, said Jim O''Neill,
Broadbent''s former boss and now chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management. Incredibly sharp and one of the best the economics
department had in the last 15 years anywhere around the world. </p>
<p>Independently Minded'' </p>
<p>The Treasury said in an advertisement for the role that
applicants must be independently minded and be able to exert
their influence within the bank, the MPC and in the wider
external policy debate. The salary will be 131,771 pounds
($213,324) plus healthcare benefits, and the position will be on
a part-time basis, averaging three days a week. </p>
<p>Former policy maker Kate Barker and Treasury officials Tom Scholar and Dave Ramsden interviewed candidates and made
recommendations to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.
Of the 27 applications, only one was from a woman, and
Broadbent''s appointment means the MPC remains an all-male panel. </p>
<p>The government would like to see a greater number of
women apply for future appointments and will continue to
encourage them to do so, the Treasury said today. </p>
<p>Broadbent will join Posen, Weale and David Miles as the
fourth external member of the rate-setting panel. Governor Mervyn King, Paul Tucker, Charles Bean, Paul Fisher and Dale are
the internal members. </p>

<p>The year that China officially
became the world''s second-largest economy marked another
milestone. In 2010, Beijing gave investors the world''s biggest-
ever initial public offering -- the $22.1billion share float of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) in Hong Kong and Shanghai. </p>
<p>The Agricultural Bank listing was the highlight of a year
in which share sales by Asian companies dominated the equity
capital markets, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its April
issue. Asian companies accounted for 6 of the world''s 10 biggest
offerings. </p>
<p>Total fees from arranging IPOs and secondary stock
offerings were almost unchanged for the year, at $16.3 billion
compared with $16.4 billion in 2009, even though the total
amount companies across the world raised in 2010 jumped
23percent, to $549 billion, from 2009, according to data
compiled for Bloomberg Markets'' annual ranking of the best-paid
investment banks. </p>
<p>That''s because the fees charged for those deals dropped 19
percent, to an average of 2.94 percent from 3.65 percent. That''s
the lowest average fee for equity deals since Bloomberg began
compiling such data in 1999. The data exclude fees from self-led
deals, in which investment banks collect commissions from
selling their own companies'' stock. </p>
<p>Government-backed deals helped push fees down. General
Motors Co. (GM)''s $18.1 billion offering in November paid banks only
0.75 percent. Morgan Stanley (MS) picked up just 0.4 percent in fees
as sole lead underwriter for the $10.5 billion disposal of the
U.S. Treasury''s remaining stake in Citigroup Inc. (C) </p>
<p>AgBank IPO </p>
<p>By those standards, the Agricultural Bank listing was
lucrative. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley, which
were among the banks leading the offering, were paid
1.96percent by the Chinese government for the $12 billion Hong
Kong portion of the IPO. The Beijing-based bank, which is
China''s biggest lender by customer, was the last of China''s big
financial institutions to go public. It was established in 1951
to serve China''s rural areas. </p>
<p>Asia raised more through IPOs than any region on record
since Bloomberg began keeping such statistics in 1999. Seven of
the 10 biggest IPOs were in Asia, and companies in the region
raised $115 billion through IPOs, compared with $91billion for
the rest of the world. </p>
<p>The pace of activity in Asia is likely to continue
unabated, says Dan Cummings, Bank of America Corp. (BAC)''s New York-
based head of global equity capital markets. There were so many
landmark offerings that it almost becomes difficult to
distinguish what is a landmark offering anymore. </p>
<p>JPMorgan No. 1 </p>
<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was No. 1 in fees from underwriting
equity offerings in 2010, according to the Bloomberg Markets
ranking. JPMorgan has led the equity ranking for three
consecutive years. It took in $1.61 billion, topping Goldman
Sachs, No. 2 with $1.57 billion, and No. 3 Morgan Stanley''s
$1.51 billion. </p>
<p>The year featured the biggest share issue ever: Sao Paulo-
based Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)''s $70 billion secondary offering,
$23.5 billion of which was underwritten by Bank of America,
Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. The share sale is designed to fund
the Brazilian company''s ambitious deep-water oil-drilling
program. Fees for the part of the offering that were
underwritten were 0.65 percent. </p>
<p>New York-based Citigroup, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Bank of America
and Morgan Stanley led the $3.5 billion IPO of state-controlled Coal India Ltd. (COAL), and Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley led
Malaysia''s $4.7 billion IPO of Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd. (PCHEM),
which were the largest in each country''s history. </p>
<p>AIG Spinoff </p>
<p>The second-biggest IPO of the year, the $20.5billion Hong
Kong sale by insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG)''s main
Asian unit, AIA Group Ltd. (1299), was led by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank,
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The sale helped put AIG, now
majority-owned by the U.S. Treasury, on course to repay its
government creditors. </p>
<p>Governments had no trouble attracting underwriters despite
the lower fees. </p>
<p>They are the marquee deals, and everybody knows who does
them, says Steven Kaplan, a professor at the University of
Chicago Booth School of Business. You are advertising that you
can do these big deals. </p>
<p>Global issues of stock and convertible bonds will increase
only about 5percent over 2010, according to year-end forecasts
by Matthew Johnson, New York-based head of Barclays Plc (BARC)''s global
equity syndicate. </p>
<p>We''ve been in a multiyear bear market from an equities
perspective, Johnson says. He is cautiously optimistic that
it''s finally about to end. </p>

<p>Investment bankers, whose
institutions have already been bailed out to the tune of
$817billion across the globe, now have something else to thank
taxpayers for: deals. </p>
<p>In a year when some of the biggest transactions came from
emerging markets, governments from Washington to Beijing helped
buoy investment banking fees by selling off their stakes in
financial companies, automakers and other corporations. </p>
<p>Bankers eagerly signed up to handle those government
offerings, even though they sometimes paid fees of less than 1
percent, compared with a historical average of 3 percent to 5
percent, Bloomberg Markets reports in its April issue. </p>
<p>The government-backed deals helped to push fee revenue up
last year by 5.8 percent across the industry to $49.1 billion
from $46.4 billion, as total deal volume stayed constant at
about $7 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
Markets magazine for its seventh annual ranking of the best-paid
investment banks. </p>
<p>The volume of announced mergers and acquisitions rose 27
percent, to $2.2 trillion, while fees rose 23 percent to $17.9
billion. </p>
<p>Deal totals in the bond markets fell to $4.1 trillion from
$4.7 trillion, and fees also fell. </p>
<p>Fees for all IPOs and secondary stock offerings dropped to
their lowest level since Bloomberg began compiling such data in
1999, averaging 2.9 percent. The industry average in 2003 was
5.6 percent. </p>
<p>On the Mend </p>
<p>Although bankers say global markets are on the mend, it
will take years before they see anything close to the record
$86.9 billion in investment-banking fees earned in 2007, says
Hugh Skip McGee, head of global investment banking at Barclays
Plc (BARC)''s Barclays Capital in New York. </p>
<p>You''re going to be hard-pressed to get back to ''07 levels
anytime soon, he says. </p>
<p>The world''s best-paid investment bank in 2010 was JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), which ranks No. 1 in the Bloomberg 20 for the third
year in a row, with total fees of $4.14 billion. The bank also
led the field in fees from bond and equity issues. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley supplanted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for the
No. 2 position in total fees for 2010, earning $3.67 billion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is No. 3 overall with $3.60 billion. It ranks
No. 1 in earnings from mergers and acquisitions, as it has every
year since the Bloomberg 20 started in 2004. </p>
<p>Asia Critical </p>
<p>James Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s
investment bank, told investors and analysts at a Feb. 15
meeting at the bank''s New York headquarters that Asia was a
critically important region for the investment bank in 2010. </p>
<p>Three of the five largest markets last year in terms of
IPOs were Hong Kong at $57 billion, Shenzhen at $47 billion and
Shanghai at $27 billion, Staley, 54, said. He said that while
his unit gets 18 percent of its revenue from emerging markets,
the growth in revenue from that sector is 1 times that of the
investment bank as a whole. </p>
<p>Outside Asia, the U.S. Treasury was one of the most
important customers for Wall Street last year, selling stock it
acquired during the 2008 to 2009 financial meltdown in a long
list of companies, including American International Group Inc. (AIG), Ally Financial Inc. (formerly GMAC), and Citigroup Inc. (C) Treasury
negotiated rockbottom prices, paying bankers, including Morgan
Stanley, JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
0.75percent to sell about half of its stake in General Motors
Co. (GM) </p>
<p>Petrobras''s Big Deal </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley picked up only 0.4 percent in fees as sole
underwriter for the $10.5 billion in Citigroup stock Treasury
sold. Brazil''s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) paid underwriters 0.65
percent to execute $23.5 billion of its $70 billion secondary
stock offering, the biggest in history. </p>
<p> Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (1288), which launched the biggest
IPO ever, paid its underwriters 1.96 percent for the $12 billion
that was raised in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was an underwriter of the Agricultural Bank
offering. At the meeting with investors, Staley said the
investment bank expanded its workforce last year by 42 percent
in China, 40 percent in Brazil and nearly 20percent in Russia. </p>
<p>Bankers are less optimistic about fast growth in Europe and
the U.S., where new strictures by the Federal Reserve and the
European Central Bank on the amount banks must hold in reserve
against bad loans, and the amount of leverage they can take on,
mean the high-flying days of 2005 to 2007 are over. </p>
<p>Dreaming of 2007 </p>
<p>The 2007 levels will be really difficult to get back to
because of the new capital requirements and the deleveraging of
financial institution balance sheets across the board, McGee,
51, says. </p>
<p>Asian corporations kept their bankers busier than in any
other region. Asia provided seven of the ten biggest IPOs in
2010, including the $22.1 billion dual offering in Shanghai and
HongKong by Agricultural Bank. </p>
<p>While the U.S. and Europe lagged in the sale of new stock
and bonds, the younger, emerging economies bubbled with new
money and deals. </p>
<p>All those countries that we thought of as the emerging
markets are very developed right now, says Purna Saggurti, co-
head of global investment banking at Bank of America Corp. (BAC)
China is the second-largest investmentbanking fee market
already. You can''t call it an emerging market anymore; it is the
developed world. </p>
<p>Mergers, acquisitions and share offerings were the daily
bread of bankers last year in the BRIC countries -- Brazil,
Russia, India and China. </p>
<p>Cross-Border Deals </p>
<p>About 25 percent of the banking industry''s MA volume and
some of the largest IPOs came from crossborder deals in Asia
such as U.S. insurer AIG''s $20.5 billion spinoff of its Asian
arm, AIA Group, which was the second-largest IPO last year. </p>
<p>A host of big Western banks had a hand in that deal,
including Barclays, Citigroup Global Markets Asia, Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK), Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Securities Asia, Morgan Stanley (MS)
Asia, Bank of America''s Merrill Lynch Far East subsidiary and UBS AG. (UBSN) </p>
<p>Firms are once again thinking global after the
retrenchment of the last couple of years, Barclays''s McGee
says. They are looking to resume their growth trajectory. </p>
<p>In the U.S., Timothy F. Geithner''s Treasury Department kept
investment banks busy last year. Deutsche Bank alone advised the
U.S. Treasury on 13 separate transactions that sold $3.9 billion
in warrants for taxpayers in 2010. </p>
<p>GM''s IPO </p>
<p>Paul Taubman, co-president of institutional securities at
Morgan Stanley, says the most important transaction of 2010 came
very late in the year -- the November IPO of General Motors,
which filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009. On Nov. 17, it
launched an initial public offering in which it sold $18.1
billion of common shares at $33 each, making it the second-
largest U.S. IPO on record. General Motors stock, after rising
as high as $39, was down on March 4 from its IPO price, closing
at $32.39. </p>
<p>The General Motors deal was important for the economy; it
was important for the markets, Taubman says. It was a defining
moment last year in many respects. It was increased in size; it
was increased in price; it traded well in the aftermarket. </p>
<p>That deal marked the culmination of a banner year for
Morgan Stanley''s investment bank. Profits from continuing
operations in the unit, including trading, more than doubled to
$3.75 billion last year from $1.39 billion in 2009. The firm
generated higher investment-banking revenue in the fourth
quarter than Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The firm, which in June 2009 repaid the government $10
billion it borrowed through the Troubled Asset Relief Program,
was a lead underwriter on three of the four largest IPOs last
year: GM, the Agricultural Bank of China and AIA Group. </p>
<p>High-Profile Hiring </p>
<p>Taubman, 50, credits Morgan Stanley''s rise in investment
banking to its high-profile hiring over the last half of the
2000s, beginning with the bank''s global head of MA, Robert Kindler, who Taubman lured away from JPMorgan in 2006. </p>
<p>Kindler, 57, was a mergers lawyer for New York law firm
Cravath Swaine  Moore LLP before becoming a banker in 2000.
Morgan Stanley also hired Gary Shedlin from Citigroup, who
Taubman says brought with him a long roster of clients, and Dan Toscano, hired last year from HSBC to run Morgan Stanley''s
leveraged finance business. </p>
<p>We''ve been able over the past few years to systematically
attract, recruit and integrate some of the best bankers on the
Street, Taubman says. </p>
<p>Multinational Cross-Border </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman and other big banks are
more heavily invested than ever in serving multinational
corporations doing cross-border transactions. Banks that have
such a global presence have to be able to handle everything from
sharp swings in currency rates to political unrest, says Jacques Brand, co-head of investment banking at Deutsche Bank in New
York. </p>
<p>The exchange rate of the euro, for instance, swung during
2010 from a high of $1.45 in January to as low as $1.19 in June.
By October, it was back above $1.40. </p>
<p>That represented a bigger swing in value than those of the
Russian ruble and the Brazilian real during the same period. </p>
<p>In 2010, the market for mergers, stock and bond issues in
the U.S. and Europe was dampened by a series of crises that
began on April22, when the European Union estimated that
Greece''s budget deficit for 2009 had been 13.6 percent of gross
domestic product, more than triple Greece''s own previous
estimate. </p>
<p>The cost to buy credit protection against Greek debt
surged, and markets in both Europe and the U.S. recoiled as the
EU quickly put together a 440 billion euro ($594billion)
bailout fund to guarantee the debt of Greece and other shaky
euro-zone economies, including Ireland, Portugal and Spain. The
euro plunged against the dollar. </p>
<p>Blow to Confidence </p>
<p>The next blow to confidence came on May6, when in the
course of less than an hour shares listed on the New York Stock
Exchange plunged, briefly erasing $862 billion in market value.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued an October
report on the incident, concluding that it started with a $4
billion automatic sell order by an asset manager that triggered
a flood of follow-on sales by highfrequency traders. </p>
<p>The first couple of months of 2010 were very strong,
Deutsche Bank''s Brand, 50, says. A combination of the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe, particularly around Greece, combined with
the flash crash, really undermined the investor confidence
that''s necessary for robust MA and capital raising. </p>
<p>The midyear freeze on deals in Europe sealed the fate of
European investment banking for the entire year, Barclays''s
McGee says. </p>
<p>Shrinking Europe </p>
<p>That market shrunk pretty significantly from ''09 to ''10,
he says. The total fee pool was actually down year over year,
so that has an impact on anybody that has a sizable presence in
the region, as we do. </p>
<p>London-based Barclays moved up a notch to No. 8 in the
Bloomberg 20 with total fees of $2.25 billion. </p>
<p>Though Europe''s troubles dulled the overall deal market,
there was still a steady stream of transactions in the U.S.,
particularly toward the end of the year. </p>
<p>We saw a good pickup in the U.S. markets, Bank of
America''s Saggurti says. The 2010 capital raising was all about
cleaning up balance sheets and refinancing because the markets
were forgiving and were available. </p>
<p>Corporate and sovereign bond sales worldwide declined
overall by 12 percent, and yet 2010 was still the second-best
year on record, with companies taking advantage of low interest
rates to refinance higher-interest debt and garner cash for
share buybacks and acquisitions, bankers say. </p>
<p>Bond Fees Down </p>
<p>Fees overall fell to $14.9billion from a record $15.5
billion in 2009 due to the decline in volume, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Within the debt markets, companies around the world sold
$369 billion in high-yield junk bonds -- the most lucrative
for underwriters -- the most since Bloomberg began keeping count
in 1999. </p>
<p>High-yield will continue to thrive in the current
environment in a world in which issuers are fearful that rates
may increase, Saggurti says. Well-regarded, well-capitalized
B, BB, BBB credits are a bit of a safe haven as the economy
continues to heal. </p>
<p>The rise in announced MA deals in 2010 bodes well for
investment banking generally in 2011, Taubman says. </p>
<p>If there''s more MA activity, that drives all the volumes
around it, he says. More MA activity means more so-called
bridge financing to help companies complete their acquisitions,
he says, which can in turn be followed by bond and equity deals
for the merged company. </p>
<p>Spending $1 Trillion </p>
<p>In the U.S., bankers say, corporations are ready to put the
$1 trillion in capital they''ve been hoarding over the past two
years to work. </p>
<p>We came into 2011 with a lot of momentum, Brand says.
The market broadly is coming off of a very strong high-yield
issuance, very strong equity market in the fourth quarter and
increasing momentum in MA activity. Corporations feel
optimistic about their ability to consummate transactions, so I
think we''re going to see an uptick in MA activity. </p>
<p>One good sign for the bankers: Private-equity firms are
doing deals again. Firms such as Blackstone Group Inc., Carlyle
Group and KKR  Co. represented 25 percent of investment-banking
fees during the height of the leveraged-buyout boom in 2006 and
2007, according to Deutsche Bank. That figure dropped to about
5percent of the market in 2008 and 2009. </p>
<p>Private Equity Comeback </p>
<p>Last year, private equity accounted for about 16percent of
the industry''s fees, Brand says, and he expects the number to
exceed 20 percent this year. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank advised IMS Health Inc., a Norwalk,
Connecticut-based health-care company, in its $5.2 billion sale
to TPG Partners, which was announced in 2009 and completed in
February. It was the largest leveraged buyout since the collapse
of Lehman Brothers and the fifth-largest ever. </p>
<p>We saw sharp, renewed LBO and IPO activity in 2010, and we
expect that to continue in 2011, Brand says. </p>
<p>Investment bankers are confident that MA and stock and
bond issuance will all rise substantially this year, especially
if Europe stabilizes. Deutsche Bank led 24 technology IPOs
around the world last year and has a healthy pipeline slated for
2011, Brand says. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury will continue to be a source of revenue.
The Treasury still owns large stakes in General Motors, AIG,
Ally Financial and other U.S. corporations. Virtually every bank
on Wall Street got a piece of the business last year. </p>
<p>More Mergers Coming </p>
<p>Investors should also expect to see more mergers among
natural resource companies this year, including metals, mining,
coal and oil, McGee and Saggurti say. </p>
<p>The consolidation opportunity in those sectors has been
brewing for quite a while now, and people are pulling the
trigger as we speak, Saggurti says. </p>
<p>Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) completed its biggest
acquisition since 1999 and the largest purchase in the world
last year when it paid $41 billion in a stock swap to buy Fort
Worth, Texas-based natural gas company XTO Energy Inc. McGee
calls the purchase, announced in 2009, a game changer in the
energy field and notes that it was followed by smaller
acquisitions of natural gas companies by Chevron Corp. and
others. </p>
<p>All the ingredients are there for a strong recovery in
investment banking this year, bankers say, though they still
worry that unemployment in the U.S. and Europe and inflation in
China and other emerging markets could muffle economic growth. </p>
<p>Still, more deals will be done by private companies --
which have less clout when it comes to demanding discounts. That
means fees may continue their rise through 2011. </p>

<p>Spurred by declining interest rates,
banks in 2010 capped off the biggest two-year bond sale binge on
record. Corporate bond sales of $2.8 trillion were the second
largest on record behind 2009''s $3.1 trillion. </p>
<p>Corporate and sovereign bond deals around the world
generated a total of $14.9 billion in fees for bankers, down
from $15.5 billion in 2009, according to data compiled for
Bloomberg Markets magazine''s seventh annual ranking of the best-
paid investment banks. </p>
<p>Fees dropped in 2010 because companies felt less urgency to
borrow than in 2009, when markets reopened after the crisis,
bankers say. While the quantity of bonds sold globally declined
12percent, a record $369 billion of high-yield, high-risk bonds
-- the most lucrative for underwriters -- helped prevent a
comparable drop in fees. </p>
<p>Corporate treasurers around the world are taking advantage
of the lowest borrowing costs since at least 1996 by refinancing
higher-interest debt and pushing out maturities, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s Global Broad Market Corporate
Index. </p>
<p>After two years of hoarding cash, they''re also borrowing
more to fund a growing number of acquisitions and to fund share
buybacks, says Therese Esperdy, head of global debt capital
markets at New York-based JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Corporate bond yields dropped to as low as 3.36 percent in
October from 4.4 percent at the end of 2009, according to the
BofA Merrill Lynch index. Yields stood at 7.8 percent in October
2008. </p>
<p>More Aggressive'' </p>
<p>Given the amount of cash on corporate balance sheets,
companies have become much more aggressive about pushing out
their refinancing horizon, Esperdy says. She says companies are
refinancing bonds that don''t mature for three or more years. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the No. 1 underwriter in 2010, taking or
sharing the top spot for the third straight year, earning $1.26
billion in fees, according to Bloomberg data. Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America climbed to No. 2, with $1.07
billion in fees. New York-based Citigroup continued its slide in
the rankings, slipping to No. 5 from No. 2 last year. </p>
<p>Citigroup was the lead bond underwriter from 2004 to 2008. </p>
<p>The biggest corporate bond deal of 2010 was Kraft Foods
Inc. (KFT)''s sale of $9.5 billion of debt for its takeover of London-
based Cadbury Plc. Cadbury agreed to an 11.9 billion pound
($19.2 billion) offer from Kraft after a five-month standoff
over pricing in a deal that created the world''s largest
confectioner. </p>
<p>Novartis Buys Alcon </p>
<p>Another big cross-border deal was Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis AG''s sale of $5 billion in debt to fund its acquisition
of U.S. eye-care company Alcon Inc. </p>
<p>The second-biggest corporate bond deal was the $6 billion
in debt issued by Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to
finance part of its purchase of railroad Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. The total sale price was $26.5 billion, with
Buffett digging into his $30.6 billion cash pile to pay for
almost a third of it. The rest of the deal, the biggest takeover
in 80-year-old Buffett''s career, was funded with Berkshire
shares. </p>
<p>Barclays''s bond team is projecting that U.S. investment-
grade debt sales will increase about 4percent this year as
growing demand for floating-rate debt makes up for a projected
decline in fixed-rate bonds. </p>
<p>With yields still low and balance sheets flush with cash,
companies are more likely to finance acquisitions with debt
instead of shares, says Nigel Cree, head of syndicate for the
Americas bond team at Deutsche Bank. </p>
<p>Very Low Yields </p>
<p>Two-year U.S. Treasury yields fell to a record 0.31 percent
in November, helping corporate bond sales. As European leaders
sought to bolster confidence in the finances of Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, the yield on two-year German bunds
dropped to as low as 0.43 percent in May. </p>
<p>On the other hand, global investment-grade bond yields have
climbed 0.7 percentage points to 4.05 percent from their low in
October to March 3. That triggered bond index losses averaging
1.5percent in the last three months of 2010, the worst decline
since the quarter ended on Sept. 30, 2008, according to the BofA
Merrill Lynch index. </p>
<p>There''s definitely a risk to the demand in our market to
the extent we continue to see rates move upward, says Andrew Karp, Bank of America''s head of high-grade debt syndicate for
the Americas. If that occurs at a time when equities are
rallying, and you believe dollars chase returns, you could see
money shifting out of fixed-income into equities. </p>

Mider and Jeffrey McCracken" date="Mar 07, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-07/goldman-heads-m-a-rankings-spurred-by-commodities-demand-in-bric-economies.html"><headline>Goldman Leads M&amp;amp;A List Spurred by Commodities Demand in BRICs</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>The merger boom that started in 2010
isn''t looking like any of the past three. The takeover binge of
the 1980s was fueled by Michael Milken''s junk bonds; the late-
1990s wave of Internet and telecom deals, by inflated stock
prices; and the private-equity frenzy that produced a record
year for deals in 2007, by leveraged loans. </p>
<p>The more recent surge comes from the expanding BRIC
economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- and beyond.
Deals are rising among the companies that supply raw materials
to these countries. Worldwide deals in energy, power and basic
materials made up about a third of the merger and acquisition
market in 2010, compared with about 20 percent in the previous
decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies with
headquarters in emerging markets played a role in more than a
third of 2010 takeovers, about twice their historical share. </p>
<p>Emerging-market acquisitions helped the total value of
announced deals for 2010 grow 27percent to $2.2 trillion,
driving up advisory fees. It''s the first annual increase in fees
since the banner year of 2007. Goldman Sachs took the top spot
in an annual ranking of advisers by the fees they collect in the
April issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine. </p>
<p>Lower volatility in commodity prices is helping deals come
together, says Carl Contiguglia, co-head of natural resources investment banking at Morgan Stanley (MS), the No. 2 fee earner. </p>
<p>The back half of 2010 was the beginning of a natural
resources MA boom, Contiguglia says. I forecast that to
continue through 2011. </p>
<p>Biggest Deal </p>
<p> Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)''s $42.5 billion purchase of offshore
oil rights from the Brazilian government, announced in
September, was the biggest deal of the year. Less than a month
earlier, London-based Vedanta Resources Plc agreed to buy Cairn
India Ltd. for $9.6 billion to get access to India''s biggest
onshore field. </p>
<p>Even dealmaking within the world''s mature economies has
been spurred by the BRICs. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar
Inc. agreed in November to buy South Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Bucyrus International Inc. (BUCY) for $7.6billion to sell giant mining
machines in China. </p>
<p>Demand is being driven by these super-charged emerging
economies, says Cary Kochman, head of MA for the Americas at
Zurich-based UBS AG. (UBSN) We are quickly moving from oversupply of
raw materials into a tighter demand situation. UBS, which is
helping advise Bucyrus, is No. 5 in the rankings. </p>
<p>Goldman No. 1 </p>
<p>In other deals, emerging-market companies expanded to
better compete on the global stage, says Antonio Weiss, head of
investment banking at Lazard Ltd. (LAZ), which ranked 11th in the
tally. Russia''s two biggest potash producers, OAO Uralkali and
OAO Silvinit, agreed in December to a $7.8 billion combination
to help them supply materials to international markets. Goldman
Sachs, Morgan Stanley and VTB Group are advising Uralkali,
according to Bloomberg data, and Bank of America is working with
Silvinit. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs retained its No. 1 ranking for the seventh
straight year, showing that Western banks with global reach
dominate the new merger landscape. Big Western banks led the way
even in takeovers of companies based in emerging Asian markets.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, and
Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) all logged more deals than
local competitors such as China International Capital Corp.,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>For the first time, an emerging-market bank made the Top 20
ranking. Banco BTG Pactual SA, the Rio de Janeiro-based
investment bank, came in 18th place on the list. </p>
<p>Core Acquisitions </p>
<p>Companies are using acquisitions to build and refine their
existing businesses rather than plunge into new ones as they
emerge from the worst financial crisis in decades, says Jeffrey Kaplan, head of MA at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America. Conglomerates such as ITT Corp. (ITT) and Sara Lee Corp. are
pursuing breakups -- another sign that companies are choosing to
focus on their core markets. </p>
<p>Coming out of such a severe downturn, even with the cheap
cost of debt, shareholders are not looking for companies to take
on big risks, says Kaplan, whose firm has been advising
SaraLee. </p>
<p>With the International Monetary Fund forecasting robust
growth in the BRICs in 2011, bankers say acquisitions will
increase for the second straight year after hitting $4 trillion
in 2007. </p>
<p>You have all this cash built up, and you have sectors such
as power and energy that are active, says John Studzinski, head
of Blackstone Group''s advisory unit. This year''s going to match
2007, or it will be higher. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), aiming to increase revenue by helping municipalities
manage traffic and water systems, said it has boosted the number
of projects it''s working on with cities to more than 2,000. </p>
<p>IBM had 2,133 such projects at the end of last year,
including 645 in emerging markets, the Armonk, New York-based
company said in a presentation today at its annual investor
briefing, held this year in Yorktown Heights, New York. </p>
<p>The company is helping cities such as Shenyang, China and
Bangkok manage energy, health-care, and public safety systems.
Using technology to monitor and make anything from cities to
buildings more efficient -- a concept IBM calls Smarter Planet -
- will be a $10 billion business for IBM by 2015, the company
said. </p>
<p>The business is all the things that, even in a tough
economic environment, free up money so cities can go invest,
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano said at the event. </p>
<p>The company, which turns 100 this year, has helped Rio de
Janeiro monitor weather, energy and transportation and created a
program to track the sewer system in Sacramento, California. </p>
<p>IBM climbed $2.35, or 1.5 percent, to $162.28 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company has
climbed 11 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company also said it will spend about $35 billion on
research and development over the next five years, compared with
about $30 billion spent in the past five years. The company
invests in RD to support its main growth areas, including
Smarter Planet, as well as exploratory projects, such as mapping
a cocoa gene. </p>
<p>Patents and Royalties </p>
<p>We invested $24 billion in RD and yes, garnered another
18,000 patents, Palmisano said of the company''s last long-term
roadmap, which ended last year. The company gets about $1
billion annually from licensing fees. </p>
<p>Palmisano reiterated IBM''s goal of nearly doubling
operating earnings per share to at least $20 in 2015. Along with
Smarter Planet, the company is investing in analytics software
and services, which help companies predict trends, and cloud-
computing, which lets customers store and access data on servers
other than their own. The two businesses will have $16 billion
and $7 billion in revenue in 2015, respectively, the company
said. </p>
<p>Along with geographic growth markets, which will increase
to be about 30 percent of total sales in the next five years,
the three areas will add about $20 billion to IBM''s revenue,
which totaled $99.9 billion last year, in the same time period.
It will make about $20 billion in acquisitions in that time. </p>

<p>The Bank of England''s appointment of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Senior European Economist Ben Broadbent
to its Monetary Policy Committee shows governments are again
looking to the firm for top decision makers, less than a year
after it settled U.S. fraud claims. </p>
<p>Broadbent, who has worked at Goldman Sachs since 2000, will
replace Andrew Sentance at the end of May, the Treasury in
London said yesterday. He joins a panel that has split four ways
on policy for the first time since the central bank''s
independence in 1997. </p>
<p>Opposition parties last year pressed U.K. Prime Minister
Gordon Brown to suspend Goldman Sachs from government work after
the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New York-based
company in April. Brown said at the time he was shocked by the
moral bankruptcy described in the complaint. </p>
<p>I think this was much more unlikely to have happened six
or eight months ago, Steven Kaplan, a professor at the
University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said of
Broadbent''s appointment. In the intervening months, the fact
that we haven''t seen anything else truly scandalous with them or
with any of the other top banks has definitely helped. </p>
<p>Even the SEC has shown an interest in luring Goldman Sachs''
expertise. In January, it hired Eileen Rominger, who spent 11
years in the firm''s asset-management division, including as
global chief investment officer. She now heads the SEC''s
division of investment management. </p>
<p>SEC Cases </p>
<p>In July, the firm paid $550 million to settle SEC civil
claims that it misled investors in a mortgage-linked investment
that was sold in 2007. </p>
<p>In a separate case last week, the agency accused Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs board member, of telling hedge-
fund manager Raj Rajaratnam about Warren Buffett''s
$5 billion investment in the bank in 2008 before the deal was
announced. Gupta and Rajaratnam deny the insider-trading
allegations. The firm wasn''t accused of wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Former Goldman Sachs employees hold key policy-setting
positions worldwide. New York Federal Reserve Bank President
William Dudley is the firm''s former chief U.S. economist. Bank
of Canada Governor Mark Carney is a former managing director.
Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, the current frontrunner to
become the next president of the European Central Bank, was vice
chairman of the firm''s international arm. </p>
<p>Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin both headed the bank before
becoming Treasury secretaries, while other former leaders
include Stephen Friedman, who was an adviser to President George W. Bush, and Jon Corzine, who governed New Jersey. </p>
<p>Third on Panel </p>
<p>Broadbent is the third Goldman Sachs employee to join the
Monetary Policy Committee. Former U.K. rate-setters David Walton
and Sushil Wadhwani had Goldman Sachs on their resumes before
joining the central bank. Broadbent also has worked previously
at the Treasury and the Bank of England. </p>
<p>The Chancellor appointed him because he was the
outstanding candidate from the field, said a Treasury
spokesman, who declined to be named to comply with U.K. civil-
service rules. </p>
<p> Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>It makes sense for the government to hire the best and
the brightest, said James Angel, a finance professor at
Georgetown University''s business school in Washington. The
public doesn''t typically hold ill will for long against
individual firms, he said. Most people outside of the
financial markets don''t really know the difference between
Goldman Sachs, Countrywide and their friendly neighborhood local
bank, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase </p>
<p> Wall Street has provided other executives for government
positions this year. In January, President Barack Obama named
William Daley, 62, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executive and former
commerce secretary, as his chief of staff. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has taken steps to restore its reputation and
win the trust of clients. </p>
<p>In May, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
established a Business Standards Committee to examine the firm''s
responsibilities to clients, review how it identifies and
manages conflicts of interest, and consider whether financial
reporting and public disclosure could improve. The committee
also looked at whether the firm was properly selling complex
products, adequately training employees and whether companywide
operating committees could become more effective. </p>
<p>The panel issued a report in January with 39 proposals. </p>
<p>Reputational Excellence'' </p>
<p>We believe the recommendations in this report represent a
fundamental re-commitment of Goldman Sachs to our clients and to
reputational excellence in everything the firm does,
Blankfein, 56, said in the statement announcing the report. </p>
<p>Broadbent will join Adam Posen, Martin Weale and David Miles as the fourth external member of the rate-setting panel.
Governor Mervyn King, Paul Tucker, Charles Bean, Paul Fisher and
Spencer Dale are the internal members. At the last meeting,
Sentance voted to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50
basis points from a record low of 0.5 percent. Weale and Dale
called for a 25 basis-point increase, while the remaining six
opted to maintain the current rate. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) jumped 2.2 percent in New York trading after seven
analysts boosted their price targets for the company, including
one who predicted the shares will reach $200. </p>
<p>Chris Whitmore, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, raised his
price target for the stock 14 percent to $200, saying IBM''s
analyst meeting yesterday made the company''s profit targets seem
conservative. He''s now one of eight analysts tracked by
Bloomberg projecting the shares will reach at least $180. </p>
<p>At yesterday''s meeting, IBM reiterated its goals of almost
doubling per-share operating earnings to at least $20 and
increasing sales by about $20 billion by 2015. The company is
being conservative on revenue growth and how much it will be
able to eliminate in expenses, Whitmore wrote in a note to
clients yesterday. </p>
<p>We believe there is ample flexibility for IBM to beat this
target and expect investors to place a larger premium on IBM''s
earnings stream as confidence in this goal increases, said San
Francisco-based Whitmore, who maintained his buy rating on the
company''s shares. </p>
<p>IBM said it sees $8 billion in cost savings through 2015
and is assuming only $3 billion of that in its profit target,
Whitmore wrote. The company could see about $25 in operating
earnings per share in 2015, he said. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose $3.58 to $165.86 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the steepest
jump since Jan. 24. The shares have climbed 13 percent this
year. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, will eliminate between 200 and 300 trainees
and financial advisers at its retail brokerage, according to a
person briefed on the decision. </p>
<p>The cuts will target low-producing brokers and bring the
number of advisers close to 17,800 from 18,043 on Dec. 31, said
the person, who declined to be named because the decision hasn''t
been made public. Christine Pollak, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based company, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley paid $2.75 billion in 2009 to win control of
a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney, giving it
the world''s biggest brokerage. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman said in November that the firm intends to
buy the remaining stake on target dates established in the
original deal. </p>
<p>Weeding out the worst-performers may help boost the firm''s
revenue per adviser, which climbed to an annualized $742,000 in
the fourth quarter, up 7 percent from a year earlier. Bank of
America''s Merrill Lynch brokerage, its largest competitor, had
$854,000 in revenue per adviser for 2010. </p>
<p>Dow Jones Newswires reported the employee cuts earlier
today. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) bought a
stake in Management Dynamics Inc., a closely held New Jersey
company that makes software to automate international shipments. </p>
<p>We plan to use the funds from Goldman to make a strategic
acquisition to expand our product portfolio and further distance
ourselves from the competition, Management Dynamics Chief
Executive Officer Jim Preuninger said in a statement today from
the East Rutherford-based company. </p>
<p>Management Dynamics didn''t disclose the size of the stake. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
didn''t immediate reply to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Gene Yoon, a managing director at New York-based Goldman
Sachs, will join the board of the company, according to the
statement. Yoon is head of private equity for Goldman Sachs''s
Americas Special Situations Group, according to a biography
published on the Management Dynamics website. </p>
<p>Preuninger worked in sales and marketing for International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) before founding Management Dynamics in
1989, the company''s website says. John Preuninger, president and
chief operating officer and Jim''s twin brother, was a strategy
consultant at Monitor Company before joining Management Dynamics
in 1990, Kathleen Hickey, a spokeswoman, said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs in January changed the way it reports its
financial results, creating a new division called Investing and
Lending. Investments by the special situations group, which buys
distressed debt and equity and makes loans, have been mostly
moved out of the company''s fixed-income, currencies and
commodities division into the new investing and lending segment. </p>
<p>Investing and Lending contributed 19 percent of Goldman
Sachs''s 2010 revenue, making it the second-largest division on
that basis after institutional client services, or sales and
trading, according to Goldman Sachs''s annual 10-K filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>In 2009, Investing and Lending accounted for 6 percent of
the firm''s revenue, the filing showed, and in fiscal 2008 it had
negative revenue of $10.8 billion, making it the only money-
losing division that year. </p>

<p> Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
biggest company by market value, plans to spend $100 million a
day for the next half decade on capital projects such as new oil
wells and natural-gas plants. </p>
<p>Exxon has budgeted $34 billion for capital projects this
year, a 5.6 percent increase from 2010, Chief Executive Officer
Rex Tillerson said today at an analyst meeting in New York. The
budget will range from $33 billion to $37 billion through 2015,
according to a slide presentation prepared for the meeting. </p>
<p>Exxon expects to boost oil and gas production by 3 percent
to 4 percent this year, the company said. Eleven new projects
are scheduled to begin pumping oil or gas between now and 2013. </p>
<p>Exxon is spending more as the company expands its search
for untapped oil and gas fields, and upgrades refining and
chemical plants in Asia to supply the world''s fastest-growing
energy markets. Production rose 13 percent last year, the
largest annual increase since Exxon''s 1999 acquisition of Mobil
Corp.  Oil prices reached a 29-month high this week amid unrest
in the Middle East. </p>
<p>We are executing a large inventory of high-quality
projects, Tillerson said today. Actual spending in a given
year will vary depending on the pace and the progress of each
project. </p>
<p>About 80 percent of production from new wells between now
and 2016 will consist of crude oil, the company said. Exxon''s
exploration prospects range from Madagascar to Greenland to Vietnam. </p>
<p>Outpacing Mexico''s Reserves </p>
<p>The company replaced 209 percent of the oil and gas pumped
from its wells last year, partly through the $34.9 billion
acquisition of Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy Inc. Exxon had
proved reserves equivalent to 24.8 billion barrels at the end of
December, which exceeded the crude reserves of nations such as
Mexico or Algeria. </p>
<p>Exxon shares fell 84 cents to $83.76 at 9:57 a.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>Exxon, which traces its roots to the 1880s and John D.
Rockefeller''s Standard Oil Trust, earned $15.50 in profit on
each barrel of crude it produced in 2010, Tillerson said today
in remarks to a gathering of analysts at the New York Stock
Exchange. </p>
<p>Exxon is awaiting U.S. regulatory approval to drill two
wells at its deep-water Hadrian discovery in the Gulf of Mexico,
the company said. Work on Hadrian was interrupted after the
fatal explosion at BP Plc''s Macondo well in April prompted the
government to halt all exploration drilling in waters deeper
than 500 feet (152 meters). </p>

<p> Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s theme park in
Shanghai will be built in a 7 square-kilometer (2.7 square-mile)
area that the city has designated as a tourist destination,
according to a draft blueprint of the project. </p>
<p>The first phase of the government project covers 3.9 square
kilometers which includes a theme park, hotels, car parks, a
lake and commuter stations, according to the plan, on which the
government is seeking public opinion. The municipality will
extend two subway lines connecting to the site, according to the
blueprint posted on the city government''s website yesterday. </p>
<p>The project''s first phase will cost 24.5 billion yuan ($3.7
billion), Mayor Han Zheng said on March 6. The Disneyland theme
park in Shanghai, the first in mainland China for the Burbank,
California-based company, is expected to attract 7.3 million
visitors a year when it opens in 2015 in the Pudong area, the
city government said in a statement on March 3. </p>
<p>Disney won''t comment until the regulatory approval
process is complete, Alannah Hall-Smith, a Hong Kong-based
spokeswoman for the world''s biggest theme-park company, said in
an e-mailed statement. A person who answered the phone at the
media department of Shanghai''s Urban Planning, Land and
Resources Administration Bureau, who would only give his surname
as Xu, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Water will be a prominent feature of Shanghai Disneyland,
which will feature three theme parks -- Magic Kingdom,
Epcot and Animal Kingdom -- according to the March 3
government statement. Large-scale construction could start
as early as May, it said. </p>
<p>Disney, which won government approval for a theme park in
2009, signed a contract in November with state-owned Shanghai
Shendi Group Co. to build the facility. </p>
<p>Shanghai started building infrastructure for Disney''s first
park on the Chinese mainland last year, Jiang Shujie, deputy
director of the city''s construction and transport commission
said on Jan.7. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
world''s best-paid merger adviser, named Michael Carr and David Dusty'' Philip to run the business in the Americas, succeeding
Timothy Ingrassia. </p>
<p>Ingrassia, 46, will take the title of co-chairman of global
mergers and acquisitions alongside Jack Levy and Gene Sykes, New
York-based Goldman Sachs said yesterday in an internal memo.
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman, confirmed the
contents. </p>
<p>Carr, 52, is returning to a leadership post he held a
decade ago. He joined Goldman Sachs from Salomon Smith Barney
Inc. in 1998 and was tapped to co-head the Americas mergers
business the following year. In 2000, he moved to Hong Kong to
oversee Goldman Sachs'' investment-banking operation in Asia, and
returned to New York in 2003. </p>
<p>Carr recently advised Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Airgas
Inc. (ARG) on its defense against a yearlong, $5.9 billion hostile
pursuit from Air Products  Chemicals Inc. </p>
<p>Philip, a Goldman Sachs employee since 1991, has advised
health-care and industrial companies on mergers, including
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. on its $26 billion sale last
year to Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) In 2006, he
worked with Fisher Scientific International Inc. on its $11
billion sale to Thermo Electron Corp. </p>
<p>Gordon Dyal remains the global head of the mergers
business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs collected $2.06 billion from advisory fees in
2010, the most of any firm. Goldman Sachs trailed Morgan Stanley
in Bloomberg''s ranking of merger advisers by dollar value of
transactions last year, working on $451 billion of deals
compared with Morgan Stanley (MS)''s $472 billion. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
invest as much as $65 million in closely held Management
Dynamics Inc., whose software helps companies automate
international shipments. </p>
<p>The investment by Goldman Sachs''s special situations group
will enable East Rutherford, New Jersey-based Management
Dynamics to pursue an acquisition, Chief Executive Officer Jim Preuninger said yesterday in a phone interview. Goldman Sachs
provided $15 million in equity up front and will supply as much
as $50 million more, depending on the acquisition size, he said. </p>
<p>We have a short list of companies that we''re talking to,
we haven''t finalized a deal right now, Preuninger said. It
would be a software company that had a product or two that we
don''t have but would be very complementary and would fit in well
with our ambition of automating the full order-to-pay life cycle
of a global transaction. </p>
<p>For Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank, the deal
shows that the special situations group continues to make new
investments amid uncertainty over how government implementation
of the so-called Volcker Rule may restrict deals with the firm''s
own capital. David Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial
officer, told analysts in October that the predominant part
of the special situations group is a lending business. </p>
<p>Minority Stake </p>
<p>Preuninger, who founded the company in 1989, said Goldman
Sachs will have a minority stake and declined to specify the
size. He and his twin brother John are the biggest shareholders,
he said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Preuninger wouldn''t disclose Management Dynamics''s
financial information, other than saying that it is profitable. </p>
<p>Even in the shaky economic times that everybody went
through, we had great years in 08, 09 and 2010, he said.
Putting another one on top of that is important to us. I think
we''re well on our way to doing that. </p>
<p>The company is not using Goldman Sachs or any other
investment bank as an adviser on the acquisition, he said. </p>
<p>Preuninger said he was approached by a Goldman Sachs
employee at a conference in San Francisco hosted by investment
bank Thomas Weisel Partners Group Inc. more than a year ago.
Before Goldman, Management Dynamics had equity investments from
venture-capital firms Cross Atlantic Capital Partners and UpData
Partners, he said. </p>
<p>Apple, Wal-Mart </p>
<p>Preuninger previously worked in sales and marketing for International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), according to the software
company''s website. John Preuninger, president and chief
operating officer, was a strategy consultant at Monitor Company
before joining in 1990. </p>
<p>Management Dynamics''s clients include Apple Inc. (AAPL), Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO), Honeywell International Inc. (HON), and Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT), Jim Preuninger said. They use the software in more than 70
countries and trade across 122 nations, he said. </p>
<p>Gene Yoon, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, is joining
Management Dynamics''s board. Yoon is head of private equity for
Goldman Sachs''s Americas special situations group, according to
a biography published on the Management Dynamics website. </p>
<p>The company, which employs about 400 people, has discussed
whether to pursue an initial public offering, Preuninger said.
While the company is big enough to proceed with an IPO, that''s
not the plan, he said. Private equity investors are typically
patient as long as the company makes progress, he said. Goldman
Sachs may be even more patient, he said. </p>
<p>Less Pressure </p>
<p>A lot of times, a private equity investor or venture
capitalist has a lot of the money come from limited partners,
who have provided that capital to them with a time frame in
mind, it might be 10 years, Preuninger said. Goldman''s
capital all comes from Goldman Sachs, so they don''t have the
same kind of pressures to turn over their capital. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs in January changed the way it reports
financial results, creating a division called Investing and
Lending. The special situations group, which buys distressed
debt and equity and makes loans, has moved most of its holdings
out of the firm''s fixed-income, currencies and commodities
division into the new segment. </p>
<p>Investing and Lending contributed 19 percent of Goldman
Sachs''s 2010 revenue, making it the second-largest division on
that basis after institutional client services, or sales and
trading, according to Goldman Sachs''s annual 10-K filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>In 2009, Investing and Lending accounted for 6 percent of
revenue, the filing showed, and in fiscal 2008 it had negative
revenue of $10.8 billion, making it the only money-losing
division that year. </p>

<p>The surge in crop prices that drove
food costs to a record last month may be peaking because global
inventories are now forecast to be more plentiful than
previously expected, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>Corn will be up 1.8 percent a year from now at $6.75 a
bushel, while wheat will be 4.3 percent higher at $7.50 a
bushel, the bank said in a report. Corn surged 82 percent in the
last 12 months and wheat jumped 50 percent as flooding from Canada to Australia and drought in Russia ruined crops. </p>
<p>This stabilization will put a lid on crop prices,
Damien Courvalin, a New York-based analyst at the bank, said in
the report. With the market focus shifting to the likely 2011-
12 supply response, we actually see downside risk to crop prices
in the near term, especially for corn and cotton. </p>
<p>Lower prices would help ease the surge in food costs that
contributed to protests across North Africa and the Middle East
in the past few months, toppling leaders in Egypt and Tunisia.
The acceleration in food inflation has driven 44 million more
people into extreme poverty since June, according to the World
Bank. </p>
<p>Wheat futures fell for a fifth day in Chicago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture unexpectedly raised its stockpile
estimate by 2.3 percent to 181.9 million metric tons. The grain
for May delivery slid 21.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $7.19 a
bushel at 7:14 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, headed for
the biggest weekly drop since December 2008. </p>
<p>Corn Drops </p>
<p>Corn retreated for a sixth session after the USDA increased
its stockpiles estimate by 0.5 percent to 123.1 million tons.
The grain for May delivery lost 19.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to
$6.6325 a bushel. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs doesn''t expect corn and wheat to keep
rallying over the next 12 months, the prices it forecast by then
would still be above the averages over the last five years.
Averages in that period were $4.18 a bushel for corn and $6.16 a
bushel for wheat, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. </p>
<p>The bank let its recommendation to investors to buy the
March 2011 corn contract traded in Chicago expire last week,
Courvalin said. </p>
<p>Price declines may be temporary as inventories are still
critically low and higher prices have yet to curb demand,
Goldman Sachs said. Adverse weather in the Northern Hemisphere
this year also may provide support, according to the report.
Even average weather conditions will not allow for
sufficient building of stockpiles, the bank said. </p>
<p>Soybeans, Cotton </p>
<p>Soybeans are most likely to remain in a supply shortage in
2011-12, and Goldman Sachs kept its recommendation to buy the
oilseed traded in Chicago for November delivery. Consumers
should take advantage of likely lower prices in the coming
months to layer in upside protection, the bank said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also dropped its previous recommendation to
investors to buy the December 2011 cotton contract on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The fiber for May delivery slid 0.7
percent to $1.9955 a pound today, rebounding from a decline of
as much as 2.2 percent. Prices will fall to $1.50 in the next
three months and $1.25 in a year, the bank estimated. </p>
<p>Coffee futures that have lost more than 6 percent in two
sessions in New York also may slide, the report shows. The beans
will fall to $2 a pound in three months and to $1.75 in a year,
Goldman Sachs said. Cocoa, down for four days, will drop to
$2,700 a ton in three months and to $2,400 in a year, the bank
said. </p>
<p>Sugar futures in New York may rise to 30 cents a pound in
three months before falling back to 20 cents, Goldman Sachs
said. Cattle contracts will remain steady at about $1.15 a pound
in the next three months in Chicago and may rise to $1.20 in a
year, while hog futures may gain to $1.05 a pound in the next
six months, according to the report. </p>

<p>A unit of Morgan Stanley (MS), the
sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, and other lenders are being
investigated by the Justice Department for overcharging members
of the military and foreclosing on their homes without court
orders. </p>
<p>The Civil Rights Division has an ongoing investigation
into Saxon mortgage and other lenders as well as authorized
lawsuits against lenders for violations of the Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act, specifically for overcharging and foreclosing
against the homes of Servicemembers without court orders,
Xochitl Hinojosa, a department spokeswoman, said today in an e-
mailed statement. </p>
<p>The investigation was revealed in a court document filed
this week in a lawsuit brought in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by U.S. Army Sergeant James Hurley. He served in
Operation Iraqi Freedom starting in 2004, and lost his home
through an eviction proceeding in 2005 while he was still in
Iraq. </p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley unit, Saxon Mortgage Services Inc., and
a unit of Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) were responding in court papers to an
effort by Hurley''s lawyers to subpoena Saxon''s general counsel
to learn more about a Justice Department probe. </p>
<p>Introducing evidence of the investigation would result in a
monumental waste of time, the companies said in a March 8

preliminary investigation based on unproven allegations, for
which no liability or wrongdoing has been found. </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will stop
introducing new versions of the Zune music and video player
because of tepid demand, letting the company shift its focus to
other devices, according to a person familiar with the decision. </p>
<p>Microsoft will concentrate on putting Zune software onto
mobile phones, such as those running its Windows operating
system, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the decision hasn''t been announced. Zune software lets customers
buy songs and movies, as well as pay a monthly fee to stream
unlimited music. </p>
<p>Zune, introduced in 2006, never managed to break the iPod''s
grip on the music-player industry and became the brunt of late-
night talk-show jokes. Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPod led the market with 77
percent of unit sales last year, while the Zune failed to crack
the top five, according to NPD Group Inc. By adding the Zune
features to the Windows Phone software, Microsoft aims to gain

it''s lost market share to Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, declined to

<p>We have nothing to announce about another Zune device --
but most recently have introduced Zune HD to Canada via the Zune

<p> Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, is reviewing the sale or spin off of business units
that may shrink the company''s revenue by almost half, said Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, would split off four non-
pharmaceutical businesses as well as other units to reduce
annual revenue to $35 billion to $40 billion from $67 billion,
Anderson said in a research report today, citing a meeting with
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read. </p>
<p>Read said on Feb. 1 that he is looking at the company''s
entire portfolio of business units and will complete the review
later this year. That review includes Pfizer''s established
products division with medicines that have lost patent
protection and revenue of about $10 billion, Anderson wrote
today in a note to clients. The company may be remaking itself
as a pharmaceutical pure-play, focused on designing new
drugs, Anderson said. </p>
<p>Pfizer may be destined for a significant shake-up in the
form of shrinking its behemoth $67 billion a year revenue
base, Anderson said. Read appears to want to narrow both the
focus and size of the future Pfizer, presumably with the goal of
achieving sustainable growth off a new base. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 34 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $19.81 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
climbed 13 percent this year. </p>
<p>Pfizer faces generic competition this year to more than
$10.7 billion in annual sales of its Lipitor cholesterol drug,
and the drugmaker doesn''t have enough new medicines to offset
the losses. Read has said he''s seeking buyers for Capsugel, a
unit that makes pill casings, and may consider additional sales.
No decisions have been made, said Joan Campion, a Pfizer
spokeswoman, in a telephone in interview today. </p>
<p>Campion declined to comment on whether anything new was
disclosed to Anderson or whether Pfizer was considering
shrinking the size of the company. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is unveiling new software and services that help customers
market and sell their products, aiming to mine a $70 billion
market opportunity. </p>
<p>The new division, Smarter Commerce, features services such
as using analysis to tailor marketing and brand assessment on
Facebook Inc. or Twitter Inc. in real time, Craig Hayman, a
general manager in the IBM software unit, said in a telephone
interview last week. </p>
<p>Companies seeking the best ways to market and sell to
customers are using more social media and mobile devices, Hayman
said. Hardware, software and services that help companies do
that will be a $70 billion market opportunity this year, he
said. </p>
<p>It gives you a view on your products and services and how
your spend in social media -- whether that''s Facebook or Twitter
or any other social media engine -- is resonating, Hayman
said. </p>
<p>The division will be part of the Armonk, New York-based
company''s Smarter Planet initiative, which uses technology to
monitor anything from cities to hospitals to make them more
efficient. IBM expects the program to be a $10 billion business
in 2015. </p>
<p>The services help companies analyze who views their social
media efforts, by using Web browsing history and other
information to give a picture of customers and how they behave. </p>
<p>Facebook </p>
<p>Say I have a Facebook page. What are the dynamics of the
customers coming into Facebook? How many of them are buying? How
old are they? Hayman said. </p>
<p>IBM worked with one college that was trying to boost its
global presence with social media. After analyzing the campaign
with IBM, they learned people from only two zip codes were
viewing the pages. </p>
<p>Last Mothers'' Day, IBM helped a North American retailer
track who was buying its products and how. A trend popped up: Of
customers buying from a mobile device, most -- and the biggest
spenders -- were using Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. </p>
<p>It shows you iPad users think of their mothers quite a
bit, Hayman said. We also could tell who was thinking of
them late, tracking it hour by hour. </p>
<p>The company is also working with 1-800-Flowers.com Inc. (FLWS),
helping the flower-and-gift retailer track their customers'' use
of the site. The service can show whether they''re looking for
birthday flowers, how often they visit the site and how much
they spend. </p>
<p>We''ll be able to categorize all of our customers into
buckets, Chief Information Officer Steve Bozzo said in a phone
interview last week. We may actually have different promotions
for the good customers. </p>
<p>IBM fell $1.04 to $161.39 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 10 percent
this year. </p>

<p> Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, plans to boost oil and natural-gas output
20 percent by 2017, more than double the rate of growth from
2003 to 2010. </p>
<p>The production forecast is based on $79-a-barrel oil, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a slide presentation
to be delivered to analysts today in New York. Chevron expects
to pump the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude daily in
2017, up from 2.76 million last year. </p>
<p>The company''s production growth will be driven by projects
such as the $37 billion Gorgon development in Australia, which
is scheduled to begin liquefying gas for export in 2014, Chevron
said in the slide presentation. </p>
<p>Chevron expects to surpass Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) in liquefied
natural gas production by 2020 to become the world''s fourth-
largest supplier of the fuel, according to the slides. Only
Qatar, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Algeria''s Sonatrach Group will
have greater LNG output by then, Chevron said. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are marketing $1.4 billion of bonds tied to
commercial property loans as Wall Street ramps up lending. </p>
<p>The issue is tied to 57 mortgages on 111 properties across
the U.S. with the highest concentration in Texas, according to a
person familiar with the offering who declined to be identified
because terms aren''t public. </p>
<p>The transaction will bring 2011 sales of commercial-
mortgage backed securities to about $8 billion, compared with
$11.5 billion in all of 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Turmoil in the Middle East has caused investors in
the debt to pull back and increased the relative yield sellers
have had to pay in the past month, according to a March 11
report from Barclays Capital. </p>
<p>Broader markets have played a key role in this widening,
with the spike in crude oil being the prime mover, said the
New York-based analysts led by Julia Tcherkassova. </p>
<p>Crude oil climbed to a 29-month high of $105.44 a barrel in
New York on March 7 amid fighting in Libya. Protests planned in Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer in the Middle East, also
raised supply concerns. Stocks have fallen as rising fuel costs
threaten the economic recovery, Barclays said. </p>
<p>Top-rated securities backed by skyscraper, hotel and
shopping mall loans are yielding 2.02 percentage points more
than Treasuries, compared with 1.91 percentage points a month
ago, according to a Barclays index. </p>
<p>Vulnerability to Oil </p>
<p>Some property types are more vulnerable to elevated oil
prices if unrest in the Middle East persists, according to
Barclays. The performance of shopping centers and malls is
closely linked to consumer spending, which could fall if rising
fuel prices eat into household budgets, according to Barclays. </p>
<p>Retail properties account for 53 percent of newly issued
commercial-mortgage bonds sold since the market revived in April
of last year, Barclays data show. About 60 percent of the
Goldman Sachs-Citigroup sale is backed by retail buildings. The
largest loan in the pool is a $125.7 million mortgage on the
Arlington Highlands mall in Texas. </p>
<p>Sales of commercial-mortgage bonds may rise to $45 billion
this year, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. They plummeted to
$3.4 billion in 2009 as credit markets seized. The market peaked
with $234 billion in CMBS sales in 2007, Bloomberg data show. </p>

<p>Aleynikov, convicted in December of violating the Economic

Prosecutors cited Aleynikov''s alleged history of violating

<p>     March 14 (Bloomberg) - International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has hit its longest stretch without an acquisition in
almost eight years, even as the company holds about $11 billion
in cash on its balance sheet. </p>
<p>The company, which has made more than 100 deals in the past
decade, last announced a purchase on Oct. 21, more than four
months ago. That''s the longest period since May 2003, when an
acquisition ended a five-month drought, according to Bloomberg
data. If it lasts another 15 days, the dry spell would be the
longest since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer. </p>
<p>Palmisano has made more than $25 billion purchases in his
nine years at the helm, steering the company toward software and
services. IBM could have a flurry of deals next quarter after a
surplus of purchases at the end of the year delayed deal-making,
said Jeff Bistrong, managing director at investment bank Harris
Williams  Co. in Boston. </p>
<p>IBM is sitting on a lot of capital, said Bistrong, who
has sold companies to IBM. They''re very interested in
acquisitions. They have to put the capital to work. </p>
<p>Ed Barbini, a spokesman for the company, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 41 cents to $162.43 on
March 11 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares had climbed 11 percent this year before today. </p>
<p>The company, the world''s biggest computer-services
provider, announced nine deals in the second half of last year,
including the $1.7 billion purchase of storage-maker Netezza
Corp., the company''s largest deal since 2007. </p>
<p>The last six months of 2010 were active for the technology
industry, with Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) snapping up 3Par Inc. and Dell Inc. (DELL) buying Compellent Technologies Inc. That''s made for a
quiet first quarter for acquisitions, Bistrong said. </p>
<p>$20 Billion in Acquisitions </p>
<p>IBM has one of the most systematic approaches to deal-
making in the industry, said Chris Whitmore, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG. The company has an internal MA team, led by
former Morgan Stanley investment banker Eli Mendoza, and a
standing committee for vetting deals that includes executives
such as the head of research. </p>
<p>IBM has even broken down -- to the penny -- how much
acquisitions should contribute to earnings per share by 2015: 90
cents out of the overall goal of at least $20 per share in
operating earnings by that time. </p>
<p>It''s been a key contributor to the success of the
business, said the San Francisco-based Whitmore, who has a
buy rating on the stock and a price target of $200, the
highest of any analyst tracked by Bloomberg. I don''t know
who does a better job of buying and integrating software
companies than IBM. </p>
<p>IBM Deals </p>
<p>IBM, which ended last year with $10.7 billion in cash and
about $1 billion in short-term investments, has said it plans to
spend about $20 billion on acquisitions through 2015. The
company is ahead of the target pace for adding 90 cents in
profit, after $6 billion in acquisitions last year, Chief
Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said at the company''s investor
briefing last week. </p>
<p>We indeed are ahead of the game, and I think we have
upside here, Loughridge said. </p>
<p>Over the last decade, IBM has used acquisitions as part of
its strategy to transition away from hardware and toward more
profitable software and services. Its two largest purchases were
for Cognos Inc., a maker of business-management software, in
2008 and PwC Consulting, a provider of business and technology
consulting services, in 2002. Services now make up more than
half of total revenue, and software will be about half of total
profit by 2015. </p>
<p>MA Timing </p>
<p>Palmisano is now investing in analytics software, which
helps companies predict trends, and cloud-computing, which lets
clients store and access data on servers other than their own.
The two businesses should grow to be $16 billion and $7 billion
in sales, respectively. He''s also spending on Smarter Planet,
the company''s concept that any infrastructure -- from highways
to utility grids -- can be digitally monitored and made more
efficient. </p>
<p>IBM is extremely focused on those target areas and deals
virtually always happen within them, said Whitmore. </p>
<p>There may be many reasons for IBM''s acquisition slowdown,
from the number of deals last quarter to an inability to find
anything to buy at the right price, said David Grossman, an
analyst with Stifel Nicolaus  Co.. </p>
<p>MA is a timing thing, said San Francisco-based
analyst. They just think opportunistically. </p>
<p>IBM only buys companies for intellectual property that the
company can scale to its more than 170 countries and quickly
make a return on investment, Loughridge said at the meeting.
That approach has helped IBM spend about $28 billion on deals,
compared with more than $43 billion each for HP and Oracle Corp. (ORCL)
in the last nine years. The company''s largest deal was Cognos
for $5 billion. </p>
<p>I''m really focused on getting him his money back,
Loughridge said of Palmisano at the meeting. Because when I
don''t give him his money back, I''m going to have a very bad
day. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it''s trying to sell
Litton Loan Servicing LP, the Houston-based mortgage-servicing
unit it acquired more than three years ago. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is exploring strategic options for Litton
Loan Servicing, which include a possible sale, Michael DuVally, a spokesman in New York, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The company bought Litton in December 2007 as investors
including billionaire Wilbur Ross and Centerbridge Capital
Partners LLC purchased mortgage servicers to help them better
understand the market and profit from buying discounted loans.
Goldman Sachs is selling after failing to find enough
opportunities to buy distressed mortgage loans, said a person
familiar with the situation. </p>
<p>The unit is cooperating with investigations by the attorneys general from 50 states of the mortgage industry''s
foreclosure practices, which began after they discovered some
firms used faulty or falsified paperwork to seize homes. </p>
<p>The inquiries may result in the imposition of fines or
other regulatory action, Goldman Sachs said March 1 in its
annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Since Goldman Sachs bought Litton, the value of the
company''s mortgage-servicing rights has also evaporated. By the
end of 2009, Goldman Sachs''s estimate for the fair value of the
rights had dropped to $88 million from $283 million at the end
of February 2008, according to regulatory filings. In the latest
filing, the firm disclosed that as of Dec. 31, 2010, their value
was not material. </p>
<p>Radian, C-Bass </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs never disclosed how much it paid to acquire
Litton, which added about 1,000 employees to the company''s
staff. Goldman bought Litton from Credit-Based Asset Servicing
and Securitization LLC, known as C-Bass. Radian Group Inc. (RDN), a
part owner of C-Bass, disclosed a month before the sale was
completed that the unit would be sold for about $467.9 million
to an unnamed buyer. </p>
<p>Before buying Litton, Goldman Sachs had tried to avoid
businesses that involved the mass-market or retail customer.
David Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial officer, told
analysts in September 2006, more than a year before the company
bought Litton, that Goldman Sachs was reluctant to buy a lender
because of the retail concern. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is largely an institutional business,
Viniar said at the time. There are different risks when you''re
touching the retail customer. </p>
<p>The New York Times reported Goldman Sachs''s plan to sell
Litton earlier today. The Financial Times reported in December
that Goldman Sachs was considering a sale of Litton and that
talks with one potential buyer had fallen apart over price. </p>

<p> Rajat Gupta, while a member of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s board in 2008, told Raj Rajaratnam of
talks on whether to buy American International Group Inc. (AIG) or
Wachovia Corp., according to a wiretap recording. </p>
<p>Prosecutors at the insider-trading trial of Rajaratnam, the
co-founder of the Galleon Group LLC hedge fund, played the
recording of a July 2008 discussion between the men, one of
about 170 wiretaps the government said it will present to jurors
in Manhattan federal court. During the conversation, Rajaratnam
asked about a rumor that Goldman may look to buy a commercial
bank. </p>
<p>Yeah, this is being discussed at the board meeting,
Gupta replied, adding that it was a divided discussion.
Among the institutions the Goldman Sachs board discussed were Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia, now part of Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), and New York-based insurer AIG, according to the
transcript. </p>
<p>Prosecutors previously said that Gupta, who isn''t charged
with criminal wrongdoing, tipped Rajaratnam about Goldman
Sachs''s transactions, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc.''s 2008
investment in the bank. Today''s recording was the first tape
played in which Gupta was a participant in the conversation. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam is the central figure in the largest crackdown
on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The Sri Lankan-
born money manager is accused of making $45 million from
confidential information leaked by corporate insiders and hedge
fund traders. The Galleon Group case has led to a nationwide
investigation implicating banks, consultants, technology
companies and other hedge funds. </p>
<p>Planned to Invest </p>
<p>Former McKinsey  Co partner Anil Kumar, a government
witness, today described for the jury Rajaratnam''s relationship
with Gupta. Before prosecutors played the tape, Kumar said Gupta
invested or planned to invest in several Galleon Group funds. </p>
<p>In the taped conversation, Gupta takes Rajaratnam through a
portion of a recent Goldman Sachs board meeting. </p>
<p>The view was very bearish on the commercial bank, Gupta
told Rajaratnam, according to the recording. I would be
extremely surprised if there was anything imminent. Goldman
never purchased either one of the companies. </p>
<p>On the recording, Gupta said some Goldman Sachs board
members believed commercial banking was a low-return
business, while others said such a bank was a low-cost
source of funding. No evidence was presented that Rajaratnam
traded on Gupta''s disclosure about the board''s discussions. </p>
<p>AIG, Wachovia </p>
<p> Ed Canaday, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, and Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman
for Wells Fargo, declined to comment. Anne Granfield, a
spokeswoman for Gupta, didn''t return calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam''s defense attorney, John Dowd, began cross-
examining Kumar shortly after the tape was played. The lawyer''s
initial focus was on Kumar''s alleged refusal to tell the Internal Revenue Service whether he holds offshore accounts. </p>
<p>Kumar has pleaded guilty in the Galleon case and is
testifying for prosecutors in exchange for leniency. </p>
<p>The recording, which includes Rajaratnam complaining about
Kumar, was played for jurors as Kumar sat on the witness stand.
The former McKinsey partner had just testified that he decided
in 2006 not to join Gupta and Rajaratnam in a private-equity
fund called New Silk Route. Yesterday, Kumar testified that
Rajaratnam paid him $2.6 million for inside information on
McKinsey clients including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), the
second-largest maker of processors for personal computers. </p>
<p>Mini-Rajat'' </p>
<p>Kumar wants to be a mini-Rajat without bringing
anything to the party, Rajaratnam told Gupta on the recording.
Rajaratnam said on the tape that he had been paying Kumar $1
million annually for years -- after-taxes, offshore, cash --
in return for little or nothing. </p>
<p>Keep your eyes and ears open, Rajaratnam told Gupta.
If you hear anything, just anything you think may be
interesting -- which I will track down and see what''s in the
market -- I''ll bring that angle to you. </p>
<p>Prosecutors also had Kumar testify about the links between
Rajaratnam and Gupta. In addition to co-founding and investing
in New Silk Route, Rajaratnam wanted Gupta to be chairman of an
investment fund called Galleon International, Kumar alleged. </p>
<p>What he does is, he gives bit of cachet in South Asia,
Rajaratnam told Kumar on May 28, 2008, according to another
recording played by prosecutors. On the tape, Kumar said the 10
percent ownership stake Rajaratnam offered in Galleon
International was reasonable, even if Gupta wanted 15
percent. </p>
<p>Complained About Gupta </p>
<p>Gupta also owned a 20 percent stake in Galleon''s Crossover
Fund, which invested in small businesses, and he had lost
millions of dollars in Galleon''s Voyager Fund, Kumar testified.
Kumar said that, in October 2009, Rajaratnam complained to him
about Gupta. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam told me Mr. Gupta had confronted him and said
he, Mr. Rajaratnam, should have paid more attention to what was
happening with Voyager, Kumar testified. </p>
<p>Kumar said that days before his and Rajaratnam''s October
19, 2009, arrest, the two men and their wives traveled to
Trinidad for a wedding and returned to New York through Miami.
While in Florida, Rajaratnam took a call on his mobile phone and
returned to tell Kumar that he''d been told that an ex-employee,
Ali Far, is now wearing a wire, Kumar said. </p>
<p>Really Disappointed'' </p>
<p>I''m really disappointed in him, Rajaratnam said,
according to Kumar. He said, You should be careful, you
should be using pre-paid phones when you''re calling me.'' </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Kumar testified that he tried to
protect a McKinsey employee he described as his protege,
David Palecek, from being lured into Rajaratnam''s insider-
trading scheme. </p>
<p>I did not want the Galleon Group to suck him into the
mistakes I was making, Kumar testified. </p>
<p>Yesterday, prosecutors played a tape in which Rajaratnam''s
brother, Rengan, said that Palecek might be willing to play
ball with Galleon. Palecek died last year. </p>
<p>Catherine Redlich, a lawyer for Palecek''s wife, said
yesterday that Palecek never agreed to assist Galleon. </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) had more
Japanese holdings than any U.S. lender and Citigroup Inc. (C)
counted Japan''s government among its biggest debtors before last
week''s earthquake struck, according to KBW Inc. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, has
total cross-border outstandings of $53.9 billion and $64
billion in commitments, according to David Konrad, an analyst
for New York-based KBW, an investment bank that specializes in
financial companies. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had $33.6 billion,
Morgan Stanley held $19.1 billion and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) had
$17 billion, Konrad wrote in a note dated yesterday. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. has $39.2 billion in Japanese loans,
securities and trading assets and the government is the New
York-based bank''s third-largest credit position, according to
Konrad. Japanese policy makers are struggling to contain
investor fears amid nuclear radiation leaks at power plants
triggered by last week''s earthquake and tsunami. </p>
<p>We don''t expect a material credit event, Konrad wrote
in the report. However, we believe that volatility in the
markets may cause volatility in the trading results. </p>
<p>Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, is the only U.S.
lender with a meaningful retail banking presence in Japan,
Konrad said. The company''s Asian regional consumer banking unit
made a $2.17 billion profit in 2010. </p>
<p>Pumping Cash </p>
<p>The Bank of Japan (8301) has pledged to pump more cash into the
financial system after injecting $183 billion yesterday. The
Topix index of stocks suffered its worst two-day drop since the
1987 crash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The KBW Bank Index, which tracks 23 of the biggest U.S.
lenders, dropped 1.55 percent as of 10:50 a.m. in New York, with
New York-based JPMorgan down 2.3 percent, Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America slipping 2 percent and Citigroup
off 1.8 percent. Morgan Stanley fell 2 percent and Goldman Sachs
declined 1.2 percent. Both are based in New York. </p>
<p>KBW''s data on cross-border positions includes loans and
derivatives and doesn''t account for hedges, the analyst wrote.
The category includes holdings such as loans to banks,
investment in local franchises and public-sector loans,
according to Citigroup''s annual report to securities regulators. </p>
<p>Bank of America''s holdings equal 0.75 percent of total
assets, according to Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman at Bank of
America, the biggest U.S. lender. So I would describe our
exposure as small relative to our total assets, he said. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, and Stephen Cohen at New York-based Goldman Sachs
didn''t immediately comment. Shannon Bell, a Citigroup
spokeswoman, and Morgan Stanley (MS)''s Mark Lake declined to comment. </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) are among global banks allowing employees to
work from home or leave the office early as Japan''s strongest
earthquake disrupts public transport in Tokyo. </p>
<p>JPMorgan employees in Japan are being allowed to work from
home, or take vacation if their managers approve, said
spokeswoman Sachiko Hasegawa in an interview. Credit Suisse is
allowing employees to leave work early, according to Isamu Kajino, a spokesman for the Swiss bank. </p>
<p>The banks, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), said they have no plans to move operations out of
Japan, even after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned the risk of
radiation leaks at an earthquake-damage nuclear plant north of Tokyo is rising. </p>
<p>Our business is as usual, JPMorgan''s Hasegawa said. </p>
<p>The German Embassy in Tokyo has said it recommended its
citizens in Japan consider leaving the country following last
week''s earthquake and explosions at Tokyo Electric Power Co.''s
nuclear power plant in Fukushima. About 100 Germans live in the
Tohoku area, where a magnitude 9 quake struck March 11, while
2,600 people are in Tokyo and 900 in the Kanagawa area,
according to Mari Shindo, a spokeswoman at the embassy. </p>
<p>The power plant, where four of six reactors have been
damaged by explosions, is 135 miles (220 kilometers) north of
Tokyo. The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami rose to
2,478 at 2 p.m., according to the National Police Agency in
Tokyo. </p>
<p>Business as Usual </p>
<p>UBS AG, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America were among 
other financial companies that said their operations in Japan
aren''t being affected by the disaster. </p>
<p>Our goal is to remain open as long as the markets remain
open, and to operate as normally as possible under challenging
circumstances, said Mika Watanabe, a spokeswoman for New York-
based Morgan Stanley, in an interview. </p>
<p>CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, the Asian securities affiliate
of France''s Credit Agricole SA, has non-essential Japan-based
staff working from home, said spokeswoman Simone Wheeler. The
firm''s business, including broking and trading, is operating as
normal, she said. </p>
<p> Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)''s 174 retail brokerage branches are
doing business as usual, and employees are allowed to take
holidays if needed, according to spokeswoman Keiko Sugai. </p>
<p>We don''t see any employees moving out of Japan except
people who were scheduled to take a holiday, said Natsumi Akita, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. The U.K. lender has no plans to move operations out
of Japan, she said. </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) released a speedier
version of its Internet Explorer browser that adds privacy
controls and video features, a bid to regain market share lost
to Firefox and Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Chrome. </p>
<p>Internet Explorer 9 relies on HTML5, the latest version of
the language that presents Web content, which lets sites handle
more multimedia content. The browser''s designed to run
applications within the browser more quickly, while adding more
powerful privacy options than Google offers. It''s available for
download today, the Redmond, Washington-based company said. </p>
<p>Microsoft is trying to accommodate rising demand for
software that runs online rather than on the Windows operating
system. The sluggish performance of Microsoft''s last browser
made it harder to use Internet apps and pushed customers toward
rival products, said David Smith, an analyst at Stamford,
Connecticut-based Gartner Inc. </p>
<p>The vast, overwhelming majority of new apps that are
developed today are developed to run in browsers -- they are not
native Windows applications, Smith said. Any vendor has to
have a very competitive offering there. </p>
<p>While Internet Explorer remains the leading browser, its
dominance has ebbed over the past two years. It had 57 percent
share in February, down from 62 percent a year earlier,
according to Net Applications, which tracks Internet usage
statistics. Mozilla''s Firefox had 22 percent, and Google''s
Chrome had 11 percent. Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s Safari ranked fourth, with
6.4 percent. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 1 cent to $25.69 yesterday on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The shares have fallen 8 percent this year. </p>
<p>Adobe''s Flash </p>
<p>By supporting the HTML5 technology for playing video, the
browser deals a fresh blow to Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE)''s Flash -- the
most popular software for watching clips on the Internet. Apple
has limited the use of Flash on its iPhone and iPad, endorsing
HTML5 instead, after Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs said
Flash was too slow to run on mobile devices. </p>
<p>The new privacy features, meanwhile, put pressure on Google
to respond, Smith said. Microsoft has added the ability for
users to create Do Not Call-style lists that bar listed
websites from tracking what users do on the Web. </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has called for do-not-
track options in browsers, Smith said. Firefox also has
developed such a feature. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended investors buy put options in Vale SA (VALE3), the world''s
largest iron-ore producer, to protect against a short-term drop
in the commodity''s price. </p>
<p>Derivatives strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall recommend buying May $30 puts and selling Jan 2012 $25
puts. The New York-based company, which in January advised
hedging near-term risks by buying April $35 puts and selling
January $25 puts, is now saying to roll the April $35 puts.
Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, fell 2.7 percent to $31.04 today. </p>
<p>Iron ore prices and volumes could be negatively impacted
due to the earthquake in Japan, Fogertey and Marshall said in
the note. While our analyst is bullish on Vale on the longer
term, we continue to see three near-term risks which could cause
volatility and pull back the stock. </p>
<p>Vale dropped 16 percent from its 31-month high on Jan. 18. Brazil''s Bovespa fell 6.9 percent in that period. Japan
accounted for 10 percent of Vale''s iron ore exports, the note
said, compared with 12 percent for Brazil. </p>
<p>Mining Royalty Taxes </p>
<p>The company may also owe Brazilian states almost 5 billion
reais ($3 billion) on royalties through 2010, Mining Minister
Edison Lobao said March 14 in Brasilia. Mining royalty taxes to
the government may increase to about 4 percent from 2 percent,
which could hurt the stock price, according to the strategists,
who cited a Goldman Sachs analyst. </p>
<p>Vale Chief Executive Officer Roger Agnelli''s term will
expire this year and the prospect of a new leader may increase
volatility in the next two months, according to the note.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff may push major Vale
shareholders to name Antonio Maciel Neto of Suzano Papel e
Celulose SA, Latin America''s second-biggest pulp exporter, to
replace Agnelli, newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported on
March 14, without saying where it got the information. </p>
<p>Vale Chairman Ricardo Flores signaled Agnelli may stay,
saying there will be no change in the company''s command,
Brazil Economico reported on Jan. 3. Flores is president of the
pension fund that''s Vale''s biggest shareholder. </p>
<p>Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said a U.S. proposal to exempt
certain mortgages from rules governing securitized loans may
unintentionally help the biggest banks. </p>
<p>A law requiring lenders to keep 5 percent of the loans they
securitize on their balance sheets could be a positive for the
larger players such as JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) because
it exempts few mortgages, Citigroup Inc. (C) analysts said in a
March 3 research note summarizing a meeting with Dimon. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act lets regulators exempt some mortgages
from securitization rules designed to discourage risky lending.
Six agencies drafting the rules, including the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and Office of Comptroller of the Currency,
agreed to exempt loans in which borrowers make down-payments of
at least 20 percent, according to U.S. officials who requested
anonymity because the negotiations aren''t yet public. </p>
<p>That means lenders could securitize those loans without
keeping part of the debt on their books. It would help bigger
lenders such as New York-based JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, because they have the scale to hold the
5 percent of non-qualifying mortgages on their balance sheet,
said Citigroup analysts Keith Horowitz, Craig Singer and Steve
Foundos, citing Dimon. </p>
<p>Last year, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo urged regulators
to exempt only mortgages with down-payments of 30 percent or
more. </p>
<p>Smaller lenders and housing activists say exempting only
high-down-payment loans would raise borrower costs, shut out
smaller originators and cement the positions of big banks that
can afford to keep 5 percent of non-exempt loans on their books. </p>
<p>In response to those concerns, regulators are considering
whether to include an option that would exempt loans with down-
payments of at least 10 percent if they are backed by private mortgage insurance, which protects lenders from default, said
one government official with knowledge of the discussions. </p>

its website. </p>
<p>Operating profit and net profit guidance for 2011 are
bullish good news, Fabrizio Croce, a Zurich-based analyst with
Kepler Capital Markets and who has a hold recommendation on
the stock, said by phone. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto is trying to
expand in emerging markets and eastern Europe to boost profit
following the global financial crisis. The Trieste, Italy-based
company said today its fourth-quarter profit fell 6 percent,
hurt by a higher tax rate. </p>
<p>In the life sector the group expects to confirm the
ambitious production levels of 2010, Generali said in a
statement. In the non-life business area, the group expects to
confirm the premium growth rates of 2010. </p>
<p>Profit Drop </p>
<p>Net income in the fourth quarter declined to 389 million
euros ($543 million) from 414 million euros a year earlier,
missing the 416 million-euro average estimate of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Generali will propose a dividend of 45
cents a share from 35 cents. </p>
<p>The insurer''s tax rate last year increased to 33.2 percent
from 24.9 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Generali fell 2.9 percent to 14.54 euros in Milan, giving
the company a market value of 22.6 billion euros. </p>
<p>Generali''s operating profit in the fourth quarter rose 19
percent to 944 million euros. Non-life operating income gained
18 percent to 246 million euros, while the operating profit in
the life segment climbed 20 percent to 731 million euros. </p>
<p>Full-year profit rose 30 percent to 1.7 billion euros,
while operating income increased 12 percent to 4.1 billion
euros. The combined ratio, or spending on claims and costs as a
percentage of premiums, increased to 98.8 from 98.3 in 2009,
signaling that the company''s insurance underwriting is less
profitable. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
buy Benchmark Asset Management Co., India''s largest provider of
index-tracking funds, stepping up an expansion in Asia''s third-
biggest economy. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which set up its own mutual fund unit in
India in 2008, didn''t oversee any assets in India as of the end
of last year, according to data from the Association of Mutual
Funds of India, an industry body. The transaction is expected to
be completed later in the year, subject to regulatory approvals,
Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. It did not disclose the
terms of the transaction. </p>
<p>The purchase gives New York-based Goldman Sachs access to a
market where assets managed by mutual funds more than tripled to
6.8 trillion rupees ($150 billion) in the five years to Dec. 31,
according to the industry body. </p>
<p>It''s curious that Goldman is buying Benchmark because
they don''t have an ETF business anywhere in the world, said
Dhirendra Kumar, New Delhi-based managing director at Value
Research, a firm that tracks funds. I think this purchase is
more a statement of their commitment to India. </p>
<p>Benchmark Asset Management oversaw 29.35 billion rupees in
assets as of Dec. 31. The company last year began selling an
exchange-traded fund linked to Hong Kong''s benchmark Hang Seng
Index, the first overseas-backed ETF in India. </p>
<p>It''s a good deal for Benchmark, which have been pioneers
in the ETF business in India, said Kumar. They have been
facing a lot of competition from rivals like Kotak Mutual Fund
and Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund getting into the ETF fray. </p>
<p>Becoming Popular </p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to buy or sell
shares of entire portfolios of stocks in a single security, have
become popular worldwide since their creation in 1993 as they
widen investors'' access to different types of assets. ETFs,
which mimic the performance of an index and trade like
securities, are cheaper than mutual funds. </p>
<p>India''s benchmark Sensitive Index has dropped 11 percent
this year, the third-worst performance among 90 global
benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg, after gaining 17 percent last
year and 81 percent in 2009. </p>
<p>Mutual-fund assets in India have dropped 19 percent since
peaking in November 2009, three months after the country banned
firms from charging investors an upfront fee when they bought
fund units, according to the industry association. The ban
caused distributors, which previously shared the fee with the
manager, to reduce marketing of funds. </p>
<p>India is one of the world''s largest growth markets and a
strategic priority for our firm, Oliver Bolitho, head of
Goldman Sachs Asset Management in Asia said in the statement.
The acquisition illustrates our commitment to expand in
India. Goldman Sachs also will start actively managed on-shore
funds in the country, he said. </p>
<p>T. Rowe Price Group Inc. bought a 26 percent stake in UTI
Asset Management Co., India''s oldest money manager, in November
2009, in a deal that valued UTI at 3.3 percent of its money
under management. The financing unit of Larsen  Toubro Ltd.,
India''s largest engineering company, in September 2009 acquired
DBS Cholamandalam Asset Management for 450 million rupees, or
1.6 percent of the target''s managed assets. </p>

<p>Japanese stocks may gain even as
the nation battles to rebuild and prevent a potential nuclear
meltdown following its strongest earthquake on record, as global
economic growth drives export demand, strategists said. </p>
<p>The economic effects of the magnitude 9 temblor on March 11
and the subsequent tsunami are likely to be temporary, and
shares may gain in the medium term, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Equities are trading below their fair
value, according to Morgan Stanley. Stocks may advance by the
end of March as the global economy recovers, UBS AG (UBSN) said. </p>
<p> Japan''s Topix Index plunged as much as 14 percent
yesterday, the third-worst daily slump in history, following
damage to a nuclear plant following the quake and tsunami that
destroyed towns north of Tokyo. Thousands have been killed and
millions left without electricity or water. The Nikkei rebounded
6.6 percent today, its biggest one-day gain since Oct. 2008. </p>
<p>Share prices have fallen sharply as they factor in
adverse impacts from the natural disaster and nuclear reactor
incidents, UBS strategists led by Shoji Hirakawa said in a
report dated yesterday. We believe there could be investment
opportunities for sectors and stocks where valuations are
appealing. </p>
<p>Pumping Cash </p>
<p> Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa pledged on March
14 to keep pumping cash into the economy as needed after
unleashing a record 15 trillion yen ($183 billion) in one-day
operations. The measures should help stop the yen''s
appreciation, which will lead to a rebound in share prices
through the end of the month, Hirakawa said. </p>
<p>Japan''s stock market is likely to advance as the U.S. and
global economies continue to grow, deflation dissipates in Japan
and company profits rise in fiscal 2012 amid reasonable
valuations, Goldman strategist Kathy Matsui wrote in a report
yesterday. </p>
<p>Japanese stocks entered what some investors consider a bear
market yesterday, with the Topix extending its drop since April
15, 2010, to more than 20 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gauge yesterday traded at 0.91 times the value of
net assets for its companies, the lowest level since March 2009.
It rose to 0.97 today. </p>
<p>28-Month Low </p>
<p>The Topix closed at 817.63 today in Tokyo amid speculation
that the selloff that drove valuations to a 28-month low was
excessive. </p>
<p>Goldman left its 12-month target for the Topix Index
unchanged at 1,050, while the bulk of the gains are likely to be
in the latter half of the year, as overseas investors may resume
buying shares, and the potential negative impact on fiscal year
2011 profit growth for companies listed on the first section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange is likely to be a decline on 10
percent, rather than a possible 20 percent drop, Matsui said. </p>
<p>We believe the current uncertainty will result in a near-
term pause in foreign buying, wrote Matsui. The market still
has scope for upside over the medium-term. </p>
<p>The Topix lost more than $680 billion in market value in
the past three days. The gauge''s relative strength index, a
measure of price momentum, dropped to as low as 16.54 yesterday,
before advancing to 31.50 today. Some traders use a reading
below 30 as an indicator to buy. </p>
<p>Rolling Blackouts </p>
<p>Tokyo Electric Power Co., also known as Tepco, began
rolling blackouts that will continue until the end of April to
conserve electricity in the Kanto region on concerns of a supply
shortfall. The utility is also battling to prevent a nuclear
catastrophe at its earthquake-damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant,
and said today that fuel rods at two reactors may have been
damaged. </p>
<p>Stocks may stop falling once Tepco returns power usage back
to normal and the government formulates an appropriate policy
response, both likely to be addressed by the end of April, Bank
of America-Merrill Lynch strategists including Masatoshi Kikuchi
said in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>As so many market players reside in the Tokyo area, the
morning and evening severe commuter congestion caused by the
power shortage has come to symbolize the overall economic damage
and has exacerbated the sense of unease, wrote Kikuchi. We
expect the rolling power cuts to end during April, once Tepco''s
thermal power stations return to normal operations. </p>
<p> Morgan Stanley (MS) strategists led by Alexander Kinmont said
while sentiment may weaken in the near term, there is no need
for a knee-jerk response, as earnings for Japanese companies are
more dependent on global growth rather than events in Japan. The
Topix is trading about 20 percent below its fair value of
1,100, Kinmont said. </p>
<p>The effects of the earthquake are ultimately likely to be
less significant than the swing in other variables that affect
earnings -- most notably, global demand growth, wrote Kinmont.
In addition to the obvious moral considerations, we believe
that investors are poorly advised to trade on events,
especially ones such as Friday''s devastating earthquake. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said board
member H. Lee Scott, who helped review the bank''s business
practices when the firm was sued by U.S. regulators, will quit
after one year because of other commitments. </p>
<p>Scott, 62, a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) chief executive
officer, was elected to the board at the annual shareholder
meeting in May. He won''t seek re-election at this year''s
meeting, the firm said today in a statement. Goldman Sachs, the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking a replacement,
said a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Lee made an important contribution to our board and the
firm during a challenging period, Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman
Sachs''s chairman and CEO, said in the statement. I am
particularly grateful for the enormous time and effort he
committed to the board''s efforts related to the business
standards committee. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs announced at last year''s annual meeting that
it would review business standards in the wake of a fraud
lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The firm paid $550 million to settle the suit in July and in
January released a report with 39 recommendations for improving
its practices. </p>
<p>Scott was nominated to the board on March 19 last year, the
same day the firm said Rajat K. Gupta, who had joined the board
in 2006, wouldn''t stand for re-election. A month later, the Wall
Street Journal reported U.S. prosecutors were investigating
whether Gupta had passed confidential information about Goldman
Sachs to Galleon Group hedge-fund founder Raj Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the SEC sued Gupta. Gary Naftalis, an
attorney for Gupta, has called the SEC''s allegations totally
baseless. </p>
<p>In November, 2009, Scott became an operating partner and
investment committee member at Solamere Capital, a Lexington,
Massachusetts-based private-equity firm whose managing partners
include Tagg Romney, a son of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hid from
the South Korean Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. that it had bet
against the viability of a collateralized debt obligation the
bank sold as safe, according to a lawsuit filed in New York. </p>
<p>The insurer seeks more than $47.3 million in damages from
the New York-based banking firm according to its 56-page
complaint accusing Goldman Sachs of fraud and negligent
misrepresentation. </p>
<p>Goldman had utilized its specialized knowledge of the

said in its complaint. </p>
<p>The complaint focuses on the bank''s Timberwolf I CDO Ltd.,

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) investors are pushing
for a spinoff of the drugmaker''s nutrition business that would
command a price tag of $6.8 billion and deliver more than twice
the gains of the U.S. stock market. </p>
<p>Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN), the baby-formula maker that
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) took public in February 2009, now
trades at 23.1 times adjusted earnings, more than twice the
valuation of its former parent or Pfizer, after a 133 percent
surge through yesterday that beat the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index''s 52 percent rise, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Applying Mead Johnson''s profit margins and valuations
to Pfizer''s own nutrition unit, which had $1.87 billion in sales
last year, would give it a market value of $6.8 billion. </p>
<p>While Bristol-Myers outperformed U.S. drugmakers by 20
percentage points since announcing plans for Mead Johnson''s
initial public offering in April 2008, Pfizer fell in the same
period and has the third-lowest price-to-earnings valuation of
SP 500 pharmaceutical companies, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Investors are pressing Pfizer''s Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read to slim down the company and focus on new drugs as it
faces the loss of exclusivity for its Lipitor cholesterol pill. </p>
<p>Who wouldn''t want a repeat of Mead Johnson? said Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at Miller Tabak  Co.,
which owns Pfizer shares. Investors and shareholders are
pushing for value-creating strategies. </p>
<h2>Today''s Trading </h2>
<p>Pfizer shares climbed 58 cents, or 3 percent, to $19.88 on
the New York Stock Exchange today. The gain was the largest
among the 52 companies in the SP 500 Health Care Index and the
second-biggest in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. </p>
<p>Bristol-Myers advanced 46 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $25.43,
while Mead Johnson fell 45 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $55.36. </p>
<p>Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer, said
the company is conducting a strategic review of each of its
units. No decision has been made about the future of the
nutritional business, she said. The unit was acquired by the
world''s largest drugmaker in the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
in 2009. </p>
<p>Pfizer and Mead Johnson both make infant formula and
nutrition drinks for children and expecting mothers as
burgeoning middle classes in emerging markets drive demand.
Overall sales of baby food in Asia, Latin America and Eastern
Europe more than doubled from 2005 to 2010, according to
Euromonitor, a London-based research firm. </p>
<p>Mead Johnson, which analysts project will post a 20 percent
increase in net profit this year, has a market capitalization of
$11.4 billion. Its 133 percent rally from Feb. 10, 2009, through
yesterday outstripped the 33 percent advance in the SP 500''s
gauge of 41 companies that sell consumer staples from foods to
household products, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Positive Development'' </h2>
<p>The spinoff was a positive development for the company,
Chris Perille, a spokesman for Glenview, Illinois-based Mead
Johnson, said in a telephone interview. We have been better
able to invest for growth in our business than would have been
possible as part of a larger pharmaceutical company. </p>
<p>The maker of the Enfamil infant formula turned every dollar
of sales into 14.4 cents of profit last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Applying Mead Johnson''s profit margin and
share price valuation of 25.2 times net income to the $1.87
billion of revenue posted last year by Pfizer''s nutritional unit
would produce a market value of $6.8 billion, the data show. </p>
<p>Mead Johnson offers a guide for the valuation that Pfizer''s
unit may command because they offer similar products and compete
in many of the same markets, according to Linda Bannister, an
analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres, Missouri. </p>
<h2>Emerging Markets </h2>
<p>Selling the nutrition business would be a change of
strategy for Pfizer. The company diversified by buying Wyeth to
add biologic drugs, consumer and animal health products and baby
formula. It also boosted sales in emerging markets such as
China, India and Brazil to 18 percent of the company''s revenue
under Jeffery Kindler, who Read replaced in December. </p>
<p>Mead Johnson''s revenue of $3.14 billion last year outpaced
Pfizer''s unit by 68 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>If they spin out nutritionals and get a Mead Johnson-type
price, it would add value to Pfizer shareholders, Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, said in an
interview. The question is: what are the business costs in
terms of Pfizer building its emerging-market platform? </p>
<p>Bristol-Myers climbed 17 percent through yesterday since
saying on April 24, 2008, that it planned an IPO for Mead
Johnson. That compared with a 3.3 percent drop for the SP 500''s
gauge of 11 pharmaceutical companies and a 2.9 percent decline
for Pfizer, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bristol-Myers still
trades at 11.4 times profit, less than half of Mead Johnson''s
valuation. </p>
<h2>Mead Johnson Stake </h2>
<p>The drugmaker said in November 2009 that it would separate
its remaining 83 percent stake in Mead Johnson in a tax-free
transaction that retired 270 million Bristol-Myers shares and
reduced dividend obligations by $335 million a year. </p>
<p>The split off of Mead Johnson was a key part of our
biopharma strategy, Jennifer Mauer, a spokeswoman for New
York-based Bristol-Myers, said in a phone interview. It allows
all of the company efforts and resources to be focused on
developing medicines for serious diseases. </p>
<p>The move was part of former CEO James Cornelius'' strategy
to shed non-pharmaceutical businesses and build up the pipeline
of experimental drugs through partnerships and acquisitions. </p>
<p>Bristol-Myers will have generic competition next year for
its Plavix blood thinner, which generates about a third of the
company''s revenue. </p>
<h2>Lipitor Pill </h2>
<p>Pfizer faces the loss of exclusivity of its biggest drug,
the Lipitor cholesterol pill, which accounts for about 16
percent of its sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
company forecasts revenue may fall as much as 2.7 percent this
year as the pipeline of experimental drugs fails to offset lower
sales of Lipitor. </p>
<p>Pfizer may sell businesses that account for almost half of
its revenue, Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
 Co. in New York, wrote in a March 14 report. The company may
divest four non-pharmaceutical businesses as well as its
established products group, reducing sales to $35 to $40 billion
from $67 billion, he said. </p>
<p>The nutrition unit would be an easy candidate since its
products don''t match up with the rest of Pfizer''s offerings and
the business was acquired recently, Anderson wrote. </p>
<p>Nestle SA (NESN) of Vevey, Switzerland, or Paris-based Danone (BN) may
be interested in purchasing Pfizer''s nutrition unit after a
spinoff, according to a note in January from Catherine Arnold,
an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. Any deal may
trigger anti-trust restrictions, she said. </p>
<h2>Nestle, Danone </h2>
<p>Robin Tickle, a spokesman for Nestle, didn''t return a
request for comment after business hours. Sabrina Schneider, a
spokeswoman for Danone, declined to comment. </p>
<p>If Pfizer were to sell its baby-formula division, it may be
worth more than $7 billion, based on Mead Johnson''s earnings and
previous deals in the pharmaceutical industry, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Mead Johnson generates 24.7 cents of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for every $1 of
sales. At that level Pfizer''s unit would have posted Ebitda of
about $461.7 million last year. Based on the median multiple of
15.4 times Ebitda for U.S. pharmaceutical takeovers greater than
$1 billion in the last 10 years, the nutrition company may fetch
$7.1 billion, the data show. </p>
<h2>Eli Lilly </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s shares traded at 8.5 times profit. That was the
third-lowest of any company in the SP 500 Pharmaceuticals
Index, after Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX) of New York and
Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY), which were valued at 7 times
profit, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Bristol shareholders are now also shareholders of Mead
Johnson, and Mead Johnson has performed fabulously well, said
Edward Jones'' Bannister. Pfizer unlocking some value, making
the company smaller: I think that is a good idea and those are
welcome moves from a shareholder perspective. </p>
<p>There have been 4,788 deals announced globally this year,
totaling $467.1 billion, a 12 percent increase from the $416.7
billion in the same period in 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>In the world of Web browsers,
there''s privacy, and then there''s security, and they
aren''t quite the same thing. </p>
<p>This week, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) released a new version of
Internet Explorer, and while we wait to hear from the security
experts how it fares against hackers, it''s already taken a big
step forward on the privacy front. </p>
<p>Internet Explorer 9, which is available as a free download
from Microsoft, replaces IE''s previous, largely ineffectual
scheme for preventing snoopy content providers from
surreptitiously tracking your online movements. The goal may be
benign -- gathering usage data for analytic purposes, for
instance -- but such data can also generate a profile of you,
based on your behavior, which can be used for ad-targeting or
other more nefarious purposes. </p>
<p>The new version of Microsoft''s browser offers controls
that, while far from perfect, make it easier to choose what
information about your behavior you''re willing to share with
online content providers. </p>
<p>While IE remains one of the most widely used pieces of
software on the planet, it doesn''t wield the clout it once did.
For years now, new generations of competing browsers -- Google''s
Chrome, Apple''s Safari, Mozilla''s Firefox and Opera Software''s
Opera, to name four -- have out-innovated and out-performed it. </p>
<p>With IE9, which is all-around faster, slicker and more
enjoyable than its predecessor, Microsoft finally deserves to be
front-of-mind again for anyone lucky enough to be able to run
it. </p>
<p>Not for Everyone </p>
<p>Therein lies an important point: Not every Web surfer -- in
fact, not even every Microsoft-using Web surfer -- will be
capable of running the new software. In a bold move, the company
has made IE9 compatible only with Windows 7, the current version
of its desktop operating system, and with its immediate
predecessor, Vista. About half of all Windows users, who are
still on the nine-year-old XP operating system, are out of luck. </p>
<p>Microsoft says that step was made necessary by the new
features of IE9 that integrate it more deeply with the operating
system than previous versions, or, in earlier years, antitrust
regulators would allow. </p>
<p>Among other things, IE9 blurs the line between programs
running on your computer''s hard drive and content from the Web.
Website icons can now be permanently affixed to Windows''s task
bar, where they both look and, if the site developer supports
it, act much like applications located on your PC. </p>
<p>Jump Lists </p>
<p>Pin the Yahoo! icon to your task bar, for instance, and a
right-button mouse click opens a menu called a jump list that
lets you go directly to the site''s widely used mail, finance and
sports services. The New York Times menu gives you links to its
top 10 headlines, plus shortcuts to its home page and search,
video and most-popular functions. </p>
<p>The new browser is also much speedier. Its Windows-only
orientation means Microsoft didn''t have to make compromises to
assure it would run the same on other operating systems; by
contrast, Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera all have versions
that run on Macs as well as PCs, and all except Safari have
versions for the open-source Linux operating system too. </p>
<p>The most important part of Microsoft''s Windows-only
approach is that IE can harness your PC''s hardware to give
itself a significant speed boost for performing certain kinds of
functions -- running animated graphics, for instance. </p>
<p>IE9''s new privacy features, meanwhile, represent an upping
of the ante for other browser developers. The previous version
of Explorer had a tool called InPrivate Filtering that
proved to be deeply flawed. Among other things, it was disabled
by default; to trigger it, users had to deliberately switch it
on, and every time they closed their browser, the setting would
revert to the off position. </p>
<p>More Powerful </p>
<p>While IE9 still requires the user to choose tracking
protection, this time it''s easier to do, more powerful and
persists across browsing sessions. </p>
<p>To enable the feature, you''ll click on the settings icon on
IE9''s newly streamlined interface, and choose the Safety
option from the pull-down menu. The software uses two methods
for blocking tracking. One instructs your browser to tell
content providers that you don''t wish to be tracked. While
reputable services should comply, there''s no protection against
the unscrupulous ones. </p>
<p>The second method requires a little more work on your part,
hopefully just once, by allowing you to easily subscribe to
online tracking protection lists. These lists are maintained
and updated by online-privacy organizations such as TRUSTe and
PrivacyChoice, which monitor content providers and their
technologies, and are supposed to actually block their efforts. </p>
<p>Cat and Mouse </p>
<p>The big question is how well the new tools work, or whether
they''ll trigger cat-and-mouse moves by less-than-reputable sites
to circumvent them. Indeed, one risk with Microsoft''s new
features is that they''ll result in a false sense of security. </p>
<p>Still, they represent a welcome step to put privacy issues
front and center -- and not just for Microsoft. The next version
of Firefox will include do not track functionality, for
instance, while Google recently made an anti-tracking add-on
available for its new Chrome 10 browser. </p>
<p>With President Barack Obama''s administration and Congress
beginning to debate the need for online-privacy legislation,
Microsoft''s efforts with IE9 may be just the opening salvo in a
feature war among all the browser makers to make Web surfing
safer and more private. We can only hope. </p>

<p>ISS A/S, the world''s largest
cleaning-service provider, said it postponed its initial public
offering, citing high levels of uncertainty and volatility
in global markets. </p>
<p>The offering was scheduled for today, ISS said in a
statement. The Copenhagen-based company, owned by Goldman Sachs
Capital Partners and EQT Partners AB, yesterday cut the top end
of its IPO price range by about 19 percent as a global sell-off
in stocks after Japan''s earthquake hurt demand for new equity. </p>
<p>The timetable has coincided with an extraordinary period
in global markets, ISS said in the statement. Given the
existing shareholders'' and the company''s desire to achieve a
successful IPO with an orderly aftermarket, it has been decided
to postpone the IPO. </p>
<p>The IPO would have been Denmark''s biggest in more than 16
years. ISS was seeking to sell as many as 133 million new shares
to raise gross proceeds of about 13.3 billion kroner ($2.5
billion), according to a statement earlier this month. The
process of taking orders for the stock started March 8, ISS
said. </p>
<p>The offering was oversubscribed within the price range, the
company said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup Inc. (C), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Nordea
Bank AB (NDA) have been managing the sale. </p>
<p>Slumping stock markets have prompted companies to postpone
offerings in the U.S., Europe and Asia. </p>
<p>Postponed Offerings </p>
<p> Lagardere SCA (MMB), France''s largest publisher, yesterday
delayed an initial share sale of its stake in Canal Plus France.
Global Market Group Ltd., the Guangzhou, China-based company
that connects domestic businesses with international customers,
postponed a $143 million U.S. IPO scheduled for today. Japanese
drugmaker RaQualia Pharma Inc. said March 15 it would put off an
IPO. </p>
<p>Stocks plunged this week after Japan''s March 11 earthquake,
which followed weeks of political unrest in some Middle East and
northern Africa nations. The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index
advanced as much as 1.8 percent today after declining 3.6
percent over the past three days. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued by employees who alleged their
stock-option and retirement savings plans sustained losses in
2008 because the company invested too heavily in its own shares. </p>
<p>G. Kenneth Coulter of Florida and five other participants
in the plans said in a complaint in Manhattan federal court that
the New York-based bank and its directors breached their
fiduciary duty by failing to manage the plans'' assets and by not
providing accurate information. </p>
<p>At the end of 2007, the plans held about $2.2 billion worth
of Morgan Stanley stock, according to the complaint. The value
of the company stock in the plans fell to about $673 million by
the end of 2008, the plaintiffs said. The plaintiffs are seeking
proceeds on behalf of employees who participated in the plans
from Jan. 2, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2008. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and its stock were exposed to
extraordinary risk as a result of the financial perils of the
entire banking sector, the plaintiffs said. Company stock
was an imprudent, inappropriate and exceedingly risky
investment. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment on the lawsuit, which is related to a class-action suit
filed in federal court in New York in 2007 being presided over
by U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts. </p>
<p>The case is Coulter v. Morgan Stanley, 11-CV-1849, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and two hedge-
fund partners would break federal rules limiting media ownership
under their plan to reorganize Tribune Co., delaying the
publisher''s exit from bankruptcy, a lawyer said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Angelo Gordon  Co. and Oaktree Capital
Management LP have built stakes in newspaper and broadcast
companies that have come out of bankruptcy in recent years, Mark
Prak, a lawyer who lobbies Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission on behalf of television broadcasters,
said today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. </p>
<p>They will violate the FCC media ownership rules, Prak
said. The interest they have will complicate reorganization. </p>
<p>Prak was testifying on behalf of Aurelius Capital
Management LP, which is opposing a reorganization plan for
Chicago-based Tribune sponsored by JPMorgan, Angelo Gordon and
Oaktree. Aurelius is sponsoring its own plan. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Kevin J. Carey must decide which of the two plans to
approve. </p>
<p>The noteholder plan would have the same ownership problem,
Ronald Flagg, a lawyer for Tribune, said in court while
questioning Prak. Under either proposal, JPMorgan, Angelo Gordon
and Oaktree would own more than 5 percent each of the newspaper
and television company, according to court records. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said Moscow''s traffic jams are
the biggest obstacle to turning the capital into a financial
hub, according to Deputy Finance Minister Dmitry Pankin. </p>
<p>Blankfein and President Dmitry Medvedev discussed
investment opportunities in Russia and Medvedev''s plans for the
capital at a March 15 meeting outside Moscow that Pankin
attended. </p>
<p>The first question we asked was about the main problem
for creating Moscow as a financial center, Pankin said in an
interview in Moscow yesterday. He said it was bottleneck from
the airport to the city center. </p>
<p>Medvedev has named 27 people, including Blankfein, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and Citigroup Inc. (C) CEO Vikram Pandit, to an advisory board as he seeks to bolster Russia''s
role in international finance, according to the Kremlin''s
website this month and a member of the board who declined to be
identified. Medvedev has made diversifying the economy of the
world''s biggest oil and gas supplier a priority. </p>
<p>Transport and infrastructure, as well as child care, are
priorities for bankers working in Moscow, Pankin said. Goldman
Sachs declined to comment, said a spokeswoman, who asked not to
be named, citing company policy. </p>
<p>Grueling'' Traffic </p>
<p>Mayor Sergei Sobyanin vowed to focus on easing
transportation in the capital and uprooting corruption after
Medvedev ousted Yury Luzhkov, who had governed the city for 18
years. The president wants investors in Moscow to feel no less
comfortable than in London, Geneva or New York, according to
the Kremlin website. Moscow ranked 68th of 75 cities in the
December 2009 Global Financial Centers Index commissioned by the
City of London. </p>
<p>Moscow drivers suffer the longest traffic jams of 20 major
cities, making for a grueling atmosphere that inhibits
commerce, according to a July report by International Business
Machines Corp. </p>
<p>The average Muscovite motorist spent a whopping 2 1/2
hours stuck in traffic at least once in the last three years,
IBM said in its global study on the emotional and economic
toll of commuting. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is also among the 23 banks selected by the
government last year to help manage its 1 trillion-ruble ($35
billion) state-asset sale program over three years. </p>
<p>Russia picked advisers that have experience in launching
big projects to help build Moscow into a financial hub, said Alexander Voloshin, head of the government working group
overseeing the project and former chief of staff under
Presidents Vladimir Putin and Boris Yeltsin, in a Jan. 11
interview. And those big banks that can bring business here. </p>

<p> FPT Corp. (FPT), Vietnam''s biggest
publicly traded telecommunications and software company, said it
plans to combine its technology units and focus on restoring the
annual earnings growth rate to more than 30 percent. </p>
<p>FPT will consolidate five subsidiaries -- FPT Information
System, FPT Telecom Corp., FPT Software, FPT Online and FPT
Trading Group -- with itself, Truong Dinh Anh, who will take
over as chief executive officer of Hanoi-based FPT on March 25,
said in a phone interview today. The parent may either buy out
the units'' minority shareholders or issue its own shares and
swap them as part of the transaction, Anh said. </p>
<p>The Vietnamese technology company, which in May announced a
cloud-computing alliance with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is seeking to
renew its focus on telecommunications and Internet services and
software development after the pace of profit growth fell below
20 percent in the last three years, Anh said. </p>
<p>We have reoriented our businesses to make it a
technology, information and communications corporation instead
of an economic group, Anh said. We are restructuring our
holdings in subsidiaries to focus on core businesses in order to
enhance growth. </p>
<p>FPT fell 1 percent to 52,000 dong at the 11 a.m. close of
trading in Ho Chi Minh City. The stock has declined 19 percent
this year, while the benchmark VN Index has lost 5 percent. </p>
<p>Growth Pace </p>
<p>In 2010, pretax profit increased 19 percent to 2 trillion
dong ($96 million), FPT said in a statement on its website.
Revenue except internal sales of goods and services rose 9.5
percent to 20.5 trillion dong. </p>
<p>The slowing pace of profit growth didn''t satisfy board
members and shareholders, Anh said. </p>
<p>FPT had created many joint stock companies as part of a
business development model aimed at tapping opportunities in
multiple sectors, Anh said. </p>
<p>In recent years, especially in the crisis period, we''ve
seen that the main strength of FPT is still in technology and
telecommunications, he said. We want to focus all efforts on
our strong points. </p>
<p>The company has a commitment to boost revenue by up to
25-fold by 2020, CEO Nguyen Thanh Nam said in May. FPT expects
both revenue and pretax profit to increase 20 percent this year
to 24.5 trillion dong and 2.42 trillion dong respectively, it
said. </p>
<p>The Southeast Asian nation''s economy expanded 6.8 percent
last year, the fastest pace since 2007. Vietnam is targeting an
average annual growth rate of as much as 8.5 percent between
2011 and 2015, and the government aims to derive 22 percent of
gross domestic product from the technology industry by 2020. </p>
<p>FPT, whose customers include Microsoft, Panasonic Corp. and
Hitachi Ltd., will also set up a wholly owned unit to hold and
manage its investments in Tien Phong Commercial Bank, FPT
Securities Joint-Stock Co., FPT Capital and FPT Land, Anh said. </p>
<p>The company will seek shareholders'' opinions on the
consolidation plan at a meeting in April, he said. </p>

<p>The price investors are willing to
pay in relation to earnings for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index
companies will decline as economic growth decelerates, according
to Morgan Stanley (MS)''s Adam Parker. </p>
<p>Our contrarian call at Morgan Stanley is that the market
multiple is going to contract, said Parker, chief U.S. equity
strategist at the New York-based bank, in an interview today on
Surveillance Midday with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television.
That''s a function of the belief that growth''s decelerating.
It''s probably going to be more volatile, and then you have the
overhang of inflation. </p>
<p>An increase in capital spending in the U.S. will reduce the
free cash flow of companies and damp a rise in equities,
according to Parker, who predicted the combined earnings of
companies in the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks to be $93 this
year, compared with the average estimate of $94.34. </p>
<p>Investors should favor technology stocks over the
industrial sector as corporate earnings sag as stimulus measures
in the U.S. end, Parker said. His forecast for the SP 500 at
the end of 2011 is 1,238, the lowest of 13 strategists surveyed
by Bloomberg. SP 500 stocks trade at an average price-to-
earnings ratio of about 15. </p>
<p>The SP 500 Index (SPX) advanced 0.4 percent to 1,279.21 at 4
p.m. in New York, rallying for a second day as the Federal
Reserve cleared the way for big banks to boost dividends, Libya
announced a cease-fire, and central banks worked to support
Japan''s economy after the March 11 earthquake. </p>
<p>You don''t want to own the stock market until the capital
spending is done accelerating, Parker said. Technology stocks
have never been cheaper versus industrials; they have the
specter of returning more cash to the shareholder, he said. </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) increased dividends and authorized share buybacks
after the Federal Reserve reviewed the ability of the largest
U.S. lenders to withstand another economic slump. Bank stocks
rallied in New York trading. </p>
<p>JPMorgan raised its quarterly payout to 25 cents a share
from 5 cents and authorized a $15 billion stock repurchase.
Wells Fargo authorized the repurchase of 200 million shares and
a special dividend of 7 cents, which will raise the first-
quarter payout to 12 cents. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it got
permission to buy back $5 billion of preferred stock sold to
Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2008. </p>
<p>Regulators are giving banks more flexibility in their use
of capital after forcing the companies in early 2009 to cut
dividends. Profits rebounded last year after losses tied to home
mortgages, commercial real estate and business lending had
drained capital and led to more than 300 failures. </p>
<p>Significant improvement in both economic conditions and
the capital positions of financial institutions helped firms
win permission to increase their payouts, the Fed said in a
statement today. From the end of 2008 through 2010, common
equity increased by more than $300 billion at the 19 largest
U.S. bank holding companies. </p>
<p>The KBW Bank Index of 24 companies advanced 1 percent at
4:02 p.m. in New York. JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, climbed 2.7 percent to $45.74. No. 4 Wells Fargo, based
in San Francisco, increased 1.5 percent to $31.83. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs jumped 2.7 percent to $159.96. New York-based
Goldman said it also has Fed approval for the repurchase of
common stock and a potential increase of its dividend. </p>
<p> KeyCorp (KEY), Ohio''s second-biggest bank, and Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) said today they are raising capital to repay
bailout funds after the Fed''s review. Cleveland-based KeyCorp
said it''s selling $625 million of stock and also issuing debt to
help repay $2.5 billion in U.S. bailout funds. SunTrust will
offer $1 billion in shares and $1 million in debt to help repay
a $4.9 billion rescue. </p>
<p>KeyCorp climbed 0.8 percent and SunTrust added 4.7 percent.
Lenders including New York-based JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and U.S.
Bancorp already paid back the U.S. Treasury Department. </p>
<p>U.S. Bancorp, Minnesota''s largest lender, advanced 1.1
percent after it raised its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents a
share from 5 cents. The Minneapolis-based bank authorized the
purchase of 50 million shares through December. </p>
<p>Confidence and Patience'' </p>
<p>Our shareholders deserve to be rewarded for the support,
confidence and patience they have shown over the past few
years, Chief Executive Officer Richard Davis said in a
statement. </p>
<p>The Fed told banks in November to consider conservative
payouts that would still allow for a significant build-up of
capital and said today that firms are generally expected to
keep dividends no higher than 30 percent of earnings. </p>
<p>That ratio will be the new normal, Gerard Cassidy, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a Feb. 8 report. </p>
<p>At the new level, JPMorgan''s dividend yield, the annualized
payout divided by the current share, equates to 2.2 percent. The
$1 annualized dividend works out to about 20 percent of
analysts'' estimates for earnings per share over the
next four quarters, based on a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo''s new dividend yield is 1.5 percent, with an
estimated payout ratio over the next year of 16 percent. BBT
Corp., which lifted its dividend by a penny to 16 cents, has a
dividend yield of 2.3 percent and an estimated payout ratio of
about 35 percent. </p>
<p>Send a Signal'' </p>
<p>We really didn''t have a call to action to raise it at
all, BBT CEO Kelly King said in an interview. We wanted to
send a signal to our shareholders that we were strong enough to
be able to do it and to signal to them that we are now entering
into a period where we can begin to think about future dividend
increases. The Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based company is
also making a special payout of 1 cent a share. </p>
<p> State Street Corp. (STT), the third-largest custody bank, raised
its quarterly dividend to 18 cents from a penny and said it will
buy back as much as $675 million in stock this year. </p>
<p> American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, is planning share buybacks that will begin after the
New York-based company reports first-quarter results, according
to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>BNY Mellon, PNC </p>
<p> Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the world''s biggest custody
bank, and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC), the Pittsburgh-
based lender, said the Fed approved plans that include higher
dividends and share buybacks in the second quarter. Neither
company''s statement disclosed the size or cost. </p>
<p>Fifth Third Bancorp, Ohio''s biggest lender, said the Fed
didn''t object to its capital plan, which includes a dividend
increase this quarter and possible redemption of trust-preferred
securities. The board of directors is scheduled to weigh the
dividend on March 22, the Cincinnati-based company said in a
statement today. </p>
<p>The Fed said it tested how banks would absorb stresses of a
typical recession, such as a decline in the value of riskier
assets, and an 11 percent unemployment rate. </p>
<p>The Fed still can limit dividends by weaker banks to
prepare the companies for tighter capital rules and eliminate
the need for taxpayer rescues. A bank''s decision to maintain its
dividend isn''t necessarily the result of the regulator denying
permission. Some companies may have opted not to seek approval,
the Fed said. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>Rejections may be based on a determination that plans for
meeting the upcoming Basel III capital standards were not
robust, the Fed said. Requested increases may also have been
rejected if the amount of the proposed distribution would
weaken the firm''s ability to weather adverse economic
conditions. </p>
<p> Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the biggest U.S. lender, didn''t
request approval for a second-quarter increase, said Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
company, in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The bank will resubmit a proposal for a modest dividend
increase in the second half of this year, he said. </p>
<p> Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. bank, said today
that it still expects to return capital to shareholders next
year. Morgan Stanley (MS) said it will proceed with plans to purchase
the portion of the Smith Barney brokerage business it doesn''t
already own after regulators reviewed its financial strength. Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) said it will maintain its quarterly
dividend of 5 cents a share. </p>
<p>Regions, MetLife </p>
<p>Regions Financial Corp., Alabama''s largest lender, said it
planned no immediate capital actions and intends to repay its
bailout in a prudent manner on shareholder-friendly terms.
Regions was one of only two stocks in the bank index to decline
today, dropping 3.4 percent. </p>
<p>MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer, said it is too
early to discuss possible capital distribution after the Fed
reviewed the company''s financial strength. </p>
<p>Our capital distribution activity typically occurs later
in the year, said John Calagna, a spokesman for the New York-
based company, in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>MetLife, which didn''t take U.S. Treasury Department bailout
funds, is overseen by the Fed because the company has a banking
unit that gathers deposits and makes home loans. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
pay $10 million to settle U.S. regulators'' accusations that it
gave cash and gifts to Chinese and South Korean officials in
connection with about $54 million in government contracts. </p>
<p>The company, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, will
pay $5.3 million in disgorgement, $2.7 million in interest and a
penalty of $2 million to settle a lawsuit filed today by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington federal court,
according to court papers. </p>
<p>The SEC alleged the bribes, which included travel and
entertainment, occurred from 1998 through 2009 in violation of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. </p>
<p>Deficient internal controls allowed employees of IBM''s
subsidiaries and joint venture to use local business partners
and travel agencies as conduits for bribes or other improper
payments to South Korean and Chinese government officials over
long periods of time, the SEC said in the complaint. </p>
<p>The improper payments were made by employees at three
subsidiaries of Armonk, New York-based IBM, as well as LG IBM PC
Co., a joint venture between the company and LG Electronics
Inc., according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The SEC said cash payments to South Korean officials from
1998 to 2003 totaled $207,000. The payments were connected to
contracts worth almost $54 million, the SEC said. </p>
<p>Bags of Money </p>
<p>Some of the money paid to Korean officials was delivered in
shopping bags at specific drop-off locations, such as restaurant
or apartment parking lots. </p>
<p>In China, the IBM employees created slush funds at
local travel agencies that were used to pay for overseas
excursions by Chinese government officials. IBM employees also
gave gifts, such as cameras and laptop computers, to Chinese
government officials, the SEC said. </p>
<p>The misconduct in China involved several key IBM-China
employees and more than 100 IBM China employees overall, the
SEC said. </p>
<p>The SEC lawsuit doesn''t say what IBM received from China in
return. </p>
<p>IBM insists on the highest ethical standards in the
conduct of its business and requires all employees to follow its
policies and procedures for conducting business, Doug Shelton,
an IBM spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The settlement agreement, filed in court today, was signed
by IBM''s general counsel on Jan. 6. </p>
<p>No Insurance </p>
<p>IBM agreed in the settlement, which requires approval from
a federal judge, not to pay the monetary penalties from any
insurance policy. </p>
<p>Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on whether there''s a criminal investigation of the
matter. </p>
<p>IBM expects that revenue from geographic growth markets,
including China and South Korea, will be about 30 percent of
total sales in 2015, up from 21 percent last year, according to
company executives. </p>
<p>The case is SEC v. International Business Machines Corp.,

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will pay $5.65 billion to
redeem preferred stock sold to Warren Buffett''s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) at the depth of the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>The purchase includes a 10 percent premium on Buffett''s
original $5 billion investment, a $125 million first-quarter
dividend, and $24 million in accelerated dividends, said Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for the New York-based company. The
redemption will cut first-quarter earnings per share by $2.84,
the bank said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Berkshire Hathaway''s 2008 investment in Goldman Sachs was
a major vote of confidence in our firm and we are very
appreciative of it, Cohen said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had been awaiting Federal Reserve approval to
buy back Buffett''s investment, which gave him $500 million a
year in dividends. In his annual letter to shareholders last
month, Buffett said he expected the regulator will likely give
Goldman the green light before long. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve also approved a plan for Goldman Sachs
to buy back company stock and potentially increase the common
stock dividend, the firm said in today''s statement. Cohen
declined to comment on the buyback or dividend plans. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley (MS) is starting to win
more business from smaller private-equity firms after forming a
group of bankers to focus on the sector and generate more fee
revenue from buyouts. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank has advised on seven closed or
pending deals this year from firms that manage funds of less
than $5 billion, said Joe Purcell, managing director of the
middle-market advisory group created last year. The five-person
team has attracted business from clients such as Rhone Group
LLC, Tailwind Capital Group LLC and JLL Partners Inc. </p>
<p>It''s often considered lower profile than covering the
largest sponsors, but middle-market private equity can be very
profitable for us, Purcell said in an interview this month. </p>
<p>The focus on smaller buyout firms puts Morgan Stanley in
competition with boutique investment banks as well as some
larger ones such as Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Deutsche Bank AG. Morgan Stanley ranked seventh among banks in
terms of fees that buyout firms paid for financial services such
as acquisitions and loan underwriting last year, according to
New York-based consultant Freeman  Co. </p>
<p>In all corporate and private-equity takeovers, Morgan
Stanley was the top adviser globally in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bank advised Rhone this year on its
minority investment in beauty products maker Coty Inc. Last
year, it worked with JLL Partners on the sale of McKechnie
Aerospace Holdings Inc., the aircraft-components manufacturer
that TransDigm Group Inc. (TDG) bought in December for $1.27 billion. </p>
<p>Fewer Fees </p>
<p>Financial advisers are trying to capitalize on the so-
called middle market after buyout funds ranging from $1 billion
to $5 billion in size grew to account for 69 percent of the
total amount raised last year, compared with 35 percent in 2009,
according to researcher Pitchbook Data Inc. </p>
<p>Traditionally banks have put more emphasis on the largest
20 firms, such as TPG Capital and KKR  Co., since their deals
generated 48 percent of the $7.65 billion in fees that buyout
firms paid banks last year, according to Freeman. That is still
less than half of the $16.3 billion banks reaped in fees at the
height of buyout dealmaking in 2007. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is looking to fill some of that gap. For the
first time last month, the bank held a conference for about 100
prospective middle-market private-equity clients. Robert Kindler, Morgan Stanley''s global head of MA, recruited Purcell
last year from JPMorgan Chase  Co., where he ran a similar
team. </p>
<p>Middle-market firms selling businesses benefit from
Morgan Stanley''s strong relationships with strategic buyers,
Kindler said in a telephone interview. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and U.S.
law firms are luring lawyers away from the U.K. fraud prosecutor
as companies prepare to comply with the world''s most
draconian anti-bribery law. </p>
<p>The U.K. Ministry of Justice has said it will introduce new
proposals as soon as next week, leaving companies scrambling to
hire lawyers to help prepare compliance plans. Under the law,
U.K. companies without adequate controls to prevent corruption
may be prosecuted if a bribe is paid by third parties on their
behalf anywhere in the world, even if officials didn''t know. </p>
<p>Kwadjo Adjepong, who worked on the Serious Fraud Office''s
probe into the collapse of London hedge fund Weavering Capital,
joined Goldman Sachs as a vice president in its compliance
department last month, SFO spokesman David Jones said. Covington
 Burling LLP, White  Case LLP and Arnold  Porter LLP have
also hired lawyers from the SFO as the Bribery Act creates work
for firms preparing compliance plans. </p>
<p>There is a real thirst for knowledge on the Bribery Act,
a thirst for having the right kind of advice from someone who''s
been on the other side, said Robert Amaee, the former head of
anti-corruption at the SFO who joined Washington-based Covington
 Burling, in January. A good deal of my time is spent in
helping clients understand the Bribery Act. </p>
<p>Washington-based Arnold  Porter in February said it hired
Kathleen Harris, the former head of the SFO fraud business
group, as a partner in its London office. Charlie Monteith, a
senior policy adviser and the head of assurance at the agency,
left for New York-based White  Case. </p>
<p>Skadden Arps </p>
<p>Another former SFO prosecutor, Matthew Cowie, who oversaw
an investigation of BAE Systems Plc, left in June to join the
U.S. law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom. </p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice may weaken some parts of the law
initially put forward by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown''s
Labour government last year, SFO officials said. The proposal
was criticized over clauses that would have classified fancy
dinners or sports tickets for foreign officials as bribes. </p>
<p> Chris Walker, the SFO policy chief, told a defense industry
conference in January that the revised law may allow a company
to fund a factory visit and hospitality for a public official. A
month''s stay on a private yacht after the trip would raise red
flags, he said. </p>
<p>British business groups pressed the ministry to make the
law more business-friendly and clarify provisions that may be
too vague to defend in a prosecution. </p>
<p>Fuzzy Edges'' </p>
<p>Jim Bligh, a policy adviser at the Confederation of British
Industry, said the Justice Ministry should clarify rules on
corporate hospitality and how much due diligence a company must
conduct on its suppliers, affiliates and joint ventures. </p>
<p>There''s a lot of fuzzy edges, Bligh said. You''ve got
to know what people are going to prosecute. </p>
<p>The ministry said that the act would allow prosecutors to
charge U.K. companies and foreign firms which carry on a
business or part of a business in the U.K. </p>
<p>The mere fact that a company is listed for London Stock
Exchange purposes may not, in itself, be enough to amount to
carrying on a business or part of a business in the U.K., the
ministry said in a statement. It will always be for the courts
to decide in individual cases. </p>
<p>SFO Probes </p>
<p>The SFO, which prosecutes white-collar crime, is
investigating allegations of overseas bribery at companies
including Johnson  Johnson''s DePuy International unit and at
Alstom SA''s U.K. division. Last month, KBR Inc.''s M.W. Kellogg
Ltd. subsidiary agreed to pay 7 million pounds ($11 million) to
the SFO to end a four-year probe into bribes paid to Nigerian
officials. </p>
<p>The SFO''s budget continues to shrink. Since Richard Alderman, the agency''s director, took the post in 2008, the
government has cut its operating budget to about 34 million
pounds ($55 million) from 52 million pounds, according to the
SFO''s annual report. </p>
<p>Vivian Robinson, the SFO''s general counsel, who has called
the new law one of the most world''s most draconian, said
earlier this month that the agency would take a common-sense
approach to policing hospitality functions at sporting events
like Wimbledon. </p>
<p>The guidance may also allow facilitation payments made
to foreign officials to expedite a routine procedure in some
circumstances. </p>
<p>The paramount question regarding facilitation payments
is whether a prosecution is in the public interest, Robinson
said at a conference organized by the Clyde  Co. law firm this
month in London. </p>
<p>The SFO might not be the agency to enforce the law. Under
separate government proposals, it may be split up, with its
lawyers joining the Crown Prosecution Service and investigators
becoming part of a National Crime Agency. </p>
<p>There will always be a prosecutor, it doesn''t really make
a difference at this stage, Bligh said. The crucial thing is
that the right guidance comes out. </p>

<p> General Mills Inc. (GIS), the maker of
Cheerios cereal, is in exclusive talks to buy 50 percent of
Yoplait, strengthening ties to the French yogurt maker to expand
its line of dairy products. </p>
<p>The purchase values the entire yogurt maker at 1.6 billion
euros ($2.3 billion), Paris-based private equity firm PAI
Partners, owner of the stake, said today in a joint e-mailed
statement with partner Sodiaal. The Minneapolis-based company
has had the U.S. license for Yoplait products since 1977.
Sodiaal, the founder of the yogurt brand, owns the rest. </p>
<p>General Mills plans to build Yoplait''s market share in
western Europe and accelerate expansion in emerging markets
including China and India. The purchase also prevents a rival
from possibly contesting its U.S. rights, according to analysts
including Jonathan Feeney of Janney Montgomery Scott. General
Mills had jockeyed for Yoplait with competitors including Nestle
SA, people familiar with the matter have said. </p>
<p>The price is a bit higher than expected, but it settles
an ongoing question mark, Feeney said in a report yesterday.
Keeping the U.S. rights with no additional terms was the
optimal outcome, so it is fair to see this partially as a
payment to take some risk off the table. The Philadelphia-
based analyst rates the shares neutral. </p>
<p>Ebitda Multiples </p>
<p>The talks are the latest in a string of dairy
consolidation. PepsiCo Inc. in December agreed to buy a
controlling stake in Russian dairy company Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods
OJSC to become the biggest food-and-beverage company in Russia.
Groupe Lactalis yesterday disclosed a stake in Italian dairy
company Parmalat SpA and said it may buy more shares. </p>
<p>The median multiple paid for dairy assets in the last
decade is about 10 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, according to Bloomberg data.
Yoplait had 2010 Ebitda of 128 million euros and is projected to
have 2011 earnings on that basis of 153 million euros, a person
familiar with the matter said. PAI, which manages a 2.7 billion-
euro buyout fund, bought the stake in 2002 in a purchase that
valued the company at 400 million euros, the person said. </p>
<p>Yoplait is an interesting investment as the yogurt market
is growing strongly, which may justify the high price, said Klaus Kraenzle, a consumer-industry analyst at Silvia Quandt 
Cie. in Frankfurt. </p>
<p>Sodiaal and PAI last month said nine companies had made
indicative offers for the asset. Nestle, Mexico''s Grupo Lala and
China''s Bright Food Group Co. were among the bidders for the
stake, four people familiar with the process said this month. </p>
<p>Joint Ownership </p>
<p>Sodiaal will jointly own the Yoplait brand worldwide and
will be a core shareholder in the operating company, PAI and
Sodiaal said today. The consultation process with employees will
begin shortly, the companies said. </p>
<p>General Mills Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell faces
increasing pressure as prices for raw materials rise, forcing
General Mills and rivals like Kellogg Co. (K) to raise food prices.
Raw sugar prices reached their highest level in 30 years last
month, while milk prices have risen more than 50 percent from a
year earlier. </p>
<p>The shares rose 8 cents to $36.13 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange trading. They had fallen 1.2 percent in the past
12 months before today, compared with a 9.2 percent gain for the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>Yoplait''s history dates back to 1964, when French farmers
joined together to sell their products nationally, according to
Yoplait''s website. The name derives from Yola and
Coplait, two brands operated by some of the farmers. In
1967, Yoplait''s first fruit yogurt debuted in French stores. </p>
<p>Sodiaal and PAI had said they would examine suitors'' plans
to further the Yoplait brand in areas where it currently has
little or no presence, such as China, India and Latin America. </p>
<p>Rothschild advised PAI while HSBC Holdings Plc advised
Sodiaal. Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale were advising both
shareholders. Barclays advised General Mills. </p>

<p> Chevron Corp. (CVX) had a partial
shutdown for a planned maintenance at the Pembroke oil refinery
in Wales that it sold to Valero Energy Corp. (VLO), potentially
limiting supplies of fuels at a time of rising prices. </p>
<p>The shutdown "is currently ongoing," Paul Bray, a London-
based Chevron spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement.
"This partial shutdown will not impact Chevron''s ability to
fulfill its supply contracts." </p>
<p>Refiners are required to halt processing units periodically
to carry out repairs and inspections to ensure safe and
efficient operations. The Pembroke refinery can process 210,000
barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Gasoline prices in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp, Europe''s
oil-trading hub, rose 15 percent this year amid increasing oil
costs and maintenance halts. The fuel climbed to $947 a metric

<p>Chevron agreed to sell the Pembroke plant and 1,000 retail
outlets to Valero, the largest U.S. oil refiner, for about $1.73
billion in cash, the companies said on March 11. Chevron is
based in San Ramon, California. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) put volume
remained elevated today after being above the four-week average
every day last week, boosted by one trade with a strike price 39
percent below the March 18 close. </p>
<p>A block of 39,526 September $12 puts to sell the world''s
largest maker of power-generation equipment traded for 18 cents
each at 10:39 a.m. in New York, all at the ask price, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. An investor bought 45,000 of the
same puts on March 18. Today''s trade came from the same broker
as Friday''s, Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC, a New
York-based provider of options-market data and analytics, said. </p>
<p>More than 125,000 puts changed hands today, 1.6 times the
four-week average and 1.6 times the number of calls to buy. The
September $12 puts were the most traded and accounted for 46
percent of all put volume. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE
gained 2.4 percent to $19.72 today and hasn''t fallen below $12
since July 2009. </p>
<p>It looks like a protective hedge, Schwartz said. I
would expect it has to do with the exposure to the Japan
crisis. </p>
<p>Governments from Germany to India are reassessing the
technology after Japan''s March 11 earthquake and tsunami
crippled a power plant and raised the threat of a meltdown.
Three reactors at Japan''s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant use a GE
design, including the damaged No. 1 unit. China on March 16
halted nuclear project approvals and plans safety inspections of
new facilities. GE last week fell 6.9 percent in three days,

<p>Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a

<p>Goldman Sachs raised its forecast
for Argentina''s economic growth in 2011 after the economy
expanded last year at the fastest pace since 2005. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs economist Alberto Ramos raised his gross
domestic product expansion estimate to 6.8 percent from a
previous 5.6 percent, according to an e-mail statement. Still,
he expects a significant slowdown in the second half of
2011, and maintained his 2012 growth forecast of 3.2 percent. </p>
<p>South America''s second-biggest economy expanded for an
eighth consecutive year in 2010, growing 9.2 percent. The
country''s recovery from 0.9 percent expansion in 2009 was fueled
by commodity prices and by external demand, mainly from Brazil,
for manufactured and industrial goods, Ramos said. </p>
<p>Ramos forecast that prices will rise by more than 25
percent this year. Even so, the government is unlikely to take
steps to rein in inflation, he said. </p>
<p>The paramount policy objective appears to be to maximize
growth ahead of the elections, even if such a strategy proves
unsustainable and thereby self-defeating over the medium term,
said New York-based Ramos in the statement. </p>
<p>The government will allow the peso to depreciate gradually
until the October presidential elections as it tries to prevent
a further escalation of inflationary pressures, said Ramos, who
estimated the peso will lose 8 percent to 10 percent of its
value over the whole of 2011. </p>
<p>The resulting appreciation of the real exchange rate means
that beyond entrenched high inflation, the erosion of external
competitiveness is another thorny issue the next administration
will have to face, which, if not handled properly could end up
generating a crash, rather than a soft-landing of the economy in
2012, said Ramos. </p>
<p>The peso, which last year fell 4.5 percent, the most among
Latin America''s major currencies, was little changed as of 4:22
p.m. New York time at 4.0366 per dollar. </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) extended its
market-share lead over Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in mergers
advice after ATT Inc. (T) beat out Sprint Nextel Corp. to buy Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)''s U.S. wireless unit for $39 billion. </p>
<p>Already first in Bloomberg''s ranking of advisers by dollar
value of transactions announced since Jan. 1, JPMorgan''s role
with ATT on the T-Mobile USA deal boosted the New York-based
bank''s tally to $159 billion. Goldman Sachs, which advised
Sprint Nextel in talks with T-Mobile, dropped to third with
$96.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Ranks are important, said Neal Stoughton, a professor
of financial services at the University of New South Wales in
Sydney. If you hire an adviser, you''re seeking someone who can
have success. JPMorgan is competing very aggressively. </p>
<p>The acquisition is a sign of life for dealmaking in the
telecommunications industry, where the more than $500 billion of
takeovers struck in both 1999 and 2000 were followed by a decade
with an average of $175 billion a year, Bloomberg data show.
Telecom deals made up 8 percent of the merger market last year,
compared with 18 percent in 2000. </p>
<p>JPMorgan stands to earn fees of about $20 million from
committing to provide ATT a $20 billion, one-year unsecured
loan as part of the transaction, according to estimates by New
York-based research firm Freeman Consulting. The loan-
arrangement fee could become significantly higher if ATT''s
credit rating is negatively affected by the deal, said Freeman. </p>
<p>Loan Fee </p>
<p>Freeman estimates ATT may also pay fees of as much as $65
million to its three advisers: JPMorgan and boutique advisory
firms Greenhill  Co. and Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) </p>
<p>New York-based Greenhill''s team included founder Robert Greenhill, Gil Ha and Lawrence Chu. The JPMorgan bankers were
Andy O''Brien, James Woolery, Kurt Simon, Anwar Zakkour and
Thomas Cassin. Evercore''s team included founder Roger Altman,
Eduardo Mestre and Dan Mendelow. </p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom''s advisers, Morgan Stanley (MS), Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), may earn as much as $60 million
in advisory fees, according to Freeman. The transaction helped
Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Telekom''s lead banker, overtake Goldman
Sachs to win the No. 2 spot in Bloomberg''s merger league tables
since Dec. 31, with $135 billion of transactions, Bloomberg data
show. Morgan Stanley garnered the top spot in global MA
advisory in 2009 and 2010, the data show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bankers advising Deutsche Telekom included
Jean Abergel and Dirk Notheis in Europe and Robert Eatroff, Adam Shepard and James Murray in the U.S. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank''s team was led by Armin von Falkenhayn and
Philipp Meier-Scherling in Europe and David Pearson and Don
Birchenough in the U.S. Credit Suisse bankers included Luigi de Vecchi, Jeff Murphy and Ken Oliver Fritz in Europe and John Trousdale and Mark Simonian in the U.S. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, held the top spot in
global MA advisory every year from 2001 to 2008, Bloomberg data
show. Connie Ling, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Excluding transfers of government assets, the ATT deal is
the largest takeover proposed anywhere in the world since BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world''s largest mining company, offered $40
billion for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan last August. BHP''s bid
was blocked by the Canadian government. </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will stop
offering debit-card rewards for almost all of its customers in
July to reduce losses from a proposed cap on interchange fees. </p>
<p>The company is mailing letters to customers announcing the
change, said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the bank. New York-based
JPMorgan said in November it would end rewards for new customers
in February, while keeping programs for existing clients. </p>
<p>Congress recently enacted a new law known as the Durbin
Amendment that significantly impacts debit cards, said one of
the company''s letters to customers. As a result of this law,
we will be changing our debit rewards program. </p>
<p>The Durbin Amendment is part of the Dodd-Frank Act
financial overhaul enacted last year, that caps debit-card swipe
fees to help merchants who said they were powerless to negotiate
rates with payment networks Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) The
Federal Reserve has until April to decide what the cap will be
before being implemented July 21, 2011. </p>
<p>The Fed proposed capping debit-interchange fees at a flat
12 cents a transaction in December, compared with the current
formula that averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price or
about 44 cents. Such a cap would cost JPMorgan, the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets behind Bank of America Corp. (BAC), about
$1.3 billion in lost revenue annually, according to a Feb. 15
investor presentation. </p>
<p>Customers will continue to earn rewards through July 19,
and points accrued through that date will not expire, according
to the letter. Debit cards with annual fees won''t be assessed as
of July, Kelly said. The bank''s credit-card rewards programs
will not be affected, he said. </p>
<p>Banks Lobbying </p>
<p>Banks lobbied against the proposed cap on debit
interchange, which generated about $16 billion in revenue for
the industry in 2009, according to the Federal Reserve. </p>
<p>Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, is the chief
sponsor of a bill that would delay the rule for two years.
Representative Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia
Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services
subcommittee on financial institutions, introduced a similar
measure. </p>
<p>It''s not clear whether a two-year delay on the cap would
change the company''s plans, Kelly said. </p>
<p>The bank''s move was reported March 20 by American Banker. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will continue making
principal investments with the firm''s own money because
executives don''t think the so-called Volcker rule prevents the
practice, a Bank of America Corp. analyst said. </p>
<p>The analyst, Guy Moszkowski, published a note to investors
today after meeting last week with four Goldman Sachs executives
in Hong Kong. New York-based Goldman Sachs doesn''t think U.S.
legislation passed last year that bans proprietary trading and
limits holdings in hedge funds and private-equity funds
precludes buying stakes in companies and other assets,
Moszkowski wrote. </p>
<p>The market interpretation of Volcker rules is that this
will be off-limits ahead, but GS believes that many such
investments will remain permissible, and will be closing on a
meaningful'' one in China shortly, Moszkowski''s note said. </p>
<p>On March 11, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission
approved AXA Life Ltd.''s sale of a stake in Taikang Life
Insurance Co. to buyers including Goldman Sachs, according to a
statement on the Chinese regulator''s website. Goldman will get a
12.02 percent stake in Taikang Life Insurance, the statement
said. The value of the stake hasn''t been disclosed. </p>

<p>Ex Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
Director Rajat Gupta sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, claiming an administrative action for insider
trading it filed against him bars him from a jury trial. </p>
<p>Gupta, 62, said the SEC should have filed a lawsuit in
federal court instead. He denied the agency''s claims that he
gave tips to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>The SEC filed the action March 1, alleging Gupta tipped the
hedge fund manager about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.''s $5 billion
investment in Goldman Sachs, about the New York-based bank''s
quarterly earnings and earnings at Procter  Gamble Co., where
Gupta was also a director. </p>
<p>Gupta denies all allegations of wrongdoing and stands
ready to mount a defense against each and every one of the
commission''s charges, his lawyer, Gary Naftalis, said in the
complaint filed March 18 in Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>In filing his lawsuit, Gupta seeks a jury trial, to have
the SEC barred from seeking civil penalties against him and a
court order keeping it from pursuing administrative claims. </p>
<p>Under SEC rules, Gupta isn''t allowed a jury trial in an
administrative action, or the right to use federal court rules
on discovery, which require the exchange of evidence with the
government, Naftalis said. </p>
<p>Florence Harmon, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to
immediately comment. </p>
<p>Gupta''s name has been mentioned almost daily at the
criminal insider trading trial of Rajaratnam, which began March
8 in Manhattan. The hedge fund manager is accused of earning $45
million by using illegal tips from traders, corporate insiders,
and others including Gupta, the former worldwide director of
McKinsey  Co. Rajaratnam, 53, faces as many as 20 years in
prison if convicted on the most serious charges. </p>
<p>The case is Gupta v. SEC, 11-cv-1900, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>HSBC Was Told About Madoff Fraud Risks'' in Two KPMG Reports </p>
<p> HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Europe''s biggest lender, was warned
twice by auditors that entrusting as much as $8 billion in
client funds to Bernard Madoff opened it up to fraud and
operational risks. </p>
<p>KPMG LLP told the London-based bank about the risks in 2006
and 2008 reports. The firm was hired to review how Madoff
invested and accounted for the funds, for which HSBC served as
custodian. KPMG reported 25 such risks in 2006, and in 2008
found 28, according to copies of the reports obtained by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Twenty-five fraud and related operational risks were
identified throughout the process whereby Madoff LLC receive,
check and account for client funds, KPMG said in the 56-page
report dated Feb. 16, 2006. The limited controls in place may
not prevent fraud or error occurring on client accounts if
management or staff at Madoff LLC either override controls or
undertake activities where appropriate controls are not in
place, according to the report. </p>
<p>A 66-page KPMG report dated Sept. 8, 2008, cited 28 risks
and described them in the same words as the 2006 document. </p>
<p>Irving H. Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC, sued HSBC and a dozen feeder funds
for $9 billion in December in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. The suit was partly based on the KPMG reports and
alleges the bank knew of concerns Madoff''s business was a fraud
and didn''t protect investors. KPMG''s reports haven''t been made
public. Picard has filed more than $50 billion in so-called
clawback suits to compensate victims. </p>
<p>HSBC confirmed hiring KPMG in 2005 and 2008 to review
Madoff''s firm, adding it now believed Madoff had tricked the
auditors. It appears from U.S. government filings that Madoff
and his employees foiled these reviews by, among other things,
providing forged documentation to KPMG, the bank said in an e-
mailed statement. </p>
<p>KPMG did not conclude in either of its reports that a
fraud was being committed by Madoff, HSBC said. HSBC did not
know that a fraud was being committed and lost $1 billion of its
own assets as a victim. </p>
<p>HSBC Spokesman Patrick Humphris, KPMG spokesman Mark
Hamilton and Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard''s lawyers
Baker  Hostetler LLP, all declined to confirm the authenticity
of the reports obtained by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Hurd Letter in HP Lawsuit Must Be Unsealed, Judge Says </p>
<p> Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) was ordered by a judge to release most
of a letter about Chairman Mark Hurd''s involvement with
contractor Jodie Fisher, the relationship that led to his
departure from the company. </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr. ruled
March 17 in Wilmington that Hurd hadn''t shown good cause why the
letter should be kept secret. HP has 10 days to file a mostly
public version of the letter, giving Hurd ample time to
appeal, Parsons said. Several narrow portions of the letter will
remain sealed, the judge said. </p>
<p>Whether or not to seal a document allegedly containing
confidential information does not turn on whether its disclosure
would cause embarrassment, Parsons said in the 70-page ruling
in a lawsuit by shareholder Ernesto Espinoza. </p>
<p>Hurd, 54, had argued that he should have a say in
Espinoza''s demand for company books and records because the
letter, sent by lawyer Gloria Allred on Fisher''s behalf, was
personal and his alone. </p>
<p>We are disappointed with the court''s ruling and will
appeal the matter, Hurd''s lawyer, Amy Wintersheimer, said in
an e-mailed statement.  We believe the letter, which was
clearly marked confidential,'' should remain that way. </p>
<p>Hurd is now a co-president of software maker Oracle Corp. (ORCL) </p>
<p>Hurd resigned as HP''s chairman and chief executive officer
on Aug. 6 after a company investigation determined that he
violated its standards of business conduct. Palo Alto,
California-based HP said it didn''t find that Hurd had violated
its sexual-harassment policy. </p>
<p>The company''s decision to grant Hurd a severance package
valued at as much as $40 million prompted Espinoza to sue HP on
Nov. 18. In his sealed complaint, Espinoza seeks company books
and records as part of an investigation into possible wrongdoing
by directors. </p>
<p>The case is Espinoza v. Hewlett-Packard Co., CA6000,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>
<p>Citic Pacific Must Give Police Lawyers'' Letters, Judge Rules </p>
<p>Citic Pacific Ltd., which delayed reporting a potential
HK$14.7 billion ($1.9 billion) loss, must turn over records of
legal advice to Hong Kong police it got before disclosing a
failed derivatives bet, a judge ruled. </p>
<p>Hong Kong''s Department of Justice said it suspects the
steelmaker and property developer defrauded four banks when it
sought financing without disclosing losses on currency bets. </p>
<p>Based on a review of six documents being contested, there
is a prima facie case of the existence of both a conspiracy to
defraud and of directors or officers of the company making
false statements, Hong Kong High Court Judge Alan Wright said in
a ruling March 18. </p>
<p>Citic Pacific''s wrong-way bets on the Australian dollar in
2008 prompted a bailout from its parent Citic Group, backed by China''s cabinet, and the resignation of its chairman Larry Yung. </p>
<p>Wright dismissed Citic Pacific''s bid to block police access
to the documents and delayed implementing the order until April
1 to give the company an opportunity to file an appeal. False
statements made by officers or directors of a company with the
intent to deceive creditors carries a maximum sentence of 10
years in jail. </p>
<p>Citic Pacific is reviewing the judgment and considering
its response, the company said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Paul Shieh, a lawyer representing Citic Pacific, argued at
a hearing last week that the company could have had entirely
proper, innocuous, and relevant considerations in relation to
the delayed disclosure. </p>
<p>The case is Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) and Secretary of Justice,
Commissioner of Police, HCMP 767/2010 in Hong Kong''s Court of
First Instance. </p>
<p>Christie''s Wins Dismissal of Koch''s Counterfeit Wine Suit </p>
<p>Christie''s International Plc won dismissal of a lawsuit
filed by billionaire collector William Koch that claimed the
auction house induced him into buying counterfeit wine. </p>
<p>The complaint was filed last year in Manhattan federal
court. Koch, who lives in Florida, claimed London-based
Christie''s has sold counterfeit wine for many years. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, in New York, on March 18
granted Christie''s motion to dismiss Koch''s suit, which included
claims of fraud, civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting. </p>
<p>Jones said in her ruling that while Koch said he was
injured by Christie''s misrepresentations, she concluded he
also knew that the bottle was counterfeit prior to making the
purchase. </p>
<p>Koch alleged in his suit that he bought a bottle of 1870
Lafite for $4,200 at a Christie''s auction in order to prove that
it was counterfeit. The judge rejected Koch''s arguments in his
lawsuit. Koch has filed lawsuits against others claiming they
sold him counterfeit wine that allegedly belonged to Thomas
Jefferson and was marked Th.J. </p>
<p>While Koch didn''t claim in this lawsuit that Christie''s had
sold him the counterfeit Jefferson wines, he alleged that
Christie''s had previously auctioned other Th.J. bottles
owned by German wine dealer and former pop music manager Hardy
Rodenstock. Koch claimed he was induced into buying them
from Rodenstock because Christie''s had described the wines
positively in auction catalogues when the wines were sold in
the 1980s. </p>
<p>Koch also sued Rodenstock in 2006 over the wines. A default
judgment was entered against Rodenstock in that case last year. </p>
<p>Jones rejected Koch''s claim that if Christie''s had
disclosed that the bottle was counterfeit Koch would never
have needed to spend $4,200 to purchase the bottle, saying he
was no longer acting as a reasonable consumer. </p>
<p>We have great respect for Mr. Koch but have always
believed his claims were without merit and are therefore
grateful for the court''s decision affirming this, Christie''s
spokesman Toby Usnik said in an e-mail statement. </p>
<p>In the lawsuit, Koch claimed that because Christie''s has
inspected so many wine cellars and bottles of wine, it knew how
to identify counterfeit wine. </p>
<p>Christie''s also has unique access to facts and
circumstances that might call into question the authenticity of
specific wines it handles, Koch alleged in the complaint. </p>
<p>Koch has filed other wine-related suits. In 2007, he sued
Scarsdale, New York-based Zachys Wine Auctions. In 2008, he sued
Chicago Wine Co., Chicago-based Julienne Importing Co. and New
York auction house Acker Merrall  Condit, accusing them of
selling him fakes. </p>
<p>The case is Koch v. Christie''s, 10-cv-2804, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Mets Owners Face New Claims in $1 Billion Madoff Fraud Lawsuit </p>
<p>The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff''s defunct firm filed
new claims against the owners of the New York Mets, saying they
chose to look the other way and invest with the con man
after repeated warnings of fraud. </p>
<p>Trustee Irving Picard revised a $1 billion lawsuit filed in
December to add a claim that the baseball team''s owner, Sterling
Equities Inc., and Madoff created a fraudulent letter agreement,
as part of Sterling''s purchase of the Mets'' broadcast rights
from Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) in 2004, according to a filing
March 18 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The amended complaint sheds more light on the deep
dependency of the Sterling business organization on the
continuation of the Madoff fraud and certain knowledge of
indicia of fraud by the Sterling partners, David Sheehan,
counsel to Picard, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Picard claims that after Madoff''s fraud was disclosed
publicly in December 2008, Sterling Equities restructured its
debt in a manner that attempted to block the trustee from
recovering assets on behalf of Madoff victims, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>The new complaint, at 373 pages, adds eight pages to the
original complaint, which was filed under seal in December and
made public in February. </p>
<p>The amended complaint is the latest chapter in the work
of fiction created by the trustee, team Chairman Fred Wilpon
and President Saul Katz said in a statement. We will pursue a
vigorous legal defense that will set the record straight and
vindicate us. Wilpon and Katz said the trustee concocted his
allegations against them to force a settlement. </p>
<p>Let us be very clear: we did not know that Madoff was
engaged in a fraud, Katz and Wilpon said in an e-mailed news
release. There were no red flags and we received no
warnings. </p>
<p>In the amended complaint, Picard claims that, as the
deadline for closing the Cablevision broadcast rights buyout
deal approached, Sterling took a $54 million, no-interest bridge
loan from Madoff, creating a fraudulent letter agreement falsely
characterizing it as an investment by Madoff''s wife, Ruth
Madoff. </p>
<p>David Cohen, general counsel for the Mets, said in an e-
mailed statement that the $54 million represented funds the
Sterling partners had invested with Madoff, as the trustee
acknowledges. As the trustee also acknowledges, that money was
never used -- and in fact was returned the next day --because
the necessary funds were received from Sterling''s lenders by the
buyout deadline, and were used to fund the buyout. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. Katz, 10-AP-5287, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Citibank Sued for $1.3 Billion by Lehman Brokerage Trustee </p>
<p>A Citigroup Inc. (C) unit was sued by Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ)''s brokerage trustee, who is seeking $1.3 billion for the
bankrupt company''s creditors. </p>
<p>More than $1.3 billion in cash and other assets now held by
Citibank and affiliates should go to creditors, said the
trustee, James Giddens, in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan
bankruptcy court March 18. The trustee claims that Citibank has
no right to keep a $1 billion deposit given to it for foreign-
exchange settlement services. </p>
<p>Another $700 million was given to Citibank as a pledge by Barclays Plc (BARC) as security for the same foreign-exchange
settlements the week the Lehman parent filed for bankruptcy,
Giddens said. Lehman filed Sept. 15, 2008 and the brokerage,
Lehman Brothers Inc., liquidated four days later. </p>
<p>The trustee asked a judge to rule that Citibank willfully
violated the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy law
when it seized the $1 billion deposit on Sept. 19, 2008, which
forbids such transfers, Giddens said. </p>
<p>The brokerage trustee''s suit is one of many in bankruptcy
courts, after creditors seize deposits to compensate them for
pending losses on their loans. The banks argue that under
commercial banking laws they had a right to set off the deposits
against money still owed. Using bankruptcy law, debtors try to
take back the deposits. </p>
<p>Citigroup said earlier this month it could face demands by
Lehman for $3 billion in funds taken around the time of the
Lehman brokerage''s liquidation. </p>
<p>The trustee''s effort to recover these monies is
unjustified and without merit, and Citi will vigorously defend
its right to recover its losses, Citigroup spokeswoman
Danielle Romero-Apsilos said. </p>
<p>Lehman benefited from Citibank''s extension of credit to it
amid panic provoked by its bankruptcy filing, and Citibank
suffered more than $1 billion in losses for helping Lehman, she
said. The money that the Lehman brokerage trustee wants to claw
back was used by Citibank to partly cover losses, she said. </p>
<p>The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). Giddens''s suit is Lehman Brothers Inc. v. Citibank
NA, 11-01681, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>BGC Says Tullett Asking for Massively Inflated Sum'' </p>
<p> BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP) said inter-dealer brokerage competitor Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) is seeking a massively inflated sum after
it won a lawsuit accusing BGC of poaching 10 traders. </p>
<p>There is a great deal of hyperbole regarding Tullett''s
losses, Andrew Hochhauser, a lawyer for BGC, told a London court
March 18 at a hearing to determine damages. Tullett hired
senior hands as replacements for the brokers within six
months, Hochhauser said. The 10 traders were prevented from
working for BGC for a year while the lawsuit was pending. </p>
<p>This was not a mass exodus, Hochhauser said. This is
a claim where 10 brokers left Tullett Prebon in an office that
employs some 600 employees on 55 desks. </p>
<p>The court last year ruled that BGC participated in a
conspiracy to poach Tullett brokers. March 17, a lawyer for
Tullett said BGC owes substantial damages. Tullett and BGC
are keeping the figures private and won''t state them in court,
Tullett lawyer Daniel Oudkerk told Judge Raymond Jack. </p>
<p>Tullett is seeking to recoup lost profits, legal fees,
wasted management time, the cost of steps to safeguard its
interests and the gardening-leave pay to brokers while the
lawsuit was ongoing, Oudkerk said. </p>
<p>Tullett asks the court to look at the desks'' performance
in 2008 and to assume that those results would have continued,
Hochhauser said. That is a defective and unreliable
approach. </p>
<p>The case is Tullett Prebon Plc v. BGC Brokers LP,
HQ09X01241, High Court (London). </p>
<p>Singapore Investors Appeal Ruling on Lehman-Related Losses </p>
<p>A group of 213 investors in Singapore, in a bid to recoup
S$18 million ($14 million) in losses tied to Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., urged the city''s appeal court to overturn a
ruling that dismissed their claim. </p>
<p>DBS Bank Ltd., which sold credit default swaps linked to
Lehman, had inconsistencies in the investment''s prospectus and
pricing statement, the investors said in their appeal filed
March 14. Singapore-based DBS, Southeast Asia''s biggest bank,
had declared the investments to be worthless after Lehman
collapsed in 2008. </p>
<p>The inconsistency stemmed from an obvious clerical
error, Judge Lee Seiu Kin said in a Dec. 10 ruling, dismissing
the lawsuit. Statements on how the investment value would be
calculated in a credit event, such as Lehman''s collapse, weren''t
meant to be comprehensive, mathematical formulae and were
instead general descriptions, Lee said in his decision. </p>
<p>While DBS insists on holding us to the strict terms of
the contract, they seek to avoid liability by relying on what
they call a clerical error, the group, represented by lawyer
Siraj Omar, said in an e-mailed statement March 18. DBS had sold
its DBS High Notes 5 as a safe, low-risk investment, lulling the
investors into having a false sense of security, the group
said. </p>
<p>The appeal is scheduled to be heard in the week of May 23. </p>
<p>Jenny Lee, a DBS spokeswoman, said the bank doesn''t comment
on legal matter in progress. </p>
<p>The case is Soon Kok Tiang and Others v. DBS Bank Ltd.

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>IBM Said to Pay $10 Million to Settle SEC Bribery Claims </p>
<p> International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) agreed to pay $10
million to settle accusations by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that it gave cash and gifts to Chinese and
South Korean officials in exchange for computer contracts,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the settlement. </p>
<p>The company will pay $5.3 million in disgorgement, $2.7
million in interest and a penalty of $2 million to settle a
lawsuit filed March 18 in federal court in Washington. The SEC
alleged the bribes, which included travel and entertainment,
occurred from 1998 through 2009 in violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act. </p>
<p>The improper payments were made by employees at three
subsidiaries of Armonk, New York-based IBM, as well as LG IBM PC
Co., a joint venture between the company and LG Electronics
Inc., according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The SEC said cash payments to South Korean officials from
1998 to 2003 totaled $207,000. In China, the IBM employees
created slush funds at local travel agencies that were used
to pay for overseas excursions by Chinese government officials. </p>
<p>IBM spokesman Ed Barbini said he couldn''t immediately
comment on the lawsuit or settlement. </p>
<p>The case is SEC v. International Business Machines Corp.,
11-cv-00563, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). </p>
<p>3M Agrees to Pay $12 Million to Settle Discrimination Suit </p>
<p> 3M Co. (MMM), the maker of products including Scotch tape and Post-it Notes, agreed to pay as much as $12 million to settle an
age discrimination lawsuit. </p>
<p>Under the agreement, which is subject to approval by the
Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota, 3M will
resolve the claims of about 7,000 members of the class
represented by the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The proposed settlement provides a reasonable resolution
that allows the company to avoid ongoing investments in time and
legal fees, Marschall Smith, 3M general counsel, said in a
statement. We believe the resolution will allow the company
and our employees to focus on growing our business and serving
our customers. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, all employed by 3M in Minnesota, claimed
that the company systematically discriminated against workers
over the age of 46 from 2001 to 2005. Management perceived older
workers as less able or willing to accept and apply new
business methodologies adopted by the company, according to
the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Clifford L. Whitaker v. 3M Co., 62-C4-04-
012239, Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota). </p>

<p>Goldman, Law Firms Hire U.K. Lawyers for Bribery Act Work </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and U.S. law firms are luring
lawyers away from the U.K. fraud prosecutor as companies prepare
to comply with the world''s most draconian anti-bribery law. </p>
<p>The U.K. Ministry of Justice has said it will introduce new
proposals as soon as next week, leaving companies scrambling to
hire lawyers to help prepare compliance plans. Under the law,
U.K. companies without adequate controls to prevent corruption
may be prosecuted if a bribe is paid by third parties on their
behalf anywhere in the world, even if officials didn''t know. </p>
<p>Kwadjo Adjepong, who worked on the Serious Fraud Office''s
probe into the collapse of London hedge fund Weavering Capital,
joined Goldman Sachs as a vice president in its compliance
department last month, SFO spokesman David Jones said. Covington
 Burling LLP, White  Case LLP and Arnold  Porter LLP have
also hired lawyers from the SFO as the Bribery Act creates work
for firms preparing compliance plans. </p>
<p>Washington-based Arnold  Porter in February said it hired
Kathleen Harris, the former head of the SFO fraud business
group, as a partner in its London office. Charlie Monteith, a
senior policy adviser and the head of assurance at the agency,
left for New York-based White  Case. </p>
<p>Another former SFO prosecutor, Matthew Cowie, who oversaw
an investigation of BAE Systems Plc, left in June to join the
U.S. law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley (MS) recommended bullish
options on South Korea stocks, saying the Asian nation will
benefit from uncertainties about the Japanese recovery. </p>
<p>South Korea has the industries such as auto and steel that
can substitute for the drop in Japanese production, equity
derivatives analysts including Viktor Hjort said in a report to
clients dated March 18. The analysts also favored call options
on Brazilian stocks, saying that food inflation seems to be in
check while strong demand may allow the economy to grow 4
percent this year. </p>
<p>Within emerging markets, we favor 3-month 110% calls in
Brazil on the Bovespa for 1.3%, owing to a modestly constructive
fundamental story within EM and a commodity producer status,
the analysts said. We also like 3-month 105% calls on the
KOSPI for 1.9% given low relative volatility and steep skew. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, reached a settlement with asbestos claimants that may
bring an end to its Quigley unit''s seven-year-old bankruptcy
case. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein refused to allow
Quigley to exit Chapter 11 court protection in September, saying
Pfizer had manipulated the bankruptcy process to benefit itself.
Pfizer and a committee of asbestos claimants entered into an
agreement on March 20 that may resolve their dispute over
claims, according to court papers filed yesterday in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The accord resolves the legal and equitable issues that
existed under that plan, including enhancing distributions for
current claimants and future demand holders, improving
reorganized Quigley''s long-term feasibility, and rectifying
concerns regarding good faith, lawyers for Quigley wrote. </p>
<p>Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. Under the deal, which requires court
approval, asbestos claimants would vote in favor of Quigley''s
bankruptcy plan and waive all rights to a jury trial. </p>
<p>In exchange, Pfizer would contribute $264.9 million in cash
and all of the stock in a reorganized Quigley to a trust to pay
asbestos claims. New York-based Pfizer also would forgive its
own claims against the non-operating unit, according to a draft
of the plan. </p>
<p>Best Interests'' </p>
<p>Once Quigley''s reorganization plan is presented to and
confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, asbestos-related
liability arising from Quigley will be resolved through a fund
established as part of the bankruptcy reorganization, Pfizer
spokesman Christopher Loder said in a statement. The agreement
is in the best interests of the company, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer in November reported a $701 million third-quarter
charge for asbestos litigation for Quigley. The ad hoc
committee, representing 43,100 asbestos claimants, had asked the
court to lift an injunction that has barred them from bringing
claims against Pfizer since 2004. </p>
<p>Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry that contained asbestos from the 1940s to the 1970s.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Here''s a little secret the Federal
Reserve Board doesn''t want you to know. On Sept. 24, 2008, while
financial markets were collapsing, Morgan Stanley borrowed $3.5
billion through the Fed''s oldest lending program, the 98-year-
old discount window. </p>
<p>The Fed has long claimed that releasing this type of data
could trigger bank runs, public hysteria, death spirals at
financial institutions large and small, and other horrible
outcomes. Yet I''ve got a hunch Morgan Stanley somehow will
survive this revelation. Mass panic will not ensue. The world
will not end. </p>
<p>This is the kind of information the late Bloomberg News
reporter Mark Pittman was seeking when he filed a Freedom of
Information Act request with the Fed in May 2008, nine months
after the financial crisis began. Among other things, he asked
for documents showing which banks had borrowed money under the
Fed''s emergency-lending programs and the details of those loans. </p>
<p>The Fed blew off his request. Bloomberg LP, the parent of
Bloomberg News, responded by suing the central bank. The company
won both at the district court level and on appeal. This week,
the Supreme Court decided to let those rulings stand. And so
almost three years after Pittman sent his original FOIA letter,
the Fed finally will have to comply with the law. </p>
<p>Fox News is pressing a similar request concerning Fed loans
from August 2007 to November 2008. Much of the information the
two companies sought has been disclosed already. The Dodd-Frank
Act, which President Barack Obama signed last July, forced the
Fed to release details of many of its bailout programs. Still,
the Fed has yet to divulge which banks borrowed through its
discount-window program. It won''t be long now, though. </p>
<p>Stigma Avoidance </p>
<p>The discount window functions as a lifesaver through which
qualifying borrowers can secure emergency liquidity during times
of severe stress. Historically the Fed had kept the names of
borrowers confidential on the grounds that disclosure could
stigmatize them in the public''s eyes, even though it was the
public''s money the Fed was lending. </p>
<p>As it turns out, the information about Morgan Stanley (MS)''s
$3.5 billion discount-window loan has been sitting on the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission''s website since last month.
The panel didn''t mention it in its final report. And nobody had
written a story about it before. So there: Now it can be told. </p>
<p>You can see the raw data by clicking here. The link takes
you to a Morgan Stanley spreadsheet showing the company''s day-
to-day liquidity changes during a two-week period in September
2008 when the New York-based bank was fighting for survival.
(You may need to magnify the pages 400 percent to see all the
numbers.) </p>
<p>Confidential'' </p>
<p>The loan came three days after Morgan Stanley said it had
received Fed approval to become a bank holding company, giving
it access to the discount window for the first time. </p>
<p>A Morgan Stanley spokesman, Mark Lake, confirmed that my
reading of the spreadsheet is correct. The bank had stamped the
document confidential treatment requested when it handed it
over to the crisis commission. The panel released it anyway,
apparently seeing no harm. </p>
<p>The Fed''s arguments for keeping this sort of data secret
were transparently bogus. One Fed economist, Brian Madigan, said
in an affidavit that disclosing discount-window borrowers'' names
can quickly place an institution in a weakened condition vis-
a-vis its competitors by causing a loss of public confidence in
the institution, a sudden outflow of deposits (a run''), a loss
of confidence by market analysts, a drop in the institution''s
stock price, and a withdrawal of market sources of liquidity. </p>
<p>Inherent Risk'' </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan rejected
that line of reasoning as bunk. </p>
<p>The risk of looking weak to competitors and shareholders
is an inherent risk of market participation, she wrote in her
August 2009 decision ordering the Fed to release the documents.
Information tending to increase that risk does not make the
information privileged or confidential. The Second Circuit
Court of Appeals in New York upheld her ruling. </p>
<p>Still, the banking industry kept fighting. Identifying
banks that tapped the discount window during the credit crisis
would be harmful even years after the fact, the Clearing House
Association, representing the largest U.S. commercial banks,
wrote in an October 2010 petition asking the Supreme Court to
intervene. Disclosure would let the public observe their
borrowing patterns during the recent financial crisis and draw
inferences -- whether justified or not -- about their current
financial conditions, it said. </p>
<p>New Requirements </p>
<p>They''ll just have to get used to that, though. Under Dodd-
Frank, the Fed will be required to publish details of its
discount-window loans, including borrowers'' identities, after
two years. That''s why the Obama administration stepped in last
year and urged the high court not to take up the case, saying
the new disclosure rules made an appeal by the Fed unnecessary. </p>
<p>This whole sorry exercise by the Fed has shown the central
bank at its worst. The Fed lost on the merits. Yet it succeeded
in serving notice that anyone who challenges its judgments must
be prepared to spend absurd amounts of time and money on
litigation as the price for busting its wall of secrecy and
holding its leaders accountable. </p>
<p>Most citizens, and news organizations, would be deterred by
such tactics. Mark Pittman, who died on Nov. 25, 2009, must be
smiling. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) sued Allied
Systems Ltd., seeking to force the vehicle hauler to return cars
being held at Allied facilities. </p>
<p>Defendant is holding hostage 1,704 new GM vehicles, with
an estimated value of $46.6 million, GM said yesterday in a
complaint in federal court in Detroit. Allied simply has no
claim to the vehicles; they are GM''s property, the carmaker
said. </p>
<p>GM, based in Detroit, said Allied breached a contract and
asked the court to order Allied to return the vehicles
immediately and award damages. Allied is a subsidiary of Allied
Systems Holding Inc. in Atlanta. </p>
<p>Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S. automaker operated by Fiat
SpA (F), said yesterday it sued Allied in Canada to force the
supplier to return 700 vehicles being held at facilities in
Windsor, Ontario. The suit was filed in Ontario Superior Court,
Chrysler said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Allied, one of Chrysler''s finished vehicle hauling
suppliers, made the decision to stop servicing us as well as
other automakers, said Katie Hepler, a Chrysler spokeswoman
We have re-sourced the business to other suppliers and are
working to ensure a smooth transition. </p>
<p>John Blount, a spokesman for Allied in Atlanta, didn''t
immediately return phone calls seeking comment. </p>
<h2>March 29 Hearing </h2>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Marianne O. Battani set a hearing
for March 29 in the GM suit, ordering Allied to appear in court
to show cause, if any, why plaintiffs should not be awarded
possession of the 1,704 vehicles. </p>
<p>If Allied doesn''t appear at the hearing, she might issue an
order directing Allied to release the vehicles, Battani said. </p>
<p>Chrysler won a court order for immediate access to 200 of
the vehicles, Hepler said today in an e-mail. Chrysler has
recovered these vehicles. The Windsor court will hold a
hearing on the recovery of the rest either March 28 or March 29,
she said. </p>
<p>The case is General Motors Holdings LLC v. Allied Systems
Ltd., 2:11-cv-11162, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of

<p>General Mills Inc. (GIS), the maker of
Cheerios cereal, said third-quarter profit increased 18 percent
as sales of yogurt and snacks advanced. </p>
<p>Net income in the period ended Feb. 27 rose to $392.1
million, or 59 cents a share, the Minneapolis-based company said
today in a statement. Excluding the impact of commodity hedges,
earnings were 56 cents, matching the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>General Mills, which has the license to distribute Yoplait
in the U.S., said sales in that division climbed 1 percent,
while snack revenue advanced 14 percent. The company is in
exclusive talks to buy half of the French yogurt maker from PAI
Partners for 810 million euros ($1.15 billion) to expand the
brand in developing countries. </p>
<p>We view yogurt as an attractive category and see
opportunity for Mills to leverage its existing sales and
innovation capabilities to drive growth internationally,
Edward Aaron, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a
report this week. The Denver-based analyst rates the shares
outperform. </p>
<p>Industrywide, food makers face rising costs for raw
ingredients like wheat and sugar, which has led General Mills
Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell to raise prices on cereal.
The company expects materials costs to rise as much as 5 percent
this year, and possibly more in the next. </p>
<p>The shares fell 21 cents to $36.91 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. They had added 3.7 percent
this year before today. </p>
<p>General Mills also reaffirmed its fiscal 2011 profit
forecast of $2.46 to $2.48 per share. Sales increased 1.6
percent to $3.65 billion, compared with the $3.69 billion
analyst average. </p>

<p>An experimental drug made by Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) slowed deadly pancreatic cancer in a study that revealed a
new treatment approach that tricks the immune system to attack
tissue protecting tumors, researchers said. </p>
<p>Four of 21 patients with incurable pancreatic cancer had
their tumors shrink after being given the drug, known as CP-
870,893, along with Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)''s Gemzar chemotherapy,
according to the study published today in the journal Science.
The median time before the disease progressed was 5.6 months
compared with 2.3 months expected for patients taking just
chemotherapy, researchers said. More surprising, biopsied tissue
samples showed the treatment didn''t do what scientists expected. </p>
<p>Designed to activate immune system T-cells to attack the
tumor, tests revealed the Pfizer drug instead spurred an
abundance of white blood cells, called macrophages. Those cells,
which normally protect tumors, had been retrained to attack the
cellular structures supporting the cancer, the scientists said. </p>
<p>Until now, we thought the immune system needed to attack
the cancer directly in order to be effective, said lead author
Robert Vonderheide, a cancer professor at the University of
Pennsylvania''s Abramson Cancer Center, in an interview. We
think that this may be a general approach for treating other
types of solid tumors. </p>
<p>In addition to the four patients who had their tumors
shrink, 11 patients had their disease stabilize. The cancer
eventually progressed for all of the patients in the study. </p>
<p>Seeking Evidence </p>
<p>Now that researchers understand how the drug worked, they
are working on ways to boost the macrophage response,
Vonderheide said. The trial was in the first round of human
tests typically used to evaluate safety and dosing. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, is currently
conducting two early tests using the drug to treat melanoma,
said Vonderheide, who is working on one of the studies, which
combines the treatment with another experimental Pfizer
antibody. </p>
<p>The medicine still requires larger successful tests, which
typically take years to conduct, before the New York-based
company might seek regulatory approval. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares rose 38 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $20.30 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 16 percent this year. </p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer kills about 37,000 people in the U.S.
each year, according to estimates by the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Just 4 percent of patients are
still alive five years after being diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, based in
Atlanta. </p>
<p>The report published today includes clinical trial results
and laboratory results in mice. It is an example of a new model
of research that speeds discoveries by taking results in humans
back to the lab to conduct tests in genetically engineered mice.
The study team was made up of laboratory scientists and clinical
doctors, Vonderheide said. </p>

production, according to a separate filing with the California

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. has added an
index of global foreign-exchange volatility that tracks options
on currencies of major and developing nations. </p>
<p>The global index is designed to complement two JPMorgan
indexes that follow implied volatility on major currencies and
emerging-market currencies, which the bank began in 2006.
Implied volatility, which traders quote and use to set option
prices, signals the expected pace of swings in the underlying
currency. </p>
<p>Despite much faster growth in the emerging market options
market turnover over the past decade, Group of 10 currencies
still constitute almost 85 percent of foreign exchange options
turnover globally, JPMorgan currency strategists John Normand
in London and Arindam Sandilya in New York wrote in a report to
clients today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the world''s sixth biggest currency trader,
according to Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc.  Deutsche
Bank AG is the largest. </p>
<p>The bank rebalanced the weighting of options on individual
currency pairs in its two original indexes based on average
daily turnover figures reported in the latest Bank for
International Settlements'' triennial survey released in August. </p>
<p>Implied Volatility </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s indexes are formulated from implied volatility
on three-month options, with individual weightings based on BIS
daily turnover percentages. JPMorgan averaged the prior two BIS
triennial surveys, using those from 2010 and 2007. Previously,
the weightings used the 2004 and 2001 survey data. All
currencies are versus the U.S. dollar. </p>
<p>The implied volatility on the global index is 10.42 percent
today, down from a peak during the past 12 months of 16.8
percent touched in May. The major nations'' index was at 10.69
percent and that tracking emerging currencies was at 8.93
percent. </p>
<p>The bank''s index tracking major exchange rates was expanded
to include nine currencies versus the dollar, up from six.
Movements in New Zealand dollar, Norwegian krone and Swedish
krona options have been added to those for the currencies of
Japan, the euro zone, the U.K., France, Italy and Canada. </p>
<p>Options on the euro against the dollar account for the
largest weighting in the major index at 36.3 percent, while the
dollar against the yen accounts for the second-largest at 31.8
percent. These were the top two weighted pairs in the original
index as well. </p>
<p>Foreign-exchange trading rose 20 percent to $4 trillion a
day on average in the three years to 2007, according to details
from the 2010 BIS triennial survey reported in August. Some 85
percent of currency trades in the three-year period involved the
dollar while Europe''s single currency portion was 39 percent,
the BIS report showed. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s emerging-market implied volatility index was
expanded to track three-month options on 13 currencies against
the U.S. dollar, up from 7. Among the additions, were the
currencies of Turkey, India and Hungary. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued the
Florida law firm of Ben-Ezra  Katz to force it to return files
of foreclosure cases in which the firm represented the bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said in a complaint filed March 25 in federal
court in Miami that the files include thousands of original
promissory notes, mortgages and other documents that evidence
and secure loans worth more than $400 million. The New York-
based bank seeks a court order forcing Ben-Ezra to return the
files and unspecified damages. </p>
<p>The Florida attorney general''s office is investigating law
firms in the state that handle residential foreclosure cases on
behalf of lenders. The probes focus on whether the firms were
fabricating and/or presenting false and misleading documents
in foreclosure cases, according to the attorney general''s
website. </p>
<p>On March 25, the attorney general said she had reached a
$2 million settlement with one of the firms, the Law Offices of
Marshall C. Watson. Ben-Ezra, based in Fort Lauderdale, is one
of four law firms still under investigation, the office said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan terminated Ben-Ezra on March 8, according to the
complaint. The law firm refuses to return the files because it
claims it is owed $5 million, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>We are working to resolve the issues raised in the
lawsuit, Ben-Ezra said today in a statement. We don''t
believe at this point that the differences are insurmountable,
and we are seeking to reach a satisfactory conclusion. </p>
<p>In a separate lawsuit filed March 14 in state court in
Miami, the law firm of David J. Stern sued Chase Home Finance,
claiming the firm was owed $398,980. Stern''s firm is also under
investigation by the Florida attorney general''s office. </p>
<p>The case is JPMorgan Chase Bank v. Ben-Ezra  Katz,
11-60655, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami.) </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s South African
unit said it will invest 475 million rand ($69 million) in as
many as 10 black-owned software development companies to fulfil
its obligations to the government to uplift the country''s black
majority. </p>
<p>We will support these companies over a period of seven
years, Mteto Nyati, the unit''s managing director, said by phone
from Johannesburg yesterday. Our consultants will work with
them to put together a package and a business plan. We will fund
whatever is relevant for that particular company to meet its own
stated objectives of growth. </p>
<p>South Africa''s government has been pushing companies to
sell stakes to black investors and hire and promote more black
staff to address racial imbalances that persist in Africa''s
largest economy, 17 years after the end of all-white rule. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which has a global policy of not selling stakes
in its units, was granted permission to implement an alternative

<p>Microsoft will sign agreements later today with four
software developers that were selected from 683 applicants, the
company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. They are:

<p>Walter Investment Management Corp. (WAC),
the Tampa, Florida-based mortgage servicer and investor, agreed
to acquire GTCS Holdings LLC from Centerbridge Capital Partners
LLC for $745 million as it expands loan servicing. </p>
<p>The entire transaction, including debt, is valued at $1.065
billion, Walter said today in a regulatory filing. GTCS, known
as Green Tree and based in St. Paul, Minnesota, provides
services such as billing and collection on a $37 billion
portfolio, including residential mortgages, manufactured housing
loans and consumer loans, the filing shows. After the deal,
Walter will no longer qualify as a real estate investment trust. </p>
<p>With the acquisition of Green Tree, Walter Investment
will be uniquely positioned to capture a significant share of
the growing specialty mortgage-services sector, said Mark J.
O''Brien, Walter''s chairman and chief executive officer, in a
separate statement. </p>
<p>Walter will issue 1.8 million shares to the seller and $765
million in new debt to acquire Green Tree''s equity, repay Green
Tree''s obligations and cover expenses of the transaction,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>This acquisition allows Walter to capitalize on the
company''s strong market share and fantastic management, New
York-based Centerbridge said in a statement. The private-equity
company purchased Green Tree for an undisclosed amount in 2007. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) advised Walter, and Simpson Thacher
 Bartlett LLP provided legal counsel. Morgan Stanley (MS) advised
Green Tree with Willkie Farr  Gallagher LLP providing legal

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s decision to
be the sole lender on a $20 billion loan to ATT Inc. (T) is a
credit negative for the bank and may encourage other lenders
to take on more risk, Moody''s Investors Service said. </p>
<p>JPM''s large ATT commitment highlights how the risk
profile of a capital markets business can change quickly,
analyst Sean Jones wrote today in a research note. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the lone underwriter on the bridge loan to ATT
in its $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG''s U.S. wireless
unit T-Mobile USA Inc. Moody''s called the deal a credit negative
for JPMorgan''s corporate debt because it shows the bank''s
willingness to finance riskier deals to win a spot as an adviser
on the acquisition. </p>
<p>We assumed they would sell down the loan, Jones said in
an interview. JPMorgan is planning to syndicate the loan to
several other lenders, according to a person involved with the
deal, who asked not to be named because the talks are private.
The tail risk scenario is that the loan cannot be sold and
becomes non-performing, Jones wrote. Shares of JPMorgan rose
10 cents to $46.96 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. </p>
<p>Even by JPMorgan''s standards, the loan is big at 17 percent
of the New York-based bank''s Tier 1 common equity as of Dec. 31,
Moody''s said. It''s rare for a loan of that size to be
concentrated at a single bank, according to Moody''s. </p>

<p>(Corrects company name in final paragraph.) </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) appointed Wei Christianson and William Strong as co-chief executive officers
for the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, replacing Owen Thomas, who is moving back to the U.S. </p>
<p>Christianson, 54, will continue to run Morgan Stanley''s
China business in addition to her new role, the New York-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Strong, 58, is
currently vice chairman of investment banking and head of the
U.S. Midwestern region, according to the release. </p>
<p>Under Christianson, Morgan Stanley got regulatory approval
for an underwriting venture in China after selling its stake in
China International Capital Corp., the Sino-foreign investment
bank it helped set up in 1995. Morgan Stanley was the top-ranked
arranger of stock sales overseas by Chinese companies in the
past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Bill and Wei are two of our most experienced and
respected bankers, Colm Kelleher, Morgan Stanley''s co-head of
institutional securities, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Strong will relocate to Hong Kong, while Christianson will
continue to be based in Beijing, Morgan Stanley said. Thomas
announced this month he would return to the U.S. after about
three years in Hong Kong, citing family reasons and
declining to say whether he''ll remain at the company. His
predecessor, Hans Schuettler, resigned after less than two years
on the job. </p>
<p>Sixth in MA </p>
<p>Strong joined Morgan Stanley in 1993 from Salomon Brothers,
where he was head of international investment banking based in
London. He was responsible for the firm''s investment banking
activities in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley ranked sixth in advising on mergers
involving Chinese companies in the past 12 months, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. In the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan, the
firm was second in MA advisory after UBS AG in the period and
held the same position in equity underwriting, the data show. </p>
<p>The firm generated 20 percent of its revenue in the first
nine months of 2010 from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and
10 percent from Asia. </p>
<p>Investment banking fees earned by securities firms in Asia
may rise 29 percent this year to $25.3 billion, outperforming
fees generated from Europe and the Americas, according to New
York-based research firm Freeman  Co. </p>
<p>Christianson first joined Morgan Stanley in 1998, and
worked at Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. from 2002 to
2006, according to the statement. She rejoined Morgan Stanley in
2006 to run its China business. </p>
<p>CICC Sale </p>
<p>The banker scored a victory in December, when Morgan
Stanley sold its 34 percent stake in Beijing-based CICC to KKR 
Co., TPG Capital, Singapore''s Great Eastern Holdings Ltd. and
Government of Singapore Investment Corp., saying the deal would
result in a $700 million pretax profit. </p>
<p>Unloading the CICC stake was a precondition for Morgan
Stanley to gain regulatory approval for a securities joint
venture in China that it can exert influence over. The firm lost
management control of CICC in 2000 after the last of three CEOs
appointed by Morgan Stanley resigned. </p>
<p>In January, Morgan Stanley said it will create a joint
venture with Huaxin Securities Co. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
UBS have been operating Chinese underwriting ventures for years. </p>

<p>Visa advanced $2.03, or 2.8 percent, to $74.23 at 4:15 p.m.

in 2011. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday
that the central bank wouldn''t meet an April 21 deadline to come
up with a final rule on debit-card transaction fees. The so-
called Durbin amendment''s cap on swipe fees, mandated by the
Dodd-Frank law that overhauled the financial industry last year,
must be in place by July 21. </p>
<p>There is increasingly a likelihood that the harsh first
draft may be watered down significantly, Christopher Brendler,
an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus  Co., wrote to investors today.
This delay and Bernanke''s comments add to the growing
political momentum against the Durbin amendment. Last week,
Durbin himself tried to delay a vote on the Tester bill until
after the April 21 Fed release of the final rules. </p>
<p>U.S. Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, is pushing for
a vote as soon as this week on a bill that could delay the cap
by two years. </p>
<p>Brendler rates both Visa and MasterCard buy, according

benefit to a lesser extent from the delay, he wrote. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s biggest
soft-drink maker, said its bottled-water plants in Japan are
running 24 hours a day to meet demand amid fears of tap water
contamination from a crippled nuclear power plant. </p>
<p>The irradiated water scare affects every part of Japan,
Kei Sakaguchi, a Tokyo-based spokesman at unit Coca-Cola (Japan)
Co., said today in a phone interview. We''re making a full
assessment of our product schedule and gave priority to some
products including water and tea, he said. </p>
<p>Companies including Coca-Cola, Fast Retailing Co. and
Toyota Motor Corp. are trying to lessen disruptions of supply to
survivors of the March 11 earthquake, the strongest on record to
hit Japan, and the ensuing tsunami. The government last week
asked beverage makers to increase production of bottled water
after revelations of rising contamination in water and food
triggered bulk buying. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola may import 1 million cases of mineral water from
South Korea this weekend to meet demand in the Tohoku region,
the worst affected by the tsunami, as well as Tokyo and its
surrounding regions, Sakaguchi said. Suntory Holdings Ltd. and
Kirin Holdings Co. also boosted orders for imported water. </p>
<p>Nestle SA, the maker of Pure Life and Perrier, donated
20,000 cases, or 500,000 bottles of water to Japan, according to
an e-mailed statement. Danone (BN), which manufactures Volvic and
Evian, said in an e-mailed statement that shipments of water to
Japan have increased since the earthquake. </p>
<p>Water Demand </p>
<p>Demand for bottled water has led to shortages across
various supermarkets and even Japan''s ubiquitous convenience
stores, research analysts Kentaro Taniguchi and Tomoko
Takanoura wrote in a Euromonitor International report on March
22. Sales of bottled water may benefit from the expected
shortage of potable water. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola, Japan''s second-biggest bottled-water maker by
market share, has 28 plants operated by 12 bottlers in Japan and
seven of them produce water, Sakaguchi said. Suntory had 30.9
percent of the nation''s bottled-water market last year, followed
by Coca-Cola''s 15.9 percent and Kirin''s 10.4 percent, according

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the securities firm
that became a bank holding company in 2008, borrowed as much as
$6.9 billion from the Federal Reserve''s discount window that
October as it leaned on U.S. aid to avoid insolvency. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley borrowed $3.63 billion through Morgan
Stanley  Co. and $3.25 billion through its Morgan Stanley Bank
N.A. subsidiary on Oct. 9, 2008, according to Fed documents
released today in response to a Freedom of Information Act
request. The firm''s borrowing from the discount window dropped
to $1.25 billion on Oct. 27, and Morgan Stanley didn''t have any
outstanding borrowings starting on Oct. 29, the data show. </p>
<p>The documents provide the most detailed view yet of lenders
that relied most heavily on the Fed''s primary lending program as
markets and funding seized up after Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. failed. The Fed agreed Sept. 21, 2008, to let Morgan
Stanley and rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) become bank holding
companies, giving them access to the discount window, a cheap
borrowing source traditionally reserved for commercial banks. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
borrowed as much as $100.5 billion at its peak on Sept. 29,
2008, from two other Fed programs, according to data the central
bank released in December of last year. That includes $61.3
billion from the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and $39.2
billion from the Term Securities Lending Facility, the data
show. </p>
<p>The borrowing occurred during a time of immense financial
turmoil throughout the banking sector and the broader market,
Morgan Stanley said in a statement on Dec. 1. Mark Lake, a
spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Total borrowing by banks using the discount window, the
Fed''s oldest lending program, rose to a record $110.7 billion in
the week ended Oct. 29, 2008, according to previously released
data. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, borrowed at least $5.9 billion from
the Federal Reserve''s discount window over six months during the
height of the financial crisis. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had previously disclosed it borrowed $500 million
on Aug. 22, 2007, as similar loans were made to Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Wachovia Corp. to display the effectiveness of the
facility, according to a joint statement at the time. JPMorgan
accessed the program at least four more times through April
2008, according to documents released today under a Freedom of
Information Act request by Bloomberg News and Fox News. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told reporters in
Washington yesterday that the release of the data will make it
harder for people to use the discount window in the future. At
JPMorgan, he said, we never intend to use the discount
window in the future. Howard Opinsky, a JPMorgan spokesman,
declined to comment today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan took a $625 million overnight loan from the Fed on
Oct. 16, 2007, the day before the New York-based bank reported a
third-quarter profit of $3.4 billion, according to the Fed
documents. Dimon told analysts on an Oct. 17 conference call
that he was working with executives at Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank
of America to set up an $80 billion fund to buy bad assets from
structured investment vehicles, a plan later abandoned. </p>
<p>Tapping Discount Window </p>
<p>JPMorgan later borrowed $3.5 billion from the Fed''s
discount window, secured by $83.8 billion in mortgage, consumer
and commercial loans, on Jan. 16, 2008, the documents show. The
bank reported that day a 34 percent drop in net income to $2.97
billion for the fourth quarter of 2007. </p>
<p>The bank accessed the Fed window again on March 7, 2008,
for a $175 million overnight loan and on April 4, 2008, for
$1.13 billion. The bank announced April 3 that it paid
$140.7 million for 11.5 million shares of Bear Stearns Cos.
about a week earlier to help close that acquisition. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had previously reported that it borrowed from the
Federal Reserve discount window as well as from other central
banks. The amount, timing and terms had never been disclosed. </p>
<p>Although considered as a source of available liquidity,
the firm does not view borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve
Bank discount window and various other central banks as a
primary source of funding, the lender said in a recent filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>JPMorgan accepted $25 billion from the U.S. Troubled Asset
Relief Program during the financial crisis and repaid the funds
in June 2009. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) tapped the
Federal Reserve''s discount window at least five times since
September 2008, according to central bank data that contradict
an executive''s testimony last year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Bank USA, a unit of the company, took
overnight loans from the Federal Reserve on Sept. 23, Oct. 1,
and Oct. 23 in 2008 as well as on Sept. 9, 2009, and Jan. 11,
2010, according to the data released today. The largest loan was
$50 million on Sept. 23 and the smallest was $1 million on the
most recent two occasions. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission June 30 that
we used it one night at the request of the Fed to make sure
our systems were linked with their systems, and it was for a de
minimis amount of money. Peter J. Wallison, a member of the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, then asked, you never had
to use it after that? </p>
<p>No, and as I said, we used it on the Fed''s request,
Cohn replied. </p>
<p>The amounts are dwarfed by Goldman Sachs''s overall balance
sheet, which was $911 billion at the end of 2010, and by other
banks'' borrowing throughout the financial crisis. Dexia SA, the
lender based in Brussels and Paris, drew $31.5 billion on one
day as total weekly borrowing reached a record in October 2008. </p>

<p>BP Plc and Morgan Stanley bought
North Sea Forties crude at prices little changed from yesterday.
India Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought Nigerian Qua Iboe oil from
Morgan Stanley, and Indian Oil Corp. is seeking more crude. </p>
<p>North Sea </p>
<p>BP bought one shipment of Forties for loading April 12 to
April 14 from Total SA at 20 cents above benchmark Dated Brent,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
daily Platts trading window. Morgan Stanley bought another cargo
for April 17 to April 19 from Trafigura Beheer BV at the same
premium, the survey showed. </p>
<p>Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window that ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior to the
window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future cost 19
cents more than Dated Brent yesterday, compared with a premium
of 22 cents March 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Brent for May settlement traded at $116.87 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, up from $115.23 yesterday. The June contract was at
$116.75, 12 cents below May. </p>
<p>No bids or offers were placed for Russian Urals in
northwest Europe for the third day. The grade was assessed at
$3.91 a barrel below Dated Brent today, unchanged from
yesterday, the Bloomberg data showed. </p>
<p>BG Group Plc, the U.K''s third-largest natural gas producer,
said its North Sea Everest and Lomond fields will resume output
within a few weeks. </p>
<p>The share of North Sea Buzzard crude in the Forties oil
blend fell to 26 percent in the week to March 27, from 31
percent a week earlier, BP Plc said today on its website. </p>
<p>Mediterranean </p>
<p>Petraco Oil Co. failed to sell 140,000 metric tons of Urals
loading for April 17 to April 21 in the Mediterranean even after
it lowered the offer by 10 cents to $3.20 a barrel less than
Dated Brent, the survey showed. </p>
<p>Eni SpA sought to buy 80,000 tons of Urals for April 14 to
April 18 at $3.40 below Dated Brent without success, while Vitol
Group withdrew its earlier offer for the same volume for April
17 to April 21 at a discount of $3.10 to the benchmark,
according to the survey. </p>
<p>OAO Surgutneftegaz sold 100,000 tons of Urals crude for
loading April 13 to April 14 from the Baltic Sea port Primorsk
to Repsol YPF SA through a spot tender, according to three
traders who participate in the market. </p>
<p>West Africa </p>
<p>Bharat Petroleum, India''s second-largest state-run oil
refiner, bought about 2 million barrels of Nigeria''s Qua Iboe
crude for loading in May from Morgan Stanley, three people who
participate in the market said today. </p>
<p>Indian Oil Corp., the country''s biggest refiner, issued its
fourth spot tender for May-loading crude and the first one for
June, official documents obtained by Bloomberg News show. Both
tenders will be awarded April 7. </p>
<p>Two Congo''s N''Kossa shipments for May loading and one Djeno

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lifted its
target for five-year Treasury yields on trade recommendation
that seeks to profit from a drop in the price of the security,
saying the outlook for growth and inflation is becoming less
friendly for bonds. </p>
<p>The bank, one of the 20 primary dealers that trade with the
Federal Reserve, lifted its target to 2.5 percent from 2.3
percent. The five-year note yielded 1.94 percent when Goldman
recommended shorting the security on March 18, which is a bet
prices will fall. The notes yield 2.19 percent today. </p>
<p>Higher global food and energy prices will keep inflation
elevated at least until the summer and core inflation, which
strips out those components, is beginning to form a bottom in
developed economies, Goldman strategists wrote in a note today.
Inflation erodes the fixed payments of bonds. </p>
<p>Survey-based measures of longer-dated inflation have
increased in various countries, most notably in the U.S.,
Francesco Garzarelli, chief interest-rate strategist at Goldman
Sachs in London, said in the note. In reaction to these
shifts, central banks will verbally emphasize their inflation-
fighting commitment or, like in euroland, start tightening
policy. </p>
<p>The firm''s bond valuation model as well as other economic
analysis suggest fading a bigger increase in yields than the
one we envisage, as underlying inflation pressures may
ultimately remain relatively contained, Garzarelli said. </p>
<p>The consumer-price index increased 0.5 percent in February,
the most since June 2009, figures from the Labor Department said
March 17. Economists projected a 0.4 percent gain, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Excluding food
and fuel costs, the core gauge rose 0.2 percent for a second
month, also more than estimated. </p>
<p>Goldman predicts 10-year Treasury yields will range from 3.5
percent to 3.75 percent in the second quarter and end the year at
3.75 percent. The notes yield 3.41 percent. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) filed a formal
complaint with European antitrust regulators about Google Inc. (GOOG)''s
dominance of the Internet search market in the region. </p>
<p>Google bars competitors from accessing its YouTube video
site for search results and has kept phones running Microsoft''s
operating system from working properly with YouTube, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said in a blog posting by General
Counsel Brad Smith. </p>
<p>A Microsoft unit and two other rivals last year lodged a
complaint with the European Union, which is investigating
whether Google has violated the region''s antitrust laws. Google
is under growing pressure from global regulators that are
probing whether the company uses its dominance of Web search to
thwart competition. </p>
<p>Our filing today focuses on a pattern of actions that
Google has taken to entrench its dominance in the markets for
online search and search advertising to the detriment of
European consumers, Smith wrote in the blog posting. </p>
<p>While Microsoft and partner Yahoo! Inc. have about a
quarter of the U.S. search market and Google the rest, Google
has almost 95 percent of the market in Europe, Smith said,
citing data from regulators. </p>
<p>Google is not surprised that Microsoft has complained
because its advertising unit, Ciao from Bing, filed a complaint
last year, said Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels. </p>
<p>Happy to Explain'' </p>
<p>We continue to discuss the case with the European
Commission and we''re happy to explain to anyone how our business
works, he said in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the European Commission in
Brussels, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Google shares fell 0.7 percent to 411 euros and Microsoft
fell 0.03 percent to 18.15 euros at 9:18 a.m. in Frankfurt
trading. </p>
<p>Besides cordoning off YouTube, Google is also seeking to
block access to content owned by book publishers and restricting
its own advertisers from accessing the data they put in Google
servers as part of ad campaigns, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google has engaged in a broadening pattern
of walling off access to content and data that competitors need
to provide search results to consumers and to attract
advertisers, Smith said in the blog. Microsoft is the world''s
largest software maker. </p>
<p>Search Boxes </p>
<p>Google also has signed contracts that block top European
websites from distributing rival search boxes, Microsoft said.
For example, Microsoft can''t distribute some e-mail and document
services through certain European telecommunications companies
that have contracts with Google because these services make use
of Bing search boxes, Smith said. </p>
<p>The EU said in November that it''s investigating whether
Google''s AdSense contracts prevent publishers from striking
deals to place ads from other services on their sites. It''s also
looking at claims Google limits advertisers'' ability to move
data such as key search terms from AdWords to another service. </p>
<p>Google said in a statement in November that it worked
hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry by
marking ads clearly and enabling users and advertisers to move
data to other services. </p>
<p>There''s always going to be room for improvement and so
we''ll be working with the commission to address any concerns,
Mountain View, California-based Google said in the November
statement. </p>

<p>Derek Jeter''s 3,000th career hit
may come down to a ruling by Jordan Sprechman far uptown from
his Park Avenue office as a managing director at JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>Sprechman and Howie Karpin, an on-air anchor for Sirius
Satellite Radio, will moonlight this season as the two primary
official scorers for Major League Baseball''s New York Yankees
and Mets, earning $150 a game and trying to stay unnoticed and
free of controversy. </p>
<p>Jeter needs 74 hits to become the 28th player to reach
3,000 and the only one to do so entirely in a Yankee uniform.
His 2,000th hit, in May 2006, was on a judgment call by Bill
Shannon, Sprechman and Karpin''s scoring mentor who died on Oct.
26. Whether a milestone moment or a mid-September meeting of
last-place clubs, Shannon preached that you can''t let the
situation dictate the scoring call. </p>
<p>There''s no such thing as a big game in baseball,
Sprechman, a 49-year-old wealth adviser from Manhattan, said in
an interview. They all count for 1/162nd of a season. </p>
<p>Baseball''s regular season begins today with six games,
including the Detroit Tigers'' visit to Yankee Stadium, which
will be scored by Sprechman. </p>
<p>An accredited scorer for New York baseball since 2000,
Sprechman was promoted from part-time status to succeed Shannon,
who was an official scorer at Yankees and Mets games for 32
seasons before dying at age 69 in a New Jersey house fire, six
days after handling the Yankees'' final 2010 victory in Game 5 of
the American League Championship Series. </p>
<p>He was totally respected by everybody and considered the
authority, said Karpin, 56, a lifelong Bronx resident who has
scored New York baseball since 1998. If it wasn''t for him, I
wouldn''t be a scorer. </p>
<p>Scorer''s Call </p>
<p>Jeter''s 2,000th hit came on a slow roller in front of home
plate that produced an errant throw by Kansas City Royals
catcher Paul Bako. Shannon ruled that Jeter would have beaten
the throw. </p>
<p>Not unlike umpiring, scoring is a mostly thankless job that
draws notice only when someone thinks a ruling is controversial,
said Phyllis Merhige, who oversees the accredited scorers in
baseball''s 30 major-league ballparks. </p>
<p>It does take a special breed, a great passion for the
game and a great desire to make a contribution, Merhige said
in a telephone interview from her New York office. It doesn''t
pay all that well, it does take a lot of free time and most of
these guys have other jobs. </p>
<p>Sharing the Duties </p>
<p>Sprechman and Karpin will split 140 New York area contests
while giving the rest to backups Billy Altman and David Freeman.
The scorer''s responsibilities include deciding whether a batted
ball is a hit or an error, and whether a pitch that gets by the
catcher is a passed ball or a wild pitch, and occasionally,
which pitcher gets a victory. </p>
<p>What Bill always said was that the purpose of errors was
to protect the pitcher from the malfeasance of his fielders,
Sprechman said. Errors are not designed to be punitive.
They''re designed to protect the pitcher''s ERA. </p>
<p>When he leaves his office for the press boxes at Citi Field
in Queens or Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, Sprechman said, it''s
most important that he bring along both his judgment and
decisiveness. </p>
<p>In what I do here as a wealth adviser, you have to be
confident, he said in the interview at the headquarters of
JPMorgan Chase, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets. You
have to do the same thing at the ballpark. Your judgment could
be outstanding as a scorer but if you don''t present well, your
judgment is always going to be suspect. </p>
<p>Historic Call </p>
<p>A scoring decision can have historic ramifications. </p>
<p>Former Tigers pitcher Virgil Trucks is one of four to throw
two no-hitters in a single major-league regular season. The
second came amid controversy. </p>
<p>In the third inning of a 1952 game at Yankee Stadium, New
York''s Phil Rizzuto was called safe on a close play at first
base after Tigers shortstop Johnny Pesky bobbled a one-hop
ground ball. </p>
<p>John Drebinger of the New York Times, the game''s official
scorer, called the play an error, then changed his mind. </p>
<p>When I went in the dugout, there was an error on the
wall, Trucks, now 93, said in a telephone interview. When I
came back out, I saw a hit. </p>
<p>Dugout Call </p>
<p>Trucks said Drebinger, under pressure from other reporters,
called the Tigers'' dugout during the seventh inning to talk to
Pesky, who said he had erred. Drebinger then changed his ruling
back to an error. Six outs later, the no-hitter was secured, and
almost six decades later, Trucks still signs memorabilia with
the date -- Aug. 25, 1952. </p>
<p>Nothing could overcome something like pitching a no-
hitter in Yankee Stadium, Trucks, nicknamed Fire, said
from his Calera, Alabama, home. </p>
<p>Sprechman, who also is the public address announcer in the
media room at tennis''s U.S. Open and a member of the New York
Jets'' statistics crew, said his most memorable scoring effort
was Curt Schilling''s Bloody Sock Game win over the Yankees
for the Boston Red Sox in the 2004 playoffs. Schilling pitched
Boston to victory while an incision in his foot from a temporary
surgery that allowed him to play bled through his sock. </p>
<p>Karpin, the author of the new book 162-0: Imagine a Mets
Perfect Season, is the only scorer in major league history to
name a winning pitcher in a no-hitter. He gave the victory to
Brad Lidge on June 11, 2003, after six Houston Astros combined
to no-hit the Yankees. </p>
<p>Clean Play </p>
<p>Karpin and Sprechman said they''ve had confrontations with
players angry over their decisions. Both said their biggest hope
is that feats such as Jeter''s 3,000th hit come on clean plays. </p>
<p>If Jeter performs up to his career average, he''s poised to
get No. 3,000 on June 9 at Yankee Stadium in the finale of a
three-game series against Boston. </p>
<p>I''ve got that Red Sox series, Karpin said with a laugh.
Oh, boy. That''ll be a beauty. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and its partner in a
proposed theme park in Shanghai scheduled an April 8
groundbreaking for the project, according to people with
knowledge of the plans. </p>
<p>Disney scheduled an event, with government-owned partner
Shanghai Shendi Group Co., in an e-mail today, without
elaborating. Construction begins that day, said the people, who
weren''t authorized to speak publicly. </p>
<p>The start of construction marks a milestone in a five-year
process involving negotiations with city and central government
officials. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger and Parks 
Resorts Chairman Thomas Staggs will attend, said one of the
people. The park''s size, investment commitments and final
approval from Beijing''s central government will be announced as
well, the people said. </p>
<p>Iger said at the shareholder meeting on March 23 that
Disney, the world''s largest theme-park operator, was close to
receiving final approval for its first resort on mainland China,
the world''s most-populous nation. A public-comment period on the
plans ends on April 6. </p>
<p>The Magic Kingdom will open in about five years, Staggs
said at an investor meeting on Feb. 17. The first phase calls
for an investment of 24.5 billion yuan ($3.7 billion), Han Zheng, Shanghai''s mayor, said in March. </p>
<p>The website Hexun.com reported earlier today the companies
may start construction this month. </p>
<p>Tourist Zone </p>
<p>Shanghai has designated a 7-square-kilometer (1,730 acres)
tourist zone that will include the Disney park. The first phase
will also include hotels, car parks, a lake and commuter
stations, according to a blueprint posted on the Shanghai city
website last month. </p>
<p>Iger declared Disney''s intention to build a Shanghai resort
in September 2005, as he was about to become CEO. The company
received an initial government approval to build the park in
2009. The company signed a contract in November with Shanghai
Shendi to build the facility. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 24 cents $42.85
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
added 14 percent this year. </p>
<p>Shanghai also plans to spend 4 billion yuan on a 9.2-
kilometer (5.7-mile) subway line for the complex in the city''s
Pudong area. Construction will begin in September and the line
is scheduled to open by July 2015, according to a Jan. 18
government statement. </p>
<p>The city government started building infrastructure for the
project last year, Jiang Shujie, deputy director of the city''s
construction and transport commission, said on Jan. 7. </p>

<p>The trustee liquidating Bernard
Madoff''s collapsed firm said JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) shouldn''t
escape facing his $6.4 billion lawsuit in bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>The issue of JPMC''s misconduct belongs before the
bankruptcy court as the court most versed in the nuances of the
Ponzi scheme and the roles of other, related wrongdoers in that
scheme, Irving Picard, the trustee, said in a filing March 30
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. JPMC seeks refuge in this
court to escape the scrutiny of the bankruptcy court, he said. </p>
<p>Picard sued JPMorgan in December, claiming the bank aided
the confidence man''s fraud. Denying wrongdoing, New York-based
JPMorgan said it had a right to a jury trial in the district
court. Picard''s suit raised unsettled questions of law
beyond the expertise of a bankruptcy court, the bank said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan no doubt hopes to distance itself both from the
thousands of victims of that scheme and from other alleged
wrongdoers, Picard said in the filing. Yet there is no
escaping the fact that JPMC was at the very center of Madoff''s
Ponzi scheme. It was the debtor''s primary banker for over two
decades and touched virtually every cent that flowed through the
Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. He''s serving a 150-year sentence in
federal prison in North Carolina. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 1:11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Mortgage Brokers Win Bid to Block Fed''s Loan Fee Rule </p>
<p>Two trade groups representing mortgage brokers won an
appeals court ruling temporarily blocking a Federal Reserve rule
that limits commissions for loan officers in mortgage
transactions from taking effect today. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington granted emergency
motions from the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and
the National Association of Independent Housing Professionals
which argue the rule unfairly penalize brokers, who won''t be
able to pay loan officers from consumer-paid fees. </p>
<p>The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the
court sufficient opportunity to consider the merits of the
motions for emergency relief, the court said in its order. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell on March 30 rejected the
groups'' request to stop the provision from taking effect,
finding that public policy interests outweighed harm to the
mortgage-broker industry. </p>
<p>The board has reasonably concluded that the rule will
further public policy interests, a position that is further
supported by the Dodd-Frank Act, which also includes provisions
restricting certain loan-compensation practices, Howell said
in a 46-page opinion, referring to the law that overhauled the
financial industry last year. </p>
<p>The trade groups filed separate lawsuits and appeals
challenging the regulation. </p>
<p>The Fed rule, part of the central bank''s effort to fix
weaknesses in mortgage finance, is aimed at preventing mortgage
originators from receiving more compensation for selling home
loans with higher interest rates. </p>
<p>Susan Stawick, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve,
didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment
after regular business hours yesterday. </p>
<p>Marc Savitt, president of the National Association of
Independent Housing Professionals, said We''re glad the judges
issued the stay. </p>
<p>Once they have the opportunity to review the entire case,
we think they''ll agree with us that the Fed did not have the
authority to issue the rule, Savitt said. </p>
<p>The cases are National Association of Mortgage Brokers v.
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 11-5078 and
National Association of Independent Housing Professionals Inc.
v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 11-5079,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). </p>
<p>Toyota Agrees on Handling of Its Secret Code in Lawsuits </p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) and lawyers suing the carmaker over
alleged unintended sudden acceleration reached an accord on how
to handle evidence involving the source code Toyota uses in its
vehicles, a lawyer said. </p>
<p>We do have an agreement, said Mark Robinson, one of the
lead lawyers for the plaintiffs in the consolidated federal
lawsuits in Santa Ana, California. The judge has approved the
plan between Toyota and the plaintiffs to allow us access to
Toyota''s source code with security protection given to Toyota. </p>
<p>Access to the source code for Toyota''s electronic throttle-
control system has been an obstacle in moving the first of the
hundreds of cases involved to trial by early 2013, U.S. District
Judge James V. Selna has said. Selna, who is overseeing the
case, yesterday ordered the details of the agreement sealed. </p>
<p>The two sides have been wrestling for several months over
how the plaintiffs'' attorneys and their experts can analyze the
source code for the automaker''s electronic system, which the
plaintiffs have said in court papers is critical to determining
whether it played a part in alleged sudden acceleration. </p>
<p>Toyota is pleased to have reached an agreement on a
source code protective order that ensures the security and
strict confidentiality of this invaluable intellectual
property, Celeste Migliore, a spokeswoman for Toyota Motor
Sales USA in Torrance, California, said in a statement. </p>
<p>The cases are combined as In re Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Santa Ana). </p>
<p>JJ Shareholders Missing Bull Market With Hip Recalls Mounting </p>
<p>In November 2005, Lance Corporal Cody Perkins, a 20-year-
old U.S. Marine, was injured by a roadside bomb outside Haditha,
Iraq, Bloomberg News''s David Voreacos, Alex Nussbaum and Greg
Farrell report. </p>
<p>Perkins suffered scrapes, bruises and a fractured femur, or
thigh bone. About a year later, he received a metal-on-metal
prosthetic hip made by DePuy Orthopaedics, a unit of Johnson 
Johnson. (JNJ) The new hip was being promoted as tough and durable --
and thus perfect for younger, physically active patients like
Perkins. By late 2009, however, he began experiencing pain. </p>
<p>The cause of his trouble, his current physician said, isn''t
a complication from his original injury but the replacement hip.
Perkins has been told he''ll need to undergo revision surgery
to replace the ASR hip with another implant -- a highly invasive
procedure with a heightened risk of infection and joint
dislocations down the road. </p>
<p>Perkins has joined more than 1,000 other people who are
suing Johnson  Johnson over its DePuy ASR implants, Bloomberg
Businessweek reports in its April 4 issue. Those plaintiffs seek
damages for medical costs, lost wages, and pain and suffering. </p>
<p>With $28 billion in holdings of cash and short-term
securities at the end of 2010, JJ will likely weather the
financial blowback from the bad hips. More troubling to
customers and stakeholders, however, is that the DePuy recalls
may be symptoms of a systemic quality-control problem at the
125-year-old corporation: a pattern of behavior that is
distinctly at odds with the comforting image long enjoyed by the
creator of brands like Band-Aid and No More Tears Baby
Shampoo. </p>
<p>The DePuy crisis is one of more than 50 voluntary product
recalls that JJ has issued just since the start of 2010,
covering brand names that read like an inventory of the family
medicine cabinet. Tylenol and St. Joseph Aspirin were recalled
for foul odors that people said made them sick. Benadryl and
Zyrtec were recalled for botched amounts of ingredients. Rolaids
were recalled for containing bits of wood and metal. </p>
<p>Johnson  Johnson management, from Chief Executive Officer
William Weldon on down, maintains that the company''s quality-
control issues are aberrations. Any suggestion of a broader
malaise, said Weldon, is just Monday-morning quarterbacking. </p>

<p>Winifred Jiau Withdraws Bail Application, to Remain Jailed </p>
<p>Winifred Jiau, the expert-network consultant charged in a
U.S. probe of insider trading, withdrew her bail application and
the judge presiding over her case ruled she will remain jailed
because she is likely to flee if freed. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, in New York, who held two
bail hearings for Jiau that lasted more than four hours last
month, said in his order issued yesterday that it was
unlikely that even if Jiau found more or different people to
co-sign her bond, it would be sufficient to change the court''s
view that no combination of conditions would reasonably assure
defendant''s appearance if she were not detained. </p>
<p>Jiau, a former consultant for Primary Global Research LLC,
was indicted March 9 on insider-trading charges along with
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager Donald
Longueuil. </p>
<p>Both have pleaded not guilty. Her lawyer, Joanna Hendon,
wrote to Rakoff on March 28 saying she was withdrawing the
request to grant Jiau bail. The letter was publicly filed
yesterday. </p>
<p>Jiau, of Fremont, California, has been in custody since she
was arrested Dec. 28. She was initially granted release on
$500,000 bond, U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson in New York
on March 2 ordered Jiau held without bail, saying it was
unmistakably clear she would flee the U.S. if released. The
case was later reassigned to Rakoff. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court,

<p>Ex-Taylor Bean CEO Allen Named as Defendant in U.S. Case </p>
<p>The former chief executive officer of Taylor, Bean 
Whitaker Mortgage Corp., Paul R. Allen, was named as a criminal
defendant in federal court in Virginia four days before the
company''s ex-chairman is scheduled for trial on accusations of
fraud. </p>
<p>No charges were specified on the court''s electronic docket
against Allen, a former senior executive at Freddie Mac, the
government-supported mortgage lender. Another former Taylor Bean
official identified Allen in court yesterday as a co-conspirator
in a fraud scheme that deceived financial firms by covering up
cash shortfalls at the company. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have charged six people in the conspiracy,
which allegedly was masterminded by the company''s former
chairman, Lee Farkas. Five people, including two officials from
Colonial Bank, have pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against
Farkas, whose trial on 16 counts of bank, wire and securities
fraud is scheduled to begin April 4. </p>
<p>Sean Ragland, 37, a former senior financial analyst at
Taylor Bean, said in court yesterday in Alexandria, Virginia,
that Allen, who lives in Oakton, Virginia, was aware that a
Taylor Bean entity created to fund mortgage loans was running up
a significant deficit. Ragland pleaded guilty to single charge
of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. </p>
<p>Allen didn''t return a telephone message seeking comment. </p>
<p>The cases are U.S. v. Allen, 11-cr-00165; U.S. v. Ragland,
11-cr-00162, and U.S. v. Farkas, 10-cr-00200, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). </p>
<p>Cephalon Accused of Failing to Weigh Valeant Buyout Bid </p>
<p>Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) officials were accused in a lawsuit by a
Pennsylvania pension fund of failing to act in the best
interests of investors regarding a $5.7 billion buyout bid by
rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) </p>
<p>Cephalon, a maker of sleep and pain drugs, said yesterday
that it will consider the bid next week. In its complaint, the
pension fund claimed the company has been shortchanging
shareholders by not considering the $73-a-share hostile offer. </p>
<p>The company''s directors are failing to act in the
interest of Cephalon stockholders by turning away repeated
offers by the Canadian drugmaker, lawyers for the Dauphin County
pension plan said in a Delaware Chancery Court suit filed
yesterday in Wilmington. The company and its board of
directors have repeatedly refused duly to consider acquisition
proposals from Valeant. </p>
<p>Cephalon, based in Frazier, Pennsylvania, surged more than
28 percent on March 30 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after
Mississauga, Ontario-based Valeant made its cash offer public.
The acquisition would be the largest hostile takeover in the
industry since Sanofi-Aventis SA bid for Genzyme Corp. last
year. Cephalon closed at $76.08 yesterday. </p>
<p>Our board of directors will meet early next week to
consider Valeant''s proposal, Natalie de Vane, a Cephalon
spokeswoman, said yesterday in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Cassandra Bujarski, a spokeswoman for Valeant, didn''t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the suit or the
statement by Cephalon. </p>
<p>The fund wants a Delaware judge to force Cephalon''s board
to consider Valeant''s offer and bar use of the company''s so-
called poison-pill defense to frustrate the buyout bid,
according to the lawsuit. That defense makes acquisitions more
expensive. </p>
<p>The case is County of Dauphin Retirement Plan v. Winger, CA
NO. 6332, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>
<p>Ex-WestLB Employees Charged Over Volkswagen Trading Losses </p>
<p>Three former WestLB AG traders and two external brokers
were charged by Dusseldorf prosecutors over speculation on
Volkswagen AG (VOW) shares during 2006 and 2007. </p>
<p>The WestLB employees were betting on the gap between the
carmaker''s common and preferred shares and their trading
resulted in damages of 48 million euros ($68 million), Ralf
Moellmann, spokesman for the Dusseldorf prosecutors'' office said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The former WestLB traders, who worked in the bank''s global
markets section, are charged with share-price manipulation and
breach of trust. The two external brokers helped the three
WestLB workers make the trades, according to the statement. The
suspects weren''t identified. </p>
<p>The losses stem from transactions in which WestLB''s traders
bet the gap between common and preferred shares would narrow.
The probe led to former executives who were investigated for
failing to inform the lender''s supervisory board about the
trading risks agreeing last year to pay 445,000 euros to settle
the claims. Prosecutors at the time said the probe looked into
600 million euros in losses WestLB had from speculative trading
by its own staff. </p>

<p>Microsoft Complaint May Expand Scope of Google Antitrust Probe </p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s antitrust complaint against Google Inc. (GOOG)
may expand an existing European Union probe beyond Internet
searches to online video and mobile phones. </p>
<p>Google bars rivals from search boxes on websites, hinders
advertisers from transferring campaign data between search ad
platforms and blocks phones running Microsoft''s operating system
from working properly with YouTube, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in a blog posting by General Counsel Brad Smith. </p>
<p>The complaint to EU regulators in Brussels threatens to
widen a probe started last year after a Microsoft unit and two
other rivals last year complained that the company''s dominance
chokes off advertising revenue. Google has almost 95 percent of
the search market in Europe, Microsoft''s Smith said, citing data
from regulators. </p>
<p>These allegations cover new and difficult ground and, if
Google fights, clearly increase the likelihood of a long
investigation, said Matthew Hall, an antitrust lawyer at
McGuire Woods LLP in Brussels. </p>
<p>Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the European Commission,
said the antitrust investigation is still at the preliminary
stage and that regulators would inform Google about the
complaint and ask for its views on it. </p>
<p>Google is not surprised that Microsoft complained
because its advertising subsidiary, Ciao from Bing, also filed a
complaint last year, said Al Verney, a spokesman for Mountain
View, California-based Google in Brussels. </p>
<p>We continue to discuss the case with the European
Commission and we''re happy to explain to anyone how our business
works, Verney said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. </p>

<p>Ex-Galleon Manager Spars With Rajaratnam Attorney Over Trades </p>
<p>Former Galleon Group LLC portfolio manager Adam Smith and a
defense lawyer for Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge-fund''s co-founder,
sparred over why the firm bought stock in ATI Technologies
before a 2006 takeover. </p>
<p>During cross-examination yesterday, the defense attorney,
Terence Lynam, sought to show jurors that Galleon and Rajaratnam
bought shares in ATI and other companies for lawful reasons and
not because Smith, 39, had come into inside information, as he
testified this week as a prosecution witness. Lynam said, for
instance, that Rajaratnam didn''t buy stock at the same time
Smith did. </p>
<p>He''s not buying when you''re buying? Lynam asked Smith
about purchases of Intersil Corp. (ISIL) Smith had testified that he
got leaks from an Intersil insider and passed them to his boss. </p>
<p>Lynam also asked questions suggesting his client didn''t
grasp that Smith was referring to a source of inside information
during a phone call between the two that the government secretly
taped. </p>
<p>You have no idea that when you got on the phone and
mentioned Kamal, that he knew who that was? Lynam asked Smith.
Jurors previously heard a recording of Smith telling Rajaratnam
that Kamal -- who he said was Kamal Ahmed, a Morgan Stanley
investment banker -- said Vishay Intertechnology Inc. (VSH) may be
selling itself. </p>
<p>Ahmed, who has not been charged, denies wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial in Manhattan federal court in
the largest crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S.
history. The Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of making
$45 million from tips by corporate insiders. Rajaratnam denies
wrongdoing, saying he based trades on research and published
sources. </p>

<p>Tony Chan Seeks Top Court Review of Ruling Over Wang Estate </p>
<p>Nina Wang''s former feng shui adviser and lover Tony Chan
asked for a review by Hong Kong''s highest court of a ruling that
denied his claim to the estate of the late property tycoon. </p>
<p>Chan has a right to a hearing as the amount in dispute is
more than HK$1 million ($128,400), his lawyer Anderson Chow told
the Court of Appeal yesterday. The court''s conclusion that Chan
had forged Wang''s will is also a grave and serious finding,
Chow said. </p>
<p>Judge Doreen Le Pichon adjourned the hearing after about an
hour and said the three-judge panel would deliver a decision on
Chan''s request in due course. </p>
<p>Chan, 51, is free on HK$5 million bail, having been
arrested on suspicion of forgery after Hong Kong''s High Court
first ruled against him in 2010. The Court of Appeal on Feb. 14
upheld that decision and ordered Wang''s estate, valued at $12
billion by lawyers for its administrators, to go to charity. </p>
<p>Chan claimed Wang left him her fortune after a 15-year
intimate relationship that began when he was hired to help find
her kidnapped husband Teddy, with whom she built the Chinachem
Group. </p>
<p>Wang''s 2002 will, which the appeal judges said was
indisputably valid, bequeathed the estate to Chinachem
Charitable Foundation Ltd. that she created with Teddy in 1988.
Supervision of the charity was to be entrusted to a body formed
by the Secretary General of the United Nations, the premier of
China and the chief executive of Hong Kong, according to the
appeal ruling. </p>
<p>The case is between Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited
and Chan Chun Chuen and the Secretary for Justice, CACV62/2010
in the Hong Kong High Court of Appeal. </p>
<p>Trial Lawyers Scour Jury''s Profiles on Facebook, Twitter </p>
<p>When jurors were chosen for the perjury trial of baseball
star Barry Bonds last month, they were barred from using social
media in regards to the case. Such a ban doesn''t extend to
lawyers, who mine Facebook Inc. profiles of jurors to unearth a
bias that might hurt or help their side, Bloomberg''s Ryan Flinn
reports. </p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter Inc. and other services have become a
major resource for both prosecutors and defense attorneys,
letting them glean more insight than they can get from jury
questionnaires, said Joseph Rice, chief executive officer of
Jury Research Institute in Alamo, California. </p>
<p>Social media has given us an incredible tool, because
it''s something jurors voluntarily engage in, and they post
information about their activities or affiliations or hobbies,
Rice said. That reveals their life experience or attitude that
may have an impact on how they view the facts of the case. </p>
<p>The practice adds fuel to the debate over social-networking
privacy and whether Internet postings should be used to reject
someone from a job or academic program -- or a seat in the jury
box. Facebook has more than 500 million users, while Twitter
members post 140 million messages daily. That yields a wealth of
data that lawyers can use to screen people or hone arguments. </p>

<p>Fed Releases Discount-Window Loan Records Under Court Order </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve released thousands of pages of secret
loan documents under court order, almost three years after
Bloomberg LP first requested details of the central bank''s
unprecedented support to banks during the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The records -- 894 files in PDF form that must be
individually opened and read -- reveal for the first time the
names of financial institutions that borrowed directly from the
central bank through the so-called discount window. The Fed
provided the documents after the U.S. Supreme Court last month
rejected a banking industry group''s attempt to shield them from
public view. </p>
<p>This is an enormous breakthrough in the public
interest, said Walker Todd, a former Cleveland Fed attorney
who has written research on the Fed lending facility. They
have long wanted to keep the discount window confidential. They
have always felt strongly about this. They don''t want to tell
the public who they are lending to. </p>
<p>The central bank has never revealed identities of borrowers
since the discount window began lending in 1914. The Dodd-Frank
law exempted the facility last year when it required the Fed to
release details of emergency programs that extended $3.3
trillion to financial institutions to stem the credit crisis.
While Congress mandated disclosure of discount-window loans made
after July 21, 2010, with a two-year delay, the records released
yesterday represent the only public source of details on
discount-window lending during the crisis. </p>
<p>The Fed documents released yesterday show the central bank
providing credit to borrowers large and small. A page described
as Primary Credit Originations, February 5, 2008 lists the
New York branch of Deutsche Bank AG with a loan of $455 million
from the New York Fed. On the same day, Macon Bank is listed
with a $1,000 loan from the Richmond Fed. </p>
<p>Lending through the discount window soared to a peak of
$111 billion on Oct. 29, 2008, as credit markets nearly froze in
the wake of the bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) While the loans provided banks with backstop cash,
the public has never known which banks borrowed or why. Fed
officials say all the loans made through the program during the
crisis have been repaid with interest. </p>
<p>Former Fed officials, lawyers representing the central
bank, and even some Fed watchers have expressed concern that
revealing the names of discount-window borrowers could keep
banks away from the facility in the future. </p>

<p>High Lehman, Madoff Fees Might Deplete SIPC, Official Says </p>
<p>High fees paid to the trustees of bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.''s brokerage and of Bernard Madoff''s collapsed firm
might deplete the $2.5 billion fund of the Securities Investor
Protection Corp., according to a report by the Securities and
Exchange Commission''s Inspector General. </p>
<p>The report assesses how well the SEC is doing in overseeing
SIPC, which liquidates bankrupt brokerages to pay creditors.
There is significant criticism and concern over the
brokerage trustees'' fees in the Lehman and Madoff bankruptcies,
according to the report. The SEC must make systematic
inspections to ensure cost-effective liquidations, it said. </p>
<p>Lehman brokerage trustee James Giddens and his law firm
were paid about $108 million in the 24 months from Lehman''s
September 2008 bankruptcy through September 2010, the report
said, citing court documents. Madoff trustee Irving Picard and
his law firm were paid about $102 million in the 21 months from
December 2008, when Madoff was arrested, through September 2010,
it said. </p>
<p>As the liquidations are far from over, fees paid to date
for both the Lehman and Madoff liquidations are a mere fraction
of the amounts that will eventually be sought, the report
said. </p>
<p>The last time the SEC inspected SIPC thoroughly was in
2003, with a follow-up in 2005, it said. </p>
<p>In the SEC''s inspection of SIPC, the SEC identified
several deficiencies in SIPC''s operations regarding its controls
over fees, an improperly denied claim, internal policies and
guidance, education initiative and funding options, it said. </p>
<p>Yet the SEC failed to set up a review schedule and scope
for inspections, the Inspector General said. As a result, 14
liquidations from 2003 until today haven''t been scrutinized by
the SEC, according to the audit report. </p>
<p>SIPC''s board constantly monitors the SIPC fund to assure
that the corporation has sufficient assets to fulfill all of
SIPC''s statutory missions, Stephen Harbeck, SIPC''s president,
said in an e-mail. Adding to resources, SIPC''s members are
currently paying assessments of one quarter of one percent of
their net operating revenues to SIPC, he said. </p>
<p>Neither Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, nor Jake
Sargent, a Giddens spokesman, responded to e-mails requesting
comment. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein $19
million in compensation for 2010, almost double the prior year,
and granted him the first cash bonus in three years. </p>
<p>The total includes $5.4 million in cash, $12.6 million in

benefits, the New York-based firm''s proxy statement showed.
Blankfein''s $9.8 million pay for 2009 included $9 million in
restricted stock plus salary and other compensation. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
boosted Blankfein''s compensation for a year in which earnings
dropped 38 percent and the stock price was little changed. The
amount falls in the middle ground between 2008, when Blankfein,
56, and six other senior officers got no bonuses, and the
record-setting $67.9 million award he received for 2007. </p>
<p>The fact that they would return to a more market-based
pay is probably not surprising after lower amounts for 2008
and 2009, said Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner at
Compensation Advisory Partners LLC in New York. They''re not
quite back to anything remotely like what they paid in the prior
years. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s 2010 share performance -- a decline of less
than half of 1 percent -- outstripped competitors including Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second-
biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs before both
converted to banks in 2008. Shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
which reported a record profit last year, rose 1.8 percent
during the year. </p>
<p>Matching Bonuses </p>
<p>All 30 members of the Goldman Sachs management committee
received only restricted stock for their 2009 bonuses and four
of them -- Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55,
President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, and Vice
Chairmen J. Michael Evans, 53, and John S. Weinberg, 54 --
received exactly the same $9 million award as Blankfein. </p>
<p>For 2010, Goldman Sachs once again matched all of those
four executives'' bonuses to Blankfein''s $12.6 million in
restricted stock and $5.4 million in cash. All four also
received a $600,000 salary in 2010. </p>
<p>They''ve had a history of paying their top five like
partners, Orens said. It''s unusual, but it really comes from
their partnership mentality. </p>
<p>The firm disclosed in January that Blankfein''s salary will
increase to $2 million in 2011 and that Cohn, Viniar, Evans and
Weinberg will each receive a $1.85 million salary starting this
year. Each of them had received a $600,000 salary since 1999,
the year the firm became a public company. </p>
<p>Gain From Investments </p>
<p>Blankfein and eight deputies reaped a total of $125 million
during 2010 from their investments in private equity and hedge
funds managed by the firm, the proxy disclosed. Blankfein''s
payments, which included profits and any return of capital,
totaled $27.2 million, outstripping his compensation. </p>
<p>After Blankfein, the largest fund distributions were $23.3
million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; $20.2 million to
Cohn; $16.7 million to Viniar; and $13.7 million to Evans. The
others disclosed in the filing were $10.9 million to Vice
Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; $6.4 million apiece to Weinberg
and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and $430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of compliance. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s executives stand to earn more cash bonuses
in future years under a long-term incentive plan disclosed in
the proxy. The payments are contingent on two financial
measures: return on equity and book value per share. </p>
<p>Board''s Choice </p>
<p>The initial measurement period is three years and the board
can extend it through the end of 2018. The notional value of the
award for all five executives named in the proxy was $7 million,
a figure that wasn''t included in the 2010 compensation because
it won''t be delivered for three years. </p>
<p>The SEC requires that the company''s proxy disclose how much
compensation executives received during the fiscal year. Under
that methodology, which includes awards received during 2010 for
performance in prior years, Blankfein received a total of $14.1
million in compensation. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s board has unanimously recommended that the
firm give shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation every year. </p>
<p>The firm is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting at
9:30 a.m. on May 6 in Jersey City, New Jersey. </p>
