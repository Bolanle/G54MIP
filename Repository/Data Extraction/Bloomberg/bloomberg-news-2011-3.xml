&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) will
build Europe&#8217;s largest recycling plant for plastic bottles in
Lincolnshire, England, the Sunday Times reported, citing
private-equity investor Eddie Truell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has set up a joint venture worth 200 million
pounds ($325 million) with Eco Plastics, a recycling company
backed by Truell, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. (CVX) won a bid to extend a
court order barring Ecuadorean residents from enforcing an $18
billion judgment against the oil company until its racketeering
case against the villagers and their lawyers is decided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said in a
ruling today that Chevron faced &#8220;imminent&#8221; and &#8220;irreparable&#8221;
harm to its business relationships and reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a significant risk that assets would be seized
or attached, thus disrupting Chevron&#8217;s supply chain, causing it
to miss critical deliveries to business partners,&#8221; Kaplan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan granted a temporary restraining order Feb. 8 barring
residents of the Amazon River basin who have sued Chevron in
Ecuador and their U.S. lawyers from enforcing the judgment
awarded by a court there. The company made the request in a U.S.
racketeering lawsuit in which it accused the Ecuadoreans&#8217;
lawyers of conspiring to fabricate evidence. The attorneys said
the lawsuit is unjustified and the claims an attempt to derail
the pollution lawsuit damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Ecuadoreans have argued that Kaplan can&#8217;t
prevent the plaintiffs from enforcing the judgment outside the
U.S. said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decision is a slap in the face to the democratic
nation of Ecuador and the thousands of Ecuadorian citizens who
have courageously fought for 18 years to hold Chevron
accountable for committing the world&#8217;s worst environmental
disaster,&#8221; Hinton said. &#8220;The trampling of due process in the
court&#8217;s refusal to consider key evidence or hold a hearing to
determine the facts is an inappropriate exercise of judicial
power.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollution Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron says it cleaned up its portion of the oil fields
and was released from pollution claims against Texaco Inc. in an
agreement with the government of Ecuador. Chevron acquired
Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, was ordered
Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18 billion in compensatory and
punitive damages for Texaco&#8217;s alleged dumping of toxic drilling
wastes in the Ecuadorean jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The
ruling came in an 18-year-old lawsuit decided by a judge in Lago
Agrio, a provincial capital near the Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and the plaintiffs have said they will appeal the
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond, Deposit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan ordered Chevron to post a $21.8 million bond or
deposit that sum with the court to ensure payment of any damages
caused by the delay in enforcement of the judgment, if his
injunction turns out to be inappropriate, according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron had $17.1 billion in cash and near-cash equivalents
at the end of December, the San Ramon, California-based company
said in a Jan. 28 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron welcomes the order of the Southern District of
New York,&#8221; Kent Robertson, a Chevron spokesman, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;The Lago Agrio plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers should not be
allowed to benefit from an Ecuadorean judicial system that does
not provide due process and from a judgment that they have
procured through fraud and corruption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court
of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s economy can withstand the
government&#8217;s budget squeeze and an interest-rate increase,
according to research published this week by Ben Broadbent, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) economist who will join the Bank of
England&#8217;s rate panel in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fiscal adjustment that the government plans over the
coming years is undoubtedly severe,&#8221; London-based economists
including Broadbent wrote in an e-mailed note dated March 6.
&#8220;Nevertheless, we take a more sanguine view than many of its
impact over the medium term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent, who previously worked at the Treasury and Columbia University, will replace Andrew Sentance on the central
bank&#8217;s Monetary Policy Committee on June 1, the Treasury said
yesterday. He sees investment driving U.K. economic growth this
year and his projections for expansion are above the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&#8217;s &#8220;hard to see much growth&#8221; in incomes and consumer spending this year, the economic impact from any
potential interest-rate increases by the Bank of England may be
limited, Broadbent wrote in the note with economists Kevin Daly
and Adrian Paul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are concerned that any increase in interest
rates would seriously threaten overall economic growth too, both
directly, via the effects of cash-flow on consumer spending, and
indirectly, by raising the rate of default in the mortgage
market,&#8221; the economists said. &#8220;This concern is understandable
but, in our view, it is routinely exaggerated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sees a U.K. expansion of 2.4 percent this
year and 2.5 percent in 2012, according to the note. The median
estimate of 16 economists is for growth of 1.7 percent this
year. The economy may expand 2 percent next year, according to a
separate survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman recently changed its U.K. rate forecast, and sees
the central bank raising its benchmark rate by a quarter point
in May and in each of the subsequent two quarters, having
previously expected the first increase in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent will join a committee that has split four ways on
policy for the first time since the central bank&#8217;s independence
in 1997. With inflation at twice the bank&#8217;s target and the
economic recovery threatened by the government&#8217;s fiscal squeeze,
policy makers are divided on whether to increase interest rates
or expand stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s rate-setting panel starts its next two-day
policy meeting tomorrow. Last month, Sentance voted to increase
the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points from a record low
of 0.5 percent. Martin Weale and Spencer Dale called for a 25
basis-point increase, while the remaining six opted to maintain
the current rate. Adam Posen voted to expand the bank&#8217;s bond-
purchase plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sentance was at the extreme hawkish end of the MPC but we
do not think his loss will divert the focus of the committee,&#8221;
said Jens Sondergaard, an economist at Nomura International Plc
in London who previously worked at the Bank of England. &#8220;In our
view, Mr. Broadbent will join the hawkish end of the MPC. His
view has tended to be more optimistic than the consensus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), McKinsey 
Co. and Intel Corp. (INTC) are among the companies that may be sued or
suffer damage to their reputations after witnesses at the trial
of Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam describe insider
leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 52, goes on trial tomorrow for trading on tips
gleaned from sources inside these and other companies, including
Morgan Stanley, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc. If the billionaire native of Sri
Lanka is convicted by a Manhattan jury, U.S. prosecutors may
seek to jail him for more than 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies from which the leaks emanated may find
themselves in court explaining how sensitive data wound up with
traders at Galleon. While the actions of a rogue employee who
leaked tips won&#8217;t justify a lawsuit, evidence that a firm&#8217;s
executives intentionally gave data to favored traders to
manipulate share price may be grounds to sue a company, said
Mark Rifkin, a New York lawyer who represents investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a company made a decision for whatever reason that it
wanted to make information available to select individuals, that
in my opinion would be unlawful,&#8221; said Rifkin, of Wolf
Haldenstein Adler Freeman  Herz LLP, in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re
paying close attention to the entire insider trading case as it
unfolds because you never know what&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largest Crackdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam denies wrongdoing in a case that is the
centerpiece of the largest U.S. crackdown on hedge fund insider
trading. Prosecutors said he used tips from a network of
traders, corporate officials and colleagues to generate $45
million in profits in a scheme that went on for seven years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam said his and his funds&#8217; trades were based on
Galleon research and that investment advisers routinely speak to
company insiders in the search for news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have cited about three dozen companies in which
there were tips, some coming from company employees and some
from workers at professional firms representing the companies.
Proof about the leaks will come from corporate officials, ex-
Galleon traders, and wiretaps of Rajaratnam&#8217;s phone calls in
which accused accomplices refer to companies such as Intel and
Broadcom Corp., prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eBay Layoffs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence about Intel and McKinsey will take center stage,
as prosecutors offer testimony from former Intel employee Rajiv Goel and ex-McKinsey director Anil Kumar about alleged tips to
Rajaratnam. Goel, who was an Intel managing director, has said
he tipped Rajaratnam about company earnings. Kumar admitted
leaking news about clients including eBay Inc. (EBAY)&#8217;s 2008 plan for
layoffs. Rajaratnam sold short eBay shares and earned about
$500,000, prosecutors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case &#8220;has McKinsey written all over it,&#8221; Rajaratnam&#8217;s
lawyer, John Dowd, wrote in a court filing last month in which
he sought documents from the consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goel and Kumar pleaded guilty and are aiding prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may also be evidence of leaks from a former Goldman
Sachs and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG) board member, Rajat Gupta,
according to court documents. Gupta, who was managing director
at McKinsey from 1994 to 2003, was sued last week by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for telling Rajaratnam about
earnings at those companies and about a Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
investment in Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors may call Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein as a witness, according to a person briefed on
the matter. Dowd said he may summon Gupta for Rajaratnam&#8217;s case.
Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, Gary Naftalis, calls the SEC claim &#8220;baseless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS), AMD &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies will be in the spotlight. Jurors may hear
that an ex-IBM senior vice president, Robert Moffat, leaked news
to Danielle Chiesi, a trader at New Castle Funds LLC, and that
tips to Chiesi made their way to Rajaratnam, according to court
papers. Moffat and Chiesi have pleaded guilty. They&#8217;re not
cooperating with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be testimony about leaks from ex-Moody&#8217;s analyst
Deep Shah, whose information traveled to former Intel employee Roomy Khan and then to Rajaratnam, prosecutors say. Shah is a
fugitive. Khan has pleaded guilty and may testify for the
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) might be
tarnished too. Prosecutors said in a court filing that a Morgan
Stanley banker, whom they didn&#8217;t name, disclosed details of an
AMD deal to an unnamed person, who told Rajaratnam. Ex-AMD CEO
Hector Ruiz allegedly leaked news to Chiesi, according to a
person familiar with the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banker has been put on leave. Ruiz hasn&#8217;t been charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front Page &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our position is that we appear to be a victim of an
insider trading scheme,&#8221; said Mike Silverman, a spokesman for
AMD, of Sunnyvale, California. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been cooperating with the
U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence of unlawful disclosures may be more than &#8220;just
embarrassing&#8221; to companies that are required to guard against
such leaks, said Ronn Torossian, Chief Executive Officer of 5W
Public Relations LLC in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely distracting from the company&#8217;s core
mission,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;A microscopic problem can
very quickly become a bigger problem. These are things that can
very easily end up on the front page of a newspaper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Anthony Sabino, a professor at the Tobin School of Business
at St. John&#8217;s University in New York, said trial disclosures
will be just &#8220;a tiny bump in the road&#8221; for the reputations of
the &#8220;elite of corporate America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Eye &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But it will be a black eye for them, nevertheless,&#8221; he
said in an interview. &#8220;These are corporations who value their
reputations tremendously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is also alleged to have traded on tips in
Clearwire Corp., Polycom Inc., Xilinx Inc., Spansion Inc., Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM), PeopleSupport Inc. and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ed Canaday, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman; Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley;
Yolande Daeninck, a spokeswoman for New York-based McKinsey; and
Paul Fox, a spokesman for Cincinnati-based Procter  Gamble, and
Andrew Merrill, a spokesman for Ruiz, declined to comment.
Carrie Kizer, a spokeswoman for Berkshire Hathaway, didn&#8217;t
return a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Santa Clara-based Intel, and
Jeff Young, a spokesman for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
Akamai, said their firms have been cooperating with prosecutors.
Intel&#8217;s cooperation began a decade ago as part of a probe of
leaks by Khan, Mulloy said. Spokespersons for other companies
didn&#8217;t return calls or declined to comment on whether they
feared they&#8217;d be sued or see their corporate reputations suffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shun Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stoltmann, a securities lawyer in Chicago, said
investors may shun companies that can&#8217;t keep secrets and that
regulators may scrutinize them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge FD issue,&#8221; said Stoltmann, referring to
Regulation FD, standing for fair disclosure, an SEC rule enacted
in 2000 barring corporate officers from intentionally slipping
market-moving news to favored investors before general
dissemination. &#8220;They&#8217;re opening themselves up to regulatory
issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Jim McCarthy, a spokesman for Rajaratnam, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rifkin said it is unlikely &#8220;but not impossible&#8221; that
there will be evidence that a company intentionally leaked
information or failed to adequately guard against leaks by
employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Official Duties&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a company wasn&#8217;t careful, or if executives wanted the
information to get out, they could be responsible,&#8221; he said. A
key question would be whether an executive who disclosed tips
was acting &#8220;within the scope of his official duties,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart Slotnick, a white-collar defense lawyer at
Pittsburgh&#8217;s Buchanan Ingersoll  Rooney PC, said investors
would have difficulty winning a lawsuit over leaked information.
Still, he said, getting sued and having to defend a suit remains
a possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unlikely a company would be held liable for the
actions of a rogue individual unless its shown the company knew
or should have know about the disclosures or the company didn&#8217;t
take precautions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But in this country, if there&#8217;s
an accusation of wrongdoing, there will be a lawsuit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York  Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano&#8217;s compensation
increased 30 percent last year as the company exceeded its four-
year earnings target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano, 59, received $31.7 million in total
compensation, including salary, stock awards and incentives,
compared with $24.3 million a year earlier, the Armonk, New
York-based company said today in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO&#8217;s non-stock incentive compensation almost doubled
to $9 million as IBM increased its full-year profit to $11.52 a
share, besting its goal of at least $10 set four years ago.
Palmisano set another long-term target for the company last
year, saying that operating earnings will almost double to $20 a
share in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, fell
$1.90 to $159.93 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have climbed 9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano, who has led the company since March 2002,
received $4.75 million in non-stock incentive pay in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will pay Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)
more than $1 billion to promote and develop Windows-based
handsets as part of their smartphone software agreement,
according to two people with knowledge of the terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia will pay Microsoft a fee for each copy of Windows used
in its phones, costs that will be offset as Nokia curtails its
own budget for software research and development, said one of
the people, who declined to be identified because the final
contract hasn&#8217;t yet been signed. The agreement runs for more
than five years, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it succeeds, the partnership may benefit both sides
financially while helping stave off a smartphone threat from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) Nokia shares have dropped 26 percent
since the accord was unveiled Feb. 11, reflecting doubts about
the move to adopt Microsoft&#8217;s operating system, which is less
than six months old and has just a few percentage points of
market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This gives Microsoft scale and allows Nokia to rip out
costs,&#8221; said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners in New
York, who recommends buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;Microsoft is
getting the platform boost that comes from acquiring a Nokia for
about a billion dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrinking Margins &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espoo, Finland-based Nokia needs to cut costs to keep 
operating margins from narrowing further, after they shrank to
4.9 percent last year from 19 percent a decade earlier. For 2011
and 2012, Nokia may cut its budget for research and development
in devices and services by about a third from last year&#8217;s
spending of about 3 billion euros, said Sami Sarkamies, a
Helsinki-based analyst with Nordea Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokeswoman Melissa Havel declined to comment on
the specifics of the agreement. Laurie Armstrong, a spokeswoman
for Nokia, said the final contract hasn&#8217;t been signed and the
company will share further details when they are complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s royalty payments will help Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft make a profit on the accord even after the
payments to Nokia, one person said. Some of the payment to Nokia
would be made before the company starts selling the phones,
meaning Microsoft bears some upfront cost in the partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer Under Pressure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shareholders want the company to salvage its
mobile-software business while also reining in costs. The
company doesn&#8217;t break out results for its mobile-software unit,
and instead groups them with the profitable Xbox video-game
business, making it difficult to evaluate the financial
performance of phone software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has come under
pressure from investors and his own board to improve sales of
mobile software after the company lost market share to Google
and Apple. Microsoft stock has declined 7.8 percent so far this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement for the more than billion-dollar payment was
part of a campaign by Microsoft to keep Nokia from choosing
Google&#8217;s Android operating system, one of the people said. Nokia
also opted for Microsoft because Windows Phone software, which
is newer than Android and has a smaller number of handsets for
sale, gives Nokia a better chance to stand out, one of the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement also has Microsoft paying Nokia for the right
to use its patent portfolio, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Microsoft will use Nokia&#8217;s Navteq
mapping products for functions such as geolocation services and
selling local advertising and coupons tied to a user&#8217;s position.
If successful, that also could generate additional revenue for
Nokia, which will share in the sales. The two companies will
also divide revenue from services like search and advertising,
Microsoft President Andy Lees said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Klein, Microsoft&#8217;s chief financial officer, said last
week at an investor conference that sales from these kinds of
services are important to generating profit from the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In success, it is a very mutually beneficial deal
economically for both companies,&#8221; Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such tailored user services may provide billions of
dollars of revenue to Nokia over the term of the contract, one
of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days after the agreement was announced, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop said the agreement will add billions of dollars in value to
Nokia, without specifying how much. Microsoft&#8217;s Lees said the
agreement involves funds changing hands for royalties, marketing
and ad-revenue sharing. Both companies have declined to provide
specific amounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Senior
European Economist Ben Broadbent was appointed to the Bank of
England&#8217;s Monetary Policy Committee to replace Andrew Sentance,
who has been calling for higher rates for the past nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent will join when Sentance&#8217;s term ends on May 31,
the Treasury in London said in a statement today. His &#8220;broad
professional experience in the financial sector and academia, as
well as his detailed knowledge of the U.K. economy, will be
extremely valuable,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent, who has previously worked at the Treasury and
the Bank of England, will join a committee that has split four
ways on policy for the first time since the central bank&#8217;s
independence in 1997. With inflation at twice the bank&#8217;s target
and the economic recovery threatened by the government&#8217;s fiscal
squeeze, policy makers are divided on whether to increase
interest rates or expand stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent is &#8220;likely to be less hawkish than Sentance,
who&#8217;s on an outlying path in the policy debate,&#8221; David Tinsley,
an economist at National Australia Bank in London and a former
central bank official, said in an interview. &#8220;Most incoming
members of the MPC will want to learn the ropes and the dynamics
of the committee and are likely to vote with the pack for at
least the first few months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divided Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s rate-setting panel starts its next two day
policy meeting on March 9. At the last meeting, Sentance voted
to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points from
a record low of 0.5 percent. Martin Weale and Spencer Dale
called for a 25 basis-point increase, while the remaining six
opted to maintain the current rate. Adam Posen voted to expand
the bank&#8217;s bond-purchase plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of England Governor Mervyn King welcomed Broadbent&#8217;s
appointment and said he is joining at a &#8220;critical time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am sure will make a valuable contribution to policy
going forward,&#8221; King said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent and colleagues recently changed their U.K. rate
forecast and see the central bank raising its benchmark rate by
a quarter point in May and in each of the subsequent two
quarters, according to a March 6 report. They forecast that the
rate will be at 2.25 percent by the end of next year. Goldman
Sachs previously expected the first increase in the fourth
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent is the latest Goldman Sachs employee to enter
policy making, and the third with experience of working at the
New York-based firm to join the MPC. Former U.K. rate-setters
David Walton and Sushil Wadhwani both had Goldman Sachs on their
resume before joining the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Excellent Economist&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley is
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s former chief U.S. economist and Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney is a former managing director. Bank of
Italy Governor Mario Draghi, the current frontrunner to become
the next president of the European Central Bank, is a former
vice chairman of its international arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin both headed the bank before
becoming Treasury secretaries, while other former leaders
include Stephen Friedman, who was an adviser to President George W. Bush and Jon Corzine, who governed New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s an excellent economist,&#8221; said Jim O&#8217;Neill,
Broadbent&#8217;s former boss and now chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management. &#8220;Incredibly sharp and one of the best the economics
department had in the last 15 years anywhere around the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Independently Minded&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury said in an advertisement for the role that
applicants must be &#8220;independently minded and be able to exert
their influence within the bank, the MPC and in the wider
external policy debate.&#8221; The salary will be 131,771 pounds
($213,324) plus healthcare benefits, and the position will be on
a part-time basis, averaging three days a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former policy maker Kate Barker and Treasury officials Tom Scholar and Dave Ramsden interviewed candidates and made
recommendations to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.
Of the 27 applications, only one was from a woman, and
Broadbent&#8217;s appointment means the MPC remains an all-male panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government would like to see a greater number of
women apply for future appointments and will continue to
encourage them to do so,&#8221; the Treasury said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent will join Posen, Weale and David Miles as the
fourth external member of the rate-setting panel. Governor Mervyn King, Paul Tucker, Charles Bean, Paul Fisher and Dale are
the internal members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) experienced a

&lt;p&gt;There is no feed going in or product coming out of the

&lt;p&gt;Aarti Ramachandran, a spokeswoman for the refinery,

there was &#8220;an unplanned unit shutdown&#8221; that would have &#8220;some
impact to production.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 155,800-barrel-a-day plant reported flaring due to a

&lt;p&gt;The year that China officially
became the world&#8217;s second-largest economy marked another
milestone. In 2010, Beijing gave investors the world&#8217;s biggest-
ever initial public offering -- the $22.1&#160;billion share float of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) in Hong Kong and Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agricultural Bank listing was the highlight of a year
in which share sales by Asian companies dominated the equity
capital markets, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its April
issue. Asian companies accounted for 6 of the world&#8217;s 10 biggest
offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total fees from arranging IPOs and secondary stock
offerings were almost unchanged for the year, at $16.3 billion
compared with $16.4 billion in 2009, even though the total
amount companies across the world raised in 2010 jumped
23&#160;percent, to $549 billion, from 2009, according to data
compiled for Bloomberg Markets&#8217; annual ranking of the best-paid
investment banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s because the fees charged for those deals dropped 19
percent, to an average of 2.94 percent from 3.65 percent. That&#8217;s
the lowest average fee for equity deals since Bloomberg began
compiling such data in 1999. The data exclude fees from self-led
deals, in which investment banks collect commissions from
selling their own companies&#8217; stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government-backed deals helped push fees down. General
Motors Co. (GM)&#8217;s $18.1 billion offering in November paid banks only
0.75 percent. Morgan Stanley (MS) picked up just 0.4 percent in fees
as sole lead underwriter for the $10.5 billion disposal of the
U.S. Treasury&#8217;s remaining stake in Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AgBank IPO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By those standards, the Agricultural Bank listing was
lucrative. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley, which
were among the banks leading the offering, were paid
1.96&#160;percent by the Chinese government for the $12 billion Hong
Kong portion of the IPO. The Beijing-based bank, which is
China&#8217;s biggest lender by customer, was the last of China&#8217;s big
financial institutions to go public. It was established in 1951
to serve China&#8217;s rural areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia raised more through IPOs than any region on record
since Bloomberg began keeping such statistics in 1999. Seven of
the 10 biggest IPOs were in Asia, and companies in the region
raised $115 billion through IPOs, compared with $91&#160;billion for
the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pace of activity in Asia is likely to continue
unabated,&#8221; says Dan Cummings, Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s New York-
based head of global equity capital markets. &#8220;There were so many
landmark offerings that it almost becomes difficult to
distinguish what is a landmark offering anymore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan No. 1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was No. 1 in fees from underwriting
equity offerings in 2010, according to the Bloomberg Markets
ranking. JPMorgan has led the equity ranking for three
consecutive years. It took in $1.61 billion, topping Goldman
Sachs, No. 2 with $1.57 billion, and No. 3 Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
$1.51 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year featured the biggest share issue ever: Sao Paulo-
based Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)&#8217;s $70 billion secondary offering,
$23.5 billion of which was underwritten by Bank of America,
Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. The share sale is designed to fund
the Brazilian company&#8217;s ambitious deep-water oil-drilling
program. Fees for the part of the offering that were
underwritten were 0.65 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Citigroup, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Bank of America
and Morgan Stanley led the $3.5 billion IPO of state-controlled Coal India Ltd. (COAL), and Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley led
Malaysia&#8217;s $4.7 billion IPO of Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd. (PCHEM),
which were the largest in each country&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG Spinoff &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-biggest IPO of the year, the $20.5&#160;billion Hong
Kong sale by insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s main
Asian unit, AIA Group Ltd. (1299), was led by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank,
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The sale helped put AIG, now
majority-owned by the U.S. Treasury, on course to repay its
government creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments had no trouble attracting underwriters despite
the lower fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are the marquee deals, and everybody knows who does
them,&#8221; says Steven Kaplan, a professor at the University of
Chicago Booth School of Business. &#8220;You are advertising that you
can do these big deals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global issues of stock and convertible bonds will increase
only about 5&#160;percent over 2010, according to year-end forecasts
by Matthew Johnson, New York-based head of Barclays Plc (BARC)&#8217;s global
equity syndicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been in a multiyear bear market from an equities
perspective,&#8221; Johnson says. He is cautiously optimistic that
it&#8217;s finally about to end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment bankers, whose
institutions have already been bailed out to the tune of
$817&#160;billion across the globe, now have something else to thank
taxpayers for: deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year when some of the biggest transactions came from
emerging markets, governments from Washington to Beijing helped
buoy investment banking fees by selling off their stakes in
financial companies, automakers and other corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers eagerly signed up to handle those government
offerings, even though they sometimes paid fees of less than 1
percent, compared with a historical average of 3 percent to 5
percent, Bloomberg Markets reports in its April issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government-backed deals helped to push fee revenue up
last year by 5.8 percent across the industry to $49.1 billion
from $46.4 billion, as total deal volume stayed constant at
about $7 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
Markets magazine for its seventh annual ranking of the best-paid
investment banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of announced mergers and acquisitions rose 27
percent, to $2.2 trillion, while fees rose 23 percent to $17.9
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal totals in the bond markets fell to $4.1 trillion from
$4.7 trillion, and fees also fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees for all IPOs and secondary stock offerings dropped to
their lowest level since Bloomberg began compiling such data in
1999, averaging 2.9 percent. The industry average in 2003 was
5.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Mend &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although bankers say global markets are on the mend, it
will take years before they see anything close to the record
$86.9 billion in investment-banking fees earned in 2007, says
Hugh &#8220;Skip&#8221; McGee, head of global investment banking at Barclays
Plc (BARC)&#8217;s Barclays Capital in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be hard-pressed to get back to &#8217;07 levels
anytime soon,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s best-paid investment bank in 2010 was JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), which ranks No. 1 in the Bloomberg 20 for the third
year in a row, with total fees of $4.14 billion. The bank also
led the field in fees from bond and equity issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley supplanted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for the
No. 2 position in total fees for 2010, earning $3.67 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is No. 3 overall with $3.60 billion. It ranks
No. 1 in earnings from mergers and acquisitions, as it has every
year since the Bloomberg 20 started in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Critical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James &#8220;Jes&#8221; Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, told investors and analysts at a Feb. 15
meeting at the bank&#8217;s New York headquarters that Asia was a
&#8220;critically important&#8221; region for the investment bank in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Three of the five largest markets last year in terms of
IPOs were Hong Kong at $57 billion, Shenzhen at $47 billion and
Shanghai at $27 billion,&#8221; Staley, 54, said. He said that while
his unit gets 18 percent of its revenue from emerging markets,
the growth in revenue from that sector is 1&#189; times that of the
investment bank as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside Asia, the U.S. Treasury was one of the most
important customers for Wall Street last year, selling stock it
acquired during the 2008 to 2009 financial meltdown in a long
list of companies, including American International Group Inc. (AIG), Ally Financial Inc. (formerly GMAC), and Citigroup Inc. (C) Treasury
negotiated rock&#173;bottom prices, paying bankers, including Morgan
Stanley, JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
0.75&#160;percent to sell about half of its stake in General Motors
Co. (GM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras&#8217;s Big Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley picked up only 0.4 percent in fees as sole
underwriter for the $10.5 billion in Citigroup stock Treasury
sold. Brazil&#8217;s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) paid underwriters 0.65
percent to execute $23.5 billion of its $70 billion secondary
stock offering, the biggest in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (1288), which launched the biggest
IPO ever, paid its underwriters 1.96 percent for the $12 billion
that was raised in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was an underwriter of the Agricultural Bank
offering. At the meeting with investors, Staley said the
investment bank expanded its workforce last year by 42 percent
in China, 40 percent in Brazil and nearly 20&#160;percent in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers are less optimistic about fast growth in Europe and
the U.S., where new strictures by the Federal Reserve and the
European Central Bank on the amount banks must hold in reserve
against bad loans, and the amount of leverage they can take on,
mean the high-flying days of 2005 to 2007 are over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreaming of 2007 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 2007 levels will be really difficult to get back to
because of the new capital requirements and the deleveraging of
financial institution balance sheets across the board,&#8221; McGee,
51, says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian corporations kept their bankers busier than in any
other region. Asia provided seven of the ten biggest IPOs in
2010, including the $22.1 billion dual offering in Shanghai and
Hong&#160;Kong by Agricultural Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. and Europe lagged in the sale of new stock
and bonds, the younger, emerging economies bubbled with new
money and deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All those countries that we thought of as the emerging
markets are very developed right now,&#8221; says Purna Saggurti, co-
head of global investment banking at Bank of America Corp. (BAC)
&#8220;China is the second-largest investment&#173;banking fee market
already. You can&#8217;t call it an emerging market anymore; it is the
developed world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers, acquisitions and share offerings were the daily
bread of bankers last year in the BRIC countries -- Brazil,
Russia, India and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-Border Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 25 percent of the banking industry&#8217;s MA volume and
some of the largest IPOs came from cross&#173;border deals in Asia
such as U.S. insurer AIG&#8217;s $20.5 billion spinoff of its Asian
arm, AIA Group, which was the second-largest IPO last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A host of big Western banks had a hand in that deal,
including Barclays, Citigroup Global Markets Asia, Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK), Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Securities Asia, Morgan Stanley (MS)
Asia, Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch Far East subsidiary and UBS AG. (UBSN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Firms are once again thinking global after the
retrenchment of the last couple of years,&#8221; Barclays&#8217;s McGee
says. &#8220;They are looking to resume their growth trajectory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., Timothy F. Geithner&#8217;s Treasury Department kept
investment banks busy last year. Deutsche Bank alone advised the
U.S. Treasury on 13 separate transactions that sold $3.9 billion
in warrants for taxpayers in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM&#8217;s IPO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Taubman, co-president of institutional securities at
Morgan Stanley, says the most important transaction of 2010 came
very late in the year -- the November IPO of General Motors,
which filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009. On Nov. 17, it
launched an initial public offering in which it sold $18.1
billion of common shares at $33 each, making it the second-
largest U.S. IPO on record. General Motors stock, after rising
as high as $39, was down on March 4 from its IPO price, closing
at $32.39. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The General Motors deal was important for the economy; it
was important for the markets,&#8221; Taubman says. &#8220;It was a defining
moment last year in many respects. It was increased in size; it
was increased in price; it traded well in the aftermarket.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That deal marked the culmination of a banner year for
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s investment bank. Profits from continuing
operations in the unit, including trading, more than doubled to
$3.75 billion last year from $1.39 billion in 2009. The firm
generated higher investment-banking revenue in the fourth
quarter than Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which in June 2009 repaid the government $10
billion it borrowed through the Troubled Asset Relief Program,
was a lead underwriter on three of the four largest IPOs last
year: GM, the Agricultural Bank of China and AIA Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-Profile Hiring &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taubman, 50, credits Morgan Stanley&#8217;s rise in investment
banking to its high-profile hiring over the last half of the
2000s, beginning with the bank&#8217;s global head of MA, Robert Kindler, who Taubman lured away from JPMorgan in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler, 57, was a mergers lawyer for New York law firm
Cravath Swaine  Moore LLP before becoming a banker in 2000.
Morgan Stanley also hired Gary Shedlin from Citigroup, who
Taubman says brought with him a long roster of clients, and Dan Toscano, hired last year from HSBC to run Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
leveraged finance business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been able over the past few years to systematically
attract, recruit and integrate some of the best bankers on the
Street,&#8221; Taubman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multinational Cross-Border &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman and other big banks are
more heavily invested than ever in serving multinational
corporations doing cross-border transactions. Banks that have
such a global presence have to be able to handle everything from
sharp swings in currency rates to political unrest, says Jacques Brand, co-head of investment banking at Deutsche Bank in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange rate of the euro, for instance, swung during
2010 from a high of $1.45 in January to as low as $1.19 in June.
By October, it was back above $1.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That represented a bigger swing in value than those of the
Russian ruble and the Brazilian real during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the market for mergers, stock and bond issues in
the U.S. and Europe was dampened by a series of crises that
began on April&#160;22, when the European Union estimated that
Greece&#8217;s budget deficit for 2009 had been 13.6 percent of gross
domestic product, more than triple Greece&#8217;s own previous
estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to buy credit protection against Greek debt
surged, and markets in both Europe and the U.S. recoiled as the
EU quickly put together a 440 billion euro ($594&#160;billion)
bailout fund to guarantee the debt of Greece and other shaky
euro-zone economies, including Ireland, Portugal and Spain. The
euro plunged against the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blow to Confidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next blow to confidence came on May&#160;6, when in the
course of less than an hour shares listed on the New York Stock
Exchange plunged, briefly erasing $862 billion in market value.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued an October
report on the incident, concluding that it started with a $4
billion automatic sell order by an asset manager that triggered
a flood of follow-on sales by high&#173;frequency traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The first couple of months of 2010 were very strong,&#8221;
Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Brand, 50, says. &#8220;A combination of the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe, particularly around Greece, combined with
the flash crash, really undermined the investor confidence
that&#8217;s necessary for robust MA and capital raising.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The midyear freeze on deals in Europe sealed the fate of
European investment banking for the entire year, Barclays&#8217;s
McGee says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrinking Europe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That market shrunk pretty significantly from &#8217;09 to &#8217;10,&#8221;
he says. &#8220;The total fee pool was actually down year over year,
so that has an impact on anybody that has a sizable presence in
the region, as we do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Barclays moved up a notch to No. 8 in the
Bloomberg 20 with total fees of $2.25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Europe&#8217;s troubles dulled the overall deal market,
there was still a steady stream of transactions in the U.S.,
particularly toward the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We saw a good pickup in the U.S. markets,&#8221; Bank of
America&#8217;s Saggurti says. &#8220;The 2010 capital raising was all about
cleaning up balance sheets and refinancing because the markets
were forgiving and were available.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate and sovereign bond sales worldwide declined
overall by 12 percent, and yet 2010 was still the second-best
year on record, with companies taking advantage of low interest
rates to refinance higher-interest debt and garner cash for
share buybacks and acquisitions, bankers say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond Fees Down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees overall fell to $14.9&#160;billion from a record $15.5
billion in 2009 due to the decline in volume, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the debt markets, companies around the world sold
$369 billion in high-yield &#8220;junk&#8221; bonds -- the most lucrative
for underwriters -- the most since Bloomberg began keeping count
in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High-yield will continue to thrive in the current
environment in a world in which issuers are fearful that rates
may increase,&#8221; Saggurti says. &#8220;Well-regarded, well-capitalized
B, BB, BBB credits are a bit of a safe haven as the economy
continues to heal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise in announced MA deals in 2010 bodes well for
investment banking generally in 2011, Taubman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there&#8217;s more MA activity, that drives all the volumes
around it,&#8221; he says. More MA activity means more so-called
bridge financing to help companies complete their acquisitions,
he says, which can in turn be followed by bond and equity deals
for the merged company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending $1 Trillion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., bankers say, corporations are ready to put the
$1 trillion in capital they&#8217;ve been hoarding over the past two
years to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We came into 2011 with a lot of momentum,&#8221; Brand says.
&#8220;The market broadly is coming off of a very strong high-yield
issuance, very strong equity market in the fourth quarter and
increasing momentum in MA activity. Corporations feel
optimistic about their ability to consummate transactions, so I
think we&#8217;re going to see an uptick in MA activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One good sign for the bankers: Private-equity firms are
doing deals again. Firms such as Blackstone Group Inc., Carlyle
Group and KKR  Co. represented 25 percent of investment-banking
fees during the height of the leveraged-buyout boom in 2006 and
2007, according to Deutsche Bank. That figure dropped to about
5&#160;percent of the market in 2008 and 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Equity Comeback &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, private equity accounted for about 16&#160;percent of
the industry&#8217;s fees, Brand says, and he expects the number to
exceed 20 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank advised IMS Health Inc., a Norwalk,
Connecticut-based health-care company, in its $5.2 billion sale
to TPG Partners, which was announced in 2009 and completed in
February. It was the largest leveraged buyout since the collapse
of Lehman Brothers and the fifth-largest ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We saw sharp, renewed LBO and IPO activity in 2010, and we
expect that to continue in 2011,&#8221; Brand says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment bankers are confident that MA and stock and
bond issuance will all rise substantially this year, especially
if Europe stabilizes. Deutsche Bank led 24 technology IPOs
around the world last year and has a healthy pipeline slated for
2011, Brand says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury will continue to be a source of revenue.
The Treasury still owns large stakes in General Motors, AIG,
Ally Financial and other U.S. corporations. Virtually every bank
on Wall Street got a piece of the business last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Mergers Coming &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should also expect to see more mergers among
natural resource companies this year, including metals, mining,
coal and oil, McGee and Saggurti say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consolidation opportunity in those sectors has been
brewing for quite a while now, and people are pulling the
trigger as we speak,&#8221; Saggurti says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) completed its biggest
acquisition since 1999 and the largest purchase in the world
last year when it paid $41 billion in a stock swap to buy Fort
Worth, Texas-based natural gas company XTO Energy Inc. McGee
calls the purchase, announced in 2009, a &#8220;game changer&#8221; in the
energy field and notes that it was followed by smaller
acquisitions of natural gas companies by Chevron Corp. and
others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the ingredients are there for a strong recovery in
investment banking this year, bankers say, though they still
worry that unemployment in the U.S. and Europe and inflation in
China and other emerging markets could muffle economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, more deals will be done by private companies --
which have less clout when it comes to demanding discounts. That
means fees may continue their rise through 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spurred by declining interest rates,
banks in 2010 capped off the biggest two-year bond sale binge on
record. Corporate bond sales of $2.8 trillion were the second
largest on record behind 2009&#8217;s $3.1 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate and sovereign bond deals around the world
generated a total of $14.9 billion in fees for bankers, down
from $15.5 billion in 2009, according to data compiled for
Bloomberg Markets magazine&#8217;s seventh annual ranking of the best-
paid investment banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees dropped in 2010 because companies felt less urgency to
borrow than in 2009, when markets reopened after the crisis,
bankers say. While the quantity of bonds sold globally declined
12&#160;percent, a record $369 billion of high-yield, high-risk bonds
-- the most lucrative for underwriters -- helped prevent a
comparable drop in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate treasurers around the world are taking advantage
of the lowest borrowing costs since at least 1996 by refinancing
higher-interest debt and pushing out maturities, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate
Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two years of hoarding cash, they&#8217;re also borrowing
more to fund a growing number of acquisitions and to fund share
buybacks, says Therese Esperdy, head of global debt capital
markets at New York-based JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bond yields dropped to as low as 3.36 percent in
October from 4.4 percent at the end of 2009, according to the
BofA Merrill Lynch index. Yields stood at 7.8 percent in October
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Aggressive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the amount of cash on corporate balance sheets,
companies have become much more aggressive about pushing out
their refinancing horizon,&#8221; Esperdy says. She says companies are
refinancing bonds that don&#8217;t mature for three or more years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the No. 1 underwriter in 2010, taking or
sharing the top spot for the third straight year, earning $1.26
billion in fees, according to Bloomberg data. Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America climbed to No. 2, with $1.07
billion in fees. New York-based Citigroup continued its slide in
the rankings, slipping to No. 5 from No. 2 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup was the lead bond underwriter from 2004 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest corporate bond deal of 2010 was Kraft Foods
Inc. (KFT)&#8217;s sale of $9.5 billion of debt for its takeover of London-
based Cadbury Plc. Cadbury agreed to an 11.9 billion pound
($19.2 billion) offer from Kraft after a five-month standoff
over pricing in a deal that created the world&#8217;s largest
confectioner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis Buys Alcon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big cross-border deal was Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis AG&#8217;s sale of $5 billion in debt to fund its acquisition
of U.S. eye-care company Alcon Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-biggest corporate bond deal was the $6 billion
in debt issued by Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to
finance part of its purchase of railroad Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. The total sale price was $26.5 billion, with
Buffett digging into his $30.6 billion cash pile to pay for
almost a third of it. The rest of the deal, the biggest takeover
in 80-year-old Buffett&#8217;s career, was funded with Berkshire
shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217;s bond team is projecting that U.S. investment-
grade debt sales will increase about 4&#160;percent this year as
growing demand for floating-rate debt makes up for a projected
decline in fixed-rate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With yields still low and balance sheets flush with cash,
companies are more likely to finance acquisitions with debt
instead of shares, says Nigel Cree, head of syndicate for the
Americas bond team at Deutsche Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very Low Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-year U.S. Treasury yields fell to a record 0.31 percent
in November, helping corporate bond sales. As European leaders
sought to bolster confidence in the finances of Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, the yield on two-year German bunds
dropped to as low as 0.43 percent in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, global investment-grade bond yields have
climbed 0.7 percentage points to 4.05 percent from their low in
October to March 3. That triggered bond index losses averaging
1.5&#160;percent in the last three months of 2010, the worst decline
since the quarter ended on Sept. 30, 2008, according to the BofA
Merrill Lynch index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s definitely a risk to the demand in our market to
the extent we continue to see rates move upward,&#8221; says Andrew Karp, Bank of America&#8217;s head of high-grade debt syndicate for
the Americas. &#8220;If that occurs at a time when equities are
rallying, and you believe dollars chase returns, you could see
money shifting out of fixed-income into equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Mider and Jeffrey McCracken" date="Mar 07, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-07/goldman-heads-m-a-rankings-spurred-by-commodities-demand-in-bric-economies.html"><headline>Goldman Leads M&amp;amp;A List Spurred by Commodities Demand in BRICs</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The merger boom that started in 2010
isn&#8217;t looking like any of the past three. The takeover binge of
the 1980s was fueled by Michael Milken&#8217;s junk bonds; the late-
1990s wave of Internet and telecom deals, by inflated stock
prices; and the private-equity frenzy that produced a record
year for deals in 2007, by leveraged loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more recent surge comes from the expanding BRIC
economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- and beyond.
Deals are rising among the companies that supply raw materials
to these countries. Worldwide deals in energy, power and basic
materials made up about a third of the merger and acquisition
market in 2010, compared with about 20 percent in the previous
decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies with
headquarters in emerging markets played a role in more than a
third of 2010 takeovers, about twice their historical share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market acquisitions helped the total value of
announced deals for 2010 grow 27&#160;percent to $2.2 trillion,
driving up advisory fees. It&#8217;s the first annual increase in fees
since the banner year of 2007. Goldman Sachs took the top spot
in an annual ranking of advisers by the fees they collect in the
April issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower volatility in commodity prices is helping deals come
together, says Carl Contiguglia, co-head of natural resources investment banking at Morgan Stanley (MS), the No. 2 fee earner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The back half of 2010 was the beginning of a natural
resources MA boom,&#8221; Contiguglia says. &#8220;I forecast that to
continue through 2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)&#8217;s $42.5 billion purchase of offshore
oil rights from the Brazilian government, announced in
September, was the biggest deal of the year. Less than a month
earlier, London-based Vedanta Resources Plc agreed to buy Cairn
India Ltd. for $9.6 billion to get access to India&#8217;s biggest
onshore field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even dealmaking within the world&#8217;s mature economies has
been spurred by the BRICs. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar
Inc. agreed in November to buy South Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Bucyrus International Inc. (BUCY) for $7.6&#160;billion to sell giant mining
machines in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Demand is being driven by these super-charged emerging
economies,&#8221; says Cary Kochman, head of MA for the Americas at
Zurich-based UBS AG. (UBSN) &#8220;We are quickly moving from oversupply of
raw materials into a tighter demand situation.&#8221; UBS, which is
helping advise Bucyrus, is No. 5 in the rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman No. 1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other deals, emerging-market companies expanded to
better compete on the global stage, says Antonio Weiss, head of
investment banking at Lazard Ltd. (LAZ), which ranked 11th in the
tally. Russia&#8217;s two biggest potash producers, OAO Uralkali and
OAO Silvinit, agreed in December to a $7.8 billion combination
to help them supply materials to international markets. Goldman
Sachs, Morgan Stanley and VTB Group are advising Uralkali,
according to Bloomberg data, and Bank of America is working with
Silvinit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs retained its No. 1 ranking for the seventh
straight year, showing that Western banks with global reach
dominate the new merger landscape. Big Western banks led the way
even in takeovers of companies based in emerging Asian markets.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, and
Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) all logged more deals than
local competitors such as China International Capital Corp.,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, an emerging-market bank made the Top 20
ranking. Banco BTG Pactual SA, the Rio de Janeiro-based
investment bank, came in 18th place on the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are using acquisitions to build and refine their
existing businesses rather than plunge into new ones as they
emerge from the worst financial crisis in decades, says Jeffrey Kaplan, head of MA at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America. Conglomerates such as ITT Corp. (ITT) and Sara Lee Corp. are
pursuing breakups -- another sign that companies are choosing to
focus on their core markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coming out of such a severe downturn, even with the cheap
cost of debt, shareholders are not looking for companies to take
on big risks,&#8221; says Kaplan, whose firm has been advising
Sara&#160;Lee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the International Monetary Fund forecasting robust
growth in the BRICs in 2011, bankers say acquisitions will
increase for the second straight year after hitting $4 trillion
in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have all this cash built up, and you have sectors such
as power and energy that are active,&#8221; says John Studzinski, head
of Blackstone Group&#8217;s advisory unit. &#8220;This year&#8217;s going to match
2007, or it will be higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), aiming to increase revenue by helping municipalities
manage traffic and water systems, said it has boosted the number
of projects it&#8217;s working on with cities to more than 2,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM had 2,133 such projects at the end of last year,
including 645 in emerging markets, the Armonk, New York-based
company said in a presentation today at its annual investor
briefing, held this year in Yorktown Heights, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is helping cities such as Shenyang, China and
Bangkok manage energy, health-care, and public safety systems.
Using technology to monitor and make anything from cities to
buildings more efficient -- a concept IBM calls Smarter Planet -
- will be a $10 billion business for IBM by 2015, the company
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business is &#8220;all the things that, even in a tough
economic environment, free up money so cities can go invest,&#8221;
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano said at the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which turns 100 this year, has helped Rio de
Janeiro monitor weather, energy and transportation and created a
program to track the sewer system in Sacramento, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM climbed $2.35, or 1.5 percent, to $162.28 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company has
climbed 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said it will spend about $35 billion on
research and development over the next five years, compared with
about $30 billion spent in the past five years. The company
invests in RD to support its main growth areas, including
Smarter Planet, as well as exploratory projects, such as mapping
a cocoa gene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patents and Royalties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We invested $24 billion in RD and yes, garnered another
18,000 patents,&#8221; Palmisano said of the company&#8217;s last long-term
roadmap, which ended last year. The company gets about $1
billion annually from licensing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano reiterated IBM&#8217;s goal of nearly doubling
operating earnings per share to at least $20 in 2015. Along with
Smarter Planet, the company is investing in analytics software
and services, which help companies predict trends, and cloud-
computing, which lets customers store and access data on servers
other than their own. The two businesses will have $16 billion
and $7 billion in revenue in 2015, respectively, the company
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with geographic growth markets, which will increase
to be about 30 percent of total sales in the next five years,
the three areas will add about $20 billion to IBM&#8217;s revenue,
which totaled $99.9 billion last year, in the same time period.
It will make about $20 billion in acquisitions in that time. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Hugh Son" date="Mar 08, 2011  4:02 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-08/bofa-s-investment-bank-seeks-profitability-target-below-that-of-jpmorgan.html"><headline>BofA&#8217;s Montag Targets 15%-Plus Return on Tangible Equity</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s investment
banking and trading division is seeking at least a 15 percent
return on tangible equity, a lower profitability target than the
firm&#8217;s biggest rival, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit also has a long-term goal of &#8220;mid-to-high single-
digit revenue growth,&#8221; according to a presentation from the
division&#8217;s head, Thomas K. Montag, at an investor conference
today in New York. Montag, 54, targeted increasing international
revenue and making investments to improve technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall Street bank that makes
the most revenue from trading, has stood by its target of a 20
percent return on tangible equity. New York-based JPMorgan, the
second biggest U.S. bank by assets, is sticking to a target of
17 percent return on equity at its investment bank. Bank of
America&#8217;s division consists mostly of operations acquired in the
2009 takeover of Merrill Lynch  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what drove Goldman and JPMorgan&#8217;s numbers,&#8221;
Montag said. &#8220;We still have some investments to make versus JP
that they&#8217;ve made in previous years with technology and stuff
that makes us a little different right now. Remember, we&#8217;re two
years old and there&#8217;s the element of putting two things together
that takes a while to happen. It doesn&#8217;t happen over two
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG, based in Zurich, last month lowered
its firm-wide goal for return on equity to more than 15 percent
from more than 18 percent. Barclays Plc also said in February it
will aim for a 13 percent ROE, down from an average of 18
percent over the past 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan,
51, has leaned on the firm&#8217;s investment bank for profits as
consumer-finance units booked losses tied to new regulations and
faulty mortgages. Montag&#8217;s division earned $6.3 billion in 2010,
almost double the annual profit of any other unit at the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1 percent market-share gain internationally in all the
division&#8217;s businesses would translate into $3 billion of
additional revenue, Montag said. While Bank of America has a
market share of greater than 9 percent in the Americas, its
international market share is less than 3 percent, Montag said.
Growth in the international market will be key because it
represents 65 percent of available fees, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We showed you the gaps we have that we think will drive
better growth than many of the people we compete with,&#8221; Montag
said. &#8220;We have a stable corporate-banking platform from which
to build, and we think we will do incredibly well in the years
going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has reduced its proprietary-trading headcount by
about 75 percent as it winds down that business, Montag said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov, convicted of stealing the
firm&#8217;s trade secrets by appropriating its computer source code,
should get probation and not prison, his lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted in December in federal court in New
York on charges of violating the Economic Espionage Act and the
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. He faces as
long as 10 years in prison on the espionage charge and five
years for the interstate transportation charge when he is
sentenced by U.S. District Court judge Denise Cote on March 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov doesn&#8217;t deserve a prison term &#8220;because there was
no evidence of an actual or intended loss,&#8221; or financial harm
to Goldman as a result of his actions, his attorney, Kevin Marino, said in court papers filed late yesterday. Prosecutors
have argued Aleynikov deserves a prison term of eight to ten
years, Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the crimes for which Aleynikov was convicted are
undoubtedly serious, he was not found to have caused or intended
pecuniary harm to Goldman,&#8221; Marino said. &#8220;As a result he does
not deserve the harsh sentence the government requests -- 97 to
120 months in prison.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino said his client&#8217;s alleged crimes merit a term of
probation to six months. The lawyer argued, as he had during the
trial, that Aleyninkov only took open-source code he had written
at Goldman and nothing that was proprietary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading Platform &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence showed at most that Aleynikov intended to
use the code he copied to make it easier for him to build a
high-frequency trading platform&#8221; at his new employer&#8217;s firm,
Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government now seeks to have Alyenikov punished as
though he had not only stolen Goldman&#8217;s entire platform, as it
originally claimed, but also had sold that platform to a Goldman
competitor who used it to cause Goldman monetary damages of
twenty million dollars,&#8221; Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 24, Cote ordered Aleynikov, who had been free on
bond, jailed before sentencing because she deemed him a flight
risk. Aleynikov, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, holds dual
U.S.-Russian citizenship, Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rebecca Rohr told jurors
during her closing statement that Aleynikov was a &#8220;thief.&#8221; On
his last day of work at New York-based Goldman in June 2009,
Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of lines of source code
from the firm&#8217;s trading system, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encrypted Code &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He circumvented Goldman&#8217;s security system, sent the code to
an outside server in Germany, and later compressed and encrypted
the code, Rohr said. Aleynikov took the code with him to a
meeting with his new employers in Chicago in July 2009, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking Goldman&#8217;s software, Aleynikov executed a
program to cover his tracks, prosecutors said. If he thought the
codes were open source and should be publicly available, &#8220;why
did he then encrypt it?&#8221; Rohr asked jurors. &#8220;So that no one,
like him, could access the code.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co. named Ralph Rosenberg, a
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partner, to head global real-
estate investing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg will pursue property investments for KKR&#8217;s
equity, debt and special situations funds, the New York-based
private-equity firm said in a statement today. He left Goldman
Sachs in 2006 to found R6 Capital Management, a hedge fund that
invested in commercial real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ralph brings with him 25 years of experience investing
in the real estate industry,&#8221; Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, co-founders of KKR, said in the statement. &#8220;We are
very pleased Ralph has decided to join us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR and its rivals have been expanding their property
investments as they try to diversify profits beyond fees reaped
from leverage buyouts. Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world&#8217;s largest
private-equity firm, said Feb. 3 that fourth-quarter profit
increased 56 percent to $512.7 million as the company benefited
from a rebound in commercial real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg co-managed a unit at New York-based Goldman Sachs
that invested in companies going through corporate events such
as mergers and bankruptcies. He previously worked for Goldman
Sachs investment funds that participated in $50 billion of
global real-estate transactions, KKR said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg joined Eton Park Capital Management as a partner
after the New York-based hedge fund agreed to buy R6 Capital&#8217;s
investment holdings in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he built a 10-person investment team at R6 Capital,
he wasn&#8217;t able to expand enough to absorb the costs associated
with pursuing profitable investments around the world, according
to a November 2007 letter that Eton Park sent to its investors.
Eton Park was founded by former Goldman Sachs partner Eric Mindich. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Richard Holwell, the Manhattan
federal judge overseeing the trial of Raj Rajaratnam, is a
former corporate lawyer who condemned insider trading in two
recent cases he has handled during his eight years on the bench. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the 2008 sentencing of Eugene Plotkin, then a 28-year-
old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) banker who pleaded guilty to
insider trading, a defense attorney urged Holwell to impose a
sentence below federal sentencing guidelines because of
Plotkin&#8217;s youth and because a co-defendant was the mastermind
behind the scheme. The judge refused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was not a simple and singular lapse of judgment, but
an egregious breach of trust, a fraud, pure and simple, by a
person who had no moral compass,&#8221; Holwell said, sentencing
Plotkin to 57 months in prison, within federal guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, the co-founder of hedge-fund company Galleon
Group LLC, is accused of making $45 million in illicit trades
from insider tips. The 53-year-old native of Sri Lanka, who
faces as much as 20 years in prison on the most serious charges
against him, denies wrongdoing. It&#8217;s the largest insider-trading
case ever involving hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial, which starts today with jury selection,
may last two months and feature evidence from 2,400 wiretapped
conversations with 130 people and involves alleged inside tips
on 37 companies, including Goldman Sachs, Google Inc. (GOOG), Hilton
Hotels Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he was nominated to the bench by President George W.
Bush, Holwell spent more than 30 years as a business litigator,
rising to be chairman of the litigation department at New York-
based White  Case LLP. Holwell, who was confirmed as a judge in
2003, declined to be interviewed for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White  Case declined to permit any of its lawyers to be
interviewed, citing a policy not to talk about partners who
become judges. It said in an e-mail that Holwell is a lawyer
&#8220;of the highest quality and integrity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Trial May Tarnish Goldman, McKinsey, Spark Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., McKinsey  Co. and Intel Corp. (INTC)
are among the companies that may be sued or suffer damage to
their reputations after witnesses at the trial of Galleon Group
LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam describe insider leaks, Bloomberg
News&#8217;s David Glovin, Patricia Hurtado and Bob Van Voris report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 52, goes on trial today for trading on tips
gleaned from sources inside these and other companies, including
Morgan Stanley, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc. If the billionaire native of Sri
Lanka is convicted by a Manhattan jury, U.S. prosecutors may
seek to jail him for more than 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies from which the leaks emanated may find
themselves in court explaining how sensitive data wound up with
traders at Galleon. While the actions of a rogue employee who
leaked tips won&#8217;t justify a lawsuit, evidence that a firm&#8217;s
executives intentionally gave data to favored traders to
manipulate share price may be grounds to sue a company, said
Mark Rifkin, a New York lawyer who represents investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a company made a decision for whatever reason that it
wanted to make information available to select individuals, that
in my opinion would be unlawful,&#8221; said Rifkin, of Wolf
Haldenstein Adler Freeman  Herz LLP, in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re
paying close attention to the entire insider trading case as it
unfolds because you never know what&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam denies wrongdoing in a case that is the
centerpiece of the largest U.S. crackdown on hedge fund insider
trading. Prosecutors said he used tips from a network of
traders, corporate officials and colleagues to generate $45
million in profits in a scheme that went on for seven years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam said his and his funds&#8217; trades were based on
Galleon research and that investment advisers routinely speak to
company insiders in the search for news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have cited about three dozen companies in which
there were tips, some coming from company employees and some
from workers at professional firms representing the companies.
Proof about the leaks will come from corporate officials, ex-
Galleon traders, and wiretaps of Rajaratnam&#8217;s phone calls in
which accused accomplices refer to companies such as Intel and
Broadcom Corp., prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ed Canaday, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman; Pen
Pendleton, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS);
Yolande Daeninck, a spokeswoman for New York-based McKinsey; and
Paul Fox, a spokesman for Cincinnati-based Procter  Gamble, and
Andrew Merrill, a spokesman for Ruiz, declined to comment.
Carrie Kizer, a spokeswoman for Berkshire Hathaway, didn&#8217;t
return a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Santa Clara-based Intel, and
Jeff Young, a spokesman for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
Akamai, said their firms have been cooperating with prosecutors.
Intel&#8217;s cooperation began a decade ago as part of a probe of
leaks by Khan, Mulloy said. Spokespeople for other companies
didn&#8217;t return calls or declined to comment on whether they
feared they&#8217;d be sued or see their corporate reputations suffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Attorneys General Push for Loan Reductions, Seek Bank Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State attorneys general are pushing lenders to reduce loan
balances and said they hope to reach a final settlement with
banks over their mortgage-servicing and foreclosure practices
within two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states along with federal agencies submitted a 27-page
settlement proposal last week to the country&#8217;s five largest
mortgage servicers and aim to reach an agreement that leads to
more loan modifications for homeowners having trouble making
their payments, attorneys general said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The result we come to can have an impact on the housing
market and the economy,&#8221; North Carolina Attorney General Roy
Cooper told reporters at a meeting of attorneys general in Washington. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want uncertainty to linger very long.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State attorneys general and federal agencies, including the Justice Department, the Treasury Department and the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, submitted the proposal as a
starting point for negotiating a settlement with the servicing
industry, said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is helping
to lead the talks with the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller declined to comment about the role of banking
regulators in the negotiations. Officials are talking with
investors in mortgage-backed securities, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies that received the settlement terms from
officials are Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), Ally Financial Inc. and Citigroup Inc. They service
59 percent of U.S. home loans, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumana Bauwens, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to
comment, as did Mark Rodgers, a Citigroup spokesman, and Gina
Proia, an Ally spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vickee Adams, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, and JPMorgan
spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
requests for comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tam Ormiston, a deputy attorney general in Iowa, declined
to comment yesterday about the settlement discussions. He didn&#8217;t
rule out criminal prosecutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Forms Criminal Task Force on Deepwater Horizon Disaster &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department has formed the Deepwater
Horizon Task Force to consolidate its investigation into
possible criminal charges stemming from the drilling rig
explosion that killed 11 workers and caused the worst offshore
oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said in a statement that the task
force brings together &#8220;separate and simultaneous
investigations&#8221; by its criminal and environmental and natural
resources divisions and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in New
Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After assessing the overlap of the cases and in an effort
to avoid duplication of effort, Deputy Attorney General James
Cole has decided to establish a single task force with authority
to oversee all facets of the investigation,&#8221; Wyn Hornbuckle, a
Justice Department spokesman, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three groups have been probing the April 20 &#8220;fire,
explosion and aftermath&#8221; of the Deepwater Horizon incident
since U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced on June 1 that
the government would seek potential criminal charges and civil
penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task force will be led by John Buretta, criminal
division senior counsel, and supervised by Assistant Attorney
General Lanny Breuer of the criminal division, according to the
statement. Much of the task force&#8217;s activities will be based in
New Orleans, where the Justice Department established a command
post last year, Hornbuckle said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven rig workers died and more than 4.1 million barrels
of crude gushed into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater
Horizon rig exploded and sank. The U.S. has sued BP Plc (BP/), which
owned the well, and Transocean Ltd. (RIG), which owned the rig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheros Delays Shareholder Vote on $3 Billion Qualcomm Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Atheros Communications Inc. (ATHR) postponed a shareholder vote on
a planned $3.2 billion takeover of the company by Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)
after a judge ordered that more information be released about
the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vote was scheduled for yesterday and will be delayed
until March 18, San Jose, California-based Atheros said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proxy statement currently fails to provide the
required disclosures&#8221; about advisory fees and &#8220;all material
facts&#8221; about deal-negotiations by Craig Barratt, chief
executive officer of Atheros, and what he would be paid if the
sale goes through, Delaware Chancery Court Judge John Noble said
in a 38-page opinion made public yesterday in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheros was sued in January by shareholders contending the
$45 per-share offer is inadequate. Atheros provides expertise in
wireless technology and home-computer networking. Qualcomm,
based in San Diego, is the world&#8217;s largest maker of
semiconductor chips for mobile-phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed transaction arose out of a nearly non-
existent sales process that was orchestrated&#8221; by Barratt, who
stands to gain benefits including $24 million in stock options,
plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer P. Bradford deLeeuw said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly Mulloy, an Atheros spokeswoman, said in a phone
interview the company doesn&#8217;t think delaying the vote &#8220;will
impact the completion of our original timetable and we expect to
close in the first half of this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated case is In re Atheros Communications Inc.
Shareholder Litigation, CA6124, Delaware Chancery Court

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Hedge Fund Manager Pleads Guilty to Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francisco Illarramendi, a hedge fund manager in
Connecticut, pleaded guilty to fraud and two other men were
charged with conspiracy in a U.S. probe of an alleged Ponzi
scheme with potential investor and creditor losses of hundreds
of millions of dollars, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illarramendi, 42, pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court
in Bridgeport to two counts of wire fraud and one count each of
securities fraud, investment-adviser fraud and conspiracy to
obstruct justice, said U.S. Attorney David Fein in Connecticut
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plea couldn&#8217;t be confirmed immediately in electronic
court records. John Gleason, an attorney for Illarramendi,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2006 to February, Illarramendi used money from new
investors to pay returns he promised to earlier ones using
fraudulent documents that purported to show the hedge funds had
hundreds of millions of dollars in credits, Fein said.
Illarramendi, Juan Carlos Guillen Zerpa, 43, and Juan Carlos
Horna Napolitano, 40, allegedly conspired to obstruct a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the hedge
funds, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Targ, an attorney for Zerpa, couldn&#8217;t immediately be
reached for comment. Dan Forman, an attorney for Napolitano,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC case is SEC v. Illarramendi, 11-78, U.S. District
Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in mortgage-backed bonds sold by Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) lost a case to have the notes declared in default,
which they&#8217;d brought to increase their chances of getting paid
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal in London upheld a lower court ruling
against holders of bonds that were part of the Eurosail-UK 2007-
3BL Plc transaction sold in 2007. Lehman, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in September 2008, raised 650 million
pounds ($1.1 billion) from the deal, which packaged U.K. home
loans into bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd., the financing&#8217;s
trustee, brought the original case after holders of $405 million
of so-called class A3 notes asked it to call an event of default
because of the issuer&#8217;s insolvency. If they&#8217;d won, these
investors would no longer have had to wait for their money until
the more senior class A1 and A2 noteholders were repaid in full, Fitch Ratings said after the original judgment in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s appeal court judgment &#8220;is generally positive&#8221;
for the U.K. mortgage-backed securities market, said Conor
Downey, a London-based partner at law firm Paul Hastings Janofsky  Walker LLP. &#8220;Most deals even if they have seen drops
in asset values, can apply the decision and form decisions that
they are solvent and able to continue to trade,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurosail&#8217;s risk was hedged with interest-rate and currency
swaps with Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc., which were in
turn guaranteed by Lehman Brothers. The financing unit filed for
bankruptcy a month after its parent, and the swap agreements
were terminated in November 2009. Eurosail has filed claims
against Lehman Brothers seeking more than $221 million to cover
losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd. v.
Eurosail-UK 2007-3BL Plc  ors, A2/2010/2046, Court of Appeal
(London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayer&#8217;s Cipro Accord Won&#8217;t Be Questioned by U.S. High Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, rebuffing calls to scrutinize &#8220;pay
for delay&#8221; drug settlements, refused to revive a suit accusing Bayer AG (BAYN) of paying almost $400 million to forestall competition
to its Cipro antibiotic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court, without comment, yesterday rejected an appeal
from drugstore chains that sought to press an antitrust suit
over a 1997 settlement between Bayer and Barr Laboratories Inc.,
now part of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) Under the
accord, Bayer paid Barr $398 million, while Barr dropped its
challenge to a Bayer patent and agreed not to sell a generic
version of Cipro until June 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents say such settlements are rampant in the drug
industry, costing consumers $3.5 billion a year, according to
the Federal Trade Commission, which has led the criticism.
Consumer advocates and 32 states joined the pharmacies and a
drug wholesaler in urging Supreme Court review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case involves one of the most controversial business
practices in the United States in one of the most important
segments of the economy,&#8221; the chains argued in their appeal.
The group includes two of the three largest U.S. drugstore
companies, CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) and Rite-Aid Corp. (RAD) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Wholesale Drug v. Bayer, 10-762, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo Group Rejected by U.S. High Court on $300 Million Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court refused to question a jury verdict
that may force Apollo Group Inc. (APOL), the owner of the University of
Phoenix, to pay more than $300 million for deceiving
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday rejected an appeal from Apollo,
accused of withholding an Education Department report that said
the company was illegally paying recruiters on the basis of
enrollment numbers. Apollo, the largest U.S. for-profit college
operator, said the suing shareholders didn&#8217;t show that the
eventual release of the report&#8217;s details caused the company&#8217;s
prices to fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how much Apollo must pay will depend on how many
shareholders file claims. An expert witness for the suing
shareholders testified at trial that the verdict might affect as
many as 50 million shares, meaning Apollo would owe $277.5
million, plus interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phoenix-based Apollo has set aside $177 million to cover
damages and other litigation costs. The company said in a
regulatory filing in January that it estimates damages will be
between $127 million to $228 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in an e-mailed statement that it &#8220;has
already fully accrued the estimated liability in relation to
this litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a court filing in August, the company said the jury
verdict &#8220;could result in a total payment of an amount between
$200 and $300 million.&#8221; That range represents a &#8220;worst-case
scenario,&#8221; said Manny Rivera, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute stems from an Education Department report
delivered to the company privately in February 2004. The report
said the company needed to make &#8220;substantial and comprehensive
changes to the salary compensation system for its recruiters and
their direct supervisors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo agreed to revamp its compensation system and on
Sept. 7, 2004, the company announced it was paying $9.8 million
to resolve the Education Department&#8217;s investigation. The company
revealed the existence of the report, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, the company&#8217;s shares fell from $82.72 to
$82.07, a drop the suing shareholders said would have been
greater had the company been upfront about the report. By Sept.
21, after a series of newspaper articles provided more details
and a securities analyst had downgraded the stock, shares had
fallen to $72.00. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo officials said during the case that they didn&#8217;t
disclose the report because their lawyers told them it was
preliminary and flawed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apollo Group v. Policeman&#8217;s Annuity and Benefit
Fund of Chicago, 10-649, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern Firm to Cease Foreclosure Work, Unit Says in Filing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law Offices of David J. Stern PA, under investigation
in Florida for its foreclosure practices, will stop processing
home-seizure cases by the end of the month, according to an
affiliated company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern&#8217;s firm &#8220;will be ceasing the practice of law with
respect to all pending foreclosure matters,&#8221; according to a
filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission by DJSP Enterprises Inc. (DJSPU), which provides non-legal
services for the firm. &#8220;As a result, the company does not
expect to receive any further file referrals from this
customer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern and his firm are under investigation in Florida for
allegedly &#8220;fabricating and/or presenting false and misleading
documents in foreclosure cases,&#8221; according to the attorney
general&#8217;s website. Shannon Knowles, a spokeswoman for Attorney
General Pam Bondi, said the investigation hasn&#8217;t ended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t stop&#8221; because the firm is closing its
foreclosure practice, Knowles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one answered the phone at the Plantation, Florida,
office that the law firm and DJSP share. Stern&#8217;s attorney,
Jeffrey Tew, said the firm would stop handling foreclosures and
declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last year barred the firm from
handling their foreclosure cases. Citigroup Inc. (C) said in October
that it had stopped directing foreclosure work to the firm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil declined for the first time in
three days, retreating from a 29-month high, as members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries discussed whether
to hold a special meeting on a production increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude slipped as Kuwait&#8217;s oil minister said OPEC members
are considering whether to convene an &#8220;urgent meeting&#8221; to
determine whether more output is needed. Futures trimmed earlier
losses after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America
Merrill Lynch raised their oil-price forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market &#8220;is adjusting back to previous levels, showing
increased supply is priced in,&#8221; said Alexander Ridgers, head of
commodities at London-based CMC Markets. &#8220;It&#8217;s not easily
swayed unless facts come to light fast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
fell as much as $2.11, or 2 percent, to $103.33 a barrel and was
at $105.31 at 1:28 p.m. London time. The price has risen 21
percent in the past month and reached $106.95 yesterday, the
highest since Sept. 26, 2008. Brent crude for April settlement
was down $1.04 at $114 a barrel after falling as much as $2.25
to $112.79 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuwait&#8217;s oil minister told reporters in Kuwait City today
that OPEC Secretary General Abdulla El-Badri is contacting
members to see whether a meeting on production levels is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve talked to Abdulla El-Badri in this regard and he is
calling everybody and making a consensus on whether we&#8217;ll need
an OPEC meeting, an urgent meeting,&#8221; Sheikh Ahmad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah said. &#8220;We have to find out at the meeting whether
there is a need for an increase or not.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Sweet Crude &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violence in Libya, Africa&#8217;s third-largest crude producer,
has cut output by as much as 1 million barrels a day, according
to the International Energy Agency. The North African country
pumped 1.39 million barrels a day in February, down from 1.59
million the previous month, according to Bloomberg estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vienna-based researcher JBC Energy GmbH estimated Libya
accounts for 8.8 percents of total global production of light,
sweet crude, or crude oil with low density and sulfur content.
This type of crude yields more lucrative fuels such as gasoline
and diesel when processed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The loss of Libyan light, sweet crude poses a threat to
profitability of Europe&#8217;s already troubled refining industry,&#8221;
JBC said today in an e-mailed note. &#8220;This is due to the fact
that refineries rely heavily on high-quality crudes to produce
value-added products and minimize expensive processing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Supply Effect &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some OPEC members and producers outside the group have made
up for the reduction in crude shipments from Libya, Qatari
Energy Minister Mohammed Saleh al Sada said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was hardly any effect&#8221; on supply because of the
Libyan unrest, he said at a conference in Doha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group&#8217;s next formal meeting is scheduled for June 8 in
Vienna. Most OPEC members were already producing more than their
individual quotas before the Libyan unrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya&#8217;s government denied holding talks with rebels in the
North African nation, Al Arabiya television reported today,
without saying where it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libyan rebel fighters prepared an offensive to regain a town
lost to Muammar Qaddafi&#8217;s forces as the U.S. and its allies
stepped up the debate on imposing a no-fly zone that might help
the insurgents win the civil war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrations have toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and
there have been protests in countries including Iran, Yemen and
Oman. In Saudi Arabia, OPEC&#8217;s biggest producer, websites have
called for a nationwide &#8220;Day of Rage&#8221; on March 11 and March
20, according to Human Rights Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Saudi government &#8220;takes a very tough line with the
demonstrators, it could produce some headline risk in the
market, even if no oil production is placed at risk,&#8221; analysts
led by Helima Croft at Barclays Capital said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price Forecasts Raised &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised its second-quarter outlook for Brent
crude by $4.50 to $105 a barrel, citing estimates that spare
capacity in OPEC has dropped below 2 million barrels a day,
according to a report dated yesterday. Bank of America Merrill
Lynch increased its Brent crude price forecast for this year to
$108 a barrel from $88 and for next year to $95 a barrel from
$85, the bank said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
U.S. gasoline inventories dropped 2 million barrels from 234.7
million, according to the Bloomberg News survey. It would be a
third week of declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude stockpiles increased in six of the last seven
weeks, according to government data. Inventories probably rose 1
million barrels last week from 346.4 million in the previous
period, according to the survey. Five of the analysts
anticipated a gain and four projected a decline. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Gonzalo Vina" date="Mar 08, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-08/goldman-s-pariah-status-fades-with-broadbent-s-bank-of-england-appointment.html"><headline>Goldman's Pariah Status Fades With BoE's Broadbent Appointment</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England&#8217;s appointment of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Senior European Economist Ben Broadbent
to its Monetary Policy Committee shows governments are again
looking to the firm for top decision makers, less than a year
after it settled U.S. fraud claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent, who has worked at Goldman Sachs since 2000, will
replace Andrew Sentance at the end of May, the Treasury in
London said yesterday. He joins a panel that has split four ways
on policy for the first time since the central bank&#8217;s
independence in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition parties last year pressed U.K. Prime Minister
Gordon Brown to suspend Goldman Sachs from government work after
the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New York-based
company in April. Brown said at the time he was shocked by the
&#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; described in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think this was much more unlikely to have happened six
or eight months ago,&#8221; Steven Kaplan, a professor at the
University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said of
Broadbent&#8217;s appointment. In the intervening months, &#8220;the fact
that we haven&#8217;t seen anything else truly scandalous with them or
with any of the other top banks has definitely helped.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the SEC has shown an interest in luring Goldman Sachs&#8217;
expertise. In January, it hired Eileen Rominger, who spent 11
years in the firm&#8217;s asset-management division, including as
global chief investment officer. She now heads the SEC&#8217;s
division of investment management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the firm paid $550 million to settle SEC civil
claims that it misled investors in a mortgage-linked investment
that was sold in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate case last week, the agency accused Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs board member, of telling hedge-
fund manager Raj Rajaratnam about Warren Buffett&#8217;s
$5 billion investment in the bank in 2008 before the deal was
announced. Gupta and Rajaratnam deny the insider-trading
allegations. The firm wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs employees hold key policy-setting
positions worldwide. New York Federal Reserve Bank President
William Dudley is the firm&#8217;s former chief U.S. economist. Bank
of Canada Governor Mark Carney is a former managing director.
Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, the current frontrunner to
become the next president of the European Central Bank, was vice
chairman of the firm&#8217;s international arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin both headed the bank before
becoming Treasury secretaries, while other former leaders
include Stephen Friedman, who was an adviser to President George W. Bush, and Jon Corzine, who governed New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third on Panel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent is the third Goldman Sachs employee to join the
Monetary Policy Committee. Former U.K. rate-setters David Walton
and Sushil Wadhwani had Goldman Sachs on their resumes before
joining the central bank. Broadbent also has worked previously
at the Treasury and the Bank of England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Chancellor appointed him because he was the
outstanding candidate from the field,&#8221; said a Treasury
spokesman, who declined to be named to comply with U.K. civil-
service rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes sense for the government to hire the best and
the brightest,&#8221; said James Angel, a finance professor at
Georgetown University&#8217;s business school in Washington. The
public doesn&#8217;t typically hold ill will for long against
individual firms, he said. &#8220;Most people outside of the
financial markets don&#8217;t really know the difference between
Goldman Sachs, Countrywide and their friendly neighborhood local
bank,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Wall Street has provided other executives for government
positions this year. In January, President Barack Obama named
William Daley, 62, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executive and former
commerce secretary, as his chief of staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has taken steps to restore its reputation and
win the trust of clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
established a Business Standards Committee to examine the firm&#8217;s
responsibilities to clients, review how it identifies and
manages conflicts of interest, and consider whether financial
reporting and public disclosure could improve. The committee
also looked at whether the firm was properly selling complex
products, adequately training employees and whether companywide
operating committees could become more effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel issued a report in January with 39 proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Reputational Excellence&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the recommendations in this report represent a
fundamental re-commitment of Goldman Sachs to our clients and to
reputational excellence in everything the firm does,&#8221;
Blankfein, 56, said in the statement announcing the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadbent will join Adam Posen, Martin Weale and David Miles as the fourth external member of the rate-setting panel.
Governor Mervyn King, Paul Tucker, Charles Bean, Paul Fisher and
Spencer Dale are the internal members. At the last meeting,
Sentance voted to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50
basis points from a record low of 0.5 percent. Weale and Dale
called for a 25 basis-point increase, while the remaining six
opted to maintain the current rate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI) posted
its biggest two-day rally since July 2009 after announcing a
restructuring that would include Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
increasing its stake in the money-transfer company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Minneapolis-based MoneyGram advanced 20 cents, or
6.6 percent, to $3.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading and earlier climbed as much as 9.5 percent, on
top of yesterday&#8217;s 14 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would receive $77.5 million in cash and
additional preferred shares that may be equal to a 30 percent
equity stake if converted to common stock, MoneyGram said
yesterday in a statement. Boston-based private-equity firm
Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and its co-investors would get $140.8
million in cash and own about 55 percent of the common shares.
The deal may close in mid-2011, MoneyGram said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This transaction is beneficial to current and future
shareholders,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Pamela H. Patsley, 54,
said yesterday in a conference call with analysts. &#8220;It
increases the attractiveness of our common stock by removing the
uncertainty surrounding the current capital structure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoneyGram, the second-largest money-transfer firm after Western Union Co. (WU), sold preferred stock to THL and New York-
based Goldman Sachs in 2008 after reporting declines in
investments linked to the U.S. housing market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) jumped 2.2 percent in New York trading after seven
analysts boosted their price targets for the company, including
one who predicted the shares will reach $200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Whitmore, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, raised his
price target for the stock 14 percent to $200, saying IBM&#8217;s
analyst meeting yesterday made the company&#8217;s profit targets seem
&#8220;conservative.&#8221; He&#8217;s now one of eight analysts tracked by
Bloomberg projecting the shares will reach at least $180. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At yesterday&#8217;s meeting, IBM reiterated its goals of almost
doubling per-share operating earnings to at least $20 and
increasing sales by about $20 billion by 2015. The company is
being conservative on revenue growth and how much it will be
able to eliminate in expenses, Whitmore wrote in a note to
clients yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe there is ample flexibility for IBM to beat this
target and expect investors to place a larger premium on IBM&#8217;s
earnings stream as confidence in this goal increases,&#8221; said San
Francisco-based Whitmore, who maintained his &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the
company&#8217;s shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said it sees $8 billion in cost savings through 2015
and is assuming only $3 billion of that in its profit target,
Whitmore wrote. The company could see about $25 in operating
earnings per share in 2015, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose $3.58 to $165.86 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the steepest
jump since Jan. 24. The shares have climbed 13 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should use options to bet
on a potential increase in DirecTV (DTV)&#8217;s stock price, as the largest
U.S. satellite-television provider has &#8220;high potential&#8221; to be

strangle. Short-dated options prices are at &#8220;decade lows,&#8221; and
the annual general meeting in April as well as the first-quarter
earnings report in May could boost the share price, the note
also said. El Segundo, California-based DirecTV dropped 0.8
percent to $46.38 as of 3 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Owning June calls, which capture earnings, is attractive
in our view,&#8221; the strategists wrote in a note today. Jason Armstrong, an analyst who upgraded DirecTV to a &#8220;buy&#8221; on Feb.
27 and has a price forecast of $55, &#8220;sees the company as a
strategic fit for large-cap telcos,&#8221; the note said. &#8220;DTV
options are not pricing in takeout potential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions are rebounding as the global
economy recovers from the worst recession since the Great
Depression. There were $2.47 trillion of deals announced
worldwide last year, up from $1.9 trillion in 2009. The 1,000
biggest companies worldwide, excluding financial-services
industries, have amassed more than $3 trillion in cash and
equivalents based on their latest filings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyout Candidates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dish Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-
television provider, on Feb. 10 rose the most in almost a year
after Credit Suisse Group AG said ATT Inc. may make a bid to
buy the company. Analyst Jonathan Chaplin said Dish is an
appealing buyout candidate to large phone companies because
consumers increasingly want video and broadband from the same
provider. Englewood, Colorado-based Dish rose 0.7 percent to
$23.83. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish Network spokeswoman Francie Bauer and DirecTV
spokesman Darris Gringeri both declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirecTV has advanced 33 percent in the past year, compared
with a 23 percent increase for companies in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index that are dependent on discretionary spending by
consumers. Dish has gained 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company in January recommended buying
DirecTV March $45 calls as well as selling January $40 puts and
selling January $55 calls, and in December recommended selling
January $35 puts and January $55 calls. Fogertey and Marshall
said to close those trade recommendations now, at a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) bought a
stake in Management Dynamics Inc., a closely held New Jersey
company that makes software to automate international shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We plan to use the funds from Goldman to make a strategic
acquisition to expand our product portfolio and further distance
ourselves from the competition,&#8221; Management Dynamics Chief
Executive Officer Jim Preuninger said in a statement today from
the East Rutherford-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management Dynamics didn&#8217;t disclose the size of the stake. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
didn&#8217;t immediate reply to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene Yoon, a managing director at New York-based Goldman
Sachs, will join the board of the company, according to the
statement. Yoon is head of private equity for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Americas Special Situations Group, according to a biography
published on the Management Dynamics website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preuninger worked in sales and marketing for International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) before founding Management Dynamics in
1989, the company&#8217;s website says. John Preuninger, president and
chief operating officer and Jim&#8217;s twin brother, was a strategy
consultant at Monitor Company before joining Management Dynamics
in 1990, Kathleen Hickey, a spokeswoman, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in January changed the way it reports its
financial results, creating a new division called Investing and
Lending. Investments by the special situations group, which buys
distressed debt and equity and makes loans, have been mostly
moved out of the company&#8217;s fixed-income, currencies and
commodities division into the new investing and lending segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing and Lending contributed 19 percent of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s 2010 revenue, making it the second-largest division on
that basis after institutional client services, or sales and
trading, according to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s annual 10-K filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Investing and Lending accounted for 6 percent of
the firm&#8217;s revenue, the filing showed, and in fiscal 2008 it had
negative revenue of $10.8 billion, making it the only money-
losing division that year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest company by market value, plans to spend $100 million a
day for the next half decade on capital projects such as new oil
wells and natural-gas plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has budgeted $34 billion for capital projects this
year, a 5.6 percent increase from 2010, Chief Executive Officer
Rex Tillerson said today at an analyst meeting in New York. The
budget will range from $33 billion to $37 billion through 2015,
according to a slide presentation prepared for the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon expects to boost oil and gas production by 3 percent
to 4 percent this year, the company said. Eleven new projects
are scheduled to begin pumping oil or gas between now and 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is spending more as the company expands its search
for untapped oil and gas fields, and upgrades refining and
chemical plants in Asia to supply the world&#8217;s fastest-growing
energy markets. Production rose 13 percent last year, the
largest annual increase since Exxon&#8217;s 1999 acquisition of Mobil
Corp.  Oil prices reached a 29-month high this week amid unrest
in the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are executing a large inventory of high-quality
projects,&#8221; Tillerson said today. &#8220;Actual spending in a given
year will vary depending on the pace and the progress of each
project.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 80 percent of production from new wells between now
and 2016 will consist of crude oil, the company said. Exxon&#8217;s
exploration prospects range from Madagascar to Greenland to Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outpacing Mexico&#8217;s Reserves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company replaced 209 percent of the oil and gas pumped
from its wells last year, partly through the $34.9 billion
acquisition of Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy Inc. Exxon had
proved reserves equivalent to 24.8 billion barrels at the end of
December, which exceeded the crude reserves of nations such as
Mexico or Algeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares fell 84 cents to $83.76 at 9:57 a.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which traces its roots to the 1880s and John D.
Rockefeller&#8217;s Standard Oil Trust, earned $15.50 in profit on
each barrel of crude it produced in 2010, Tillerson said today
in remarks to a gathering of analysts at the New York Stock
Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is awaiting U.S. regulatory approval to drill two
wells at its deep-water Hadrian discovery in the Gulf of Mexico,
the company said. Work on Hadrian was interrupted after the
fatal explosion at BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in April prompted the
government to halt all exploration drilling in waters deeper
than 500 feet (152 meters). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French stock market regulator

shares since Feb. 8, the Le Monde newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of shares traded has reached more than 50 times

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s theme park in
Shanghai will be built in a 7 square-kilometer (2.7 square-mile)
area that the city has designated as a tourist destination,
according to a draft blueprint of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the government project covers 3.9 square
kilometers which includes a theme park, hotels, car parks, a
lake and commuter stations, according to the plan, on which the
government is seeking public opinion. The municipality will
extend two subway lines connecting to the site, according to the
blueprint posted on the city government&#8217;s website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project&#8217;s first phase will cost 24.5 billion yuan ($3.7
billion), Mayor Han Zheng said on March 6. The Disneyland theme
park in Shanghai, the first in mainland China for the Burbank,
California-based company, is expected to attract 7.3 million
visitors a year when it opens in 2015 in the Pudong area, the
city government said in a statement on March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney won&#8217;t comment &#8220;until the regulatory approval
process is complete,&#8221; Alannah Hall-Smith, a Hong Kong-based
spokeswoman for the world&#8217;s biggest theme-park company, said in
an e-mailed statement. A person who answered the phone at the
media department of Shanghai&#8217;s Urban Planning, Land and
Resources Administration Bureau, who would only give his surname
as Xu, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water will be a prominent feature of Shanghai Disneyland,
which will feature three theme parks -- &#8220;Magic Kingdom,&#8221;
&#8220;Epcot&#8221; and &#8220;Animal Kingdom&#8221; -- according to the March 3
government statement. &#8220;Large-scale&#8221; construction could start
as early as May, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, which won government approval for a theme park in
2009, signed a contract in November with state-owned Shanghai
Shendi Group Co. to build the facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai started building infrastructure for Disney&#8217;s first
park on the Chinese mainland last year, Jiang Shujie, deputy
director of the city&#8217;s construction and transport commission
said on Jan.7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
world&#8217;s best-paid merger adviser, named Michael Carr and David &#8216;Dusty&#8217; Philip to run the business in the Americas, succeeding
Timothy Ingrassia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingrassia, 46, will take the title of co-chairman of global
mergers and acquisitions alongside Jack Levy and Gene Sykes, New
York-based Goldman Sachs said yesterday in an internal memo.
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman, confirmed the
contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carr, 52, is returning to a leadership post he held a
decade ago. He joined Goldman Sachs from Salomon Smith Barney
Inc. in 1998 and was tapped to co-head the Americas mergers
business the following year. In 2000, he moved to Hong Kong to
oversee Goldman Sachs&#8217; investment-banking operation in Asia, and
returned to New York in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carr recently advised Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Airgas
Inc. (ARG) on its defense against a yearlong, $5.9 billion hostile
pursuit from Air Products  Chemicals Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip, a Goldman Sachs employee since 1991, has advised
health-care and industrial companies on mergers, including
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. on its $26 billion sale last
year to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) In 2006, he
worked with Fisher Scientific International Inc. on its $11
billion sale to Thermo Electron Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon Dyal remains the global head of the mergers
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs collected $2.06 billion from advisory fees in
2010, the most of any firm. Goldman Sachs trailed Morgan Stanley
in Bloomberg&#8217;s ranking of merger advisers by dollar value of
transactions last year, working on $451 billion of deals
compared with Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s $472 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Brazil&#8217;s measures to curb rising
inflation may deepen a selloff in the nation&#8217;s stock market as
investors refrain from adding to positions, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unless markets get clear indications from the government&#8217;s
economic team about where Brazil is going and what strategy it
will employ, the bias of most investors is to wait and see from
the sidelines,&#8221; analysts including Emy Shayo Cherman wrote in a
note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 1 percent in 2010,
the worst annual performance relative to the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index. Brazil&#8217;s central bank signaled today it may
resort to additional measures to curb credit growth and contain
inflation running at the fastest pace in more than two years,
according to minutes published from the March 1-2 policy
meeting. Brazil&#8217;s benchmark interest rate was lifted to a two-
year high last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of more rate increases means &#8220;equity markets
will need to adjust once more,&#8221; the analysts said. &#8220;If the
domestic economy and earnings don&#8217;t decelerate, inflation won&#8217;t
either, and therefore, more rate hikes will be needed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising oil prices and concern that the economy will lose
momentum &#8220;could lead to another round of outflows from global
investors in Brazil,&#8221; Shayo Cherman said. In this scenario,
&#8220;U.S. markets are likely to overperform Brazil this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dilma Rousseff&#8217;s administration is relying on a
mix of higher rates, measures to curb credit expansion and
spending cuts to slow inflation running at the fastest pace in
27 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors &#8216;Doing Homework&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are &#8220;still not ready&#8221; to buy more Brazilian
equities, the analysts said. They issued the report after
visiting 25 clients in the U.S. to assess their views on
Brazil&#8217;s stock market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are starting to do their homework on Brazil once
more, but are still not ready to add positions and likely will
not do so until there is a great deal more visibility on the
outlook for local interest rates and inflation,&#8221; Shayo Cherman
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists covering the Brazilian economy expect policy
makers to raise the overnight rate to 12.5 percent from today&#8217;s
11.75 percent by the end of the year, according to the median
estimate in a March 4 weekly central bank survey of about 100
analysts. The same survey showed economists forecast consumer
prices will increase 5.78 percent this year and 4.80 percent in
2012. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa stock index fell 3 percent this year through
yesterday, as homebuilders and banks led declines on concern
rising inflation will spur additional measures to restrict
credit growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 5.5
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Valero Energy Corp. (VLO), the largest
U.S. oil refiner, plans to buy Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s U.K. refinery for
about $2 billion, said two people with knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An announcement was scheduled for today, and now may come
as soon as tomorrow, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the deal hasn&#8217;t been made public. Chevron has
been seeking a buyer for the Pembroke refinery in Wales, its
last European plant, for almost a year. The offer, expected to
be in cash, includes the plant&#8217;s inventory of crude oil and
refined products, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can say that we&#8217;ve been very explicit about our desire
to explore our options in Europe,&#8221; said Bill Day, a spokesman
for San Antonio-based Valero. Day said the company doesn&#8217;t
comment on speculation about potential purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is among oil
companies selling refineries to cut debt and redeploy spending
to oil exploration and development in higher growth regions.
Valero hasn&#8217;t bought a refinery since its 2005 acquisition of
Premcor Inc., and has sold four refineries in that time, two on
the U.S. East Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s view is that &#8220;you get better returns upstream
than you do downstream,&#8221; said Mark Samter, an analyst at CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets in Sydney who covers refiner Caltex
Australia Ltd. (CTX), half-owned by Chevron. &#8220;Refining is a pretty
ugly business. In good cycles, you make a decent return,
probably three or maybe four years every decade, and arguably
we&#8217;re going structurally into a cycle that&#8217;s broken.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanlow Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery&#8217;s almost $2 billion price tag is about twice
the amount offered by India&#8217;s Essar Group for Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)&#8217;s Stanlow refinery in the U.K., when adjusted for size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on March
21, 2010, that it planned to sell Pembroke. The refinery can
process 210,000 barrels of crude a day, or about 11 percent of
total U.K. capacity, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Comey, a spokesman for Chevron, declined to comment in
an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While margins from turning crude into fuel may improve
during the next 12 months to 18 months, countries are adding
more refining capacity to increase energy security, &#8220;not on an
economic rationale,&#8221; CLSA Asia-Pacific&#8217;s Samter said by phone
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero fell 51 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $27.20 at 8:34
a.m. in New York, before the start of regular trading on U.S.
markets. Chevron fell $1.04, or 1 percent, to $101.10 at 8:37
a.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero Chief Executive Officer Bill Klesse told analysts at
a conference last month that Valero would only pay cash for any
refineries it purchased. The company ended 2010 with over $3
billion in cash available on hand. Valero has expressed interest
in acquiring a European refinery for more than six years, and
failed in a bid to buy a stake in Total SA (FP)&#8217;s Vlissingen plant in
the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
invest as much as $65 million in closely held Management
Dynamics Inc., whose software helps companies automate
international shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s special situations group
will enable East Rutherford, New Jersey-based Management
Dynamics to pursue an acquisition, Chief Executive Officer Jim Preuninger said yesterday in a phone interview. Goldman Sachs
provided $15 million in equity up front and will supply as much
as $50 million more, depending on the acquisition size, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a short list of companies that we&#8217;re talking to,
we haven&#8217;t finalized a deal right now,&#8221; Preuninger said. &#8220;It
would be a software company that had a product or two that we
don&#8217;t have but would be very complementary and would fit in well
with our ambition of automating the full order-to-pay life cycle
of a global transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank, the deal
shows that the special situations group continues to make new
investments amid uncertainty over how government implementation
of the so-called Volcker Rule may restrict deals with the firm&#8217;s
own capital. David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial
officer, told analysts in October that the &#8220;predominant&#8221; part
of the special situations group is &#8220;a lending business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minority Stake &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preuninger, who founded the company in 1989, said Goldman
Sachs will have a minority stake and declined to specify the
size. He and his twin brother John are the biggest shareholders,
he said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preuninger wouldn&#8217;t disclose Management Dynamics&#8217;s
financial information, other than saying that it is profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even in the shaky economic times that everybody went
through, we had great years in &#8216;08, &#8216;09 and 2010,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Putting another one on top of that is important to us. I think
we&#8217;re well on our way to doing that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is not using Goldman Sachs or any other
investment bank as an adviser on the acquisition, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preuninger said he was approached by a Goldman Sachs
employee at a conference in San Francisco hosted by investment
bank Thomas Weisel Partners Group Inc. more than a year ago.
Before Goldman, Management Dynamics had equity investments from
venture-capital firms Cross Atlantic Capital Partners and UpData
Partners, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, Wal-Mart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preuninger previously worked in sales and marketing for International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), according to the software
company&#8217;s website. John Preuninger, president and chief
operating officer, was a strategy consultant at Monitor Company
before joining in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management Dynamics&#8217;s clients include Apple Inc. (AAPL), Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO), Honeywell International Inc. (HON), and Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT), Jim Preuninger said. They use the software in more than 70
countries and trade across 122 nations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene Yoon, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, is joining
Management Dynamics&#8217;s board. Yoon is head of private equity for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Americas special situations group, according to
a biography published on the Management Dynamics website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which employs about 400 people, has discussed
whether to pursue an initial public offering, Preuninger said.
While the company is big enough to proceed with an IPO, that&#8217;s
not the plan, he said. Private equity investors are typically
patient as long as the company makes progress, he said. Goldman
Sachs may be even more patient, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Pressure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of times, a private equity investor or venture
capitalist has a lot of the money come from limited partners,
who have provided that capital to them with a time frame in
mind, it might be 10 years,&#8221; Preuninger said. &#8220;Goldman&#8217;s
capital all comes from Goldman Sachs, so they don&#8217;t have the
same kind of pressures to turn over their capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in January changed the way it reports
financial results, creating a division called Investing and
Lending. The special situations group, which buys distressed
debt and equity and makes loans, has moved most of its holdings
out of the firm&#8217;s fixed-income, currencies and commodities
division into the new segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing and Lending contributed 19 percent of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s 2010 revenue, making it the second-largest division on
that basis after institutional client services, or sales and
trading, according to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s annual 10-K filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Investing and Lending accounted for 6 percent of
revenue, the filing showed, and in fiscal 2008 it had negative
revenue of $10.8 billion, making it the only money-losing
division that year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPC index rose 0.6 percent to 36,091.22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL MM), the largest Coke bottler in
Latin America, rose 0.3 percent to 91.17 pesos a day after
announcing plans to sell debt in Mexico this year. The soft-
drink bottler, controlled by Monterrey-based Fomento Economico
Mexicano SAB, didn&#8217;t provide a date or size of the sale in a
statement to the Mexico stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonos de Mexico SAB (TELMEXL MM), the nation&#8217;s largest
fixed-line provider, fell 2.1 percent to 10.18 pesos. The shares
have fallen 5.3 percent since Telmex said March 8 that it wants
to split its business in rural areas into a separate company
called Telmex Social. Telmex hasn&#8217;t contacted the government to
ask for permission to restructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megacable Holdings SAB (MEGACPO MM), a telecom services
provider based in Guadalajara, Mexico, gained 2.1 percent to
26.93 pesos on volume 44 times its three-month average. Earlier,
Megacable increased as much as 9.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrias Penoles SAB (PEOLES* MM), Mexico&#8217;s largest
silver producer, rose 0.6 percent to 417.76 pesos. Silver
futures for May delivery gained 86.9 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
$35.935 an ounce. This week, the price increased 1.7 percent,
the seventh straight gain. The metal has more than doubled in
the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfa SAB (ALFAA MM), the world&#8217;s largest producer of
aluminum engine heads, fell 0.1 percent to 150.68 pesos. U.S.
applications for first-time unemployment benefits for the week
ended March 5 surpassed the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. The U.S. is Alfa&#8217;s second-biggest revenue
source. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, rose 1.6 percent to 10.48 pesos after boosting its
convertible-bond sale by as much as 21 percent over what it
planned as the company seeks to reduce bank debt faster. Cemex
aims to sell as much as $1.67 billion of convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Board approved Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s request to retain its 9.8 percent
stake in Avenue Financial Holdings Inc.&#8217;s voting shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman has committed not to exercise or attempt to
exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies
of Avenue or any of its subsidiaries,&#8221; the Fed said today in a
statement announcing the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed approval is required for any bank-holding company to
own 5 percent or more of the voting shares of a bank. Through
its stake in Nashville, Tennessee-based Avenue Financial,
Goldman Sachs also indirectly holds voting shares in the Avenue
Bank unit, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Avenue Financial received $7.4 million from
the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief Program,
which it hasn&#8217;t repaid, according to the Treasury&#8217;s website.
Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which was the largest U.S. securities firm
before converting to a bank-holding company in September 2008,
holds the Avenue shares through a hedge fund, Goldman Sachs
Investment Partners Master Fund L.P., the Fed said. The purchase
by the Cayman Islands limited partnership was made before
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conversion and was a passive investment,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s approval &#8220;is specifically conditioned on
compliance by Goldman with the conditions imposed in this order
and the commitments made to the Board in connection with the
application," the central bank said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avenue was formed in 2006 and purchased Planters Bank of Tennessee in Maury City, Tennessee, in 2007, according to the
Fed. It changed the bank&#8217;s name to Avenue and moved the
headquarters to Nashville, the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;

Dreibus" date="Mar 11, 2011  9:27 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-11/goldman-sachs-sees-corn-wheat-rallies-peaking-as-stockpile-forecasts-gain.html"><headline>Wheat Peaking in Goldman Sachs Forecast as Inventory Larger Than Estimated</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The surge in crop prices that drove
food costs to a record last month may be peaking because global
inventories are now forecast to be more plentiful than
previously expected, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn will be up 1.8 percent a year from now at $6.75 a
bushel, while wheat will be 4.3 percent higher at $7.50 a
bushel, the bank said in a report. Corn surged 82 percent in the
last 12 months and wheat jumped 50 percent as flooding from Canada to Australia and drought in Russia ruined crops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This stabilization will put a lid on crop prices,&#8221;
Damien Courvalin, a New York-based analyst at the bank, said in
the report. &#8220;With the market focus shifting to the likely 2011-
12 supply response, we actually see downside risk to crop prices
in the near term, especially for corn and cotton.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower prices would help ease the surge in food costs that
contributed to protests across North Africa and the Middle East
in the past few months, toppling leaders in Egypt and Tunisia.
The acceleration in food inflation has driven 44 million more
people into extreme poverty since June, according to the World
Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat futures fell for a fifth day in Chicago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture unexpectedly raised its stockpile
estimate by 2.3 percent to 181.9 million metric tons. The grain
for May delivery slid 21.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $7.19 a
bushel at 7:14 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, headed for
the biggest weekly drop since December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn Drops &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn retreated for a sixth session after the USDA increased
its stockpiles estimate by 0.5 percent to 123.1 million tons.
The grain for May delivery lost 19.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to
$6.6325 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t expect corn and wheat to keep
rallying over the next 12 months, the prices it forecast by then
would still be above the averages over the last five years.
Averages in that period were $4.18 a bushel for corn and $6.16 a
bushel for wheat, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank let its recommendation to investors to buy the
March 2011 corn contract traded in Chicago expire last week,
Courvalin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price declines may be temporary as inventories are still
&#8220;critically low&#8221; and higher prices have yet to curb demand,
Goldman Sachs said. Adverse weather in the Northern Hemisphere
this year also may provide support, according to the report.
Even &#8220;average weather conditions&#8221; will not allow for
sufficient building of stockpiles, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybeans, Cotton &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybeans are most likely to remain in a supply shortage in
2011-12, and Goldman Sachs kept its recommendation to buy the
oilseed traded in Chicago for November delivery. Consumers
should &#8220;take advantage of likely lower prices in the coming
months to layer in upside protection,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also dropped its previous recommendation to
investors to buy the December 2011 cotton contract on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The fiber for May delivery slid 0.7
percent to $1.9955 a pound today, rebounding from a decline of
as much as 2.2 percent. Prices will fall to $1.50 in the next
three months and $1.25 in a year, the bank estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee futures that have lost more than 6 percent in two
sessions in New York also may slide, the report shows. The beans
will fall to $2 a pound in three months and to $1.75 in a year,
Goldman Sachs said. Cocoa, down for four days, will drop to
$2,700 a ton in three months and to $2,400 in a year, the bank
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar futures in New York may rise to 30 cents a pound in
three months before falling back to 20 cents, Goldman Sachs
said. Cattle contracts will remain steady at about $1.15 a pound
in the next three months in Chicago and may rise to $1.20 in a
year, while hog futures may gain to $1.05 a pound in the next
six months, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Czech central bank will
probably start increasing interest rates in June and will lift
borrowing costs more than the European Central Bank by the end
of 2012, JP Morgan forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ceska Narodni Banka, or CNB, has left the benchmark
two-week repo rate at record-low 0.75 percent since May, a
quarter-point below the main ECB rate. The Czech central bank
signaled in its latest forecast that rates may increase around
the end of this year, while the ECB said it may raise borrowing
costs as early as in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The beginning of a Czech interest-rate hiking cycle is
approaching,&#8221; Miroslav Plojhar, a London-based JP Morgan Chase
Bank analyst, wrote in an e-mailed report. &#8220;The base rate is at
an emergency low level of 0.75 percent, the economy continues to
recover, inflation is heading above the 2 percent target and the
ECB will likely initiate a tightening cycle in April.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the seven Czech policy makers voted for a quarter-
point rate increase on Feb. 3. One of the supporters of higher
borrowing costs, Robert Holman, left the central bank&#8217;s board at
after his term ended and was replaced by Lubomir Lizal on Feb.
13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product growth slowed to 2.6 percent in the
three months through December, from 2.8 percent in the third
quarter, data from the statistics office showed today. Household
and government consumption declined, as did fixed investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of policy makers, led by Governor Miroslav Singer, will probably want to wait to see the first-quarter data
before raising interest rates, Plojhar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Votes will likely be cast for a hike at the March 24 and
the May 5 meetings, but until Governor Singer changes his mind,
a majority favoring a hike is unlikely to be formed,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Czech interest rates may rise to 3.25 percent by the end
of 2012, while the euro-area&#8217;s benchmark rate should increase to
2.75 percent by end of next year, JP Morgan forecast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil Morrison, a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) banker fired in December, began advising former
Massachusetts Treasurer Tim Cahill&#8217;s gubernatorial campaign in
2009 even as he was seeking to underwrite state bonds, according
to e-mails obtained through a public records request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison, 36, a top aide to Cahill before he left for Wall
Street in 2007, helped the treasurer review consultants for his
independent run for governor last year, analyzed polls and
discussed strategy at the same time he lobbied for bond
business, correspondence from his Goldman Sachs e-mail address
shows. The New York-based bank underwrote at least $5.6 billion
of Massachusetts bonds at the same time Morrison was helping
Cahill&#8217;s campaign, according to state data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
documents from Cahill and his aides on Jan. 21. Bloomberg News
reported Dec. 16 that the bank stopped underwriting state-level
bonds in October when the Cahill campaign revealed that Morrison
was acting as an adviser. So-called pay-to-play rules restrict
bankers from contributing to politicians who control bond sales,
including limiting volunteer work. Breaking the rules can
trigger a two-year underwriting ban. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell this week, sending
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to the lowest level since Jan.
31, after American and Chinese reports damped optimism about the
global economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities pared their weekly decline yesterday as fuel,
metal and industrial companies helped the market overcome a
global slump that followed Japan&#8217;s worst earthquake on record. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) lost 3.5 percent since March 4, leading the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower, as oil fell 3.1 percent. Finisar Corp. (FNSR) plunged 46 percent, driving down networking
companies such as JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU), after its profit forecast
trailed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slipped 1.3 percent to 1,304.28 after closing
at an almost six-week low of 1,295.11 on March 10. It surged 28
percent between Aug. 26 and Feb. 18 before slumping 2.9 percent.
The Dow retreated 125.48 points, or 1 percent, to 12,044.40 this
week after U.S. jobless claims increased more than forecast, the
American trade deficit widened and China&#8217;s export growth slowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We&#8217;ve had a long run of the market going up," said Giri Cherukuri, a money manager and head trader at Oakbrook
Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois, which oversees $2.7 billion.
"It was more the trade deficit number that affected the market -
- the idea that the economy is not growing as much." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 pared its 2011 gain to 3.7 percent this week as
the bull market began its third year. The benchmark measure of
U.S. equities has rallied 93 percent since sinking to a 12-year
low on March 9, 2009, amid government stimulus measures and
corporate profits that beat analysts&#8217; estimates for eight
straight quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobless Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department on March 10 said applications for
first-time unemployment benefits rose by 26,000 to 397,000 in
the week ended March 5. Economists forecast claims would climb
to 376,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The Commerce Department said on March 10 the trade
deficit in goods and services rose 15 percent to $46.3 billion
in January as a surge in imports led by costlier oil
overshadowed record exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; China&#8217;s unexpected $7.3 billion trade deficit on March 10
was the biggest in seven years, buttressing the government&#8217;s
case against U.S. arguments for faster gains in the yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil slumped 1.5 percent to $101.16 a barrel yesterday after
falling 3.6 percent intraday for its biggest drop since
November, as the earthquake in Japan shut refineries in the
world&#8217;s third-largest oil-consuming nation. Oil had risen to a
29-month peak on March 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fairly Resilient&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s Japan, combined with continued challenges in
emerging markets and the bigger issue of what happens in the
Middle East,&#8221; said Bill McVail, a money manager at Berwyn,
Pennsylvania-based Turner Investments with $18 billion in
assets. &#8220;But the market is fairly resilient and able to process
a lot of negative macro data points in an orderly fashion, it
doesn&#8217;t feel like we have sellers out of control.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling oil prices drove declines in fuel companies, with
the SP 500 Energy Index (S5ENRS) losing 4 percent. Exxon Mobil, the
world&#8217;s biggest company by market value, dropped 3.5 percent to
$82.12. Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil company, fell
3.7 percent to $99.93 for the biggest loss in the Dow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finisar, the U.S. maker of fiber-optic transmission gear,
tumbled the most since its initial public offering in 1999. It
said earnings per share excluding one-time items will probably
be 31 cents to 35 cents this quarter. Analysts predicted 48
cents a share, according to the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finisar lost 46 percent to $23.21. JDS Uniphase slumped 22
percent to $21.26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconductors Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of semiconductor stocks fell 5.7 percent, the most
among 24 groups in the SP 500, after Wells Fargo cut its
industry rating to &#8220;market weight&#8221; from &#8220;overweight,&#8221; citing
the 125 percent gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index
over the last two years. The downgrade &#8220;is more an indication
of a more moderate though still optimistic view of the sector
rather than any active concern about the chip stocks as a
group.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market&#8217;s drop doesn&#8217;t seem to have &#8220;significant
downside implications,&#8221; said Craig Peskin, co-head of technical
analysis at MF Global Inc. &#8220;Some indicators are getting to
minor oversold conditions. It&#8217;s not the start of a significant
decline, more like an interruption in the uptrend of the bull
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sprint Nextel Corp. (S), the third-largest U.S. wireless
provider, advanced 15 percent to $5 for the biggest gain in the
SP 500. Deutsche Telekom AG has held talks to sell its T-Mobile
USA unit to Sprint Nextel Corp. in exchange for a major stake in
the combined entity, said people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ATT Inc. (T), the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, led gains in
the Dow with a 1.9 percent increase to $28.46. Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), the biggest U.S. lender by assets, posted the second-
biggest gain in the Dow, advancing 1.8 percent to $14.38. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Edison SpA (EDN) may ask Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. for an independent valuation of its assets to end a
shareholder dispute about the extent of writedowns, Il Sole 24
Ore reported, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricite de France SA and the Italian shareholders,
which jointly control 61 percent of the Italian electricity
company, will accept a proposal at a board meeting tomorrow from
three independent directors to ask Goldman to review its books,
the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDF is pushing for deeper writedowns than the 200 million
euros ($278 million) proposed by an outside consultant for
Edison, the newspaper said. EDF has already provisioned about
700 million euros against its 50 percent stake in Edison. The
dispute means that the board will not approve the company&#8217;s 2010

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will stop
introducing new versions of the Zune music and video player
because of tepid demand, letting the company shift its focus to
other devices, according to a person familiar with the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will concentrate on putting Zune software onto
mobile phones, such as those running its Windows operating
system, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced. Zune software lets customers
buy songs and movies, as well as pay a monthly fee to stream
unlimited music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zune, introduced in 2006, never managed to break the iPod&#8217;s
grip on the music-player industry and became the brunt of late-
night talk-show jokes. Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPod led the market with 77
percent of unit sales last year, while the Zune failed to crack
the top five, according to NPD Group Inc. By adding the Zune
features to the Windows Phone software, Microsoft aims to gain
ground in another challenging area -- mobile phones -- where
it&#8217;s lost market share to Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, declined to
comment on plans for the Zune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have nothing to announce about another Zune device --
but most recently have introduced Zune HD to Canada via the Zune
Originals store and remain committed to supporting our devices
in North America,&#8221; the company said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;We are thrilled by the consumer excitement for Zune across
many new platforms, including Windows Phone 7 and Xbox 360. Our
long-term strategy focuses on the strength of the entire Zune
ecosystem across Microsoft platforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of a 10 percent U.S. stock
slide by April tripled in a month, options prices show, amid
rising oil prices that threaten the economic recovery and
Japan&#8217;s biggest earthquake, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index options show that traders are
betting that it has a 6 percent chance of losing 10 percent over
the next month, up from a 2 percent probability a month ago,
equity derivatives strategists Krag &#8220;Buzz&#8221; Gregory and John Marshall wrote in a report yesterday. The VIX, a gauge of prices
for options on the equity benchmark, is up 35 percent from last
month&#8217;s low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are boosting the price of protection as crude oil
climbed to a 29-month high this month amid fighting in Libya and
Japan&#8217;s 8.9-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed
thousands, the New York-based strategists wrote. Traders see
more &#8220;tail&#8221; risk, or a higher chance that a lower-probability
event could erase a tenth of stock-market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. options market has increased its likelihood of a
near-term &#8216;tail event&#8217; dramatically given the uncertainty
surrounding the events in the Middle East and Northern Africa
along with the earthquake in Japan,&#8221; the strategists wrote in
the note. &#8220;The transmission of higher oil to slower growth is
now much more of a risk factor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude-oil futures jumped 28 percent to a 29-month high of
$106.95 a barrel in New York from their intraday low on Feb. 15
to the peak on March 7 as concern about supplies increased amid
fighting in Libya and threats of protests in Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude oil options suggest a more
than 20 percent chance that it will end this year above $125,
the strategists wrote. Hedge funds&#8217; bullish oil bets rose to an
all-time high for a third straight week, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s weekly Commitments of
Traders report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher oil prices &#8220;could create strong headwinds for US
equities,&#8221; the strategists wrote. &#8220;The rise in oil is now
emerging as a more meaningful downside risk to U.S. growth later
in the year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each 10 percent gain for crude prices reduces gross
domestic product growth over the next two years by an average of
0.2 percentage points, with a peak impact of 0.5 percentage
points after 4 quarters, the report said, citing Goldman Sachs
U.S. Economist Jan Hatzius. That could reduce growth by as much
as 1 point by late this year or early 2012, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, is reviewing the sale or spin off of business units
that may shrink the company&#8217;s revenue by almost half, said Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, would split off four non-
pharmaceutical businesses as well as other units to reduce
annual revenue to $35 billion to $40 billion from $67 billion,
Anderson said in a research report today, citing a meeting with
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said on Feb. 1 that he is looking at the company&#8217;s
entire portfolio of business units and will complete the review
later this year. That review includes Pfizer&#8217;s established
products division with medicines that have lost patent
protection and revenue of about $10 billion, Anderson wrote
today in a note to clients. The company may be remaking itself
as a pharmaceutical &#8220;pure-play,&#8221; focused on designing new
drugs, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer may be destined for a significant shake-up in the
form of shrinking its behemoth $67 billion a year revenue
base,&#8221; Anderson said. Read &#8220;appears to want to narrow both the
focus and size of the future Pfizer, presumably with the goal of
achieving sustainable growth off a new base.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 34 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $19.81 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
climbed 13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer faces generic competition this year to more than
$10.7 billion in annual sales of its Lipitor cholesterol drug,
and the drugmaker doesn&#8217;t have enough new medicines to offset
the losses. Read has said he&#8217;s seeking buyers for Capsugel, a
unit that makes pill casings, and may consider additional sales.
No decisions have been made, said Joan Campion, a Pfizer
spokeswoman, in a telephone in interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campion declined to comment on whether anything new was
disclosed to Anderson or whether Pfizer was considering
shrinking the size of the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is unveiling new software and services that help customers
market and sell their products, aiming to mine a $70 billion
market opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new division, Smarter Commerce, features services such
as using analysis to tailor marketing and brand assessment on
Facebook Inc. or Twitter Inc. in real time, Craig Hayman, a
general manager in the IBM software unit, said in a telephone
interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies seeking the best ways to market and sell to
customers are using more social media and mobile devices, Hayman
said. Hardware, software and services that help companies do
that will be a $70 billion market opportunity this year, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It gives you a view on your products and services and how
your spend in social media -- whether that&#8217;s Facebook or Twitter
or any other social media engine -- is resonating,&#8221; Hayman
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division will be part of the Armonk, New York-based
company&#8217;s Smarter Planet initiative, which uses technology to
monitor anything from cities to hospitals to make them more
efficient. IBM expects the program to be a $10 billion business
in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The services help companies analyze who views their social
media efforts, by using Web browsing history and other
information to give a picture of customers and how they behave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Say I have a Facebook page. What are the dynamics of the
customers coming into Facebook? How many of them are buying? How
old are they?&#8221; Hayman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM worked with one college that was trying to boost its
global presence with social media. After analyzing the campaign
with IBM, they learned people from only two zip codes were
viewing the pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Mothers&#8217; Day, IBM helped a North American retailer
track who was buying its products and how. A trend popped up: Of
customers buying from a mobile device, most -- and the biggest
spenders -- were using Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It shows you iPad users think of their mothers quite a
bit,&#8221; Hayman said. &#8220;We also could tell who was thinking of
them late, tracking it hour by hour.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also working with 1-800-Flowers.com Inc. (FLWS),
helping the flower-and-gift retailer track their customers&#8217; use
of the site. The service can show whether they&#8217;re looking for
birthday flowers, how often they visit the site and how much
they spend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll be able to categorize all of our customers into
buckets,&#8221; Chief Information Officer Steve Bozzo said in a phone
interview last week. &#8220;We may actually have different promotions
for the good customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell $1.04 to $161.39 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 10 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, plans to boost oil and natural-gas output
20 percent by 2017, more than double the rate of growth from
2003 to 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production forecast is based on $79-a-barrel oil, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a slide presentation
to be delivered to analysts today in New York. Chevron expects
to pump the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude daily in
2017, up from 2.76 million last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s production growth will be driven by projects
such as the $37 billion Gorgon development in Australia, which
is scheduled to begin liquefying gas for export in 2014, Chevron
said in the slide presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron expects to surpass Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) in liquefied
natural gas production by 2020 to become the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest supplier of the fuel, according to the slides. Only
Qatar, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Algeria&#8217;s Sonatrach Group will
have greater LNG output by then, Chevron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 87 cents to $100.80 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange at 4:00 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are marketing $1.4 billion of bonds tied to
commercial property loans as Wall Street ramps up lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is tied to 57 mortgages on 111 properties across
the U.S. with the highest concentration in Texas, according to a
person familiar with the offering who declined to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction will bring 2011 sales of commercial-
mortgage backed securities to about $8 billion, compared with
$11.5 billion in all of 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Turmoil in the Middle East has caused investors in
the debt to pull back and increased the relative yield sellers
have had to pay in the past month, according to a March 11
report from Barclays Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Broader markets have played a key role in this widening,
with the spike in crude oil being the prime mover,&#8221; said the
New York-based analysts led by Julia Tcherkassova. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil climbed to a 29-month high of $105.44 a barrel in
New York on March 7 amid fighting in Libya. Protests planned in Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer in the Middle East, also
raised supply concerns. Stocks have fallen as rising fuel costs
threaten the economic recovery, Barclays said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-rated securities backed by skyscraper, hotel and
shopping mall loans are yielding 2.02 percentage points more
than Treasuries, compared with 1.91 percentage points a month
ago, according to a Barclays index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability to Oil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some property types are more vulnerable to elevated oil
prices if unrest in the Middle East persists, according to
Barclays. The performance of shopping centers and malls is
closely linked to consumer spending, which could fall if rising
fuel prices eat into household budgets, according to Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail properties account for 53 percent of newly issued
commercial-mortgage bonds sold since the market revived in April
of last year, Barclays data show. About 60 percent of the
Goldman Sachs-Citigroup sale is backed by retail buildings. The
largest loan in the pool is a $125.7 million mortgage on the
Arlington Highlands mall in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial-mortgage bonds may rise to $45 billion
this year, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. They plummeted to
$3.4 billion in 2009 as credit markets seized. The market peaked
with $234 billion in CMBS sales in 2007, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil  Natural Gas Corp., India&#8217;s
biggest energy explorer, lost a bid to buy Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s
25 percent stake in an Angolan oil field, said two people with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC, based in New Delhi, had offered about $2 billion for
the stake in Block 31 off Angola&#8217;s coast, said one of the
people, who declined to be identified because the sale process
is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-owned ONGC is leading a drive by India to secure
energy supplies overseas as demand for fuels rises in Asia&#8217;s
second-fastest-growing major economy after China. The Indian
government has told ONGC and Oil India Ltd. to speed up
purchases as competition with Chinese companies for resources
heats up, Oil Secretary S. Sundareshan said a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting stakes in fields overseas is important for ONGC
as they spend money in India, but production isn&#8217;t increasing
much,&#8221; said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP
Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi. &#8220;They have been keen
to acquire stakes in assets outside India and have to compete
with companies from across the world, especially China.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joeman Thomas, managing director of overseas investment
unit ONGC Videsh Ltd., didn&#8217;t answer three calls to his mobile
phone today. Rachael L. Moore, an Exxon spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on market rumors or
speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC shares fell 0.4 percent to 280.7 rupees in Mumbai
trading after rising as much as 2.9 percent. The benchmark
Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange gained 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian company was informed a few weeks ago that
another bidder had made a higher offer, one of the people said,
adding that ONGC hasn&#8217;t yet decided whether to raise its bid.
Angolan Oil Minister Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos said in
January that talks were continuing about ONGC buying Exxon&#8217;s
stake in the oil field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC submitted a binding bid in December for Exxon&#8217;s stake
in Block 31, which is scheduled to start production this year
and may reach peak output of as much as 150,000 barrels a day,
India&#8217;s former Junior Oil Minister Jitin Prasada told lawmakers
in New Delhi on Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; BP Plc (BP/) owns 26.7 percent of Block 31 and is its operator,
Prasada said. Its partners include Statoil ASA (STL), Total SA (FP), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and Angola&#8217;s state-run oil company, Sonangol
SA, according to the official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angola, which vies with Nigeria as Africa&#8217;s top oil
producer, pumped 590 million barrels from January to November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov should get as much as 121
months in prison for stealing the firm&#8217;s computer source code,
U.S. prosecutors said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, convicted in December of violating the Economic
Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen
Property Act, has asked to be given probation when he is
sentenced by U.S. District Court judge Denise Cote on March 18.
Prosecutors cited Aleynikov&#8217;s alleged history of violating
intellectual property laws, asking Cote to sentence him to 97 to
121 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aleynikov was simply a thief motivated by greed, someone
who sought to benefit from the valuable intellectual property of
his employer to make money for himself and his new company,&#8221;
prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum filed in Manhattan
federal court March 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 24, Cote ordered Aleynikov, who had been free on
bond, jailed before sentencing because she deemed him a flight

&lt;p&gt;     March 14 (Bloomberg) - International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has hit its longest stretch without an acquisition in
almost eight years, even as the company holds about $11 billion
in cash on its balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has made more than 100 deals in the past
decade, last announced a purchase on Oct. 21, more than four
months ago. That&#8217;s the longest period since May 2003, when an
acquisition ended a five-month drought, according to Bloomberg
data. If it lasts another 15 days, the dry spell would be the
longest since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano has made more than $25 billion purchases in his
nine years at the helm, steering the company toward software and
services. IBM could have a flurry of deals next quarter after a
surplus of purchases at the end of the year delayed deal-making,
said Jeff Bistrong, managing director at investment bank Harris
Williams  Co. in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM is sitting on a lot of capital,&#8221; said Bistrong, who
has sold companies to IBM. &#8220;They&#8217;re very interested in
acquisitions. They have to put the capital to work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Barbini, a spokesman for the company, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 41 cents to $162.43 on
March 11 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares had climbed 11 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services
provider, announced nine deals in the second half of last year,
including the $1.7 billion purchase of storage-maker Netezza
Corp., the company&#8217;s largest deal since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last six months of 2010 were active for the technology
industry, with Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) snapping up 3Par Inc. and Dell Inc. (DELL) buying Compellent Technologies Inc. That&#8217;s made for a
quiet first quarter for acquisitions, Bistrong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$20 Billion in Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has one of the most systematic approaches to deal-
making in the industry, said Chris Whitmore, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG. The company has an internal MA team, led by
former Morgan Stanley investment banker Eli Mendoza, and a
standing committee for vetting deals that includes executives
such as the head of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has even broken down -- to the penny -- how much
acquisitions should contribute to earnings per share by 2015: 90
cents out of the overall goal of at least $20 per share in
operating earnings by that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been a key contributor to the success of the
business,&#8221; said the San Francisco-based Whitmore, who has a
&#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock and a price target of $200, the
highest of any analyst tracked by Bloomberg. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
who does a better job of buying and integrating software
companies than IBM.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which ended last year with $10.7 billion in cash and
about $1 billion in short-term investments, has said it plans to
spend about $20 billion on acquisitions through 2015. The
company is ahead of the target pace for adding 90 cents in
profit, after $6 billion in acquisitions last year, Chief
Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said at the company&#8217;s investor
briefing last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We indeed are ahead of the game, and I think we have
upside here,&#8221; Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, IBM has used acquisitions as part of
its strategy to transition away from hardware and toward more
profitable software and services. Its two largest purchases were
for Cognos Inc., a maker of business-management software, in
2008 and PwC Consulting, a provider of business and technology
consulting services, in 2002. Services now make up more than
half of total revenue, and software will be about half of total
profit by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MA Timing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano is now investing in analytics software, which
helps companies predict trends, and cloud-computing, which lets
clients store and access data on servers other than their own.
The two businesses should grow to be $16 billion and $7 billion
in sales, respectively. He&#8217;s also spending on Smarter Planet,
the company&#8217;s concept that any infrastructure -- from highways
to utility grids -- can be digitally monitored and made more
efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is extremely focused on those target areas and deals
virtually always happen within them, said Whitmore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be many reasons for IBM&#8217;s acquisition slowdown,
from the number of deals last quarter to an inability to find
anything to buy at the right price, said David Grossman, an
analyst with Stifel Nicolaus  Co.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MA is a timing thing,&#8221; said San Francisco-based
analyst. &#8220;They just think opportunistically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM only buys companies for intellectual property that the
company can scale to its more than 170 countries and quickly
make a return on investment, Loughridge said at the meeting.
That approach has helped IBM spend about $28 billion on deals,
compared with more than $43 billion each for HP and Oracle Corp. (ORCL)
in the last nine years. The company&#8217;s largest deal was Cognos
for $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m really focused on getting him his money back,&#8221;
Loughridge said of Palmisano at the meeting. &#8220;Because when I
don&#8217;t give him his money back, I&#8217;m going to have a very bad
day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it&#8217;s trying to sell
Litton Loan Servicing LP, the Houston-based mortgage-servicing
unit it acquired more than three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs is exploring strategic options for Litton
Loan Servicing, which include a possible sale,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman in New York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company bought Litton in December 2007 as investors
including billionaire Wilbur Ross and Centerbridge Capital
Partners LLC purchased mortgage servicers to help them better
understand the market and profit from buying discounted loans.
Goldman Sachs is selling after failing to find enough
opportunities to buy distressed mortgage loans, said a person
familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit is cooperating with investigations by the attorneys general from 50 states of the mortgage industry&#8217;s
foreclosure practices, which began after they discovered some
firms used faulty or falsified paperwork to seize homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiries &#8220;may result in the imposition of fines or
other regulatory action,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said March 1 in its
annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Goldman Sachs bought Litton, the value of the
company&#8217;s mortgage-servicing rights has also evaporated. By the
end of 2009, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s estimate for the fair value of the
rights had dropped to $88 million from $283 million at the end
of February 2008, according to regulatory filings. In the latest
filing, the firm disclosed that as of Dec. 31, 2010, their value
&#8220;was not material.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radian, C-Bass &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs never disclosed how much it paid to acquire
Litton, which added about 1,000 employees to the company&#8217;s
staff. Goldman bought Litton from Credit-Based Asset Servicing
and Securitization LLC, known as C-Bass. Radian Group Inc. (RDN), a
part owner of C-Bass, disclosed a month before the sale was
completed that the unit would be sold for about $467.9 million
to an unnamed buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before buying Litton, Goldman Sachs had tried to avoid
businesses that involved the mass-market or &#8220;retail&#8221; customer.
David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told
analysts in September 2006, more than a year before the company
bought Litton, that Goldman Sachs was reluctant to buy a lender
because of the &#8220;retail concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs is largely an institutional business,&#8221;
Viniar said at the time. &#8220;There are different risks when you&#8217;re
touching the retail customer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported Goldman Sachs&#8217;s plan to sell
Litton earlier today. The Financial Times reported in December
that Goldman Sachs was considering a sale of Litton and that
talks with one potential buyer had fallen apart over price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actelion Ltd. (ATLN), the biotechnology
company being pressured to remove board members, hired Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz to help
defeat the effort, said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wachtell, a New York law firm, is providing advice to
Actelion on the effort by hedge fund Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd.
because of its experience in dealing with proxy votes, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the matter is
confidential. Roland Haefeli, a spokesman at Actelion, declined
to comment. Spokespeople for New York-based Goldman and Wachtell
didn&#8217;t immediately return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott, part of a $17 billion hedge fund founded by Paul Singer, is pushing for Actelion&#8217;s directors to consider a sale
of the company. The fund last month sent two letters to the
board, asking the company to study a sale and disclose any
takeover approaches. Elliott also called for the resignation of
Actelion Chairman Robert Cawthorn and for Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Paul Clozel to step down from the board. The fund
said it would propose those changes at the annual shareholder
meeting May 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clozel has rejected that call and said the Allschwil,
Switzerland-based company he helped found in 1997 should remain
independent. People familiar with the situation said in November
that Amgen Inc. (AMGN), the world&#8217;s biggest biotech company, was
considering a takeover bid for Actelion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott said March 7 it started a website to help Actelion
stockholders register their shares and vote at the annual
meeting. The hedge fund also hired proxy adviser Georgeson to
help investors who want to vote at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudolf Maag, the investor who owns 4.2 percent of
Actelion&#8217;s shares, said in a March 7 statement he &#8220;fully
supports&#8221; the Swiss company&#8217;s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockholders who own more than 2 million shares have until
March 17 to add items to the agenda of the annual meeting,
according to Actelion&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
reached its low for 2011 when the 9-magnitude earthquake in
Japan earlier sent the benchmark to 1,261.12, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Thomas Lee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge for U.S. equities has declined as much as 3.3
percent this week after Japan&#8217;s biggest earthquake on record
struck March 11. The SP 500 ended the day down 1.1 percent to
1,281.87, paring its 2011 advance to 1.9 percent and extending
the retreat since Feb. 18 to 4.6 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index will rise to 1,425 by the end of the
year, with oil prices retreating from their highs and global
growth benefiting from Japan&#8217;s rebuilding, according to Lee&#8217;s
year-end estimate. His forecast compares with the average of
1,400 from 13 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The unfortunate events in Japan have brought us to our
estimated low for the year,&#8221; Lee wrote today. &#8220;In a nutshell,
we see the sell-off as creating potentially a very bullish
opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei 225 Stock Average plunged 11 percent earlier
today, bringing its loss since yesterday&#8217;s open to 16 percent.
The Nikkei and Topix index fell as much as 14 percent earlier,
the biggest intraday retreats since October 1987, on concern a
nuclear accident would cripple the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil&#8217;s Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil surged as much as 28 percent this year to a high of
$106.95 a barrel as political unrest in Egypt and Libya
threatened to curtail supplies. Since then, the price has
dropped 9.1 percent, settling at $97.18 a barrel today on the New York Mercantile Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retreat is a positive for stock investors, as oil was
&#8220;the biggest risk to consumer spending,&#8221; the world economy and
earnings, Lee wrote. SP 500 companies are forecast to grow
profits 16 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global growth may also benefit when Japan, the world&#8217;s
third-largest economy, begins to rebuild and other countries
increase their production and output where Japan&#8217;s drops, he
added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian heavy oil exports face a
&#8220;classic bottleneck,&#8221; and the nation needs a pipeline to its
western coast to open sales to Asia, said Lawrence Eagles,
global head of oil research at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Canada needs more than one buyer,&#8221; Eagles said at the
World Heavy Oil Congress in Edmonton, Alberta. &#8220;You need to
transit oil to the Pacific coast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers of oil taken from sands in northeastern Alberta
have limited pipeline capacity to refineries in the U.S. That
leads to a discount to other crudes that could be narrowed with
a line serving Asian markets. Demand for crude has producers to
transportation alternatives including trains and barges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are finding ways every day to get more oil out of
the region and down to the Gulf Coast,&#8221; Eagles said. &#8220;If price
is there, oil will find a way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of last week&#8217;s earthquake and tsunami in Japan
on oil demand will depend on how the disasters affect economic
growth, the New York-based Eagles said. If growth remains
constant, there could be an increase in requirements for power-
generating fuels in that nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are power-generation needs that will need to be
filled,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Japan has a lot of spare capacity in the
power sector that can use liquefied natural gas or oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Rajat Gupta, while a member of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s board in 2008, told Raj Rajaratnam of
talks on whether to buy American International Group Inc. (AIG) or
Wachovia Corp., according to a wiretap recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors at the insider-trading trial of Rajaratnam, the
co-founder of the Galleon Group LLC hedge fund, played the
recording of a July 2008 discussion between the men, one of
about 170 wiretaps the government said it will present to jurors
in Manhattan federal court. During the conversation, Rajaratnam
asked about a &#8220;rumor that Goldman may look to buy a commercial
bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yeah, this is being discussed at the board meeting,&#8221;
Gupta replied, adding that it was &#8220;a divided&#8221; discussion.
Among the institutions the Goldman Sachs board discussed were Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia, now part of Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), and New York-based insurer AIG, according to the
transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors previously said that Gupta, who isn&#8217;t charged
with criminal wrongdoing, tipped Rajaratnam about Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s transactions, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s 2008
investment in the bank. Today&#8217;s recording was the first tape
played in which Gupta was a participant in the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is the central figure in the largest crackdown
on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The Sri Lankan-
born money manager is accused of making $45 million from
confidential information leaked by corporate insiders and hedge
fund traders. The Galleon Group case has led to a nationwide
investigation implicating banks, consultants, technology
companies and other hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planned to Invest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former McKinsey  Co partner Anil Kumar, a government
witness, today described for the jury Rajaratnam&#8217;s relationship
with Gupta. Before prosecutors played the tape, Kumar said Gupta
invested or planned to invest in several Galleon Group funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the taped conversation, Gupta takes Rajaratnam through a
portion of a recent Goldman Sachs board meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The view was very bearish on the commercial bank,&#8221; Gupta
told Rajaratnam, according to the recording. &#8220;I would be
extremely surprised if there was anything imminent.&#8221; Goldman
never purchased either one of the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the recording, Gupta said some Goldman Sachs board
members believed commercial banking was a &#8220;low-return
business,&#8221; while others said such a bank was a &#8220;low-cost
source&#8221; of funding. No evidence was presented that Rajaratnam
traded on Gupta&#8217;s disclosure about the board&#8217;s discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG, Wachovia &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ed Canaday, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, and Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman
for Wells Fargo, declined to comment. Anne Granfield, a
spokeswoman for Gupta, didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam&#8217;s defense attorney, John Dowd, began cross-
examining Kumar shortly after the tape was played. The lawyer&#8217;s
initial focus was on Kumar&#8217;s alleged refusal to tell the Internal Revenue Service whether he holds offshore accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar has pleaded guilty in the Galleon case and is
testifying for prosecutors in exchange for leniency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recording, which includes Rajaratnam complaining about
Kumar, was played for jurors as Kumar sat on the witness stand.
The former McKinsey partner had just testified that he decided
in 2006 not to join Gupta and Rajaratnam in a private-equity
fund called New Silk Route. Yesterday, Kumar testified that
Rajaratnam paid him $2.6 million for inside information on
McKinsey clients including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), the
second-largest maker of processors for personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Mini-Rajat&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar wants to &#8220;be a mini-Rajat&#8221; without &#8220;bringing
anything to the party,&#8221; Rajaratnam told Gupta on the recording.
Rajaratnam said on the tape that he had been paying Kumar $1
million annually for years -- &#8220;after-taxes, offshore, cash&#8221; --
in return for &#8220;little or nothing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Keep your eyes and ears open,&#8221; Rajaratnam told Gupta.
&#8220;If you hear anything, just anything you think may be
interesting -- which I will track down and see what&#8217;s in the
market -- I&#8217;ll bring that angle to you.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also had Kumar testify about the links between
Rajaratnam and Gupta. In addition to co-founding and investing
in New Silk Route, Rajaratnam wanted Gupta to be chairman of an
investment fund called Galleon International, Kumar alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What he does is, he gives bit of cachet in South Asia,&#8221;
Rajaratnam told Kumar on May 28, 2008, according to another
recording played by prosecutors. On the tape, Kumar said the 10
percent ownership stake Rajaratnam offered in Galleon
International was &#8220;reasonable,&#8221; even if Gupta wanted 15
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complained About Gupta &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta also owned a 20 percent stake in Galleon&#8217;s Crossover
Fund, which invested in small businesses, and he had lost
millions of dollars in Galleon&#8217;s Voyager Fund, Kumar testified.
Kumar said that, in October 2009, Rajaratnam complained to him
about Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam &#8220;told me Mr. Gupta had confronted him and said
he, Mr. Rajaratnam, should have paid more attention to what was
happening with Voyager,&#8221; Kumar testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar said that days before his and Rajaratnam&#8217;s October
19, 2009, arrest, the two men and their wives traveled to
Trinidad for a wedding and returned to New York through Miami.
While in Florida, Rajaratnam took a call on his mobile phone and
returned to tell Kumar that he&#8217;d been told that an ex-employee,
Ali Far, is &#8220;now wearing a wire,&#8221; Kumar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Really Disappointed&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m really disappointed in him,&#8221; Rajaratnam said,
according to Kumar. &#8220;He said, &#8216;You should be careful, you
should be using pre-paid phones when you&#8217;re calling me.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Kumar testified that he tried to
protect a McKinsey employee he described as his &#8220;protege,&#8221;
David Palecek, from being lured into Rajaratnam&#8217;s insider-
trading scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I did not want the Galleon Group to suck him into the
mistakes I was making,&#8221; Kumar testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, prosecutors played a tape in which Rajaratnam&#8217;s
brother, Rengan, said that Palecek might be willing to &#8220;play
ball&#8221; with Galleon. Palecek died last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine Redlich, a lawyer for Palecek&#8217;s wife, said
yesterday that Palecek &#8220;never agreed&#8221; to assist Galleon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, while on the Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) board in 2008, told Galleon Group LLC co-
founder Raj Rajaratnam of the board&#8217;s talks on whether to buy
AIG Inc. or Wachovia Corp., according to a wiretapped recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors at Rajaratnam&#8217;s insider trading trial this
morning played a recording of a July 2008 discussion between the
two men, one of about 170 wiretaps the government said it plans
to present in Manhattan federal court. During the conversation,
Rajaratnam asked about a &#8220;rumor that Goldman may look to buy a
commercial bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yeah, this is being discussed at the board meeting,&#8221;
Gupta replied, adding that it was &#8220;a divided&#8221; discussion.
Among the institutions that the Goldman Sachs board discussed
were Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia, now part of Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), and New York-based insurer American International
Group Inc. (AIG), according to the transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimony in Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial continued today with former
McKinsey  Co partner Anil Kumar, a government witness, who
described Rajaratnam&#8217;s relationship with Gupta. Before
prosecutors played the tape, Kumar testified that Gupta had
invested or planned to invest in several Galleon Group funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors previously said that Gupta, who is not charged
with criminal wrongdoing, tipped Rajaratnam about Goldman Sachs
transactions, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s 2008
investment in the bank. Today&#8217;s recording was the first tape
played in which Gupta was a participant in the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the recording, Gupta said some Goldman Sachs board
members believed commercial banking was a &#8220;low-return
business,&#8221; while others said such a bank was a &#8220;low-cost
source&#8221; of funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ed Canaday, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, 
Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, and Christopher Mumma, a spokesman 
for Gupta, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) had more
Japanese holdings than any U.S. lender and Citigroup Inc. (C)
counted Japan&#8217;s government among its biggest debtors before last
week&#8217;s earthquake struck, according to KBW Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, has
&#8220;total cross-border outstandings&#8221; of $53.9 billion and $64
billion in commitments, according to David Konrad, an analyst
for New York-based KBW, an investment bank that specializes in
financial companies. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had $33.6 billion,
Morgan Stanley held $19.1 billion and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) had
$17 billion, Konrad wrote in a note dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. has $39.2 billion in Japanese loans,
securities and trading assets and the government is the New
York-based bank&#8217;s third-largest credit position, according to
Konrad. Japanese policy makers are struggling to contain
investor fears amid nuclear radiation leaks at power plants
triggered by last week&#8217;s earthquake and tsunami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t expect a material credit event,&#8221; Konrad wrote
in the report. &#8220;However, we believe that volatility in the
markets may cause volatility in the trading results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, is the only U.S.
lender with a &#8220;meaningful retail banking presence in Japan,&#8221;
Konrad said. The company&#8217;s Asian regional consumer banking unit
made a $2.17 billion profit in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pumping Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan (8301) has pledged to pump more cash into the
financial system after injecting $183 billion yesterday. The
Topix index of stocks suffered its worst two-day drop since the
1987 crash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index, which tracks 23 of the biggest U.S.
lenders, dropped 1.55 percent as of 10:50 a.m. in New York, with
New York-based JPMorgan down 2.3 percent, Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America slipping 2 percent and Citigroup
off 1.8 percent. Morgan Stanley fell 2 percent and Goldman Sachs
declined 1.2 percent. Both are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBW&#8217;s data on cross-border positions includes loans and
derivatives and doesn&#8217;t account for hedges, the analyst wrote.
The category includes holdings such as loans to banks,
investment in local franchises and public-sector loans,
according to Citigroup&#8217;s annual report to securities regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s holdings equal 0.75 percent of total
assets, according to Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman at Bank of
America, the biggest U.S. lender. &#8220;So I would describe our
exposure as small relative to our total assets,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, and Stephen Cohen at New York-based Goldman Sachs
didn&#8217;t immediately comment. Shannon Bell, a Citigroup
spokeswoman, and Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s Mark Lake declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)&#8217;s
generic version of Fentora doesn&#8217;t infringe two patents licensed
exclusively to Cephalon Inc. (CEPH), a federal judge in Delaware ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon sued Watson for patent infringement in June 2008
after the Corono, California-based company filed applications to
produce the generic form of the drug. Fentora is administered
orally to treat breakthrough cancer pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson said Cephalon failed to
prove the two patents -- 6,200,604 and 6,074,590 -- were
infringed and that Watson successful proved they were invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cephalon Inc. v. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
1:08-cv-00330-SLR, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaser&#8217;s AIDS-Cure Patent Offered at ICAP Ocean Tomo Auction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the patents offered at the ICAP Ocean Tomo auction
March 31 is for a therapy that uses genetically modified red
blood cells to treat viral diseases such as AIDS, according to a
statement from the auction house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 7,462,485 was issued in December 2008. The named
inventor is Lawrence F. Glaser of Fairfax Station, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the patent, the modified cells, when
administered to a patent infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, can &#8220;absorb and entrap
plasma HIV,&#8221; keeping it from infecting a protein on the surface
of white blood cells involved in cell-mediated immunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaser is the named inventor on a wide range of patents,
according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. He&#8217;s the holder of patent 6,375,995, which covers a
multidensity cereal product in which one portion of the cereal
product floats on the surface of milk while another sinks to the
bottom of the cereal bowl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also invented technology for a computer peripheral
device that causes a particular theme to be displayed by the
computer&#8217;s graphical user interface. That technology is covered
by his patents 7,007,238 and 6,392,671. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Glaser patents cover closures for vacuum-sealed
containers, a method of connecting an electrical conductor to a
terminal, and a system of telecommunications installation and
management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaser is also known for a securities fraud case he filed
against New York-based Enzo Biochem Inc. of New York. Glaser at
one time owned more than a million shared of Enzo stock, and
accused the company of exaggerating the success of its therapies
against AIDS and Hepatitis B. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaser filed a document with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in September 2008 in which he said statutes of
limitations for securities fraud &#8220;should not exist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2005 a federal appeals court ruled that a trial
court had properly dismissed Glaser&#8217;s securities fraud claims.
The following year the appeals court said his common law fraud
claims against Enzo were also property dismissed, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case was Glaser v. Enzo Biochem Inc. (ENZ), 1:02-
cv-01232-GBL, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Alexandria). The appeals were Glazer v. Enzo Biochem Inc., 03-
2188 and 05-1920, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Richmond). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department of Defense Funds Wound-Healing Technology Development &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Defense Department has awarded a $1.3 million
grant to develop a patented technology for an artificial wound-
healing material for battlefield injuries invented by a Colorado
State University professor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Melissa M. Reynolds, of the university&#8217;s School
of Biomedical Engineering, has developed a biodegradable polymer
containing nitric acid that can be used inside or outside the
body, the school said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polymer will look like gauze and contain additional
biological materials to promote healing. Nitric acid, which
naturally occurs within the body, can prevent infection and
promote the growth of healthy cells, the university said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reynolds said her invention could be used on deep cuts
inside the skin and muscles, and the polymer eventually
dissolves within the body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology covered by Reynolds patent has been licensed
to Diazamed, a company spun off by the university&#8217;s
commercialization arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reynolds is a named inventor on patent 7,335,383, and on
eight published and pending patent applications related to
medical devices and wound healing, according to the database of
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiat&#8217;s Maserati Wins Star Billing in &#8216;Limitless&#8217; Sans Fee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fiat SpA (F)&#8217;s Maserati unit reaped publicity for the luxury
auto&#8217;s trademark in Relativity Media LLC&#8217;s &#8220;Limitless&#8221; film
without paying anything for product placement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italian automaker, which sold fewer than 2,000
Maseratis in the U.S. last year, got the gig by quickly
supplying two cars to the shooting location in Puerto Vallarta
in June, the movie-industry trade newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total cash outlay to Maserati was less than $10,000,
and that amount was spent on shipping costs and for a company
technician sent to the shooting site, according to the Hollywood
Reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turin, Italy-based automaker got one minute of footage
of the car being driven through Puerto Vallarta, and the
Maserati was also featured in two commercials for the film that
ran during the Super Bowl game in February, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sailing Festival Seeks New Name to Avoid Trademark Clash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers of an annual New Hampshire festival
featuring tall sailing ships is looking for a new name for the
festival in efforts to avoid a trademark dispute, the Portsmouth
Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Piscataqua Maritime Commission, which has hosted its
Tall Ships Festival for 25 years, has been in negotiations for
two years with the American Sail Training Association, owner of
the &#8220;tall sails&#8221; trademark, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Coker, chairman of the commission, told the
newspaper his organization is seeking public input about a new
name for the festival, which will be held on the Memorial Day
weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any new name for the festival should be &#8220;short, snappy and
to the point&#8221; and must avoid use of the &#8220;tall ships&#8221; phrase,
Coker said, and the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cepia Sued by Californian Over Zhu Zhu Pet Trade Secrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cepia LLC, the closely held maker of the Zhu Zhu Pet
robotic hamster, was sued for trade secret misappropriation by a California resident who claims he&#8217;s the actual inventor of the
toy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason G. Heller of San Mateo, California, alleges that
Cepia learned of his invention through one of its Chinese
suppliers. Heller, in his complaint filed March 10 in federal
court in San Francisco, said he disclosed confidential
information about the robotic pet to toy-modeling houses in Hong
Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosures were covered by a mutual non-disclosure
agreement, Heller said, and claimed he didn&#8217;t give &#8220;any entity
or individual&#8221; permission to give information about his
invention to any third party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims that at least one of the companies to which he&#8217;d
disclosed his invention had &#8220;improperly&#8221; passed the
information along to St. Louis-based Cepia. He said he can prove
that representatives of Cepia were on the premises of the Hong
Kong company at the time it was in possession of his prototype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at the Dallas Toy Fair in 2009 that Heller said he
became aware of Cepia&#8217;s Zhu Zhu Pets, which &#8220;appeared to
embody&#8221; his own idea for the robotic toy hamster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the Zhu Zhu toy was released, Heller said Hasbro
Inc. had expressed interest in his invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims he&#8217;s damaged by Cepia&#8217;s actions, and that he&#8217;s
suffered losses of at least $201 million from the St. Louis-
based company&#8217;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, he asked for a royalty of 7 percent of
Cepia&#8217;s total sales of Zhu Zhu Pets from April 2008 until the
date judgment is entered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-defendants with Cepia are three Hong Kong-based toy
developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cepia didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mail requesting
comment. The company&#8217;s Zhu Zhu Pet, which sold for about $10,
was the must-have pet for the Christmas 2009 season, according
to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heller is represented by Robert C. Matz of the Law Office
of Robert C. Matz LLP of Alameda, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Jason G. Heller v. Cepia LLC, 3:11-cv-01146-
DMR, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Ex-Programmer Should Get Up to 10 Years, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
programmer, should be sent to prison for as long as 121 months
for stealing computer code from his former employer, U.S.
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards Angell Hires Peter Konzel for Washington IP Group &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards Angell Palmer  Dodge LLP hired S. Peter Konzel for
its Washington IP practice, the Boston-based firm said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konzel, who does both transactional work and litigation,
joins from Washington&#8217;s Novak Druce  Quigg LLP. He has also
served in a combat unit in the U.S. Army. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has represented clients in the biotechnology, chemical,
electrical, mechanical and semiconductor fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konzel has an undergraduate degree in biology from the State University of New York at Geneseo, and a law degree from

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) are among global banks allowing employees to
work from home or leave the office early as Japan&#8217;s strongest
earthquake disrupts public transport in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan employees in Japan are being allowed to work from
home, or take vacation if their managers approve, said
spokeswoman Sachiko Hasegawa in an interview. Credit Suisse is
allowing employees to leave work early, according to Isamu Kajino, a spokesman for the Swiss bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), said they have no plans to move operations out of
Japan, even after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned the risk of
radiation leaks at an earthquake-damage nuclear plant north of Tokyo is rising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our business is as usual,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Hasegawa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German Embassy in Tokyo has said it recommended its
citizens in Japan consider leaving the country following last
week&#8217;s earthquake and explosions at Tokyo Electric Power Co.&#8217;s
nuclear power plant in Fukushima. About 100 Germans live in the
Tohoku area, where a magnitude 9 quake struck March 11, while
2,600 people are in Tokyo and 900 in the Kanagawa area,
according to Mari Shindo, a spokeswoman at the embassy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power plant, where four of six reactors have been
damaged by explosions, is 135 miles (220 kilometers) north of
Tokyo. The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami rose to
2,478 at 2 p.m., according to the National Police Agency in
Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business as Usual &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America were among 
other financial companies that said their operations in Japan
aren&#8217;t being affected by the disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is to remain open as long as the markets remain
open, and to operate as normally as possible under challenging
circumstances,&#8221; said Mika Watanabe, a spokeswoman for New York-
based Morgan Stanley, in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, the Asian securities affiliate
of France&#8217;s Credit Agricole SA, has non-essential Japan-based
staff working from home, said spokeswoman Simone Wheeler. The
firm&#8217;s business, including broking and trading, is operating as
normal, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)&#8217;s 174 retail brokerage branches are
doing business as usual, and employees are allowed to take
holidays if needed, according to spokeswoman Keiko Sugai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t see any employees moving out of Japan except
people who were scheduled to take a holiday,&#8221; said Natsumi Akita, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. The U.K. lender has no plans to move operations out
of Japan, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Kirkland, who heads oil and
gas exploration and production at Chevron Corp. (CVX), said U.S.
natural-gas prices need to rise substantially for the industry
to be viable in the long term, the Financial Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in production of gas from shale rock and other
sources has pushed prices down to about $4 per million British
thermal units, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirkland, speaking as Chevron set out a plan for a 20
percent increase in oil and gas production by 2017, said prices
&#8220;in the sixes and sevens&#8221; are needed in the long term to cover

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) released a speedier
version of its Internet Explorer browser that adds privacy
controls and video features, a bid to regain market share lost
to Firefox and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Chrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 9 relies on HTML5, the latest version of
the language that presents Web content, which lets sites handle
more multimedia content. The browser&#8217;s designed to run
applications within the browser more quickly, while adding more
powerful privacy options than Google offers. It&#8217;s available for
download today, the Redmond, Washington-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to accommodate rising demand for
software that runs online rather than on the Windows operating
system. The sluggish performance of Microsoft&#8217;s last browser
made it harder to use Internet apps and pushed customers toward
rival products, said David Smith, an analyst at Stamford,
Connecticut-based Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The vast, overwhelming majority of new apps that are
developed today are developed to run in browsers -- they are not
native Windows applications,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Any vendor has to
have a very competitive offering there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Internet Explorer remains the leading browser, its
dominance has ebbed over the past two years. It had 57 percent
share in February, down from 62 percent a year earlier,
according to Net Applications, which tracks Internet usage
statistics. Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox had 22 percent, and Google&#8217;s
Chrome had 11 percent. Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s Safari ranked fourth, with
6.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 1 cent to $25.69 yesterday on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The shares have fallen 8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe&#8217;s Flash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By supporting the HTML5 technology for playing video, the
browser deals a fresh blow to Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE)&#8217;s Flash -- the
most popular software for watching clips on the Internet. Apple
has limited the use of Flash on its iPhone and iPad, endorsing
HTML5 instead, after Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs said
Flash was too slow to run on mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new privacy features, meanwhile, put pressure on Google
to respond, Smith said. Microsoft has added the ability for
users to create &#8220;Do Not Call&#8221;-style lists that bar listed
websites from tracking what users do on the Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has called for do-not-
track options in browsers, Smith said. Firefox also has
developed such a feature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) is teaming
up with Microsoft Corp. to handle the growing amount of data its
customers are using on mobile devices and plans to release its
BlackBerry PlayBook tablet computer &#8220;very soon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM is looking for ways to enhance the PlayBook&#8217;s appeal as
it prepares to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the tablet market. Apple,
which sold 7.33 million iPads last quarter, has said more than
65 percent of the Fortune 100 companies are testing or deploying
the iPad, including Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), Lowe&#8217;s Cos. and Hyatt
Hotels Corp. (H) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM has shown the PlayBook to a &#8220;significant&#8221; portion of
Fortune 100 companies and interest in the device is &#8220;very
high,&#8221; Jim Tobin, senior vice president, software and business
services, said in an interview today in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership with Microsoft is designed to make it
easier for customers to use what&#8217;s known as cloud computing, or
servers offsite that store information and can be accessed over
the Internet. Tobin said he sees about a quarter of RIM&#8217;s large
corporate customers shifting data into the cloud by the end of
this year, with half having made the shift by 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data stored in the cloud currently represents about
5&#160;percent of the $1.5 trillion in corporate information
technology spending last year, according to industry data
supplied by IDC and Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a more efficient model for everyone,&#8221; Tobin said. &#8220;As
the smartphone starts to handle more of the work effort versus a
desktop, and now you add the tablet, that&#8217;s the time&#8221; to move
away from storing information on computer hard drives and local
servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading Barbs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to give any estimate of how much money the
shift will save RIM or its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM plans to introduce the PlayBook this month or in early
April, co-Chief Executive Officer Jim Balsillie said last month.
Tobin declined to elaborate other than saying it will be very
soon. Apple&#8217;s iPad went on sale in April 2010 and the company
has since sold over 15 million of the devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, fell $1.25, or 2.1
percent, to $59.84 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. The stock has climbed 24 percent since the PlayBook was
unveiled Sept. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the PlayBook yet to appear in stores, consumers have
been buying the iPad and tablets like Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s Xoom, which went on sale last month. Both have screens
that measure about 10 inches (25 centimeters), compared to the
PlayBook&#8217;s smaller 7-inch screen. Balsillie and Apple CEO Steve Jobs exchanged barbs late last year after Jobs said smaller
tablets are &#8220;dead on arrival&#8221; because they are too small to
compete with the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One other tablet is making some inroads and lots of
noise,&#8221; said Tobin. &#8220;The PlayBook is the only other relevant
game for enterprises right now, and for enterprises that have
embraced BlackBerry, it&#8217;s a natural game to jump on that
bandwagon really quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should purchase Research
In Motion Ltd. (RIM) put options because &#8220;negative catalysts&#8221; may
hurt the BlackBerry maker&#8217;s stock price, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall recommended buying RIM&#8217;s September $60 puts while
selling September $52.50 puts, a strategy known as a spread.
Fogertey and Marshall cited analyst Simona Jankowski, who is
&#8220;bearish,&#8221; according to the note, and rates the Waterloo,
Ontario-based company a &#8220;sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiment before RIM&#8217;s fourth-quarter earnings report on
March 24 is &#8220;too positive,&#8221; and RIM&#8217;s tablet, which Goldman
expects to be introduced in mid-April, may not succeed in the
competition against Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad, the note said. The iPhone
5, which is expected to be introduced in July, &#8220;could again
raise concerns around the competitive landscape,&#8221; it said. RIM
dropped 2.1 percent to $59.84. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM will report fourth-quarter profit of $1.75 a share
excluding some items, according to the average of 48 analysts&#8217;
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. It has dropped 14 percent since
its nine-month high on Feb. 18. RIM&#8217;s implied volatility, the
key gauge of options prices, for at-the-money contracts expiring
in 30 days rose to 54.22, the highest since November, from 28.57
on Feb. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman last month recommended buying RIM&#8217;s April $60 puts
and April $65 calls ahead of the company&#8217;s PlayBook tablet
introduction because possible volatility around the launch was
not being adequately priced in, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended investors buy put options in Vale SA (VALE3), the world&#8217;s
largest iron-ore producer, to protect against a short-term drop
in the commodity&#8217;s price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall recommend buying May $30 puts and selling Jan 2012 $25
puts. The New York-based company, which in January advised
hedging near-term risks by buying April $35 puts and selling
January $25 puts, is now saying to roll the April $35 puts.
Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, fell 2.7 percent to $31.04 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iron ore prices and volumes could be negatively impacted
due to the earthquake in Japan,&#8221; Fogertey and Marshall said in
the note. &#8220;While our analyst is bullish on Vale on the longer
term, we continue to see three near-term risks which could cause
volatility and pull back the stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vale dropped 16 percent from its 31-month high on Jan. 18. Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa fell 6.9 percent in that period. Japan
accounted for 10 percent of Vale&#8217;s iron ore exports, the note
said, compared with 12 percent for Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining Royalty Taxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may also owe Brazilian states almost 5 billion
reais ($3 billion) on royalties through 2010, Mining Minister
Edison Lobao said March 14 in Brasilia. Mining royalty taxes to
the government may increase to about 4 percent from 2 percent,
which could hurt the stock price, according to the strategists,
who cited a Goldman Sachs analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vale Chief Executive Officer Roger Agnelli&#8217;s term will
expire this year and the prospect of a new leader may increase
volatility in the next two months, according to the note.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff may push major Vale
shareholders to name Antonio Maciel Neto of Suzano Papel e
Celulose SA, Latin America&#8217;s second-biggest pulp exporter, to
replace Agnelli, newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported on
March 14, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vale Chairman Ricardo Flores signaled Agnelli may stay,
saying there &#8220;will be no change in the company&#8217;s command,&#8221;
Brazil Economico reported on Jan. 3. Flores is president of the
pension fund that&#8217;s Vale&#8217;s biggest shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against

&lt;p&gt;The center-jump section of the
Pauley Pavilion court where Hall of Fame coach John Wooden&#8217;s
UCLA basketball teams compiled a 148-2 record is being auctioned
off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-foot diameter section will be offered next month as
part of an internet sale presented by SCP Auctions, Inc., with a
$25,000 minimum bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original court, which was installed in 1965, was home
to eight of the University of California, Los Angeles&#8217;s 10
National Collegiate Athletic Association championship teams
under Wooden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jump circle has been preserved in storage since its
replacement in 1982. In 1998, it was displayed for an event at
Pauley Pavilion and signed by Wooden and former players Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -- known as Lew Alcindor during his time at UCLA --
Bill Walton, Sidney Wicks and Walt Hazzard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court section is being sold by an unidentified UCLA
alumnus and a large portion of the proceeds will be dedicated to
funding medical research, SCP said. The auction will be open to
registered bidders from April 15 to 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov&#8217;s conviction for stealing
the firm&#8217;s trade secrets by appropriating its computer source
code, should be upheld, a federal judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March 14 order unsealed today, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York rejected a request by Aleynikov&#8217;s lawyer
to set aside his conviction. Cote also denied Aleynikov&#8217;s
request to dismiss the indictment or grant him a new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted in December of violating the
Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of
Stolen Property Act. He faces as long as 10 years in prison on
the espionage charge and five years for the interstate
transportation charge when he&#8217;s sentenced March 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District

&lt;p&gt; Visa Inc. (V) says it&#8217;s fixed the
problem that prevented people from booking tickets for the 2012
London Olympics by credit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans with Visa cards that expired before the end of August
were unable to process applications yesterday as 6.6 million
tickets went on public sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest electronic payments network, said
starting March 21 all of the company cards with an expiration
date of May 2011 or later will be accepted by the London Games&#8217;
ticket application website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any Visa cardholders with an April expiry date will
receive a replacement card before the ticket registration
deadline of 26th April,&#8221; the company said in a statement.
&#8220;This means that all Visa cardholders will be able to apply for
tickets before the 26 April deadline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa is an Olympics sponsor and the only card that can be
used to buy tickets for the London Games. Tickets are issued on
a first-come, first-served basis so any registration taking
place before the deadline will have an equal chance of success
in the ballot, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said a U.S. proposal to exempt
certain mortgages from rules governing securitized loans may
unintentionally help the biggest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A law requiring lenders to keep 5 percent of the loans they
securitize on their balance sheets could be &#8220;a positive for the
larger players&#8221; such as JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) because
it exempts few mortgages, Citigroup Inc. (C) analysts said in a
March 3 research note summarizing a meeting with Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act lets regulators exempt some mortgages
from securitization rules designed to discourage risky lending.
Six agencies drafting the rules, including the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and Office of Comptroller of the Currency,
agreed to exempt loans in which borrowers make down-payments of
at least 20 percent, according to U.S. officials who requested
anonymity because the negotiations aren&#8217;t yet public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means lenders could securitize those loans without
keeping part of the debt on their books. It would help bigger
lenders such as New York-based JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, because they &#8220;have the scale to hold the
5 percent of non-qualifying mortgages on their balance sheet,&#8221;
said Citigroup analysts Keith Horowitz, Craig Singer and Steve
Foundos, citing Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo urged regulators
to exempt only mortgages with down-payments of 30 percent or
more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller lenders and housing activists say exempting only
high-down-payment loans would raise borrower costs, shut out
smaller originators and cement the positions of big banks that
can afford to keep 5 percent of non-exempt loans on their books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to those concerns, regulators are considering
whether to include an option that would exempt loans with down-
payments of at least 10 percent if they are backed by private mortgage insurance, which protects lenders from default, said
one government official with knowledge of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitol Group, the world&#8217;s largest
independent oil trader, was ranked as 2010&#8217;s most productive
developer of projects yielding tradable emission credits,
according to a survey by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol Group&#8217;s Carbon Resource Management sought credits
last year for projects that may yield 11.1 million metric tons
of United Nations-overseen greenhouse gas credits through 2020,
according to the ranking. Climate Change Capital Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EcoSecurities unit tied for second place,
with projects that may yield 8.7 million tons and 8.6 million
tons, respectively, in the period. The margin is statistically
too close to call, according to a New Energy Finance statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy traders and banks have bought project developers to
create credits under the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint
Implementation programs instead of starting from scratch, said
Marisa Beck, a London-based analyst for New Energy Finance.
&#8220;Bigger players are better placed to manage these projects
because they can diversify the risks and achieve economies of
scale,&#8221; she said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Energy Finance used public data to assess the
performance of companies seeking credits last year. The CDM is
the second-biggest greenhouse gas market by traded volume after
the European Union cap-and-trade program. Factories and power
stations in the EU can use CDM credits as a cheaper alternative
for compliance than permits sold by nations. They range from
wind farms in China to industrial gas-cutting plants in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certified Emission Reduction credits from the program for
delivery in December, the industry benchmark, fell 0.2 percent
to 11.90 euros ($16.50) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London as of 11:20 a.m. They earlier today traded as
high as 11.96 euros a ton, their most expensive intraday level
since Nov. 25. Prices have fallen 1.3 percent from a year ago as
slow economic growth curbed demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth in the ranking was Tokyo-based Eco Asset Inc., with
7.2 million tons, while Barclays Plc (BARC)&#8217;s Tricorona Carbon Asset
Management unit was fifth, with 6.5 million tons, according to
New Energy Finance. Noble Carbon Credits, a unit of Singapore-
based Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL), was sixth, with 5.1 million tons
expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol, based in Geneva, said last month it increased its
stake to 100 percent of Carbon Resource Management as part of a
strategy to develop emission-reduction projects after 2012.
Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks of Credits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon Resource Management didn&#8217;t make last year&#8217;s rankings
by New Energy Finance. Barclays&#8217; Tricorona unit was ranked third
last year, while JPMorgan&#8217;s EcoSecurities was fifth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased EcoSecurities for about $206 million in
2009, while London-based Barclays bought Tricorona for about
$141 million in June last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Energy Finance adjusted expected credits for risks,
including the chance the project would not be registered by the
CDM executive board, the possibility the supply of credits would
be delayed by regulators and the likelihood of operating risks,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

harsh climates as the world&#8217;s largest oil producing country aims
to keep output at about 10 million barrels a day. Soviet-era
discoveries in western Siberia are aging, making the development
of new regions vital for maintaining production levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft agreed with BP Plc in January to swap shares and
explore for resources in the Kara Sea. Later that month, the
state-run Russian oil producer signed an accord with Exxon Mobil
Corp. to explore in the Black Sea. A joint venture with Exxon
will probably be formed by October, Khudainatov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron also has an agreement with Rosneft to explore a
deep-water block in the Black Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khudainatov didn&#8217;t name any Indian companies. Oil  Natural
Gas Corp. and Rosneft are partners at the Exxon Mobil-led
Sakhalin-1 project off Russia&#8217;s Pacific coast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
buy Benchmark Asset Management Co., India&#8217;s largest provider of
index-tracking funds, stepping up an expansion in Asia&#8217;s third-
biggest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set up its own mutual fund unit in
India in 2008, didn&#8217;t oversee any assets in India as of the end
of last year, according to data from the Association of Mutual
Funds of India, an industry body. The transaction is expected to
be completed later in the year, subject to regulatory approvals,
Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. It did not disclose the
terms of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase gives New York-based Goldman Sachs access to a
market where assets managed by mutual funds more than tripled to
6.8 trillion rupees ($150 billion) in the five years to Dec. 31,
according to the industry body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s curious that Goldman is buying Benchmark because
they don&#8217;t have an ETF business anywhere in the world,&#8221; said
Dhirendra Kumar, New Delhi-based managing director at Value
Research, a firm that tracks funds. &#8220;I think this purchase is
more a statement of their commitment to India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark Asset Management oversaw 29.35 billion rupees in
assets as of Dec. 31. The company last year began selling an
exchange-traded fund linked to Hong Kong&#8217;s benchmark Hang Seng
Index, the first overseas-backed ETF in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a good deal for Benchmark, which have been pioneers
in the ETF business in India,&#8221; said Kumar. &#8220;They have been
facing a lot of competition from rivals like Kotak Mutual Fund
and Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund getting into the ETF fray.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming Popular &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to buy or sell
shares of entire portfolios of stocks in a single security, have
become popular worldwide since their creation in 1993 as they
widen investors&#8217; access to different types of assets. ETFs,
which mimic the performance of an index and trade like
securities, are cheaper than mutual funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s benchmark Sensitive Index has dropped 11 percent
this year, the third-worst performance among 90 global
benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg, after gaining 17 percent last
year and 81 percent in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual-fund assets in India have dropped 19 percent since
peaking in November 2009, three months after the country banned
firms from charging investors an upfront fee when they bought
fund units, according to the industry association. The ban
caused distributors, which previously shared the fee with the
manager, to reduce marketing of funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India is one of the world&#8217;s largest growth markets and a
strategic priority for our firm,&#8221; Oliver Bolitho, head of
Goldman Sachs Asset Management in Asia said in the statement.
&#8220;The acquisition illustrates our commitment to expand in
India.&#8221; Goldman Sachs also will start actively managed on-shore
funds in the country, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T. Rowe Price Group Inc. bought a 26 percent stake in UTI
Asset Management Co., India&#8217;s oldest money manager, in November
2009, in a deal that valued UTI at 3.3 percent of its money
under management. The financing unit of Larsen  Toubro Ltd.,
India&#8217;s largest engineering company, in September 2009 acquired
DBS Cholamandalam Asset Management for 450 million rupees, or
1.6 percent of the target&#8217;s managed assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese stocks may gain even as
the nation battles to rebuild and prevent a potential nuclear
meltdown following its strongest earthquake on record, as global
economic growth drives export demand, strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic effects of the magnitude 9 temblor on March 11
and the subsequent tsunami are likely to be temporary, and
shares may gain in the medium term, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Equities are trading below their &#8220;fair
value,&#8221; according to Morgan Stanley. Stocks may advance by the
end of March as the global economy recovers, UBS AG (UBSN) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Japan&#8217;s Topix Index plunged as much as 14 percent
yesterday, the third-worst daily slump in history, following
damage to a nuclear plant following the quake and tsunami that
destroyed towns north of Tokyo. Thousands have been killed and
millions left without electricity or water. The Nikkei rebounded
6.6 percent today, its biggest one-day gain since Oct. 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Share prices have fallen sharply as they factor in
adverse impacts from the natural disaster and nuclear reactor
incidents,&#8221; UBS strategists led by Shoji Hirakawa said in a
report dated yesterday. &#8220;We believe there could be investment
opportunities for sectors and stocks where valuations are
appealing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pumping Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa pledged on March
14 to keep pumping cash into the economy as needed after
unleashing a record 15 trillion yen ($183 billion) in one-day
operations. The measures should help stop the yen&#8217;s
appreciation, which will lead to a rebound in share prices
through the end of the month, Hirakawa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s stock market is likely to advance as the U.S. and
global economies continue to grow, deflation dissipates in Japan
and company profits rise in fiscal 2012 amid reasonable
valuations, Goldman strategist Kathy Matsui wrote in a report
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese stocks entered what some investors consider a bear
market yesterday, with the Topix extending its drop since April
15, 2010, to more than 20 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gauge yesterday traded at 0.91 times the value of
net assets for its companies, the lowest level since March 2009.
It rose to 0.97 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28-Month Low &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix closed at 817.63 today in Tokyo amid speculation
that the selloff that drove valuations to a 28-month low was
excessive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman left its 12-month target for the Topix Index
unchanged at 1,050, while the bulk of the gains are likely to be
in the latter half of the year, as overseas investors may resume
buying shares, and the potential negative impact on fiscal year
2011 profit growth for companies listed on the first section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange is likely to be a decline on 10
percent, rather than a possible 20 percent drop, Matsui said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the current uncertainty will result in a near-
term pause in foreign buying,&#8221; wrote Matsui. &#8220;The market still
has scope for upside over the medium-term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix lost more than $680 billion in market value in
the past three days. The gauge&#8217;s relative strength index, a
measure of price momentum, dropped to as low as 16.54 yesterday,
before advancing to 31.50 today. Some traders use a reading
below 30 as an indicator to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling Blackouts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electric Power Co., also known as Tepco, began
rolling blackouts that will continue until the end of April to
conserve electricity in the Kanto region on concerns of a supply
shortfall. The utility is also battling to prevent a nuclear
catastrophe at its earthquake-damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant,
and said today that fuel rods at two reactors may have been
damaged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks may stop falling once Tepco returns power usage back
to normal and the government formulates an appropriate policy
response, both likely to be addressed by the end of April, Bank
of America-Merrill Lynch strategists including Masatoshi Kikuchi
said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As so many market players reside in the Tokyo area, the
morning and evening severe commuter congestion caused by the
power shortage has come to symbolize the overall economic damage
and has exacerbated the sense of unease,&#8221; wrote Kikuchi. &#8220;We
expect the rolling power cuts to end during April, once Tepco&#8217;s
thermal power stations return to normal operations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS) strategists led by Alexander Kinmont said
while sentiment may weaken in the near term, there is no need
for a knee-jerk response, as earnings for Japanese companies are
more dependent on global growth rather than events in Japan. The
Topix is trading about 20 percent below its &#8220;fair value&#8221; of
1,100, Kinmont said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The effects of the earthquake are ultimately likely to be
less significant than the swing in other variables that affect
earnings -- most notably, global demand growth,&#8221; wrote Kinmont.
&#8220;In addition to the obvious moral considerations, we believe
that investors are poorly advised to trade on &#8220;events,&#8221;
especially ones such as Friday&#8217;s devastating earthquake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said board
member H. Lee Scott, who helped review the bank&#8217;s business
practices when the firm was sued by U.S. regulators, will quit
after one year because of other commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott, 62, a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) chief executive
officer, was elected to the board at the annual shareholder
meeting in May. He won&#8217;t seek re-election at this year&#8217;s
meeting, the firm said today in a statement. Goldman Sachs, the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking a replacement,
said a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lee made an important contribution to our board and the
firm during a challenging period,&#8221; Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s chairman and CEO, said in the statement. &#8220;I am
particularly grateful for the enormous time and effort he
committed to the board&#8217;s efforts related to the business
standards committee.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs announced at last year&#8217;s annual meeting that
it would review business standards in the wake of a fraud
lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The firm paid $550 million to settle the suit in July and in
January released a report with 39 recommendations for improving
its practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott was nominated to the board on March 19 last year, the
same day the firm said Rajat K. Gupta, who had joined the board
in 2006, wouldn&#8217;t stand for re-election. A month later, the Wall
Street Journal reported U.S. prosecutors were investigating
whether Gupta had passed confidential information about Goldman
Sachs to Galleon Group hedge-fund founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the SEC sued Gupta. Gary Naftalis, an
attorney for Gupta, has called the SEC&#8217;s allegations &#8220;totally
baseless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, 2009, Scott became an operating partner and
investment committee member at Solamere Capital, a Lexington,
Massachusetts-based private-equity firm whose managing partners
include Tagg Romney, a son of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hid from
the South Korean Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. that it had bet
against the viability of a collateralized debt obligation the
bank sold as safe, according to a lawsuit filed in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer seeks more than $47.3 million in damages from
the New York-based banking firm according to its 56-page
complaint accusing Goldman Sachs of fraud and negligent
misrepresentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman had utilized its specialized knowledge of the
subprime mortgage market to make a massive, concealed bet
against the very CDO that it sold to Heungkuk,&#8221; the insurer
said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint focuses on the bank&#8217;s Timberwolf I CDO Ltd.,
a $1 billion CDO Heungkuk claims was marketed as &#8220;highly rated,
secure and profitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timberwolf was called &#8220;one shitty deal,&#8221; by a bank
executive in a 2007 internal e-mail written eight days after the
Heungkuk investment, according to the complaint. The e-mail by
now-former Goldman executive Thomas Montag was released publicly
by U.S. Senate lawmakers last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based
investment bank, today declined to comment on the Heungkuk case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. v. The Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., 11cv1856, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) investors are pushing
for a spinoff of the drugmaker&#8217;s nutrition business that would
command a price tag of $6.8 billion and deliver more than twice
the gains of the U.S. stock market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN), the baby-formula maker that
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) took public in February 2009, now
trades at 23.1 times adjusted earnings, more than twice the
valuation of its former parent or Pfizer, after a 133 percent
surge through yesterday that beat the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index&#8217;s 52 percent rise, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Applying Mead Johnson&#8217;s profit margins and valuations
to Pfizer&#8217;s own nutrition unit, which had $1.87 billion in sales
last year, would give it a market value of $6.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bristol-Myers outperformed U.S. drugmakers by 20
percentage points since announcing plans for Mead Johnson&#8217;s
initial public offering in April 2008, Pfizer fell in the same
period and has the third-lowest price-to-earnings valuation of
SP 500 pharmaceutical companies, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Investors are pressing Pfizer&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read to slim down the company and focus on new drugs as it
faces the loss of exclusivity for its Lipitor cholesterol pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who wouldn&#8217;t want a repeat of Mead Johnson?&#8221; said Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at Miller Tabak  Co.,
which owns Pfizer shares. &#8220;Investors and shareholders are
pushing for value-creating strategies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today&#8217;s Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares climbed 58 cents, or 3 percent, to $19.88 on
the New York Stock Exchange today. The gain was the largest
among the 52 companies in the SP 500 Health Care Index and the
second-biggest in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers advanced 46 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $25.43,
while Mead Johnson fell 45 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $55.36. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer, said
the company is conducting a strategic review of each of its
units. No decision has been made about the future of the
nutritional business, she said. The unit was acquired by the
world&#8217;s largest drugmaker in the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Mead Johnson both make infant formula and
nutrition drinks for children and expecting mothers as
burgeoning middle classes in emerging markets drive demand.
Overall sales of baby food in Asia, Latin America and Eastern
Europe more than doubled from 2005 to 2010, according to
Euromonitor, a London-based research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead Johnson, which analysts project will post a 20 percent
increase in net profit this year, has a market capitalization of
$11.4 billion. Its 133 percent rally from Feb. 10, 2009, through
yesterday outstripped the 33 percent advance in the SP 500&#8217;s
gauge of 41 companies that sell consumer staples from foods to
household products, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Positive Development&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spinoff was &#8220;a positive development for the company,&#8221;
Chris Perille, a spokesman for Glenview, Illinois-based Mead
Johnson, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We have been better
able to invest for growth in our business than would have been
possible as part of a larger pharmaceutical company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of the Enfamil infant formula turned every dollar
of sales into 14.4 cents of profit last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Applying Mead Johnson&#8217;s profit margin and
share price valuation of 25.2 times net income to the $1.87
billion of revenue posted last year by Pfizer&#8217;s nutritional unit
would produce a market value of $6.8 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead Johnson offers a guide for the valuation that Pfizer&#8217;s
unit may command because they offer similar products and compete
in many of the same markets, according to Linda Bannister, an
analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emerging Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling the nutrition business would be a change of
strategy for Pfizer. The company diversified by buying Wyeth to
add biologic drugs, consumer and animal health products and baby
formula. It also boosted sales in emerging markets such as
China, India and Brazil to 18 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue
under Jeffery Kindler, who Read replaced in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead Johnson&#8217;s revenue of $3.14 billion last year outpaced
Pfizer&#8217;s unit by 68 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they spin out nutritionals and get a Mead Johnson-type
price, it would add value to Pfizer shareholders,&#8221; Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, said in an
interview. &#8220;The question is: what are the business costs in
terms of Pfizer building its emerging-market platform?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers climbed 17 percent through yesterday since
saying on April 24, 2008, that it planned an IPO for Mead
Johnson. That compared with a 3.3 percent drop for the SP 500&#8217;s
gauge of 11 pharmaceutical companies and a 2.9 percent decline
for Pfizer, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bristol-Myers still
trades at 11.4 times profit, less than half of Mead Johnson&#8217;s
valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mead Johnson Stake &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker said in November 2009 that it would separate
its remaining 83 percent stake in Mead Johnson in a tax-free
transaction that retired 270 million Bristol-Myers shares and
reduced dividend obligations by $335 million a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split off of Mead Johnson &#8220;was a key part of our
biopharma strategy,&#8221; Jennifer Mauer, a spokeswoman for New
York-based Bristol-Myers, said in a phone interview. &#8220;It allows
all of the company efforts and resources to be focused on
developing medicines for serious diseases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move was part of former CEO James Cornelius&#8217; strategy
to shed non-pharmaceutical businesses and build up the pipeline
of experimental drugs through partnerships and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers will have generic competition next year for
its Plavix blood thinner, which generates about a third of the
company&#8217;s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lipitor Pill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer faces the loss of exclusivity of its biggest drug,
the Lipitor cholesterol pill, which accounts for about 16
percent of its sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
company forecasts revenue may fall as much as 2.7 percent this
year as the pipeline of experimental drugs fails to offset lower
sales of Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer may sell businesses that account for almost half of
its revenue, Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
 Co. in New York, wrote in a March 14 report. The company may
divest four non-pharmaceutical businesses as well as its
established products group, reducing sales to $35 to $40 billion
from $67 billion, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nutrition unit would be an easy candidate since its
products don&#8217;t match up with the rest of Pfizer&#8217;s offerings and
the business was acquired recently, Anderson wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN) of Vevey, Switzerland, or Paris-based Danone (BN) may
be interested in purchasing Pfizer&#8217;s nutrition unit after a
spinoff, according to a note in January from Catherine Arnold,
an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. Any deal may
trigger anti-trust restrictions, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nestle, Danone &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Tickle, a spokesman for Nestle, didn&#8217;t return a
request for comment after business hours. Sabrina Schneider, a
spokeswoman for Danone, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Pfizer were to sell its baby-formula division, it may be
worth more than $7 billion, based on Mead Johnson&#8217;s earnings and
previous deals in the pharmaceutical industry, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead Johnson generates 24.7 cents of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for every $1 of
sales. At that level Pfizer&#8217;s unit would have posted Ebitda of
about $461.7 million last year. Based on the median multiple of
15.4 times Ebitda for U.S. pharmaceutical takeovers greater than
$1 billion in the last 10 years, the nutrition company may fetch
$7.1 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eli Lilly &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s shares traded at 8.5 times profit. That was the
third-lowest of any company in the SP 500 Pharmaceuticals
Index, after Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX) of New York and
Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY), which were valued at 7 times
profit, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bristol shareholders are now also shareholders of Mead
Johnson, and Mead Johnson has performed fabulously well,&#8221; said
Edward Jones&#8217; Bannister. &#8220;Pfizer unlocking some value, making
the company smaller: I think that is a good idea and those are
welcome moves from a shareholder perspective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 4,788 deals announced globally this year,
totaling $467.1 billion, a 12 percent increase from the $416.7
billion in the same period in 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co. (DIS) suspended all
administrative and store operations in Tokyo in the aftermath of
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our top priority is the well-being of our employees and
their families during this challenging time and we will continue
to closely monitor the situation as it develops,&#8221; the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electric Power Co. has scheduled blackouts in the
city to conserve energy. Subway lines are running fewer trains,
shops are closing early and offices are shutting off non-
essential electricity as the country copes with the disaster.
The blackouts are compounding the economic fallout from last
week&#8217;s magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney gained 16 cents to $40.76 at 4:15 p.m. in New York

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy call options
on oil producers such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
because they are poised to rally amid &#8220;strong&#8221; global demand
for crude, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists John Marshall and Katherine Fogertey recommended buying Exxon&#8217;s October $80 calls and
Chevron&#8217;s September $100 calls. They said to use the same
strategy on nine other oil companies. Irving, Texas-based Exxon
gained 2.3 percent to $81.16 today, and Chevron of San Ramon, California, increased 2.7 percent to $102.24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Volatility is likely to remain high, and we expect strong
global demand to drive oil prices and stocks higher,&#8221; the
strategists wrote in a note today. &#8220;Calls on energy stocks have
lagged&#8221; behind as calls on oil options have jumped, the
strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil rose 3.5 percent, the most in three weeks, after the
U.S. signaled it favored allowing foreign intervention against
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi&#8217;s forces. Bahrain declared a
three-month state of emergency on March 15. UBS AG raised its
2011 Brent crude forecast because of the turmoil. Analysts at
Nomura Holdings said Japan&#8217;s oil demand may jump by 171,000
barrels a day as the country seeks alternative sources of power
and rebuilds in the wake of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Increasingly Cheap&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call options prices on large oil companies remain &#8220;at the
lower end of historical ranges,&#8221; the note said, and calls have
been &#8220;increasingly cheap relative to puts&#8221; while call implied
volatility on energy stocks has risen &#8220;modestly.&#8221; Earnings for
the nine selected companies will increase by 51 percent, Goldman
Sachs analysts projected. Marshall and Fogertey said they think
the basket of calls could offer a 300 percent return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We find that during this part of the business cycle
energy stocks tend to outperform and energy implied volatility
tends to outperform as energy demand grows quickly, but supply
is less responsive,&#8221; the strategists wrote. &#8220;We believe this
call buying strategy offers strong risk-reward as it implicitly
targets risk-adjusted returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of the trades that Goldman Sachs recommended. &lt;/p&gt;

Company             Buy
Cenovus Energy      September $35 call
Exxon Mobil Corp.   October $80 call
Marathon Oil        October $49 call
Diamond Offshore    September $74.25 call
Chevron Corp.       September $100 call
Murphy Oil Corp.    October $70 call
Baker Hughes Inc.   October $70 call
Halliburton Co.     October $43 call
Hess Corp.          August $80 call

&lt;p&gt;In the world of Web browsers,
there&#8217;s &#8220;privacy,&#8221; and then there&#8217;s &#8220;security,&#8221; and they
aren&#8217;t quite the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) released a new version of
Internet Explorer, and while we wait to hear from the security
experts how it fares against hackers, it&#8217;s already taken a big
step forward on the privacy front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 9, which is available as a free download
from Microsoft, replaces IE&#8217;s previous, largely ineffectual
scheme for preventing snoopy content providers from
surreptitiously tracking your online movements. The goal may be
benign -- gathering usage data for analytic purposes, for
instance -- but such data can also generate a profile of you,
based on your behavior, which can be used for ad-targeting or
other more nefarious purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of Microsoft&#8217;s browser offers controls
that, while far from perfect, make it easier to choose what
information about your behavior you&#8217;re willing to share with
online content providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IE remains one of the most widely used pieces of
software on the planet, it doesn&#8217;t wield the clout it once did.
For years now, new generations of competing browsers -- Google&#8217;s
Chrome, Apple&#8217;s Safari, Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox and Opera Software&#8217;s
Opera, to name four -- have out-innovated and out-performed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With IE9, which is all-around faster, slicker and more
enjoyable than its predecessor, Microsoft finally deserves to be
front-of-mind again for anyone lucky enough to be able to run
it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for Everyone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein lies an important point: Not every Web surfer -- in
fact, not even every Microsoft-using Web surfer -- will be
capable of running the new software. In a bold move, the company
has made IE9 compatible only with Windows 7, the current version
of its desktop operating system, and with its immediate
predecessor, Vista. About half of all Windows users, who are
still on the nine-year-old XP operating system, are out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says that step was made necessary by the new
features of IE9 that integrate it more deeply with the operating
system than previous versions, or, in earlier years, antitrust
regulators would allow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, IE9 blurs the line between programs
running on your computer&#8217;s hard drive and content from the Web.
Website icons can now be permanently affixed to Windows&#8217;s task
bar, where they both look and, if the site developer supports
it, act much like applications located on your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump Lists &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pin the Yahoo! icon to your task bar, for instance, and a
right-button mouse click opens a menu called a jump list that
lets you go directly to the site&#8217;s widely used mail, finance and
sports services. The New York Times menu gives you links to its
top 10 headlines, plus shortcuts to its home page and search,
video and most-popular functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new browser is also much speedier. Its Windows-only
orientation means Microsoft didn&#8217;t have to make compromises to
assure it would run the same on other operating systems; by
contrast, Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera all have versions
that run on Macs as well as PCs, and all except Safari have
versions for the open-source Linux operating system too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows-only
approach is that IE can harness your PC&#8217;s hardware to give
itself a significant speed boost for performing certain kinds of
functions -- running animated graphics, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE9&#8217;s new privacy features, meanwhile, represent an upping
of the ante for other browser developers. The previous version
of Explorer had a tool called &#8220;InPrivate Filtering&#8221; that
proved to be deeply flawed. Among other things, it was disabled
by default; to trigger it, users had to deliberately switch it
on, and every time they closed their browser, the setting would
revert to the off position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Powerful &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IE9 still requires the user to choose tracking
protection, this time it&#8217;s easier to do, more powerful and
persists across browsing sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable the feature, you&#8217;ll click on the settings icon on
IE9&#8217;s newly streamlined interface, and choose the &#8220;Safety&#8221;
option from the pull-down menu. The software uses two methods
for blocking tracking. One instructs your browser to tell
content providers that you don&#8217;t wish to be tracked. While
reputable services should comply, there&#8217;s no protection against
the unscrupulous ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second method requires a little more work on your part,
hopefully just once, by allowing you to easily subscribe to
online &#8220;tracking protection lists.&#8221; These lists are maintained
and updated by online-privacy organizations such as TRUSTe and
PrivacyChoice, which monitor content providers and their
technologies, and are supposed to actually block their efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat and Mouse &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is how well the new tools work, or whether
they&#8217;ll trigger cat-and-mouse moves by less-than-reputable sites
to circumvent them. Indeed, one risk with Microsoft&#8217;s new
features is that they&#8217;ll result in a false sense of security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, they represent a welcome step to put privacy issues
front and center -- and not just for Microsoft. The next version
of Firefox will include &#8220;do not track&#8221; functionality, for
instance, while Google recently made an anti-tracking add-on
available for its new Chrome 10 browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration and Congress
beginning to debate the need for online-privacy legislation,
Microsoft&#8217;s efforts with IE9 may be just the opening salvo in a
feature war among all the browser makers to make Web surfing
safer and more private. We can only hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. housing market is &#8220;close

Sachs Group Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The valuation of real estate is much more reasonable

&lt;p&gt;ISS A/S, the world&#8217;s largest
cleaning-service provider, said it postponed its initial public
offering, citing &#8220;high levels of uncertainty and volatility&#8221;
in global markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering was scheduled for today, ISS said in a
statement. The Copenhagen-based company, owned by Goldman Sachs
Capital Partners and EQT Partners AB, yesterday cut the top end
of its IPO price range by about 19 percent as a global sell-off
in stocks after Japan&#8217;s earthquake hurt demand for new equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The timetable has coincided with an extraordinary period
in global markets,&#8221; ISS said in the statement. &#8220;Given the
existing shareholders&#8217; and the company&#8217;s desire to achieve a
successful IPO with an orderly aftermarket, it has been decided
to postpone the IPO.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO would have been Denmark&#8217;s biggest in more than 16
years. ISS was seeking to sell as many as 133 million new shares
to raise gross proceeds of about 13.3 billion kroner ($2.5
billion), according to a statement earlier this month. The
process of taking orders for the stock started March 8, ISS
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering was oversubscribed within the price range, the
company said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup Inc. (C), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Nordea
Bank AB (NDA) have been managing the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slumping stock markets have prompted companies to postpone
offerings in the U.S., Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postponed Offerings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Lagardere SCA (MMB), France&#8217;s largest publisher, yesterday
delayed an initial share sale of its stake in Canal Plus France.
Global Market Group Ltd., the Guangzhou, China-based company
that connects domestic businesses with international customers,
postponed a $143 million U.S. IPO scheduled for today. Japanese
drugmaker RaQualia Pharma Inc. said March 15 it would put off an
IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks plunged this week after Japan&#8217;s March 11 earthquake,
which followed weeks of political unrest in some Middle East and
northern Africa nations. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
advanced as much as 1.8 percent today after declining 3.6
percent over the past three days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and two hedge-
fund partners would break federal rules limiting media ownership
under their plan to reorganize Tribune Co., delaying the
publisher&#8217;s exit from bankruptcy, a lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Angelo Gordon  Co. and Oaktree Capital
Management LP have built stakes in newspaper and broadcast
companies that have come out of bankruptcy in recent years, Mark
Prak, a lawyer who lobbies Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission on behalf of television broadcasters,
said today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They will violate the FCC media ownership rules,&#8221; Prak
said. &#8220;The interest they have will complicate reorganization.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prak was testifying on behalf of Aurelius Capital
Management LP, which is opposing a reorganization plan for
Chicago-based Tribune sponsored by JPMorgan, Angelo Gordon and
Oaktree. Aurelius is sponsoring its own plan. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Kevin J. Carey must decide which of the two plans to
approve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noteholder plan would have the same ownership problem,
Ronald Flagg, a lawyer for Tribune, said in court while
questioning Prak. Under either proposal, JPMorgan, Angelo Gordon
and Oaktree would own more than 5 percent each of the newspaper
and television company, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual and corporate aid efforts for Japan have mounted
quickly this week in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami that
devastated the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I designed a Japan prayer bracelet,&#8221; Lady Gaga posted on
her Twitter feed earlier this week. &#8220;Buy It/Donate here and ALL
proceeds will go to Tsunami Relief Efforts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orders for the $5 bracelet with &#8220;We Pray for Japan&#8221; in
English and Japanese raised more than $250,000 in 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Red Cross has received about $47 million
in donations. More than $2.6 million of that came from $10 gifts
the public texted to the organization by phone, Attie Poirier, a
Red Cross spokeswoman in Washington, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS) Japan gave $1.2 million to relief efforts, Sandra Hernandez, a New York-based Morgan Stanley spokeswoman,
said by phone. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) announced that it will
give 500 million yen ($6.3 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) pledged $5 million and will match as
much as $1 million in contributions made by the company&#8217;s
220,000 employees to the American Red Cross and World Vision, a

impoverished children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon may fly to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Tokyo offices next week to see how employees are
coping with the March 11 earthquake and the threat from
radiation leaks at a nuclear power plant northeast of the city,
a person at the bank familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 55-year-old chief executive officer is in Europe for a
previously scheduled business trip and was planning to go to
China next week, according to the person, who asked not to be
named because Dimon&#8217;s schedule is private. The travel plans
aren&#8217;t yet decided and may still change, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, has the
largest risk exposure of any U.S. bank in Japan, with $53.9
billion in &#8220;cross-border outstandings,&#8221; which include loans,
securities, foreign-currency contracts, derivatives and local-
country investments, among other assets, according to a March 14
research note by KBW Inc., an investment bank that specializes
in financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, also had $64 billion more in
&#8220;commitments&#8221; outstanding in Japan as of the end of last year,
according to the bank&#8217;s disclosures with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Commitments include outstanding letters of
credit and undrawn credit lines. None of the data takes into
account measures the company has used to hedge its risk in
Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Zuccarelli, a bank spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department urged U.S. citizens to defer
travel to Japan and said citizens already there should consider
leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had the next highest amount of
risk among U.S. banks with $33.6 billion in cross-border
outstandings, followed by Morgan Stanley (MS) with $19.1 billion, and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) with $17 billion, KBW researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian markets are &#8220;cheap&#8221;
according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill, while hedge fund GLG Partners LP is betting on gains in
the country&#8217;s currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country is the favorite emerging market for both
O&#8217;Neill and Bart Turtelboom, GLG&#8217;s co-head of emerging markets,
they said at the Bloomberg Link Hedge Fund Conference in London
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLG Partners is betting on gains in the ruble, which is
&#8220;one of the biggest trades we have on,&#8221; because the nation has
abundant natural resources and will see a number of initial
public offerings, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s currency, whose world-beating rally earlier this
year was fueled by surging oil prices, has retreated 0.3 percent
versus the dollar since Japan&#8217;s March 11 earthquake because of
concern the fallout from the catastrophe will slow economic
growth and lessen demand for crude imports. The Micex Index (INDEXCF) of
stocks trades at 9.5 times the average earnings of its members,
compared with 13.9 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble depreciated for the third day this week against
the central bank&#8217;s dollar-euro basket, losing 0.2 percent to
33.7989 as of 4:29 p.m. in Moscow. The Micex Index in the
world&#8217;s largest energy exporter increased 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s governance issues are &#8220;gradually being cured, but
it will take time,&#8221; said Turtelboom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world&#8217;s largest private equity
firm, doesn&#8217;t have any investments in Russia &#8220;that I know of,&#8221;
John Studzinski, a senior managing director at the firm, said at
the Bloomberg conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know the government is trying to make the environment
more friendly,&#8221; he said. Russia&#8217;s relative risk is &#8220;case by
case, industry by industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian government is setting up a $10 billion fund
aimed at boosting investment by overseas buyout firms in the
country, two people with knowledge of the matter said March 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged buyout firms have led $1.5 billion of takeovers
this year in Russia, about half the $3.6 billion of investments
announced in China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group LP, one of the world&#8217;s biggest private equity
firms, shut its Moscow office in 2005, a year after opening it,
saying the country was too risky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said Moscow&#8217;s traffic jams are
the biggest obstacle to turning the capital into a financial
hub, according to Deputy Finance Minister Dmitry Pankin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and President Dmitry Medvedev discussed
investment opportunities in Russia and Medvedev&#8217;s plans for the
capital at a March 15 meeting outside Moscow that Pankin
attended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The first question we asked was about the main problem
for creating Moscow as a financial center,&#8221; Pankin said in an
interview in Moscow yesterday. &#8220;He said it was bottleneck from
the airport to the city center.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medvedev has named 27 people, including Blankfein, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and Citigroup Inc. (C) CEO Vikram Pandit, to an advisory board as he seeks to bolster Russia&#8217;s
role in international finance, according to the Kremlin&#8217;s
website this month and a member of the board who declined to be
identified. Medvedev has made diversifying the economy of the
world&#8217;s biggest oil and gas supplier a priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transport and infrastructure, as well as child care, are
priorities for bankers working in Moscow, Pankin said. Goldman
Sachs declined to comment, said a spokeswoman, who asked not to
be named, citing company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Grueling&#8217; Traffic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Sergei Sobyanin vowed to focus on easing
transportation in the capital and uprooting corruption after
Medvedev ousted Yury Luzhkov, who had governed the city for 18
years. The president wants investors in Moscow to feel &#8220;no less
comfortable than in London, Geneva or New York,&#8221; according to
the Kremlin website. Moscow ranked 68th of 75 cities in the
December 2009 Global Financial Centers Index commissioned by the
City of London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moscow drivers suffer the longest traffic jams of 20 major
cities, making for a &#8220;grueling&#8221; atmosphere that inhibits
commerce, according to a July report by International Business
Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average Muscovite motorist spent a &#8220;whopping&#8221; 2 1/2
hours stuck in traffic at least once in the last three years,
IBM said in its global study on the &#8220;emotional and economic
toll of commuting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is also among the 23 banks selected by the
government last year to help manage its 1 trillion-ruble ($35
billion) state-asset sale program over three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia picked advisers &#8220;that have experience in launching
big projects&#8221; to help build Moscow into a financial hub, said Alexander Voloshin, head of the government working group
overseeing the project and former chief of staff under
Presidents Vladimir Putin and Boris Yeltsin, in a Jan. 11
interview. &#8220;And those big banks that can bring business here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vector Commodity Management LLP, a
hedge fund run by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader Gilbert Saiz, made 8.2 percent last month, six times the industry
average, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vector returned 12.2 percent this year, adding to the 8.6
percent gain made from when it started in June to the end of
2010, the people said, declining to be identified because the
data are private. The fund managed $258 million by Jan. 31, a
fund report obtained by Bloomberg shows. Saiz didn&#8217;t respond to
an e-mail and a voicemail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund beat bigger rivals last month, including the
$2.2 billion BlueGold Fund, the $5 billion Clive Fund, the
Viridian Fund and the Merchant Commodity Fund, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Vector invests in crude and oil products,
with a relative-value strategy that seeks to profit from price
gaps between contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The success of the relative-value approach is starting to
show up&#8221; in the results of some funds, Fraser McKenzie, head of
research at 47 Degrees North Capital Management Ltd., said from
Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. He declined to comment on whether his
company invests in Vector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity hedge funds as measured by the Newedge Commodity
Trading Index on average returned 1.3 percent last month, as the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials posted a
sixth monthly increase, advancing 3.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Relative&#8217; Plays &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative-value strategies invest in relationships such as
crack spreads, or the difference between crude and refined
products, and time spreads, or the gap between delivery dates
for the same commodity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil climbed as high as $106.95 a barrel in New York
on March 7 as turmoil in the Middle East and Libyan supply cuts
drove prices to the highest level since September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKenzie of 47 Degrees North said the rally boosted oil
prices for immediate delivery the most, weakening the premium,
or the contango, for later-dated contracts. &#8220;I think that was
one of the biggest and most profitable trades in the first
couple of months&#8221; for hedge funds, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil recovered to more than $100 a barrel in New York today,
as concerns that political unrest may cut Middle Eastern exports
countered estimates that the earthquake in Japan will curtail
fuel demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other speculators have increased their
positions in energy markets by 64 percent since June 2008 to the
highest level on record, according to data from U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commissioner Bart Chilton this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative positions represented more than one million
energy futures equivalent contracts as of January, the data
showed. Positions in metals and agricultural contracts have
increased about 20 percent, according to Chilton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saiz, 35, graduated from Columbia University School of
Engineering and Applied sciences in 1997. He spent his entire
career at J. Aron/Goldman Sachs, according to a biography on the
fund&#8217;s website. He was an executive director in charge of
Goldman&#8217;s European fuel-oil business from 2005 to 2009. Vector&#8217;s
chief executive officer, Edmund Gordon-Clark, was formerly
managing director of shipping derivatives at ICAP Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based BlueGold fund rose 7.5 percent in
February, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said
earlier this month. Its manager, Pierre Andurand, also started
his career at Goldman Sachs, where he traded oil products in Singapore, before moving to Bank of America Corp. and Vitol
Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clive Fund, which started trading in December 2007,
gained 4.9 percent in February, two people with direct knowledge
of the matter said earlier this month. Chris Levett, the founder
of London-based Clive, is a former trader at Moore Capital
Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viridian, Merchant &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Viridian Fund, managed by New York-based Drew Gilbert
and Chris Nygaard, returned 3.9 percent last month, taking the
two-month advance to 7.8 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The fund managed $1.1 billion at the end of February,
the data show. Gilbert and Nygaard co-founded Vermillion Asset
Management and started Viridian in June 2005. Chris Gillick, a
spokesman for Vermillion, declined to comment on its strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Merchant Commodity Fund, managed by ex-Cargill Inc.
traders Michael Coleman in Singapore and Doug King in Zug,
Switzerland, lost 3.7 percent in February and 4.8 percent in the
first two months, according to two people with direct knowledge
of the matter. Merchant had about $1.56 billion under management
as of the end of December and advanced about 28 percent in 2010,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds are largely unregulated investment vehicles
whose managers can trade any asset, aim to make money regardless
of whether markets rise or fall and participate substantially in
profits from money invested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; FPT Corp. (FPT), Vietnam&#8217;s biggest
publicly traded telecommunications and software company, said it
plans to combine its technology units and focus on restoring the
annual earnings growth rate to more than 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FPT will consolidate five subsidiaries -- FPT Information
System, FPT Telecom Corp., FPT Software, FPT Online and FPT
Trading Group -- with itself, Truong Dinh Anh, who will take
over as chief executive officer of Hanoi-based FPT on March 25,
said in a phone interview today. The parent may either buy out
the units&#8217; minority shareholders or issue its own shares and
swap them as part of the transaction, Anh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese technology company, which in May announced a
cloud-computing alliance with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is seeking to
renew its focus on telecommunications and Internet services and
software development after the pace of profit growth fell below
20 percent in the last three years, Anh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have reoriented our businesses to make it a
technology, information and communications corporation instead
of an economic group,&#8221; Anh said. &#8220;We are restructuring our
holdings in subsidiaries to focus on core businesses in order to
enhance growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FPT fell 1 percent to 52,000 dong at the 11 a.m. close of
trading in Ho Chi Minh City. The stock has declined 19 percent
this year, while the benchmark VN Index has lost 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Pace &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, pretax profit increased 19 percent to 2 trillion
dong ($96 million), FPT said in a statement on its website.
Revenue except internal sales of goods and services rose 9.5
percent to 20.5 trillion dong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slowing pace of profit growth &#8220;didn&#8217;t satisfy board
members and shareholders,&#8221; Anh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FPT had created many joint stock companies as part of a
business development model aimed at tapping opportunities in
multiple sectors, Anh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In recent years, especially in the crisis period, we&#8217;ve
seen that the main strength of FPT is still in technology and
telecommunications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to focus all efforts on
our strong points.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has a &#8220;commitment&#8221; to boost revenue by up to
25-fold by 2020, CEO Nguyen Thanh Nam said in May. FPT expects
both revenue and pretax profit to increase 20 percent this year
to 24.5 trillion dong and 2.42 trillion dong respectively, it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Southeast Asian nation&#8217;s economy expanded 6.8 percent
last year, the fastest pace since 2007. Vietnam is targeting an
average annual growth rate of as much as 8.5 percent between
2011 and 2015, and the government aims to derive 22 percent of
gross domestic product from the technology industry by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FPT, whose customers include Microsoft, Panasonic Corp. and
Hitachi Ltd., will also set up a wholly owned unit to hold and
manage its investments in Tien Phong Commercial Bank, FPT
Securities Joint-Stock Co., FPT Capital and FPT Land, Anh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will seek shareholders&#8217; opinions on the
consolidation plan at a meeting in April, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) has made about $3.7 billion, including paper profits, from
its $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) at the
depths of the financial crisis in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs today said it will pay $5.65 billion to
redeem preferred stock it sold to Berkshire. The price includes
the original investment, plus a 10 percent premium and first-
quarter dividend. Berkshire still holds warrants to buy $5
billion of the New York-based bank&#8217;s common stock with a strike
price of $115 per share, which have generated a paper profit of
more than $1.9 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett invested in Goldman Sachs following the collapse of
rival securities firm Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Under terms
of the deal, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire collected a $500
million annual dividend on the preferred stake. Goldman Sachs
closed at $159.96 today on the New York Stock Exchange, compared
with $84.39 at the end of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s redemptions are &#8220;unwelcome,&#8221; Buffett said
Feb. 26 in his annual letter to shareholders. &#8220;After they occur,
our earning power will be significantly reduced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) increased dividends and authorized share buybacks
after the Federal Reserve reviewed the ability of the largest
U.S. lenders to withstand another economic slump. Bank stocks
rallied in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its quarterly payout to 25 cents a share
from 5 cents and authorized a $15 billion stock repurchase.
Wells Fargo authorized the repurchase of 200 million shares and
a special dividend of 7 cents, which will raise the first-
quarter payout to 12 cents. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it got
permission to buy back $5 billion of preferred stock sold to
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are giving banks more flexibility in their use
of capital after forcing the companies in early 2009 to cut
dividends. Profits rebounded last year after losses tied to home
mortgages, commercial real estate and business lending had
drained capital and led to more than 300 failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Significant improvement in both economic conditions and
the capital positions of financial institutions&#8221; helped firms
win permission to increase their payouts, the Fed said in a
statement today. &#8220;From the end of 2008 through 2010, common
equity increased by more than $300 billion at the 19 largest
U.S. bank holding companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index of 24 companies advanced 1 percent at
4:02 p.m. in New York. JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, climbed 2.7 percent to $45.74. No. 4 Wells Fargo, based
in San Francisco, increased 1.5 percent to $31.83. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs jumped 2.7 percent to $159.96. New York-based
Goldman said it also has Fed approval for the repurchase of
common stock and a potential increase of its dividend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; KeyCorp (KEY), Ohio&#8217;s second-biggest bank, and Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) said today they are raising capital to repay
bailout funds after the Fed&#8217;s review. Cleveland-based KeyCorp
said it&#8217;s selling $625 million of stock and also issuing debt to
help repay $2.5 billion in U.S. bailout funds. SunTrust will
offer $1 billion in shares and $1 million in debt to help repay
a $4.9 billion rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KeyCorp climbed 0.8 percent and SunTrust added 4.7 percent.
Lenders including New York-based JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and U.S.
Bancorp already paid back the U.S. Treasury Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp, Minnesota&#8217;s largest lender, advanced 1.1
percent after it raised its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents a
share from 5 cents. The Minneapolis-based bank authorized the
purchase of 50 million shares through December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Confidence and Patience&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our shareholders deserve to be rewarded for the support,
confidence and patience they have shown over the past few
years,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Richard Davis said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed told banks in November to consider conservative
payouts that would still allow for a significant build-up of
capital and said today that firms are &#8220;generally expected&#8221; to
keep dividends no higher than 30 percent of earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ratio &#8220;will be the new normal,&#8221; Gerard Cassidy, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a Feb. 8 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the new level, JPMorgan&#8217;s dividend yield, the annualized
payout divided by the current share, equates to 2.2 percent. The
$1 annualized dividend works out to about 20 percent of
analysts&#8217; estimates for earnings per share over the
next four quarters, based on a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s new dividend yield is 1.5 percent, with an
estimated payout ratio over the next year of 16 percent. BBT
Corp., which lifted its dividend by a penny to 16 cents, has a
dividend yield of 2.3 percent and an estimated payout ratio of
about 35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Send a Signal&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We really didn&#8217;t have a call to action to raise it at
all,&#8221; BBT CEO Kelly King said in an interview. &#8220;We wanted to
send a signal to our shareholders that we were strong enough to
be able to do it and to signal to them that we are now entering
into a period where we can begin to think about future dividend
increases.&#8221; The Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based company is
also making a special payout of 1 cent a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; State Street Corp. (STT), the third-largest custody bank, raised
its quarterly dividend to 18 cents from a penny and said it will
buy back as much as $675 million in stock this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, is planning share buybacks that will begin after the
New York-based company reports first-quarter results, according
to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon, PNC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the world&#8217;s biggest custody
bank, and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC), the Pittsburgh-
based lender, said the Fed approved plans that include higher
dividends and share buybacks in the second quarter. Neither
company&#8217;s statement disclosed the size or cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth Third Bancorp, Ohio&#8217;s biggest lender, said the Fed
didn&#8217;t object to its capital plan, which includes a dividend
increase this quarter and possible redemption of trust-preferred
securities. The board of directors is scheduled to weigh the
dividend on March 22, the Cincinnati-based company said in a
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed said it tested how banks would absorb stresses of a
typical recession, such as a decline in the value of riskier
assets, and an 11 percent unemployment rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed still can limit dividends by weaker banks to
prepare the companies for tighter capital rules and eliminate
the need for taxpayer rescues. A bank&#8217;s decision to maintain its
dividend isn&#8217;t necessarily the result of the regulator denying
permission. Some companies may have opted not to seek approval,
the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejections may be based on a determination that &#8220;plans for
meeting the upcoming Basel III capital standards were not
robust,&#8221; the Fed said. Requested increases may also have been
rejected if &#8220;the amount of the proposed distribution would
weaken the firm&#8217;s ability to weather adverse economic
conditions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the biggest U.S. lender, didn&#8217;t
request approval for a second-quarter increase, said Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
company, in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will &#8220;resubmit a proposal for a modest dividend
increase in the second half of this year,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. bank, said today
that it still expects to return capital to shareholders next
year. Morgan Stanley (MS) said it will proceed with plans to purchase
the portion of the Smith Barney brokerage business it doesn&#8217;t
already own after regulators reviewed its financial strength. Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) said it will maintain its quarterly
dividend of 5 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions, MetLife &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions Financial Corp., Alabama&#8217;s largest lender, said it
planned no immediate capital actions and intends to repay its
bailout &#8220;in a prudent manner on shareholder-friendly terms.&#8221;
Regions was one of only two stocks in the bank index to decline
today, dropping 3.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer, said it is too
early to discuss possible capital distribution after the Fed
reviewed the company&#8217;s financial strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our capital distribution activity typically occurs later
in the year,&#8221; said John Calagna, a spokesman for the New York-
based company, in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife, which didn&#8217;t take U.S. Treasury Department bailout
funds, is overseen by the Fed because the company has a banking
unit that gathers deposits and makes home loans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allergan Inc., Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS)
and Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) are among companies that have at
least a 30 percent chance of being sold in the next 12 months,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of 33 companies also comprises Sara Lee Corp. (SLE), Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALXN) and Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC),
Goldman Sachs including Robert Boroujerdi said in a research
note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broader group of potential takeover targets, which
Goldman Sachs created in October 2009 and updates periodically,
returned 51 percent since inception, compared with 19 percent
for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A combination of solid GDP growth, improving equity
sentiment and CEO confidence bodes well for a continued pickup&#8221;
in mergers and acquisitions, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing corporate cash balances and unspent private-equity
funds will also contribute to more mergers and acquisitions,
benefiting advisory firms such as Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) and
buyout fund managers such as Blackstone Group LP (BX), Goldman Sachs
said. Global MA activity jumped 27 percent to $2.23 trillion in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan is a specialty health-care company based in Irvine, California. Citrix, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
is among 14 companies Goldman Sachs had on its original October
2009 list of top takeover targets, saying that the companies had
a 30 to 50 percent chance of MA activity. All of those
companies remain independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Lear Corp. (LEA) and AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS) are among the top
candidates for a leveraged buyout, Goldman Sachs said, based on
a separate model that calculates the potential internal rate of
return that a private-equity buyer could expect to realize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the list of the 33 companies that Goldman Sachs
analysts said have at least a 30 percent chance of being sold in
the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
pay $10 million to settle U.S. regulators&#8217; accusations that it
gave cash and gifts to Chinese and South Korean officials in
connection with about $54 million in government contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, will
pay $5.3 million in disgorgement, $2.7 million in interest and a
penalty of $2 million to settle a lawsuit filed today by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington federal court,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged the bribes, which included travel and
entertainment, occurred from 1998 through 2009 in violation of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Deficient internal controls allowed employees of IBM&#8217;s
subsidiaries and joint venture to use local business partners
and travel agencies as conduits for bribes or other improper
payments to South Korean and Chinese government officials over
long periods of time,&#8221; the SEC said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improper payments were made by employees at three
subsidiaries of Armonk, New York-based IBM, as well as LG IBM PC
Co., a joint venture between the company and LG Electronics
Inc., according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said cash payments to South Korean officials from
1998 to 2003 totaled $207,000. The payments were connected to
contracts worth almost $54 million, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bags of Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the money paid to Korean officials was delivered in
shopping bags at specific drop-off locations, such as restaurant
or apartment parking lots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, the IBM employees created &#8220;slush funds&#8221; at
local travel agencies that were used to pay for overseas
excursions by Chinese government officials. IBM employees also
gave gifts, such as cameras and laptop computers, to Chinese
government officials, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The misconduct in China involved several key IBM-China
employees and more than 100 IBM China employees overall,&#8221; the
SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC lawsuit doesn&#8217;t say what IBM received from China in
return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM insists on the highest ethical standards in the
conduct of its business and requires all employees to follow its
policies and procedures for conducting business,&#8221; Doug Shelton,
an IBM spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement agreement, filed in court today, was signed
by IBM&#8217;s general counsel on Jan. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Insurance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM agreed in the settlement, which requires approval from
a federal judge, not to pay the monetary penalties from any
insurance policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on whether there&#8217;s a criminal investigation of the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM expects that revenue from geographic growth markets,
including China and South Korea, will be about 30 percent of
total sales in 2015, up from 21 percent last year, according to
company executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. International Business Machines Corp.,
11-cv-00563, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will pay $5.65 billion to
redeem preferred stock sold to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) at the depth of the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase includes a 10 percent premium on Buffett&#8217;s
original $5 billion investment, a $125 million first-quarter
dividend, and $24 million in accelerated dividends, said Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for the New York-based company. The
redemption will cut first-quarter earnings per share by $2.84,
the bank said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s 2008 investment in Goldman Sachs was
a major vote of confidence in our firm and we are very
appreciative of it,&#8221; Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been awaiting Federal Reserve approval to
buy back Buffett&#8217;s investment, which gave him $500 million a
year in dividends. In his annual letter to shareholders last
month, Buffett said he expected the regulator &#8220;will likely give
Goldman the green light before long.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve also approved a plan for Goldman Sachs
to buy back company stock and potentially increase the common
stock dividend, the firm said in today&#8217;s statement. Cohen
declined to comment on the buyback or dividend plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International
AG, the lender nationalized by Austria in 2009, has hired
JPMorgan Chase  Co. to find a buyer for its domestic unit,
three people with knowledge of the process said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been informal talks with potential bidders, said
two of the people, who declined to be identified because the
information isn&#8217;t public. The lender&#8217;s board has started to
evaluate a possible sale of its Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank AG unit,
Dominic Koefner, a spokesman for Hypo Alpe, said by phone today
from Klagenfurt, Austria. A decision hasn&#8217;t been made, Koefner
said. He declined to comment on JPMorgan being hired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypo Alpe&#8217;s domestic unit has about 6.7 billion euros ($9.5
billion) of assets, or 16 percent of the group&#8217;s total,
according to a report for the first half of 2010. Its net loss
more than doubled to 65 million euros in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria nationalized Hypo Alpe in December 2009 to avert
the bank&#8217;s collapse after bad debts increased during the
financial crisis and former owners, including Bayerische
Landesbank, withdrew their support. Chief Executive Officer
Gottwald Kranebitter said on Jan. 28 that he expected most of
the bank&#8217;s assets to be privatized by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London, didn&#8217;t
have an immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypo Alpe has started sales negotiations with four Austrian
banks, Kleine Zeitung newspaper reported today, without saying
where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern European Units &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit Bank Austria AG, the nation&#8217;s biggest bank, would
consider buying the Hypo Alpe&#8217;s unit, according to spokesman
Martin Halama. Peter Thier, a spokesman for Erste Group Bank
AG&#8217;s Austrian unit, declined to comment. Raiffeisenlandesbank
Kaernten isn&#8217;t interested, said Albin Aspernig, a spokesman for
the bank in Klagenfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypo Alpe is winding down its business, mostly consisting
of leasing, in countries including Ukraine, Bulgaria and
Macedonia. It will also sell its Italian leasing unit,
Kranebitter has said. The lender&#8217;s units in Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Hercegovina should be sold as a whole,
according to the CEO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and U.S.
law firms are luring lawyers away from the U.K. fraud prosecutor
as companies prepare to comply with the world&#8217;s &#8220;most
draconian&#8221; anti-bribery law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Ministry of Justice has said it will introduce new
proposals as soon as next week, leaving companies scrambling to
hire lawyers to help prepare compliance plans. Under the law,
U.K. companies without adequate controls to prevent corruption
may be prosecuted if a bribe is paid by third parties on their
behalf anywhere in the world, even if officials didn&#8217;t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwadjo Adjepong, who worked on the Serious Fraud Office&#8217;s
probe into the collapse of London hedge fund Weavering Capital,
joined Goldman Sachs as a vice president in its compliance
department last month, SFO spokesman David Jones said. Covington
 Burling LLP, White  Case LLP and Arnold  Porter LLP have
also hired lawyers from the SFO as the Bribery Act creates work
for firms preparing compliance plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a real thirst for knowledge on the Bribery Act,
a thirst for having the right kind of advice from someone who&#8217;s
been on the other side,&#8221; said Robert Amaee, the former head of
anti-corruption at the SFO who joined Washington-based Covington
 Burling, in January. &#8220;A good deal of my time is spent in
helping clients understand the Bribery Act.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington-based Arnold  Porter in February said it hired
Kathleen Harris, the former head of the SFO fraud business
group, as a partner in its London office. Charlie Monteith, a
senior policy adviser and the head of assurance at the agency,
left for New York-based White  Case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skadden Arps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another former SFO prosecutor, Matthew Cowie, who oversaw
an investigation of BAE Systems Plc, left in June to join the
U.S. law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Justice may weaken some parts of the law
initially put forward by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#8217;s
Labour government last year, SFO officials said. The proposal
was criticized over clauses that would have classified fancy
dinners or sports tickets for foreign officials as bribes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chris Walker, the SFO policy chief, told a defense industry
conference in January that the revised law may allow a company
to fund a factory visit and hospitality for a public official. A
month&#8217;s stay on a private yacht after the trip would &#8220;raise red
flags,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British business groups pressed the ministry to make the
law more business-friendly and clarify provisions that may be
too vague to defend in a prosecution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fuzzy Edges&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Bligh, a policy adviser at the Confederation of British
Industry, said the Justice Ministry should clarify rules on
corporate hospitality and how much due diligence a company must
conduct on its suppliers, affiliates and joint ventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of fuzzy edges,&#8221; Bligh said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
to know what people are going to prosecute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said that the act would allow prosecutors to
charge U.K. companies and foreign firms which carry &#8220;on a
business or part of a business in the U.K.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mere fact that a company is listed for London Stock
Exchange purposes may not, in itself, be enough to amount to
carrying on a business or part of a business in the U.K.,&#8221; the
ministry said in a statement. &#8220;It will always be for the courts
to decide in individual cases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SFO Probes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFO, which prosecutes white-collar crime, is
investigating allegations of overseas bribery at companies
including Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s DePuy International unit and at
Alstom SA&#8217;s U.K. division. Last month, KBR Inc.&#8217;s M.W. Kellogg
Ltd. subsidiary agreed to pay 7 million pounds ($11 million) to
the SFO to end a four-year probe into bribes paid to Nigerian
officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFO&#8217;s budget continues to shrink. Since Richard Alderman, the agency&#8217;s director, took the post in 2008, the
government has cut its operating budget to about 34 million
pounds ($55 million) from 52 million pounds, according to the
SFO&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivian Robinson, the SFO&#8217;s general counsel, who has called
the new law one of the most world&#8217;s &#8220;most draconian,&#8221; said
earlier this month that the agency would take a &#8220;common-sense&#8221;
approach to policing hospitality functions at sporting events
like Wimbledon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance may also allow &#8220;facilitation payments&#8221; made
to foreign officials to expedite a routine procedure in some
circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;paramount question&#8221; regarding facilitation payments
is whether a prosecution is &#8220;in the public interest,&#8221; Robinson
said at a conference organized by the Clyde  Co. law firm this
month in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFO might not be the agency to enforce the law. Under
separate government proposals, it may be split up, with its
lawyers joining the Crown Prosecution Service and investigators
becoming part of a National Crime Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will always be a prosecutor, it doesn&#8217;t really make
a difference at this stage,&#8221; Bligh said. &#8220;The crucial thing is
that the right guidance comes out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) flared gases at

&lt;p&gt;A report filed with the National Response Center showed the

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said there would be no ground invasion of Libya to take on
Muammar Qaddafi&#8217;s forces &#8220;at the moment,&#8221; holding open the
possibility of deploying troops in some capacity in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There can&#8217;t be an occupation force,&#8221; Hague told Sky News
in London today. &#8220;That means you can&#8217;t have a ground invasion
of Libya. It doesn&#8217;t exclude every possible type of operation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question of ground forces being involved &#8220;at
the moment,&#8221; Hague said. &#8220;None of the countries involved in
this operation are envisaging a ground invasion of Libya --
let&#8217;s make that clear.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurofighter Typhoons and Tornados will move to a station in
southern Italy, Defense Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC&#8217;s
Politics Show in London today, after British Royal Air Force
Tornadoes flew a 3,000-mile, eight-hour mission to carry out a
bombing raid on Libyan targets. That was the longest single
mission since the Falklands War in 1982, Air Vice Chief Marshall
Phil Osborn told reporters in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, a U.K. Royal Navy Trafalgar Class submarine and
U.S. submarines fired more than 110 Tomahawk missiles at Libyan
targets. The U.K. attacks targeted Qaddafi&#8217;s air force assets in
the area surrounding the Libyan capital Tripoli, Osborn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Warships &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. also has two warships, HMS Westminster, with HMS
Cumberland as backup, positioned off the coast of Libya. The
government&#8217;s emergency response committee, COBRA, will meet
later today, Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s spokeswoman Vickie Sheriff said in a telephone interview. Aircraft will be
redeployed to Italy because the U.K.&#8217;s sovereign military base
in Cyprus is too far east of Libya for effective operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western allies, under the command of the U.S., are
currently concentrating on enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in
line with the United Nation&#8217;s Security Council Resolution 1973. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne echoed Hague&#8217;s
choice of words in saying that the U.K. is not considering
committing ground troops to the conflict for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not considering ground forces at the moment,&#8221;
Osborne told the BBC&#8217;s Andrew Marr Show today, saying the UN
resolution didn&#8217;t permit it. &#8220;We are undertaking operations
from our navy, through the submarine-launched cruise missiles,
from the RAF and the Tornado planes that flew missions last
night.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Too Early&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a news conference in London today, the Chief of Defense
Staff&#8217;s Strategic Communications Officer Major General John
Lorimer said that &#8220;it is too early to say what the impact has
been on the ground,&#8221; of last night&#8217;s operations. He also
declined to set out timings for an exit strategy for allied
forces. &#8220;We will see this one through for as long as it needs
to be done,&#8221; he told reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked to assess the strength of Qaddafi&#8217;s air forces, Air
Vice Chief Marshall Phil Osborn, speaking at the same news
conference as Lorimer, said &#8220;there is a threat and we have to
be aware there may remain a threat.&#8221; He added that &#8220;in no way
would we expect&#8221; Qaddafi&#8217;s &#8220;capability to match ours.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox said he expects Arab participation in the military
campaign to take place within &#8220;the next couple of days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hope that we will see the first of the Arab nations
participating and sending assets into the area,&#8221; Fox told the BBC&#8217;s Politics Show. &#8220;I spoke this morning to some of the
leaders of the Arab countries who said that they might be
involved and got a very warm response, and I hope that that will
come apparent. They themselves want to make the announcements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hunker Down&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priority of the coalition forces is to stop Qaddafi
&#8220;brutalizing&#8221; his own people, not to implement &#8220;regime
change,&#8221; Fox said. The Libyan leader could well &#8220;hunker down&#8221;
and remain in the country, he said. &#8220;Our aim is to paralyze the
regime&#8217;s capability; to control the military, which they&#8217;ve been
using to terrorize their own population,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a difference between someone being a legitimate
target and whether you would go ahead with targeting,&#8221; Fox
said. &#8220;You would have to take into account what might happen to
civilians in the area; what might happen in terms of collateral
damage. We don&#8217;t simply go in with a gung-ho attitude and start
firing off missiles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duration of the military campaign, codenamed operation
&#8220;Odyssey Dawn&#8221; by the U.S., depends upon &#8220;how quickly Qaddafi
recognizes the game is up&#8221; Fox said. &#8220;It also is dependent on
how quickly we can deny to him to use his military against the
civilian population.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qaddafi&#8217;s regime &#8220;may remain in existence,&#8221; Fox said.
&#8220;Whether it remains in power is a very different issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. (CVX) had a partial
shutdown for a planned maintenance at the Pembroke oil refinery
in Wales that it sold to Valero Energy Corp. (VLO), potentially
limiting supplies of fuels at a time of rising prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shutdown "is currently ongoing," Paul Bray, a London-
based Chevron spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement.
"This partial shutdown will not impact Chevron&#8217;s ability to
fulfill its supply contracts." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refiners are required to halt processing units periodically
to carry out repairs and inspections to ensure safe and
efficient operations. The Pembroke refinery can process 210,000
barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline prices in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp, Europe&#8217;s
oil-trading hub, rose 15 percent this year amid increasing oil
costs and maintenance halts. The fuel climbed to $947 a metric
ton on March 18 from $906 on March 16, Bloomberg data shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron agreed to sell the Pembroke plant and 1,000 retail
outlets to Valero, the largest U.S. oil refiner, for about $1.73
billion in cash, the companies said on March 11. Chevron is
based in San Ramon, California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Zimbabwe will prosecute or close
local operations of the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and other foreign and
white-owned businesses because they have not submitted plans to
cede a majority of their shares to black citizens, the state-
controlled Herald said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies may face immediate closure and the revocation
of their business licenses, the Harare-based Herald said on its
website, citing Prince Mupazviriho, secretary for the
indigenization ministry. About 795 foreign and white-owned
businesses, including Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed Innscor
Africa Ltd. (INAF), have not submitted plans specifying how they will
divest 51 percent of their shares to black Zimbabweans, the
newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe&#8217;s Indigenization and Empowerment Act, passed last
year, compels white Zimbabweans and foreign-owned companies
worth more than $500,000 to cede 51 percent stakes to black
citizens of the southern African country. Business owners may be
jailed for not complying, according to the Herald. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised its forecast
for Argentina&#8217;s economic growth in 2011 after the economy
expanded last year at the fastest pace since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs economist Alberto Ramos raised his gross
domestic product expansion estimate to 6.8 percent from a
previous 5.6 percent, according to an e-mail statement. Still,
he expects a &#8220;significant slowdown&#8221; in the second half of
2011, and maintained his 2012 growth forecast of 3.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South America&#8217;s second-biggest economy expanded for an
eighth consecutive year in 2010, growing 9.2 percent. The
country&#8217;s recovery from 0.9 percent expansion in 2009 was fueled
by commodity prices and by external demand, mainly from Brazil,
for manufactured and industrial goods, Ramos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramos forecast that prices will rise by more than 25
percent this year. Even so, the government is unlikely to take
steps to rein in inflation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The paramount policy objective appears to be to maximize
growth ahead of the elections, even if such a strategy proves
unsustainable and thereby self-defeating over the medium term,&#8221;
said New York-based Ramos in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will allow the peso to depreciate gradually
until the October presidential elections as it tries to prevent
a further escalation of inflationary pressures, said Ramos, who
estimated the peso will lose 8 percent to 10 percent of its
value over the whole of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting appreciation of the real exchange rate means
that &#8220;beyond entrenched high inflation, the erosion of external
competitiveness is another thorny issue the next administration
will have to face, which, if not handled properly could end up
generating a crash, rather than a soft-landing of the economy in
2012,&#8221; said Ramos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso, which last year fell 4.5 percent, the most among
Latin America&#8217;s major currencies, was little changed as of 4:22
p.m. New York time at 4.0366 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

Mider and Brett Foley" date="Mar 21, 2011  3:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-21/jpmorgan-beats-goldman-sachs-in-finding-t-mobile-transaction.html"><headline>JPMorgan Widens M&amp;amp;A Lead Over Goldman Sachs With $39 Billion T-Mobile Deal</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) extended its
market-share lead over Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in mergers
advice after ATT Inc. (T) beat out Sprint Nextel Corp. to buy Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s U.S. wireless unit for $39 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already first in Bloomberg&#8217;s ranking of advisers by dollar
value of transactions announced since Jan. 1, JPMorgan&#8217;s role
with ATT on the T-Mobile USA deal boosted the New York-based
bank&#8217;s tally to $159 billion. Goldman Sachs, which advised
Sprint Nextel in talks with T-Mobile, dropped to third with
$96.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ranks are important,&#8221; said Neal Stoughton, a professor
of financial services at the University of New South Wales in
Sydney. &#8220;If you hire an adviser, you&#8217;re seeking someone who can
have success. JPMorgan is competing very aggressively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is a sign of life for dealmaking in the
telecommunications industry, where the more than $500 billion of
takeovers struck in both 1999 and 2000 were followed by a decade
with an average of $175 billion a year, Bloomberg data show.
Telecom deals made up 8 percent of the merger market last year,
compared with 18 percent in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan stands to earn fees of about $20 million from
committing to provide ATT a $20 billion, one-year unsecured
loan as part of the transaction, according to estimates by New
York-based research firm Freeman Consulting. The loan-
arrangement fee could become &#8220;significantly higher&#8221; if ATT&#8217;s
credit rating is negatively affected by the deal, said Freeman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan Fee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeman estimates ATT may also pay fees of as much as $65
million to its three advisers: JPMorgan and boutique advisory
firms Greenhill  Co. and Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Greenhill&#8217;s team included founder Robert Greenhill, Gil Ha and Lawrence Chu. The JPMorgan bankers were
Andy O&#8217;Brien, James Woolery, Kurt Simon, Anwar Zakkour and
Thomas Cassin. Evercore&#8217;s team included founder Roger Altman,
Eduardo Mestre and Dan Mendelow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s advisers, Morgan Stanley (MS), Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), may earn as much as $60 million
in advisory fees, according to Freeman. The transaction helped
Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s lead banker, overtake Goldman
Sachs to win the No. 2 spot in Bloomberg&#8217;s merger league tables
since Dec. 31, with $135 billion of transactions, Bloomberg data
show. Morgan Stanley garnered the top spot in global MA
advisory in 2009 and 2010, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley bankers advising Deutsche Telekom included
Jean Abergel and Dirk Notheis in Europe and Robert Eatroff, Adam Shepard and James Murray in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s team was led by Armin von Falkenhayn and
Philipp Meier-Scherling in Europe and David Pearson and Don
Birchenough in the U.S. Credit Suisse bankers included Luigi de Vecchi, Jeff Murphy and Ken Oliver Fritz in Europe and John Trousdale and Mark Simonian in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, held the top spot in
global MA advisory every year from 2001 to 2008, Bloomberg data
show. Connie Ling, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding transfers of government assets, the ATT deal is
the largest takeover proposed anywhere in the world since BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company, offered $40
billion for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan last August. BHP&#8217;s bid
was blocked by the Canadian government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) hired Richard Sherlund, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) software analyst and
Galleon Group LLC money manager, as the New York-based head of
research for U.S. technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherlund, 56, will join the U.S. unit of Japan&#8217;s biggest
brokerage as a managing director, according to a statement from
the Tokyo-based brokerage. He was most recently chief executive
officer of New York-based Ketchem Creek Capital Management LP,
which invests in technology companies, the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tech is one of the hottest areas right now,&#8221; Jeanne Branthover, a managing director at Boyden Global Executive
Search in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s an area of extreme growth and every
single company is focused on it, so the people that do what he
does are more in demand than ever.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura has expanded its workforce in the Americas to 2,300
from 1,800 since 2009 and said last year that it plans to offer
research for 600 companies in the U.S. in a bid to boost revenue
from the world&#8217;s biggest equity market. Nomura got 11 percent of
revenue from the Americas in the fiscal year ended in March
2010, almost double the 5.7 percent share the year before,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura hired Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Ciaran O&#8217;Kelly in July
2009 as head of equities for the Americas and Bank of America&#8217;s
Michael Rietbrock as head of U.S. equity research in March 2010.
Sherlund will report to Rietbrock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top Ranking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherlund, the top-ranked software analyst by Institutional
Investor magazine from 1989 through 2005, left Goldman Sachs in
2007 after 25 years to become a manager of technology stocks at
Galleon, which is now at the center of the largest crackdown on
hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. He left Galleon in
2008, HFMWeek said that year. Sherlund declined to comment on
his employment at Galleon, according to Jonathan Hodgkinson, a
Nomura spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketchem Creek is closing, HFMWeek said last week, citing
sources familiar with the company who it didn&#8217;t name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon&#8217;s co-founder, was arrested for
insider trading in 2009 and is on trial in Manhattan federal
court. The Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of making
$45 million from tips leaked by corporate insiders and hedge
fund traders. He says his trades were based on legitimate
research and denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherlund, the analyst assigned by Goldman to follow
Microsoft when the investment bank managed the software maker
initial public offering 25 years ago, enjoyed unique access to
co-founder Bill Gates. Gates regularly invited Sherlund for one-
on-one dinners during the analyst&#8217;s early years of coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rick&#8217;s the axe on Microsoft,&#8221; money manager Philip Orlando said in an April 2000 interview. Orlando is now the New
York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors
Inc., which manages $341.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherlund spends summers prospecting for gold in Alaska, the
Wall Street Journal reported in November 2007. The annual ritual
takes him to Fairbanks, Alaska, and then on a three-hour drive
on a gravel road to Ketchem Creek, where he and his father,
stepmother, brother and nephews help dig for gold while his wife
and sons relax at Nantucket, the Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will stop
offering debit-card rewards for almost all of its customers in
July to reduce losses from a proposed cap on interchange fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is mailing letters to customers announcing the
change, said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the bank. New York-based
JPMorgan said in November it would end rewards for new customers
in February, while keeping programs for existing clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Congress recently enacted a new law known as the Durbin
Amendment that significantly impacts debit cards,&#8221; said one of
the company&#8217;s letters to customers. &#8220;As a result of this law,
we will be changing our debit rewards program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Durbin Amendment is part of the Dodd-Frank Act
financial overhaul enacted last year, that caps debit-card swipe
fees to help merchants who said they were powerless to negotiate
rates with payment networks Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) The
Federal Reserve has until April to decide what the cap will be
before being implemented July 21, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed proposed capping debit-interchange fees at a flat
12 cents a transaction in December, compared with the current
formula that averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price or
about 44 cents. Such a cap would cost JPMorgan, the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets behind Bank of America Corp. (BAC), about
$1.3 billion in lost revenue annually, according to a Feb. 15
investor presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers will continue to earn rewards through July 19,
and points accrued through that date will not expire, according
to the letter. Debit cards with annual fees won&#8217;t be assessed as
of July, Kelly said. The bank&#8217;s credit-card rewards programs
will not be affected, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Lobbying &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks lobbied against the proposed cap on debit
interchange, which generated about $16 billion in revenue for
the industry in 2009, according to the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, is the chief
sponsor of a bill that would delay the rule for two years.
Representative Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia
Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services
subcommittee on financial institutions, introduced a similar
measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not clear whether a two-year delay on the cap would
change the company&#8217;s plans, Kelly said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s move was reported March 20 by American Banker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will continue making
principal investments with the firm&#8217;s own money because
executives don&#8217;t think the so-called Volcker rule prevents the
practice, a Bank of America Corp. analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyst, Guy Moszkowski, published a note to investors
today after meeting last week with four Goldman Sachs executives
in Hong Kong. New York-based Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t think U.S.
legislation passed last year that bans proprietary trading and
limits holdings in hedge funds and private-equity funds
precludes buying stakes in companies and other assets,
Moszkowski wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market interpretation of Volcker rules is that this
will be off-limits ahead, but GS believes that many such
investments will remain permissible, and will be closing on a
&#8216;meaningful&#8217; one in China shortly,&#8221; Moszkowski&#8217;s note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 11, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission
approved AXA Life Ltd.&#8217;s sale of a stake in Taikang Life
Insurance Co. to buyers including Goldman Sachs, according to a
statement on the Chinese regulator&#8217;s website. Goldman will get a
12.02 percent stake in Taikang Life Insurance, the statement
said. The value of the stake hasn&#8217;t been disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. nuclear regulators will meet
in public this week to discuss the reactor crisis in Japan as
President Barack Obama seeks a review of safety at domestic
atomic plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-member U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission plans a
briefing today on the &#8220;NRC response to recent nuclear events in
Japan,&#8221; according to a notice posted March 18 on the agency&#8217;s
website. Commissioners will meet at 9 a.m. at the agency&#8217;s
headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, north of downtown
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is seeking to avert a meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi plant, which was damaged in the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama said March 17 he asked for a &#8220;comprehensive review&#8221;
by the NRC of safety at U.S. reactors as more is learned about
the stricken plant in Japan. U.S. plants already have undergone
&#8220;exhaustive study&#8221; and been &#8220;declared safe for any number of
extreme contingencies,&#8221; he said. The NRC has a yearly budget of
about $1 billion and employs about 4,000 people, according to
the agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NRC has sent officials to Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study Shows Too-Big-To-Fail U.S. Banks Grew After Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks have grown larger since the
financial crisis, and the number of &#8220;too-big-to-fail&#8221; banks
will increase by 40 percent during the next 15 years, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank law would prohibit the largest banks from
merging with one another. The law would not prevent the largest
banks from growing in other ways, according to the Bloomberg
Government Study, &#8220;Too-Big-to-Fail Banks Get Bigger After Dodd-
Frank.&#8221; Bloomberg&#8217;s Lizzie O&#8217;Leary reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merger Fees Should Be Published, U.K. Takeover Panel Proposes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. merger regulator proposed changes to its rules
that would seek to protect takeover targets from protracted bid
periods and to make deal fees public to increase transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. merger rules should be altered to give takeover
targets more control during deals, the Takeover Panel said in a
statement today. The regulator also said that a buyer&#8217;s
financial information and the financing of a bid should be
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel started a review of the nation&#8217;s takeover law
last year after Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)&#8217;s acquisition of Cadbury Plc
provoked an outcry from politicians. In October, the regulator
said it had concluded that the rules should be altered to reduce
the &#8220;tactical advantage&#8221; of hostile bidders for U.K.
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based regulator also proposed banning measures
in most circumstances that reduce the likelihood of a successful
counterbid, such as so-called inducement fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Amends Credit-Card Rules on Income Requirements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve approved a rule that would require
credit-card issuers to consider consumers&#8217; individual incomes
before extending credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-card applications generally can&#8217;t request
&#8220;household income&#8221; because that term is too vague for issuers
to evaluate whether customers will be able to make the required
payments on the accounts, according to a statement from the Fed
March 18. The rule is needed to prevent making credit available
to consumers who lack the ability to pay, the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change is supposed to limit issuers from giving cards
to college students, yet some lawmakers have been concerned that
stay-at-home spouses will suffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Card issuers can allow spouses to apply jointly for credit,
the Fed said. The Fed also specified that promotional programs
that waive interest charges for a specific period of time are
subject to the same protections as reduced rate programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application fees that a consumer is required to pay are
also covered by rules that apply to overall fees charged during
the first year after the account is opened, the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Was Told About Madoff &#8216;Fraud Risks&#8217; in Two KPMG Reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Europe&#8217;s biggest lender, was warned
twice by auditors that entrusting as much as $8 billion in
client funds to Bernard Madoff opened it up to &#8220;fraud and
operational risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPMG LLP told the London-based bank about the risks in 2006
and 2008 reports. The firm was hired to review how Madoff
invested and accounted for the funds, for which HSBC served as
custodian. KPMG reported 25 such risks in 2006, and in 2008
found 28, according to copies of the reports obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving H. Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC, sued HSBC and a dozen feeder funds
for $9 billion in December in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. The suit was partly based on the KPMG reports and
alleges the bank knew of concerns Madoff&#8217;s business was a fraud
and didn&#8217;t protect investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the reports, KPMG didn&#8217;t present evidence the risks it
identified had materialized or that it found signs of actual
fraud, and said HSBC had told the firm &#8220;no allegations of fraud
or misconduct have been raised.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Spokesman Patrick Humphris, KPMG spokesman Mark
Hamilton and Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard&#8217;s lawyers
Baker  Hostetler LLP, all declined to confirm the authenticity
of the reports obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fed Says Banks Can Restart Dividends After Stress Tests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve said some of the 19 largest U.S. banks
will be able to restart dividend payments, buy back shares or
repay government capital after &#8220;significant improvement&#8221; in
their capital positions and the economy. Peter Cook reported on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Plans Trader Profiles in CrossFinder Dark Pool &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) will begin a program next month to
categorize customers of its dark pool based on trading
strategies, part of an effort to help them restrict who they do
business with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Larry Tabb, founder of New York-based Tabb Group LLC, said
a challenge faced by asset managers is lack of information about
who they are trading against. &#8220;This is the next step. Credit
Suisse is trying to give clients more flexibility and
information on whether other clients are minnows, tuna or sharks
so they can decide whether to trade with them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zurich-based broker created a methodology to give
clients more information about their own transactions and what
types of counterparties they may be interacting with in dark
pools. The broker will divide clients of its electronic trading
unit into three groups based on a short-term profile of their
trading, said Robert Maher, a London-based managing director and
head of sales for Credit Suisse&#8217;s advanced execution services.
The data will be used to allow clients to avoid executions with
firms whose profiles are different from their own, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark pools, private platforms that allow stock trades
without displaying bids and offers, have grown to handle more
than 12 percent of U.S. equity volume, according to Rosenblatt
Securities Inc. The expansion has raised questions among
investment managers about who&#8217;s on the other side of their
transactions after the explosion of high-frequency trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Allows CO2 Registries in Four Countries to Reopen March 21 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union allowed carbon registries in Finland,
Romania, Slovenia and Sweden to reopen on March 21, lifting a
suspension imposed after computer-hacking attacks in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four registries got approval to resume after they
demonstrated that their systems are secure, the European
Commission, the EU regulator, said in a statement March 18. The
decision means that 19 out of 30 national registries in the
region will be fully operational as of this week, and their
users will have access to all transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission shut all registries in the European
emissions-trading system, the world&#8217;s largest, on Jan. 19
following a series of computer-hacking attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the suspension period, registries can&#8217;t record
transactions except for the surrender and allocation of permits,
effectively blocking spot trading. The closures didn&#8217;t affect
trading of carbon futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four registries will resume normal operations at 8 a.m.
today, the commission said March 18. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Fined by French Privacy Agency Over Street View &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Google Inc. (GOOG) was fined a record 100,000 euros ($142,000) for
violations of French privacy rules by its Street View mapping
service, the country&#8217;s data protection regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s infractions included collecting passwords and e-
mails transferred wirelessly, the National Commission for
Computing and Civil Liberties said today in a statement on its
website. The fines are the highest the authority, known as CNIL,
has levied, according to the agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has been targeted by data-protection authorities in
the European Union for its Street View program, which lets users
click on maps to see photographs of roadsides. The European
Commission, the EU&#8217;s executive agency, plans stricter and more
harmonized data-protection rules across the 27-nation region.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission closed a probe in October
after Mountain View, California-based Google said it would
improve its safeguards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is &#8220;profoundly sorry for having mistakenly
collected payload data from unencrypted WiFi networks,&#8221; said
Peter Fleischer, the company&#8217;s global privacy counsel, in an e-
mailed statement. The company stopped collecting the data after
it realized what happened and it contacted the authorities, he
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai Censures Saxo Bank for Breaching Money-Laundering Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dubai Financial Services Authority, the regulator of
the Dubai International Financial Center business park, censured
Saxo Bank Dubai Ltd. for breaching anti-money laundering rules
and systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &#8220;increased the risk of Saxo Bank&#8217;s DIFC business
being used for the purposes of money laundering,&#8221; the Authority
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &#8220;However, the DFSA
found no evidence of any money laundering having taken place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxo Bank A/S admitted it had breached rules relating to
taking on clients and DFSA&#8217;s anti-money laundering systems by
failing to obtain sufficient and satisfactory verification of
clients&#8217; identities, permanent addresses and sources of wealth,
and performing ongoing due diligence on clients, according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Danish provider of online currency and derivative and
equity trading also failed to adequately monitor client
transactions and to establish and maintain appropriate controls
in relation to politically exposed persons, DFSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Said to Pay $10 Million to Settle SEC Bribery Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) agreed to pay $10
million to settle accusations by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that it gave cash and gifts to Chinese and
South Korean officials in exchange for computer contracts,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will pay $5.3 million in disgorgement, $2.7
million in interest and a penalty of $2 million to settle a
lawsuit filed March 18 in federal court in Washington. The SEC
alleged the bribes, which included travel and entertainment,
occurred from 1998 through 2009 in violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Ed Barbini said he couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment on the lawsuit or settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. International Business Machines Corp.,
11-cv-00563, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta Sues SEC, Says Insider Case Deprives Him of Rights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Director Rajat Gupta sued the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, claiming an
administrative action for insider trading it filed bars him from
a jury trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 62, said the SEC should have filed a lawsuit in
federal court instead. He denied the agency&#8217;s claims that he
gave tips to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed the action March 1, alleging Gupta tipped the
hedge fund manager about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)&#8217;s $5 billion
investment in Goldman Sachs, about the New York-based bank&#8217;s
quarterly earnings and earnings at Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), where
Gupta was also a director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gupta denies all allegations of wrongdoing and stands
ready to mount a defense against each and every one of the
commission&#8217;s charges,&#8221; his lawyer, Gary Naftalis, said in the
complaint filed March 18 in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In filing his lawsuit, Gupta seeks a jury trial, to have
the SEC barred from seeking civil penalties against him and a
court order keeping it from pursuing administrative claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under SEC rules, Gupta isn&#8217;t allowed a jury trial in an
administrative action, or the right to use federal court rules
on discovery, which require the exchange of evidence with the
government, Naftalis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Harmon, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to
immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Gupta v. SEC, 11-cv-1900, U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congo Asks China to Rule on U.S. Vulture Fund&#8217;s Hong Kong Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China must approve a U.S. investment fund&#8217;s lawsuit in Hong
Kong against the Democratic Republic of the Congo before it can
proceed, the central African country&#8217;s lawyers said in a
challenge to the Chinese region&#8217;s independent judiciary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FG Hemisphere Associates LLC, a New York-based so-called
vulture fund which buys distressed debt, has sued Congo in
jurisdictions around the world seeking to seize assets to
enforce two arbitration awards. In Hong Kong, its attempt to
collect payments owed to Congo by state-owned China Railway
Group Ltd. (601390) places the financial center&#8217;s judicial independence
at stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s foreign ministry has filed three letters to Hong
Kong&#8217;s judiciary in the case stating that no foreign government
can be sued in the city&#8217;s courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of Appeal in February 2010 allowed FG
Hemisphere&#8217;s lawsuit to proceed. Arbitrators in Zurich and Paris
had ruled that Congo must repay a total of $34.25 million to
Energoinvest d.d., an engineering company based in Sarajevo,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, for construction projects in the 1980s.
The debts, including interest, now amount to more than $100
million, according to the Hong Kong court judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from deciding whether the case should be referred to
the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress in
Beijing, Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of Final Appeal could rule directly
on whether Congo and other foreign states can be sued in Hong
Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five judges also may decide whether governments
relinquish any claims to sovereign immunity when they agree to
arbitrate a dispute. The hearing is scheduled to take six days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National People&#8217;s Congress last reinterpreted the
city&#8217;s constitution in 1999, overturning a Court of Final Appeal
ruling that gave almost 2 million mainland people the right to
live in Hong Kong. The reinterpretation, supported by Hong
Kong&#8217;s then Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, raised doubts about
the city&#8217;s judicial independence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECB&#8217;s Mersch Says This Bank Stress Test Is a &#8216;Serious One&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Central Bank council member Yves Mersch said this
year&#8217;s bank stress tests will be tougher than last year&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The next stress tests won&#8217;t be a test of the liquidity
but of the banks&#8217; solidity,&#8221; Mersch told reporters at a press
conference in Luxembourg today. The tests will be &#8220;more
severe&#8221; than the previous ones and &#8220;I hope that the markets
will accept that this stress test is a serious one,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union regulators have yet to agree on which banks
to test as part of annual examinations of capital, or what the
passing grade will be, a month before an April deadline for
disclosure of stress-test methodology. Last year&#8217;s stress tests
were criticized for not being stringent enough because lenders
in the 27-nation region were shown by regulators to need only
3.5 billion euros ($4.9 billion) of new capital, about a 10th of
the lowest analyst estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxley of Sarbanes-Oxley to Lobby for Financial Self-Regulator &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Oxley, the former congressman who co-wrote the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has registered as a lobbyist for the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to promote self-
regulation of investment advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxley, a partner at Baker Hostetler LLP in Washington,
registered this week as a Finra lobbyist, saying he would work
on securities regulation and the &#8220;harmonization of regulation
of broker-dealers and investment advisers,&#8221; according to his
registration form. Finra oversees about 4,560 brokerage firms
and is interested in expanding to investment advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra contends the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
should use a self-regulatory organization, or SRO, to take over
examinations of investment advisers from the agency. The
creation of such an SRO was suggested in an SEC study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxley, 67, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for
comment. Nancy Condon, a Finra spokeswoman, said the regulator
had no comment on Oxley&#8217;s hire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s name has been mentioned almost daily at the
criminal insider trading trial of Rajaratnam, which began March
8 in Manhattan. The hedge fund manager is accused of earning $45
million by using illegal tips from traders, corporate insiders,
and others including Gupta, the former worldwide director of
McKinsey  Co. Rajaratnam, 53, faces as many as 20 years in
prison if convicted on the most serious charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Was Told About Madoff &#8216;Fraud Risks&#8217; in Two KPMG Reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Europe&#8217;s biggest lender, was warned
twice by auditors that entrusting as much as $8 billion in
client funds to Bernard Madoff opened it up to &#8220;fraud and
operational risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPMG LLP told the London-based bank about the risks in 2006
and 2008 reports. The firm was hired to review how Madoff
invested and accounted for the funds, for which HSBC served as
custodian. KPMG reported 25 such risks in 2006, and in 2008
found 28, according to copies of the reports obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five &#8220;fraud and related operational risks were
identified throughout the process whereby Madoff LLC receive,
check and account for client funds,&#8221; KPMG said in the 56-page
report dated Feb. 16, 2006. The limited controls in place &#8220;may
not prevent fraud or error occurring on client accounts if
management or staff at Madoff LLC either override controls or
undertake activities where appropriate controls are not in
place,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 66-page KPMG report dated Sept. 8, 2008, cited 28 risks
and described them in the same words as the 2006 document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving H. Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC, sued HSBC and a dozen feeder funds
for $9 billion in December in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. The suit was partly based on the KPMG reports and
alleges the bank knew of concerns Madoff&#8217;s business was a fraud
and didn&#8217;t protect investors. KPMG&#8217;s reports haven&#8217;t been made
public. Picard has filed more than $50 billion in so-called
clawback suits to compensate victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC confirmed hiring KPMG in 2005 and 2008 to review
Madoff&#8217;s firm, adding it now believed Madoff had tricked the
auditors. &#8220;It appears from U.S. government filings that Madoff
and his employees foiled these reviews by, among other things,
providing forged documentation to KPMG,&#8221; the bank said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;KPMG did not conclude in either of its reports that a
fraud was being committed by Madoff,&#8221; HSBC said. &#8220;HSBC did not
know that a fraud was being committed and lost $1 billion of its
own assets as a victim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Spokesman Patrick Humphris, KPMG spokesman Mark
Hamilton and Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard&#8217;s lawyers
Baker  Hostetler LLP, all declined to confirm the authenticity
of the reports obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurd Letter in HP Lawsuit Must Be Unsealed, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) was ordered by a judge to release most
of a letter about Chairman Mark Hurd&#8217;s involvement with
contractor Jodie Fisher, the relationship that led to his
departure from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr. ruled
March 17 in Wilmington that Hurd hadn&#8217;t shown good cause why the
letter should be kept secret. HP has 10 days to file a mostly
public version of the letter, giving Hurd &#8220;ample time&#8221; to
appeal, Parsons said. Several narrow portions of the letter will
remain sealed, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether or not to seal a document allegedly containing
confidential information does not turn on whether its disclosure
would cause embarrassment,&#8221; Parsons said in the 70-page ruling
in a lawsuit by shareholder Ernesto Espinoza. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurd, 54, had argued that he should have a say in
Espinoza&#8217;s demand for company books and records because the
letter, sent by lawyer Gloria Allred on Fisher&#8217;s behalf, was
personal and his alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed with the court&#8217;s ruling and will
appeal the matter,&#8221; Hurd&#8217;s lawyer, Amy Wintersheimer, said in
an e-mailed statement.  &#8220;We believe the letter, which was
clearly marked &#8216;confidential,&#8217; should remain that way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurd is now a co-president of software maker Oracle Corp. (ORCL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurd resigned as HP&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer
on Aug. 6 after a company investigation determined that he
violated its standards of business conduct. Palo Alto,
California-based HP said it didn&#8217;t find that Hurd had violated
its sexual-harassment policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s decision to grant Hurd a severance package
valued at as much as $40 million prompted Espinoza to sue HP on
Nov. 18. In his sealed complaint, Espinoza seeks company books
and records as part of an investigation into possible wrongdoing
by directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Espinoza v. Hewlett-Packard Co., CA6000,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citic Pacific Must Give Police Lawyers&#8217; Letters, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citic Pacific Ltd., which delayed reporting a potential
HK$14.7 billion ($1.9 billion) loss, must turn over records of
legal advice to Hong Kong police it got before disclosing a
failed derivatives bet, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s Department of Justice said it suspects the
steelmaker and property developer defrauded four banks when it
sought financing without disclosing losses on currency bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a review of six documents being contested, &#8220;there
is a prima facie case of the existence of both a conspiracy to
defraud&#8221; and of directors or officers of the company making
false statements, Hong Kong High Court Judge Alan Wright said in
a ruling March 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citic Pacific&#8217;s wrong-way bets on the Australian dollar in
2008 prompted a bailout from its parent Citic Group, backed by China&#8217;s cabinet, and the resignation of its chairman Larry Yung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright dismissed Citic Pacific&#8217;s bid to block police access
to the documents and delayed implementing the order until April
1 to give the company an opportunity to file an appeal. False
statements made by officers or directors of a company with the
intent to deceive creditors carries a maximum sentence of 10
years in jail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citic Pacific is reviewing the judgment &#8220;and considering
its response,&#8221; the company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Shieh, a lawyer representing Citic Pacific, argued at
a hearing last week that the company could have had &#8220;entirely
proper, innocuous, and relevant considerations&#8221; in relation to
the delayed disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) and Secretary of Justice,
Commissioner of Police, HCMP 767/2010 in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of
First Instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christie&#8217;s Wins Dismissal of Koch&#8217;s Counterfeit Wine Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christie&#8217;s International Plc won dismissal of a lawsuit
filed by billionaire collector William Koch that claimed the
auction house &#8220;induced&#8221; him into buying counterfeit wine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed last year in Manhattan federal
court. Koch, who lives in Florida, claimed London-based
Christie&#8217;s has sold counterfeit wine &#8220;for many years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, in New York, on March 18
granted Christie&#8217;s motion to dismiss Koch&#8217;s suit, which included
claims of fraud, civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones said in her ruling that while Koch said he was
injured by Christie&#8217;s &#8220;misrepresentations,&#8221; she concluded he
also knew that the bottle &#8220;was counterfeit prior to making the
purchase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koch alleged in his suit that he bought a bottle of 1870
Lafite for $4,200 at a Christie&#8217;s auction in order to prove that
it was counterfeit. The judge rejected Koch&#8217;s arguments in his
lawsuit. Koch has filed lawsuits against others claiming they
sold him counterfeit wine that allegedly belonged to Thomas
Jefferson and was marked &#8220;Th.J.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Koch didn&#8217;t claim in this lawsuit that Christie&#8217;s had
sold him the counterfeit Jefferson wines, he alleged that
Christie&#8217;s &#8220;had previously auctioned other Th.J. bottles&#8221;
owned by German wine dealer and former pop music manager Hardy
Rodenstock. Koch claimed he was &#8220;induced&#8221; into buying them
from Rodenstock because Christie&#8217;s had described the wines
&#8220;positively&#8221; in auction catalogues when the wines were sold in
the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koch also sued Rodenstock in 2006 over the wines. A default
judgment was entered against Rodenstock in that case last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones rejected Koch&#8217;s claim that if Christie&#8217;s had
disclosed that the bottle was counterfeit &#8220;Koch would never
have needed to spend $4,200 to purchase the bottle,&#8221; saying he
was no longer acting as a reasonable consumer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have great respect for Mr. Koch but have always
believed his claims were without merit and are therefore
grateful for the court&#8217;s decision affirming this,&#8221; Christie&#8217;s
spokesman Toby Usnik said in an e-mail statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, Koch claimed that because Christie&#8217;s has
inspected so many wine cellars and bottles of wine, it knew how
to identify counterfeit wine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Christie&#8217;s also has unique access to facts and
circumstances that might call into question the authenticity of
specific wines it handles,&#8221; Koch alleged in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koch has filed other wine-related suits. In 2007, he sued
Scarsdale, New York-based Zachys Wine Auctions. In 2008, he sued
Chicago Wine Co., Chicago-based Julienne Importing Co. and New
York auction house Acker Merrall  Condit, accusing them of
selling him fakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Koch v. Christie&#8217;s, 10-cv-2804, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mets Owners Face New Claims in $1 Billion Madoff Fraud Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s defunct firm filed
new claims against the owners of the New York Mets, saying they
&#8220;chose to look the other way&#8221; and invest with the con man
after repeated warnings of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard revised a $1 billion lawsuit filed in
December to add a claim that the baseball team&#8217;s owner, Sterling
Equities Inc., and Madoff created a fraudulent letter agreement,
as part of Sterling&#8217;s purchase of the Mets&#8217; broadcast rights
from Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) in 2004, according to a filing
March 18 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The amended complaint sheds more light on the deep
dependency of the Sterling business organization on the
continuation of the Madoff fraud and certain knowledge of
indicia of fraud by the Sterling partners,&#8221; David Sheehan,
counsel to Picard, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard claims that after Madoff&#8217;s fraud was disclosed
publicly in December 2008, Sterling Equities restructured its
debt in a manner that attempted to block the trustee from
recovering assets on behalf of Madoff victims, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new complaint, at 373 pages, adds eight pages to the
original complaint, which was filed under seal in December and
made public in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The amended complaint is the latest chapter in the work
of fiction created by the trustee,&#8221; team Chairman Fred Wilpon
and President Saul Katz said in a statement. &#8220;We will pursue a
vigorous legal defense that will set the record straight and
vindicate us.&#8221; Wilpon and Katz said the trustee concocted his
allegations against them to force a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let us be very clear: we did not know that Madoff was
engaged in a fraud,&#8221; Katz and Wilpon said in an e-mailed news
release. &#8220;There were no red flags and we received no
warnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the amended complaint, Picard claims that, as the
deadline for closing the Cablevision broadcast rights buyout
deal approached, Sterling took a $54 million, no-interest bridge
loan from Madoff, creating a fraudulent letter agreement falsely
characterizing it as an investment by Madoff&#8217;s wife, Ruth
Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Cohen, general counsel for the Mets, said in an e-
mailed statement that the $54 million &#8220;represented funds the
Sterling partners had invested with Madoff, as the trustee
acknowledges. As the trustee also acknowledges, that money was
never used -- and in fact was returned the next day --because
the necessary funds were received from Sterling&#8217;s lenders by the
buyout deadline, and were used to fund the buyout.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 10-AP-5287, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citibank Sued for $1.3 Billion by Lehman Brokerage Trustee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Citigroup Inc. (C) unit was sued by Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ)&#8217;s brokerage trustee, who is seeking $1.3 billion for the
bankrupt company&#8217;s creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $1.3 billion in cash and other assets now held by
Citibank and affiliates should go to creditors, said the
trustee, James Giddens, in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan
bankruptcy court March 18. The trustee claims that Citibank has
no right to keep a $1 billion deposit given to it for foreign-
exchange settlement services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another $700 million was given to Citibank as a pledge by Barclays Plc (BARC) as security for the same foreign-exchange
settlements the week the Lehman parent filed for bankruptcy,
Giddens said. Lehman filed Sept. 15, 2008 and the brokerage,
Lehman Brothers Inc., liquidated four days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee asked a judge to rule that Citibank willfully
violated the &#8220;automatic stay&#8221; provision of the bankruptcy law
when it seized the $1 billion deposit on Sept. 19, 2008, which
forbids such transfers, Giddens said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage trustee&#8217;s suit is one of many in bankruptcy
courts, after creditors seize deposits to compensate them for
pending losses on their loans. The banks argue that under
commercial banking laws they had a right to set off the deposits
against money still owed. Using bankruptcy law, debtors try to
take back the deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup said earlier this month it could face demands by
Lehman for $3 billion in funds taken around the time of the
Lehman brokerage&#8217;s liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee&#8217;s effort to recover these monies is
unjustified and without merit, and Citi will vigorously defend
its right to recover its losses,&#8221; Citigroup spokeswoman
Danielle Romero-Apsilos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman benefited from Citibank&#8217;s extension of credit to it
amid panic provoked by its bankruptcy filing, and Citibank
suffered more than $1 billion in losses for helping Lehman, she
said. The money that the Lehman brokerage trustee wants to claw
back was used by Citibank to partly cover losses, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). Giddens&#8217;s suit is Lehman Brothers Inc. v. Citibank
NA, 11-01681, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGC Says Tullett Asking for &#8216;Massively Inflated Sum&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP) said inter-dealer brokerage competitor Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) is seeking a &#8220;massively inflated sum&#8221; after
it won a lawsuit accusing BGC of poaching 10 traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &#8220;a great deal of hyperbole&#8221; regarding Tullett&#8217;s
losses, Andrew Hochhauser, a lawyer for BGC, told a London court
March 18 at a hearing to determine damages. Tullett hired
&#8220;senior hands&#8221; as replacements for the brokers within six
months, Hochhauser said. The 10 traders were prevented from
working for BGC for a year while the lawsuit was pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was not a mass exodus,&#8221; Hochhauser said. &#8220;This is
a claim where 10 brokers left Tullett Prebon in an office that
employs some 600 employees on 55 desks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court last year ruled that BGC participated in a
conspiracy to poach Tullett brokers. March 17, a lawyer for
Tullett said BGC owes &#8220;substantial&#8221; damages. Tullett and BGC
are keeping the figures private and won&#8217;t state them in court,
Tullett lawyer Daniel Oudkerk told Judge Raymond Jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullett is seeking to recoup lost profits, legal fees,
&#8220;wasted management time,&#8221; the cost of steps &#8220;to safeguard its
interests&#8221; and the gardening-leave pay to brokers while the
lawsuit was ongoing, Oudkerk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullett &#8220;asks the court to look at the desks&#8217; performance
in 2008 and to assume&#8221; that those results would have continued,
Hochhauser said. &#8220;That is a defective and unreliable
approach.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tullett Prebon Plc v. BGC Brokers LP,
HQ09X01241, High Court (London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Investors Appeal Ruling on Lehman-Related Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 213 investors in Singapore, in a bid to recoup
S$18 million ($14 million) in losses tied to Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., urged the city&#8217;s appeal court to overturn a
ruling that dismissed their claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS Bank Ltd., which sold credit default swaps linked to
Lehman, had inconsistencies in the investment&#8217;s prospectus and
pricing statement, the investors said in their appeal filed
March 14. Singapore-based DBS, Southeast Asia&#8217;s biggest bank,
had declared the investments to be worthless after Lehman
collapsed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inconsistency stemmed from &#8220;an obvious clerical
error,&#8221; Judge Lee Seiu Kin said in a Dec. 10 ruling, dismissing
the lawsuit. Statements on how the investment value would be
calculated in a credit event, such as Lehman&#8217;s collapse, weren&#8217;t
meant to be comprehensive, mathematical formulae and were
instead general descriptions, Lee said in his decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While DBS insists on holding us to the strict terms of
the contract, they seek to avoid liability by relying on what
they call a clerical error,&#8221; the group, represented by lawyer
Siraj Omar, said in an e-mailed statement March 18. DBS had sold
its DBS High Notes 5 as a safe, low-risk investment, lulling the
investors into having a &#8220;false sense of security,&#8221; the group
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is scheduled to be heard in the week of May 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Lee, a DBS spokeswoman, said the bank doesn&#8217;t comment
on legal matter in progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Soon Kok Tiang and Others v. DBS Bank Ltd.

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Said to Pay $10 Million to Settle SEC Bribery Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) agreed to pay $10
million to settle accusations by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that it gave cash and gifts to Chinese and
South Korean officials in exchange for computer contracts,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will pay $5.3 million in disgorgement, $2.7
million in interest and a penalty of $2 million to settle a
lawsuit filed March 18 in federal court in Washington. The SEC
alleged the bribes, which included travel and entertainment,
occurred from 1998 through 2009 in violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improper payments were made by employees at three
subsidiaries of Armonk, New York-based IBM, as well as LG IBM PC
Co., a joint venture between the company and LG Electronics
Inc., according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said cash payments to South Korean officials from
1998 to 2003 totaled $207,000. In China, the IBM employees
created &#8220;slush funds&#8221; at local travel agencies that were used
to pay for overseas excursions by Chinese government officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Ed Barbini said he couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment on the lawsuit or settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. International Business Machines Corp.,
11-cv-00563, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M Agrees to Pay $12 Million to Settle Discrimination Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 3M Co. (MMM), the maker of products including Scotch tape and Post-it Notes, agreed to pay as much as $12 million to settle an
age discrimination lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, which is subject to approval by the
Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota, 3M will
resolve the claims of about 7,000 members of the class
represented by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement &#8220;provides a reasonable resolution
that allows the company to avoid ongoing investments in time and
legal fees,&#8221; Marschall Smith, 3M general counsel, said in a
statement. &#8220;We believe the resolution will allow the company
and our employees to focus on growing our business and serving
our customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, all employed by 3M in Minnesota, claimed
that the company systematically discriminated against workers
over the age of 46 from 2001 to 2005. Management perceived older
workers as &#8220;less able or willing to accept and apply new
business methodologies adopted by the company,&#8221; according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Clifford L. Whitaker v. 3M Co., 62-C4-04-
012239, Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Law Firms Hire U.K. Lawyers for Bribery Act Work &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and U.S. law firms are luring
lawyers away from the U.K. fraud prosecutor as companies prepare
to comply with the world&#8217;s &#8220;most draconian&#8221; anti-bribery law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Ministry of Justice has said it will introduce new
proposals as soon as next week, leaving companies scrambling to
hire lawyers to help prepare compliance plans. Under the law,
U.K. companies without adequate controls to prevent corruption
may be prosecuted if a bribe is paid by third parties on their
behalf anywhere in the world, even if officials didn&#8217;t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwadjo Adjepong, who worked on the Serious Fraud Office&#8217;s
probe into the collapse of London hedge fund Weavering Capital,
joined Goldman Sachs as a vice president in its compliance
department last month, SFO spokesman David Jones said. Covington
 Burling LLP, White  Case LLP and Arnold  Porter LLP have
also hired lawyers from the SFO as the Bribery Act creates work
for firms preparing compliance plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington-based Arnold  Porter in February said it hired
Kathleen Harris, the former head of the SFO fraud business
group, as a partner in its London office. Charlie Monteith, a
senior policy adviser and the head of assurance at the agency,
left for New York-based White  Case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another former SFO prosecutor, Matthew Cowie, who oversaw
an investigation of BAE Systems Plc, left in June to join the
U.S. law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; CEZ AS (CEZ) jumped for a fifth day to
its highest in almost seven weeks after JPMorgan Chase  Co.
said the biggest Czech utility may benefit from Germany shutting
down some nuclear power plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock jumped 1.2 percent to 839 koruna by 10:07 a.m. in
Prague, its highest intraday price since Feb. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEZ &#8220;can benefit from attractive opportunities in the
electricity and gas wholesale markets&#8221; as it is &#8220;exposed to
higher prices from German action without exposure to German
politics,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts wrote in a report to clients
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank raised its price estimate for CEZ shares to
1,040 koruna from 920 koruna in a report on March 18.
Electricity prices are likely to rise after explosions and a
radiation leak at a nuclear plant in Japan prompted neighboring
Germany to shut down some reactors for safety inspections,
according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The district surrounding Tokyo
Disneyland may have to reinforce reclaimed land housing 96,000
people after last week&#8217;s magnitude-9 earthquake turned the
ground to mud, snapping utility pipes and tipping buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quake triggered ground liquefaction, which causes soil
to act like quicksand, across much of the 1,455 hectares (3,600
acres) of reclaimed land in Urayasu city, said Kazuhisa
Nakatani, a local government spokesman. Some of Disneyland&#8217;s
parking lot was also affected, trapping as many as 30 cars. The
main park areas didn&#8217;t suffer as they sit on 15-meter (49-foot)
deep reinforced foundations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no question the earthquake damaged the area more
than expected,&#8221; said Yasuhiko Hino, the head of urban disaster
prevention projects at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism. Houses in the suburban district were
most affected as they lack the concrete pilings that protected
high-rise buildings, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urayasu may consider reinforcing the reclaimed land, which
makes up about three-quarters of its surface area, once it has
finished dealing with emergency repairs following the March 11
earthquake, Nakatani said. At least one more runway at Tokyo&#8217;s
Haneda Airport may also be strengthened to bolster defenses
following the March 11 quake, the fifth largest ever recorded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) won a U.S. deep-
water drilling permit for the Gulf of Mexico, becoming the
fourth company cleared to work in the largest source of domestic
crude after BP Plc&#8217;s oil spill last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, will drill in a Keathley
Canyon Block in 6,941 feet (2,116 meters) of water, about 240
miles off the Louisiana coast, the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to review and approve applications that
demonstrate the ability to operate safely in deep water,&#8221;
Michael Bromwich, bureau director, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble Energy Inc. (NBL), BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and ATP Oil  Gas
Corp. have received U.S. permits to resume work halted after
BP&#8217;s April 20 spill. While Exxon&#8217;s well is new, the company had
a rig on site and a permit to drill when BP&#8217;s Macondo well
exploded. Exxon had to suspend operations following the
disaster, according to the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon fell 28 cents to $82.56 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is the world&#8217;s second-largest operator of deep-water
oil wells. Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil
company, is the biggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S&#8217;s Maersk Developer rig is standing
by, ready to drill the well, Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman,
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, reached a settlement with asbestos claimants that may
bring an end to its Quigley unit&#8217;s seven-year-old bankruptcy
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein refused to allow
Quigley to exit Chapter 11 court protection in September, saying
Pfizer had manipulated the bankruptcy process to benefit itself.
Pfizer and a committee of asbestos claimants entered into an
agreement on March 20 that may resolve their dispute over
claims, according to court papers filed yesterday in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord &#8220;resolves the legal and equitable issues that
existed under that plan, including enhancing distributions for
current claimants and future demand holders, improving
reorganized Quigley&#8217;s long-term feasibility, and rectifying
concerns regarding good faith,&#8221; lawyers for Quigley wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. Under the deal, which requires court
approval, asbestos claimants would vote in favor of Quigley&#8217;s
bankruptcy plan and waive all rights to a jury trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange, Pfizer would contribute $264.9 million in cash
and all of the stock in a reorganized Quigley to a trust to pay
asbestos claims. New York-based Pfizer also would forgive its
own claims against the non-operating unit, according to a draft
of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Best Interests&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once Quigley&#8217;s reorganization plan is presented to and
confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, asbestos-related
liability arising from Quigley will be resolved through a fund
established as part of the bankruptcy reorganization,&#8221; Pfizer
spokesman Christopher Loder said in a statement. The agreement
is &#8220;in the best interests of the company,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in November reported a $701 million third-quarter
charge for asbestos litigation for Quigley. The ad hoc
committee, representing 43,100 asbestos claimants, had asked the
court to lift an injunction that has barred them from bringing
claims against Pfizer since 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry that contained asbestos from the 1940s to the 1970s.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
acquire Tririga Inc., gaining software that manages real estate
holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tririga&#8217;s programs help manage buildings, strategizing
space usage, monitoring utility costs and estimating
construction expense, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today in a
statement. The financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. Tririga, which
is closely held, is based in Las Vegas and has about 200
employees worldwide, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM expects that projects making buildings, hospitals and
highways more efficient -- an initiative IBM calls Smarter
Planet -- will be a $10 billion business for the company by
2015. IBM plans to make $20 billion in acquisitions through
2015, buoying that program as well as other growth areas, such
as analytics, company officials have told investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement ends IBM&#8217;s longest acquisition drought since
2003. The company last announced a deal in October. If it lasted
another week, the period without an announcement would have been
the longest since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer
in 2002. He is also chairman and president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 32 cents to $158 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 23 percent
in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the largest
U.S. lender by assets, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Adam Bernard
as a director in its high-yield debt unit, a person with
knowledge of the appointment said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard stepped down as an executive director in JPMorgan&#8217;s
high-yield capital markets group this week, said the person, who
declined to be identified because an announcement hasn&#8217;t been
made. Bernard will start in Bank of America&#8217;s New York offices
in the second quarter, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America was the second-biggest underwriter of U.S.
high-yield bonds last year, behind JPMorgan, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The market for non-investment-grade debt
revived this week after issuance of all types fell more than 50
percent earlier this month amid the threat of a nuclear disaster
in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard will report to A.J. Murphy and John Cokinos, co-
heads of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank&#8217;s capital
markets operations for leveraged finance in the Americas.
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,

&lt;p&gt;Portugal&#8217;s government may collapse
tomorrow as the country&#8217;s parliament votes on budget cuts that
have divided lawmakers, JPMorgan economist Nicola Mai said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates has been attempting
to find a compromise with the opposition, &#8220;but the opposition
does not seem to buy into this,&#8221; London-based Mai said in a
note e-mailed to investors. &#8220;The likelihood that the Portuguese
government will fall this week looks high. This suggests that
the sovereign will likely access&#8221; the European Financial
Stability Facility &#8220;in the near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese parliament will discuss the stability and
growth program at 3 p.m. tomorrow in Lisbon. The Communist Party
plans to present a resolution in parliament against the
government plan, Bernardino Soares, the party&#8217;s parliamentary
leader, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socrates had said his government is available to discuss
its deficit-cutting measures with opposition parties as he tries
to avoid a &#8220;political crisis,&#8221; early elections and the
possibility of a bailout. Portugal is raising taxes and
implementing the deepest spending cuts in more than three
decades, aiming to convince investors it can narrow its budget
gap, curb its debt and avoid a bailout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May
announced restrictions on student visas, saying they provide an
easy route into Britain for those seeking to sidestep stringent
immigration controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration by students has more than trebled over the past
10 years against a backdrop of an &#8220;increase in abuse in the
higher-education sector,&#8221; May told lawmakers in Parliament in
London today. &#8220;Bogus&#8221; institutions that let in underqualified
students and illegal migrants are to blame, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May said the U.K. will increase the vetting procedures for
colleges so only &#8220;bona fide&#8221; institutions can operate. In
future, those who wish to study in the country must speak
English and be able to support themselves financially without
paid employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clampdown is part of Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s
effort to bring net annual immigration below the &#8220;tens of
thousands&#8221; compared with almost 200,000 in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to attract only the best and the brightest to
Britain,&#8221; May said. &#8220;We are tightening up the system, tackling
the abuse and supporting only the most economically beneficial
migrants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel of lawmakers said March 17 it feared a clampdown on
student visas might damage a business valued at 40 billion
pounds ($66 billion) a year to universities and colleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross-party Home Affairs Committee said in a report
that evidence from Australia found that changes to that
country&#8217;s visa system contributed to a 19 percent decline in
student visa applications from 2009 to 2010. The panel said the
future of the U.K.&#8217;s knowledge economy is &#8220;reliant on
international students.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable expressed concern the same
day that the changes might affect &#8220;university finances&#8221; and
the wider economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the plans, only postgraduate students at universities
and government-sponsored students will be allowed to bring their
dependants, changing current rules that allow students on longer
courses to bring their families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. will limit the overall time that can be spent on a
student visa to three years at lower levels, as now, and five
years at higher levels. At present there is no limit for study
at or above degree level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain will also close the so-called &#8220;post-study work
route,&#8221; which allows students two years to seek employment
after their course ended. Only those graduates who have an offer
of a skilled job from a sponsoring employer, earning more than
20,000 pounds a year, will be able to stay to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those coming to study at degree level will have to speak
English at an upper intermediate level, higher than the current
requirement. U.K. Border Agency staff will be able to refuse
entry to students who &#8220;cannot speak English without an
interpreter and who therefore patently do not meet the required
minimum standards,&#8221; the Home Office said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zain Fancy, who joined Och-Ziff
Capital Management Group LLC (OZM) from Morgan Stanley in 2008, sued
two units of the New York-based hedge fund manager in Singapore,
claiming they withheld $7.9 million in pay and stock that he was
owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Och-Ziff Real Estate Singapore Pte, a venture in which
Fancy was the founding partner and executive managing director,
had no basis for firing him in October and owed him $1 million
in wages and $6.9 million worth of stock, according to Fancy&#8217;s
lawsuit filed with the Singapore High Court. A closed hearing is
scheduled for March 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancy acted in bad faith by not fully disclosing his
involvement in a probe by the U.S. Department of Justice and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into alleged corruption
at Morgan Stanley, where he had been head of the bank&#8217;s real
estate business in Asia, according to court papers filed by Och-
Ziff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Fancy&#8217;s involvement in pending investigations,
coupled with other factors unrelated to Och-Ziff, have prevented
the parties from raising third-party capital for the venture and
rendered the venture unworkable,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Joel
Frank said in a filing. &#8220;His actions have resulted in a breach
of trust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancy didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. His
lawyer Cavinder Bull from Drew  Napier LLC declined to comment

&lt;p&gt;Apple Claims Amazon.com Improperly Using &#8216;App Store&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) sued Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), saying the online retailer
is improperly using Apple&#8217;s &#8220;App Store&#8221; trademark for a mobile
software developer program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, in a complaint filed March 18, accused Amazon.com of
trademark infringement and unfair competition and asks for a
court order to prevent the company from using the &#8220;App Store&#8221;
name as well as for unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s App Store offers software downloads, by the company
and by third-party developers, for users of its iPhones, iPods
and iPads. There have been more than 10 billion downloads
through the service since it was started in 2008, Apple said in
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com since January has started to solicit developers
for a future mobile software download service, Apple said.
Amazon.com has used &#8220;Amazon Appstore Developer Portal&#8221; and
&#8220;Amazon Appstore&#8221; in connection with this service, according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Seeks to Block Imports of Barnes  Noble&#8217;s Nook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) yesterday said it filed patent-infringement
claims against Barnes  Noble Inc., seeking to block U.S.
imports of the Nook e-reader in the latest legal dispute over
the Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it filed complaints with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington and in federal
court in Seattle against Barnes  Noble and the Nook&#8217;s
manufacturers, Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) and Inventec
Co. Ltd. after yearlong licensing talks failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nook uses Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system, and
is infringing patents &#8220;that are essential to the user
experience,&#8221; Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft, which
makes the rival Windows-based operating system, filed a
complaint in October against Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.
over Android-based smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Android platform infringes a number of Microsoft&#8217;s
patents, and companies manufacturing and shipping Android
devices must respect our intellectual property rights,&#8221; Horacio
Gutierrez, Microsoft&#8217;s deputy general counsel for intellectual
property and licensing, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has created a patent-
licensing program just for Android device manufacturers,
Gutierrez said. HTC Corp., which makes phones for both the
Android and Windows systems, signed a license with Microsoft
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their refusals to take licenses leave us no choice but to
bring legal action&#8221; against New York-based Barnes  Noble,
Foxconn and Inventec, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes  Noble,
declined to comment. The Nook is Barnes  Noble&#8217;s best-selling
product, and sales of the device last quarter drove the
company&#8217;s first increase in same-store sales since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suits and patent-licensing deals are likely to increase
industrywide this year, Gutierrez said in January, as the pace
of new device introductions increases. The new products combine
so many different components, it&#8217;s unlikely any company will own
all the intellectual property they use, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil case is Microsoft Corp. v. Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS),
11cv343, U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mylan Sues U.S. FDA to Block Ranbaxy&#8217;s Sale of Lipitor Copy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan Inc. sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
seeking to block India&#8217;s Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY)&#8217;s exclusive
rights to sell a generic version of Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s cholesterol
pill Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan and other generic-drug makers should be allowed to
enter the market as soon as Lipitor&#8217;s patent expires in June
because of manufacturing violations at two Ranbaxy factories in
India, Mylan said in a complaint filed March 18 in federal court
in Washington. Ranbaxy, 64 percent owned by Tokyo-based Daiichi
Sankyo Co., fell the most in almost two years in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy has said it is entitled to 180 days of marketing
exclusivity as a reward for being the first to challenge the
Lipitor patents. The drugmaker, based in Gurgaon near New Delhi,
reached an agreement with Pfizer in 2008 to sell copies of the
medicine beginning Nov. 30. The FDA has yet to clear any of the
generic competitors as equivalent to brand-name Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time someone is openly challenging
Ranbaxy&#8217;s exclusivity for Lipitor,&#8221; said Bino Pathiparampil, a
Mumbai-based analyst at India Infoline Ltd. &#8220;It is
incrementally negative for sure&#8221; for Ranbaxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenberg&#8217;s Starr Sues China MediaExpress, Alleging Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr International Co., a firm run by former American
International Group Inc. (AIG) Chief Executive Officer Maurice
&#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg, sued China MediaExpress Holdings Inc. (CCME) and
its auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, saying it was fraudulently
induced into investing about $13.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit from Starr Investments Cayman II Inc., filed in
U.S. federal court in Delaware on March 18, says Hong Kong-based
China MediaExpress misrepresented its business and finances.
Chief Executive Officer Zheng Cheng and Chief Financial Officer
Jacky Lam were also named in the suit. Lam quit earlier this
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg, through Starr International and C.V. Starr 
Co., is the third-largest China MediaExpress holder with 4.55
million shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Starr
International purchased about 1.5 million shares in October,
then valued at about $13.5 million. Shares of China
MediaExpress, which says it provides advertising on buses in
China, have been halted in the U.S. since March 11 after
plunging 48 percent in six weeks. The company said March 14 that
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu resigned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China MediaExpress didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail message sent
to its investor relations department outside regular business

&lt;p&gt;Barry Bonds Perjury Trial Over Alleged Steroid Use Begins &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home run record holder Barry Bonds&#8217;s trial to determine if
he committed perjury when he said he never knowingly took
steroids began yesterday with jury selection in federal court in
San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds, 46, who broke Hank Aaron&#8217;s record of 755 career home
runs in August 2007, faces four counts of perjury and one count
of obstruction of justice for telling a grand jury in 2003 that
he didn&#8217;t knowingly take performance-enhancing drugs. The
maximum sentence for each of the counts is 10 years in prison
and a $250,000 fine. Bonds, who was first charged in November
2007, has pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Susan Illston selected a jury
yesterday. She told would-be jurors that if chosen they must
decide the case based only on the trial evidence though they may
have read about the charges against Bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Bonds and federal prosecutors yesterday
agreed that 38 of about 100 potential jurors should be dismissed
based on their answers to a three-page questionnaire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial was postponed for two years as federal
prosecutors appealed a judge&#8217;s ruling barring them from using as
evidence certain documents they say show that Bonds tested
positive for steroid use. They lost the appeal. Government
attorneys may call former New York Yankee Jason Giambi and other
baseball players to testify that they received steroids from
Bonds&#8217;s former trainer, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds holds the Major League Baseball career record with
762 home runs and the single-season record with 73 home runs in
2001. He played 22 seasons in the major leagues, the first seven
with the Pittsburgh Pirates before moving to the San Francisco
Giants in 1993 as a free agent. He won a record seven National
League Most Valuable Player awards, including four straight from
2001 through 2004. He hasn&#8217;t played since the 2007 season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin Asks Appeals Court to Block Order on Labor Law &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin&#8217;s attorney general asked an appeals court to
block a state judge&#8217;s order that temporarily halted a law
curbing government employee unions&#8217; collective-bargaining power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen yesterday also asked
the Wisconsin Court of Appeals for permission to file an appeal
seeking to overturn the ruling by Circuit Court Judge Maryann
Sumi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Contrary to established case law, the trial court
injected itself into the legislative process and enjoined a
legislative act,&#8221; Van Hollen said in court papers filed
yesterday in Madison. &#8220;There is absolutely no authority for the
broad, overreaching step taken.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumi on March 18 granted a temporary restraining order
blocking publication of the measure signed into law by Governor
Scott Walker on March 11, after a hearing in Madison, the
state&#8217;s capital city. Publication gives the law full force and
effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation championed by Walker, a first-term
Republican, requires annual recertification votes for union
representation and makes voluntary the payment of union dues. It
exempts firefighters and police officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organized labor and Democrats called the bill an attack on
workers. Opposition sparked almost four weeks of mass protests
at the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of Wisconsin Ex Rel. Ozanne v.
Fitzgerald, 11cv1244, Dane County, Wisconsin, Circuit Court
(Madison). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilton Stock Purchase Lawful, Rajaratnam&#8217;s Lawyer Tells Jury &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers sought to use cross-examination of
a government witness to show Galleon Group LLC had legitimate
reasons to buy Hilton Hotels Corp. stock before its 2007 buyout
that didn&#8217;t involve inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During defense questioning of Margaret Holloway, a senior
credit analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc., defense
attorney Michael Starr tried to show sophisticated traders knew
Hilton was a takeover target months before Rajaratnam was
allegedly tipped. Prosecutors claim Galleon, co-founded by
Rajaratnam, bought the shares because Deep Shah, a junior
analyst at Moody&#8217;s, leaked news July 2, 2007, a day before the
Blackstone Group LP&#8217;s takeover of the chain was made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr questioned Holloway about analyst reports and media
accounts speculating on the likelihood of a buyout beginning
four months earlier. He showed her documents filed with
regulators stating that New York-based Galleon increased its
holdings from 250,000 shares in the quarter ended March 31,
2007, to 475,000 three months later -- prior to the alleged tip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a secret document, is it?&#8221; Starr asked
Holloway about an April 30, 2007, report by Morgan Stanley (MS)
saying that private equity investors were &#8220;swarming the lodging
space.&#8221; Holloway replied that it wasn&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial in the largest crackdown on
hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The Sri Lankan-born
money manager is accused of making $45 million from tips leaked
by corporate insiders and hedge fund traders. The Hilton tip was
passed from Shah to Roomy Khan, a former Intel Corp. (INTC) executive
and stock trader, who in turn told Rajaratnam, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan has pleaded guilty in the case. Shah remains a
fugitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Loses Case Over Swap Sales at German Top Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany&#8217;s biggest bank, lost a ruling
over an interest-rate swap in the first case concerning sales of
the products to companies and local governments heard at the
country&#8217;s highest civil court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank must pay Ille Papier Service GmbH 541,074 euros
($770,000) plus interest over the swap purchase, Federal Court
of Justice Presiding Judge Ulrich Wiechers said in Karlsruhe,
Germany, today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As an adviser to its customer, the bank must guard the
customers&#8217; interest alone,&#8221; Wiechers said.  &#8220;But as a seller
of the swap, a loss to the customer works to the banks&#8217;
advantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling will influence dozens of disputes Deutsche Bank
has with local German governments, community-owned utilities and
companies that claim the lender sold swaps without adequately
disclosing risks and fees. Cases over swap agreements have
spread throughout Europe with similar disputes in Italy, France
and England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank lawyer Christian Duve said his client needs
to analyze the written ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;number of open disputes over these swaps is
limited,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the bank has taken adequate risk
provisions for this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, which acted as Ille Paper&#8217;s adviser, had the
duty to disclose an initial negative market value of about
80,000 euros that covered the lenders profit and costs, because
it was a crucial indicator how chances and risks were structured
into the product, Wiechers said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BGH, XI ZR 33/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Banker Poteroba Gets 22 Months for Insider Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igor Poteroba, a former UBS AG (UBS) investment banker who
pleaded guilty to insider trading, was sentenced to 22 months in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty in Manhattan also
ordered Poteroba to pay a $25,000 fine and to serve three years
of supervised release after his prison term. In December,
Poteroba, 37, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to
commit securities fraud and three counts of securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This activity was done repeatedly, over an extended
period of time,&#8221; Crotty said before passing sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poteroba has agreed to forfeit the $465,000 in proceeds
from his insider trading. Crotty said he will probably be
deported to his native Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poteroba, who worked in UBS Securities LLC&#8217;s Global
Healthcare Group in New York, was charged and arrested in March
2010 along with Alexei Koval, a Chicago man who allegedly traded
on the information. Poteroba was accused of leaking tips about
potential mergers and acquisitions involving six public
companies to Koval and a third, unidentified person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said Poteroba&#8217;s 22-month term includes the year
he already spent in a federal lockup since his arrest.
Poteroba&#8217;s lawyers argued that his time already served was an
appropriate term. Prosecutors urged Crotty to sentence him to as
long as 37 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I made some very bad mistakes and made many bad
decisions,&#8221; Poteroba told Crotty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koval pleaded guilty in January. His sentencing is
scheduled for May 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Poteroba, 10-mag-00562, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG, Three Others Will Pay $27 Million in Antitrust Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc., the bailed-out insurer,
is one of four insurance companies that will pay a total of $27
million to resolve a lawsuit claiming they improperly sold
excess casualty policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG, Liberty Mutual Holding Co., Travelers Cos., Inc. and
XL Group Plc (XL) agreed to settle the case with buyers of insurance
policies sold from 1998 through 2004. Five other insurers agreed
to settle a related set of claims over non-excess casualty
policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have reached an agreement to resolve
this matter,&#8221; said company spokesman Mark Herr in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Through this settlement, AIG brings an end to
another long-standing lawsuit about events from many years
ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN), the largest Swiss insurer,
and Arthur J. Gallagher  Co., an insurance broker, previously
settled the case pending in federal court in Trenton, New
Jersey. Zurich, based in the Swiss city of the same name, agreed
to pay $121.8 million to clients and $30 million in attorneys&#8217;
fees. Gallagher, based in Itasca, Illinois, agreed to pay $28
million to clients and $8.9 million in attorneys&#8217; fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was inspired by a 2004 regulatory probe by Eliot
Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, of a conspiracy by
brokers and insurers to stifle competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company used fake quotes to steer clients to favored
insurers in exchange for hidden fees, Spitzer said in his suit.
Marsh  McLennan Cos. settled with him in 2005 by agreeing to
pay $850 million to customers across the U.S. Some 70,000
clients, including more than 90 percent of the largest, accepted
the compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation,
04-5184, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Will Release Bank Loan Data as Top Court Rejects Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve will disclose details of emergency
loans it made to banks in 2008, after the U.S. Supreme Court
rejected an industry appeal that aimed to shield the records
from public view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday left intact a court order that gives
the Fed five days to release the records, sought by Bloomberg
News&#8217;s parent company, Bloomberg LP. The Clearing House
Association LLC, a group of the nation&#8217;s largest commercial
banks, had asked the Supreme Court to intervene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board will fully comply with the court&#8217;s decision and
is preparing to make the information available,&#8221; said David
Skidmore, a spokesman for the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order marks the first time a court has forced the Fed
to reveal the names of banks that borrowed from its oldest
lending program, the 98-year-old discount window. The
disclosures, together with details of six bailout programs
released by the central bank in December under a congressional
mandate, would give taxpayers insight into the Fed&#8217;s
unprecedented $3.5 trillion effort to stem the 2008 financial
panic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t recall that the Fed was ever sued and forced to
release information&#8221; in its 98-year history, said Allan H.
Meltzer, the author of three books on the U.S. central bank and
a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the trial judge&#8217;s order, the Fed must reveal 231
pages of documents related to borrowers in April and May 2008,
along with loan amounts. News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Fox News is pressing a bid
for 6,186 pages of similar information on loans made from August
2007 to November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records were originally requested under FOIA, which
allows citizens access to government papers, by the late
Bloomberg News reporter Mark Pittman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Clearing House Association v. Bloomberg,
10-543, and Clearing House Association v. Fox News Network,
10-660. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAB Agrees to Settle A$309 Million Dispute Over Taxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB), the nation&#8217;s biggest lender
to companies, agreed to settle a A$309 million ($311 million)
dispute with the country&#8217;s tax office, saying it won a A$142
million reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement was reached as a four-week trial was
scheduled to begin in Sydney Federal Court March 20. The bank
didn&#8217;t admit liability and will get a refund from the tax
office, National Australia Bank said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender claimed interest on capital instruments, known
as exchangeable capital units, or ExCaps, is tax-deductible. The
Australian Tax Office disagreed and issued six amended
assessments against the bank in December 2008 and May 2005,
seeking to recoup the deductions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This removes the need for potentially long and costly
legal proceedings,&#8221; National Australia Bank Chief Financial
Officer Mark Joiner said yesterday in a statement issued to the
Australian Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Tax Office ruled the interest payments
weren&#8217;t tax deductible because the money was considered capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Australia paid A$309 million and sued to recover
the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Australia Bank Ltd. V. Commissioner of
Taxation. NSD 1297/2009. Federal Court of Australia (Sydney) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mets Say Madoff Trustee Made Charges to Force Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Mets owners said the trustee liquidating the
business of convicted fraudster Bernard L. Madoff concocted
allegations against them to force a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard, seeking $1 billion in Ponzi scheme profits
and principal from the baseball team&#8217;s owner, Sterling Equities
Inc., sued in New York, accusing the team and the owners of
participating in Madoff&#8217;s fraud and ignoring &#8220;red flags.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking a judge to dismiss Picard&#8217;s suit, the Sterling
partners said March 20 in court papers that they weren&#8217;t
professional investors and saw no warning signs. Fred Wilpon,
the Mets chairman, and Saul Katz, the ball club&#8217;s president,
described Picard&#8217;s accusations as a &#8220;work of fiction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s calculation that the Sterling partners and
companies made $300 million in false profit from the Ponzi
scheme ignored their Madoff accounts that had net losses,
Sterling said in a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
After losses, Sterling&#8217;s fake profit was about $150 million over
25 years, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let us be very clear: We did not know that Madoff was
engaged in a fraud,&#8221; Katz and Wilpon said March 20 in a
statement. &#8220;There were no red flags and we received no
warnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mets said in January that they are seeking to sell as
much as 25 percent of the Major League Baseball team to raise
money to settle a Madoff-related lawsuit. Picard&#8217;s suit, filed
in December, was kept under seal until last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard revised the suit on March 18 to add a claim that
Sterling and Madoff disguised a $54 million loan from Madoff as
an investment by his wife, Ruth Madoff, to help Sterling
purchase the Mets&#8217; broadcast rights from Cablevision Systems
Corp. in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amended complaint showed the &#8220;deep dependency&#8221; of
Sterling businesses on the Madoff fraud &#8220;and certain knowledge
of indicia of fraud&#8221; by the Sterling partners, David Sheehan,
Picard&#8217;s lawyer, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 10:05287, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFL Owners Say Court Lacks Right to Bar Lockout of Players &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Football League owners voiced opposition to a bid
by 10 NFL players for an order blocking a lockout during
collective bargaining, saying the federal court lacks
jurisdiction over the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the National Labor Relations Board has the authority
to resolve the fight, the 32-team league said yesterday in
papers submitted to U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson in
St. Paul, Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The jurisdictional bar applies as long as this case
&#8216;involves or grows out of&#8217; a labor dispute, a test that is
clearly satisfied here,&#8221; according the owners argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Drew Brees led
the group that sued the league on March 11 after negotiations to
craft a new contract collapsed and the National Football League
Players Association said it no longer would function as a union.
League policies violate U.S. antitrust laws, the players said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners declared a lockout hours later, shutting down the
most-watched and wealthiest U.S. sport at midnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the lockout, players won&#8217;t be paid, and teams can&#8217;t
practice, sign new players or make trades. The NFL draft of
college players is still scheduled to begin April 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Brady v. NFL, 0:11-639, U.S. District Court,
District of Minnesota (St. Paul). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law Firm News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Litowitz Tops 2010 Class-Action Settlements List &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann LLP recovered more
money in class-action settlements of investor lawsuits in 2010
than any other law firm, according to a study that found 17
firms recouped more than $100 million each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Litowitz represented the lead or co-lead
plaintiff in 16 lawsuits that settled last year totaling about
$1 billion, according to the study released yesterday by
RiskMetrics Group&#8217;s Institutional Shareholder Services unit,
which tracks shareholder complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Diego-based Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd, which topped
the 2009 list, fell to second with $740.8 million followed by
Labaton Sucharow in New York in third place with $576.4 million.
Hargrove Pierson  Brown in Boca Raton, Florida, and Marcus 
Auerbach in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, round out the top five
with $549.3 million each, according to the study. Robbins
Geller, which represents investors in suits filed against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C), was also the most-
active firm by number of settlements with 31 deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cunningham Bounds, based in Mobile, Alabama, also posted
the highest average settlement amount among the top 50 law firms
ranked in the study, averaging $83.5 million in its three cases.
The firm served as co-lead counsel for bondholders in
settlements with UBS AG (UBSN), HealthSouth Corp. (HLS) and Ernst  Young LLP
over the health-care services provider&#8217;s demise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mylan Inc. sued the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, seeking to block India&#8217;s Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY)&#8217;s exclusive rights to sell a generic version
of Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s cholesterol pill Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-
selling medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan and other generic-drug makers should be allowed to
enter the market as soon as Lipitor&#8217;s patent expires in June
because of manufacturing violations at two Ranbaxy factories in
India, Mylan said in a complaint filed March 18 in federal court
in Washington. Ranbaxy, 64 percent owned by Tokyo-based Daiichi
Sankyo Co., fell the most in almost two years in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy has said it&#8217;s entitled to 180 days of marketing
exclusivity as a reward for being the first to challenge the
Lipitor patents. The drugmaker, based in Gurgaon near New Delhi,
reached an agreement with Pfizer in 2008 to sell copies of the
medicine beginning Nov. 30. The FDA has yet to clear any of the
generic competitors as equivalent to brand-name Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time someone is openly challenging
Ranbaxy&#8217;s exclusivity for Lipitor,&#8221; said Bino Pathiparampil, a
Mumbai-based analyst at India Infoline Ltd. &#8220;It is
incrementally negative for sure&#8221; for Ranbaxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six-month period of exclusivity could add as much as
$585 million to Ranbaxy&#8217;s sales, according to the median of four
analysts&#8217; estimates taken before yesterday&#8217;s lawsuit. That would
make the generic version the biggest product in the Indian
drugmaker&#8217;s history. Ranbaxy had sales of 85.5 billion rupees
($1.9 billion) last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, Mylan contends that Ranbaxy isn&#8217;t
eligible for that marketing exclusivity because of &#8220;false and
unreliable data&#8221; from its manufacturing site in Paonta Sahib,
India, used in Ranbaxy&#8217;s application for generic Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;FDA&#8217;s indecision is depriving millions of Lipitor
patients access to lower-cost generic Lipitor,&#8221; Mylan, based in
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, said in its complaint. It&#8217;s &#8220;costing
the public billions of dollars in savings, and costing generic
manufacturers billions of dollars in lost sales.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan wants a court to force the FDA to say publicly
whether Ranbaxy&#8217;s application &#8220;is tainted by Ranbaxy&#8217;s
misconduct&#8221; and that therefore the application must be denied
and the 180-day reward voided. A victory for Mylan would let it
enter the market in June, when some of the Lipitor patents
expire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy is working with regulators to resolve outstanding
questions and is confident that it will get the FDA approval for
its copy this year, Chuck Caprariello, a company spokesman, said
in an interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sales fell 6 percent to $10.7 billion last year as
generic competitors arrived in Spain and Canada. New York-based
Pfizer&#8217;s product has been the world&#8217;s biggest-selling medicine
for the past 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, 11-566, U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Seeks to Block Imports of Barnes  Noble&#8217;s Nook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said it filed patent-infringement claims
yesterday against Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS), seeking to block U.S.
imports of the Nook e-reader in the latest legal dispute over
the Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it filed complaints with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington and in federal
court in Seattle against Barnes  Noble and the Nook&#8217;s
manufacturers, Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) and Inventec
Co. Ltd. after yearlong licensing talks failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nook uses Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system, and
is infringing patents &#8220;that are essential to the user
experience,&#8221; Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft, which
makes the rival Windows-based operating system, filed a
complaint in October against Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.
over Android-based smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Android platform infringes a number of Microsoft&#8217;s
patents, and companies manufacturing and shipping Android
devices must respect our intellectual property rights,&#8221; Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft&#8217;s deputy general counsel for intellectual
property and licensing, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has created a patent-
licensing program just for Android device manufacturers,
Gutierrez said. HTC Corp., which makes phones for both the
Android and Windows systems, signed a license with Microsoft
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes  Noble,
declined to comment. The Nook is Barnes  Noble&#8217;s best-selling
product, and sales of the device last quarter drove the
company&#8217;s first increase in same-store sales since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble, the largest U.S. bookstore chain, suspended
its dividend last month to invest in its digital unit as more
consumers shift to reading e-books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxconn, based in Shenzhen in southern China, is also the
world&#8217;s biggest contract maker of mobile phones. Inventec, based
in Taipei, also makes laptop computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the civil suit, Microsoft claims infringement of five
patents and seeks cash compensation and a court order blocking
further use of the patented technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disputed patents cover a control window for display
tabs that help users find information; get faster downloads of
Web pages; and select text and annotate it without changing the
underlying document, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit mirrors claims made with the ITC, an independent
agency that has the power to block imports of products that
infringe U.S. patents. A copy of the ITC complaint wasn&#8217;t
immediately available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, the world&#8217;s largest Internet search company, bought
start-up Android Inc. in 2005, bringing in co-founder Andy Rubin, who currently spearheads Google&#8217;s Android efforts.
Rubin&#8217;s team developed Android as an open operating system,
which could be used and enhanced by anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL), the world&#8217;s second-biggest software company,
sued Google last year, claiming the Android system was developed
using the Java programming language Oracle obtained when it
bought Sun Microsystems Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil case is Microsoft Corp. v. Barnes  Noble Inc.,
11cv343, U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Buffett&#8217;s Margaritaville Seeks &#8216;Tiger Blood&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaritaville Enterprises LLC, the Florida company
associated with singer Jimmy Buffett, has applied to register
&#8220;Tiger Blood&#8221; as a trademark, according to the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two applications, filed March 12, are for the use of the
mark with energy drinks and vodka. The term has been used
frequently by actor Charlie Sheen to refer to a tropical juice
made by Xango LLC of Lehi, Utah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of other applications were filed in early March to
register &#8220;Tiger Blood&#8221; as a trademark. Crebit LLC of Newton,
Pennsylvania, filed an application March 6 to register the term
for &#8220;Nutritional Supplements in liquid form and non-liquid form
that relieve or prevent fatigue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harcos LLC of Santa Monica filed an application the next
day to use the term with dietary and nutritional supplements and
on March 8 Advanced Health Sciences of Richmond, Ohio, applied
to register the term for the same uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that same day, a group of four applicants said they want
to register the term to be used for &#8220;beauty beverages.&#8221;
Several applications were filed by others that same week to use
the term on T-shirts and other clothing items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TMZ.com celebrity gossip site reports that Xango&#8217;s
makers are &#8220;very nervous&#8221; about any association with Sheen,
who was recently fired from CBS Corp. (CBS)&#8217;s &#8220;Two and a Half Men&#8221;
television program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xango didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Of Hope Sues Morris Publishing Over Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City of Hope, a cancer research hospital based in Duarte,
California, sued a newspaper publisher for trademark
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Morris Publishing Group LLC of Augusta,
Georgia, is accused of infringing the &#8220;City of Hope&#8221; mark. The
hospital objects to a civic-journalism project of Morris
Publishing&#8217;s Florida Times-Union newspaper that is called &#8220;City
of Hope.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed in federal court in
Jacksonville, Florida, in addition to using the words &#8220;City of
Hope,&#8221; the stick figure that accompanies the words in the
newspaper project&#8217;s logo is similar to the images used by the
hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital says that while it &#8220;commends&#8221; the publishing
company and its Jacksonville newspaper for using &#8220;considerable
resources to further efforts to research educational issues and
find solutions,&#8221; the public is likely to be confused by the
name and logo similarity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publishing company has refused to change the name of
its project, according to a letter it sent the hospital that is
Included in the court filing. According to the letter, sent by
Timothy E. Moses of Hull Barrett PC of Augusta, the logos are
not the same, they don&#8217;t represent similar services, and they&#8217;re
used in different geographical areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People looking for City of Hope and information about
cancer research &#8220;would not spend two seconds&#8221; looking at the
newspaper&#8217;s City of Hope website, Moses said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City of Hope asked the court to bar the newspaper&#8217;s use of
&#8220;City of Hope&#8221; and for an award of the newspaper&#8217;s profits
derived from the alleged infringement. Additionally, the
hospital asked for money damages, attorney fees and litigation
costs and for an order for the newspaper to provide and pay for
corrective advertisements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital is represented by A. Graham Allen and Richard
S. Vermut of Rogers Towers PA of Jacksonville, and Perry J.
Viscounty and Jennifer L. Barry of Los Angeles-based Latham 
Watkins LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is City of Hope v. Morris Publishing Group LLC,
3:11-cv-00190-HLA-0MCR, U.S. District Court, Middle District of
Florida (Jacksonville). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Sues Amazon.com Over Use of &#8216;App Store&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) sued Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), saying the online retailer
is improperly using Apple&#8217;s &#8220;App Store&#8221; trademark for a mobile
software developer program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, in a complaint filed March 18, accused Amazon.com of
trademark infringement and unfair competition and asked for a
court order to prevent the company from using the &#8220;App Store&#8221;
name as well as for unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s App Store offers software downloads by the company
and by third-party developers for users of its iPhones, iPods
and iPads. There have been more than 10 billion downloads
through the service since it was started in 2008, Apple said in
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com since January has started to solicit developers
for a future mobile software download service, Apple said.
Amazon.com has used &#8220;Amazon Appstore Developer Portal&#8221; and
&#8220;Amazon Appstore&#8221; in connection with this service, according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com representatives didn&#8217;t immediately return a call
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is attempting to block Apple&#8217;s registration
of &#8220;app store,&#8221; claiming in filings to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office that the term is now too generic to be afforded
protection. In return, Apple has filed documents with the patent
office reminding Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft of its own
difficulties in trying to register &#8220;Windows,&#8221; a term opponents
also claimed was too generic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against Amazon is Apple v. Amazon.com, 11-1327,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An official at Sunac China Holdings
Ltd. (1918), which cancelled its first bond sale this month, said
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. inadvertently released confidential
information regarding the developer&#8217;s finances to some investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was &#8220;in charge of marketing materials&#8221; for
the bond offer and included 2011 financial forecasts in an
investor presentation, raising compliance concerns, Feng Yanhong,
an investor relations manager for Tianjin-based Sunac, said in a
telephone interview from Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feng wasn&#8217;t authorized to discuss the matter and her
comments don&#8217;t represent the company&#8217;s views, Huang Shu Ping,
assistant to Sunac Chief Executive Officer Sun Hongbin, said in
an e-mailed comment today. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment, and when
contacted by phone Feng said she couldn&#8217;t comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunac, which builds luxury properties in cities including
Beijing and Chongqing, cancelled its bond plans on March 9 and
published some 2011 earnings estimates and targets in a filing
to Hong Kong&#8217;s stock exchange. It fell 3.9 percent when trading
was resumed on March 9 after the stock was suspended a day
earlier, and fell 2.85 percent to HK$2.39 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunac said in the filing that its average gross margin
would exceed 40 percent this year while total targeted
contracted sales may reach 18.3 billion yuan ($2.8 billion).
Aggregate land purchase expenses are forecast to be 5.43 billion
yuan, while construction expenses may be 7.67 billion yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross margins for 2010 were 43.3 percent while total sales
were 6.65 billion yuan, according to the company&#8217;s annual report,
which was published yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunac also hired Deutsche Bank AG and Standard Chartered
Plc to help arrange its bond sale and investor meetings. Mark Bennewith, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in Singapore, declined
to comment. Joyce Li, a spokeswoman for Standard Chartered in
Hong Kong, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft slipped for the second

producer in the Black Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock dropped 0.8 percent to 255.01 rubles by 10:53

&lt;p&gt;Crude for April delivery declined as much as 55 cents, or
0.5 percent, in New York. Chevron may abandon the Val Shatskogo
venture on the Black Sea amid concern the project may not have
enough oil to make drilling profitable, Kommersant reported,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Chevron
also objects to Rosneft&#8217;s demand that the venture be registered
in Russia, according to Kommersant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), told a jury that former
Goldman board member Rajat Gupta violated the firm&#8217;s
confidentiality policies by allegedly telling Raj Rajaratnam
about the firm&#8217;s earnings and strategic plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors called Blankfein to the stand to help build
their case that Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group LLC hedge fund co-
founder, traded on inside information about Goldman Sachs he
obtained from Gupta. Rajaratnam, 53, is being tried in federal
court in Manhattan on insider trading charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein testified that Gupta had confidential information
about Warren Buffett&#8217;s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs in
October 2008, Goldman&#8217;s earnings projections for that quarter
and strategic discussions the firm had about acquiring a
commercial bank or insurance company in late June 2008.
Prosecutors allege that Gupta passed the tips to Rajaratnam,
allowing him to make about $1 million for Galleon in September
2008 and avoid millions in losses the next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are a public company,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
want information about our company to get outside before the
time is appropriate. There is a process and a protocol for
speaking to the outside world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Boehringer
Ingelheim GmbH&#8217;s drug Spiriva reduced flare-ups for patients
with a lung ailment caused by smoking more than GlaxoSmithKline
Plc (GSK)&#8217;s Serevent, according to a study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who
took Spiriva went 42 days longer than those on Serevent before
experiencing exacerbation of symptoms, according to the study
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The yearlong
trial, which involved 7,376 patients, also found that Spiriva
cut the risk of the first severe flare-up requiring
hospitalization by 28 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiriva and Serevent are both standard treatments for COPD
and work in different ways to open the airways and ease
breathlessness. The study shows Spiriva may be better than
Serevent for patients with moderate COPD and a history of recent
exacerbations, Jadwiga Wedzicha, a professor of respiratory
medicine at the University College London Medical School, wrote
in an editorial published alongside the study today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors may choose Spiriva to &#8220; help minimize the risk of
exacerbations from early on, enabling patients to lead active
lives for longer,&#8221; Claus Vogelmeier, a professor in the
department of internal medicine at the University of Marburg and
the study&#8217;s lead investigator, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 12 million people in the U.S. are diagnosed with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and another 12 million
probably have it and don&#8217;t know, according to the National
Institutes of Health. Also known as emphysema, chronic
bronchitis or smoker&#8217;s cough, the illness kills more than
120,000 Americans a year as blockages in the lungs lead to
shortness of breath and disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer, based in Ingelheim, Germany, and New York-based
Pfizer sponsored the research. The German drugmaker is scheduled
to report last year&#8217;s sales of Spiriva on April 5. Sales in 2009
were 2.4 billion euros ($3.39 billion). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Abercrombie 
Fitch Co. (ANF) calls before the teen retailer hosts its first
investor day on April 5, which could boost the company&#8217;s stock
price, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall recommended buying Abercrombie&#8217;s April $55 calls
because retail analyst Michelle Tan said the investor day will
be &#8220;bullish&#8221; and there is potential for high volatility. Tan
rates the New Albany, Ohio-based retailer a &#8220;buy&#8221; and raised
the forecast price to $72 from $70 on March 3. Abercrombie
gained 0.3 percent to $55.05 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Options are not pricing in a significant move,&#8221; the
strategists wrote in a note today. &#8220;We see the potential for
this analyst day to be stock-moving, and therefore do not see
the volatility discount as warranted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abercrombie advanced 23 percent in the past year compared
with an increase of 16 percent for companies dependent on
consumer spending in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. The gain
in U.S. same-store retail sales in February surpassed analysts&#8217;
estimates and confidence among U.S. consumers rose last month to
the highest level in three years, according to a Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index, as a drop in unemployment
helped overcome concern over rising food and fuel costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade starts to profit if the shares close above $57.05
at expiration on April 15, the note said. The April $55 calls
were the second-most active contracts today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) investors re-
elected Apple Inc. (AAPL) Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs to the
board of the entertainment company, rejecting the views of proxy
advisers who say health issues may impair his ability to serve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs, 56, was re-elected with 12 other nominees at the
shareholder meeting today in Salt Lake City, with 74 percent of
the votes cast backing the group, according to a preliminary
count. The Apple executive, absent from the meeting, owns 7.3
percent of Disney and is the largest shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advisory group Glass Lewis  Co. recommended investors
withhold support for Jobs, citing his absence from meetings.
Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc., stopping short of
urging rejection, said Jobs&#8217;s attendance and &#8220;recent leave of
absence from his primary employer, raises questions about his
ability to fulfill his responsibilities as a director.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Walt Disney Company considers itself fortunate to
have Steve Jobs as a member of its board of directors,&#8221; the
Burbank, California-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs has been on medical leave from Cupertino, California-
based Apple since Jan. 17, his third in the past seven years. He
underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004 and had a liver
transplant in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Pay Proposals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney investors at the meeting also approved a company-
backed proposal to seek an annual shareholder vote on executive
pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors rejected a union proposal that would have barred
the company, owner of the ABC television and the ESPN cable TV
network, from employing multiple tests to determine stock grants
and bonuses for executives. The AFL-CIO, with 3.8 million
shares, said it voted against Jobs&#8217;s re-election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger, responding to a
speaker&#8217;s request, agreed to provide a free theme-park pass to
shareholders in attendance, an investor perk the CEO said the
company stopped offering in the mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger also said Aulani, Disney&#8217;s Hawaiian resort, will open
in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney gained 80 cents to $42.24 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have advanced 13
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refinery, near Milan, can process 230,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Exxon,
based in Irving, Texas, has a 75 percent stake in the plant,
according to the company&#8217;s 2009 Financial and Operating Review.
Italy&#8217;s ERG SpA holds the remaining shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude units are the primary processors in a refinery,
turning oil into fuels such as gasoline and diesel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chairman
Lloyd Blankfein will be called by U.S. prosecutors to testify as
a government witness at the insider-trading trial of Galleon
Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter sent March 21 to U.S. District Judge Richard
Holwell, who is presiding over Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial in Manhattan,
prosecutors sought to limit Blankfein&#8217;s cross-examination by
Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In calling Blankfein as a witness, prosecutors in the
office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said they
don&#8217;t want Blankfein to be questioned about &#8220;whether Goldman
Sachs is presently the subject of any pending investigations by
either the Department of Justice or the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8221; or whether the bank bears any
responsibility for the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyer, John Dowd, in a separate letter to
prosecutors March 21, said, &#8220;Today, counsel learned for the
first time that neither Mr. Blankfein nor Goldman Sachs has been
notified that they are a target (or for that matter a subject)
of any active investigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial in the largest crackdown on
hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The Sri Lankan-born
money manager is accused of making $45 million from tips leaked
by corporate insiders and hedge fund traders. He denies
wrongdoing, saying he based his trades on research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. subpoenaed Blankfein to testify about former
Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta and his interactions with
Rajaratnam, prosecutors said in their letter. Blankfein may
testify &#8220;as early as this week,&#8221; Dowd said in a March 20
letter to Holwell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Canaday, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on the government&#8217;s letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim McCarthy, a spokesman for Rajaratnam, didn&#8217;t have an
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court yesterday, Rajiv Goel, who worked in Intel Corp. (INTC)&#8217;s
treasury group, told a federal jury how he passed confidential
information to his &#8220;pal&#8221; Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goel, who is testifying for prosecutors in a bid for
leniency after pleading guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud, said he told Rajaratnam about Intel&#8217;s earnings in 2007
and a $1 billion transaction in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Raj and I were very good friends,&#8221; Goel, 52, testified,
as Rajaratnam watched from across the well of the courtroom in
lower Manhattan. &#8220;He was a good man to me. I was a good pal, a
good person to him, so I gave him the information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goel, who was a managing director at Intel, is the second
government cooperator to directly implicate Rajaratnam in
insider trading. Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey  Co. partner who
also pleaded guilty, earlier testified about information he
leaked about clients. Other government witnesses have also
testified about leaks to Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam says his trades were based on legitimate
research, and his lawyers say Goel is accusing Rajaratnam to
save himself from a long prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Regulator Says Ex-JPMorgan Salesman&#8217;s Ban Must Stay &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s securities watchdog wants a former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. equity salesman&#8217;s life ban for insider trading
reinstated, a lawyer for the city&#8217;s Securities and Futures
Commission told an appeal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Robert Tang for the Court of Appeal, heard
arguments yesterday from lawyers for the regulator and for David
Tsien, whose ban was reduced to 10 years in September, before
ending the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsien, who accepted that he had told two fund managers
JPMorgan was negotiating a share placement for China Overseas
Land  Investment Ltd. (688) in 2004, won the reduction from the
Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal, which said a life ban
for the executive in his early 50s was &#8220;manifestly excessive.&#8221;
The fund managers avoided a HK$1.4 million ($179,542) loss as a
result of the inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Strachan for the SFC said earlier that a life ban is
the normal punishment for insider trading to maintain public
confidence in the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strachan declined to comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsien&#8217;s lawyer Laurence Li said a decision from the three
judges wasn&#8217;t likely for a couple of months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsien was accredited to JPMorgan or its predecessor
companies from 1988 to 2006. His securities dealing and advisory
license was revoked by the regulator in April, 2006, when he
left his job at the bank, according to Li. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong spokeswoman for the bank declined
to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SFC spokesman Ernest Kong declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is between Tsien Pak Cheong David and the
Securities and Futures Commission, CACV226/2010, Hong Kong Court
of Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugmaker Investor Lawsuits Backed by U.S. Supreme Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, allowing a lawsuit over the
withdrawn Zicam cold remedy, gave shareholders more power to sue
drugmakers and biotechnology companies for failing to reveal
indications about dangerous side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices unanimously said Matrixx Initiatives Inc. (MTXX),
acquired in February by HIG Capital LLC, must defend against
accusations that it should have told investors that some Zicam
users had lost their sense of smell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrixx argued that drugmakers need not say anything until
reports of side effects become statistically significant. The
high court yesterday rejected that argument, saying that less
definitive evidence in some cases is enough to require
disclosure under the federal securities laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given that medical professionals and regulators act on
the basis of evidence of causation that is not statistically
significant, it stands to reason that in certain cases
reasonable investors would as well,&#8221; Justice Sonia Sotomayor
wrote for the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrixx stopped selling its Zicam nasal spray and gel in
June 2009 after the Food and Drug Administration warned
consumers the treatments may cause a loss of smell, a condition
known as anosmia. Matrixx says it disagrees with the FDA&#8217;s
findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer representing Matrixx said the company is confident
it will be able to refute the allegations when the case returns
to a federal trial court in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was certainly no intentional or reckless failure to
disclose any information to the public,&#8221; said the lawyer,
Michael Yoder, a partner at O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP in Newport
Beach, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Matrixx Initiatives v. Siracusano, 09-1156,

&lt;p&gt;BT Loses U.K. Appeal Over $68.3 Million Wireless Overcharges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT Group Plc (BT/A), Britain&#8217;s largest phone company, lost an
appeal to a regulator&#8217;s finding that it overcharged wireless
providers such as Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) by 41.7 million pounds
($68.3 million) for access to circuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Competition Appeal Tribunal in London yesterday
rejected BT&#8217;s claim that the regulator, Ofcom, misused a dispute
resolution process by seeking repayment of the overcharges
instead of setting fair prices for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ofcom&#8217;s use of the dispute resolution process in this
case was unimpeachable,&#8221; the tribunal said in the 106-page
ruling. The regulator correctly used its power &#8220;by ordering
that the entire amount of BT&#8217;s overcharge should be repaid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ofcom said in October 2009 that London-based BT should
repay with interest money overcharged from 2004 to 2008 for
access to so-called partial private circuits, which wireless
companies use to connect some customers to phone networks. BT
said in a May 2010 statement that it set aside 52 million pounds
to cover potential repayments in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BT is disappointed with the outcome of the appeal&#8221; and
will now &#8220;consider the range of options open to us for what we
might do next,&#8221; Gemma Thomas, a spokeswoman for BT, said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing in the appeal in May, BT&#8217;s lawyer said the
watchdog&#8217;s finding was &#8220;inherently wrong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s $125 Million Digital Library Settlement Rejected &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s $125 million settlement with publishers and
authors was rejected yesterday by a U.S. judge who said the deal
to create the world&#8217;s biggest digital book library would be
unfair to authors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansive nature of the settlement, calling for
copyright owners to opt out or be automatically included,
&#8220;would simply go too far,&#8221; said U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin
in Manhattan, who was a district-court judge when the case first
came before him. He suggested the settlement would have a better
chance at approval were it revised to cover only those who opt
into the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written now, the settlement &#8220;would grant Google
significant rights to exploit entire books, without permission
of copyright owners,&#8221; Chin wrote. It &#8220;would give Google a
significant advantage over competitors, rewarding it for
engaging in wholesale copying of copyrighted works without
permission, while releasing claims well beyond those presented
in the case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, was sued in
2005 by authors and publishers who said the company was
infringing their copyrights on a massive scale by digitizing
books. The agreement includes a Book Rights Registry to
compensate copyright holders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Yahoo! Inc., along
with the German and French governments, said the agreement would
give Google unfair control over digitized works and expand its
power in the search engine market. Some author groups who
weren&#8217;t part of the settlement said they would lose control of
their copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He shoots down the settlement on three important grounds,
which are the same three grounds that Google is under siege from
around the world,&#8221; said Gary Reback, co-founder of the Open
Book Alliance, the group formed with Amazon.com, Microsoft and
authors groups to oppose the deal. &#8220;It would give Google
dominance in the search area. There are intrusions into the
privacy of people. And Google is taking the copyrighted work of
other people without permission.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Authors Guild v. Google Inc., 05-cv-08136, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JJ&#8217;s Risperdal Letter Violated Consumer Law, Jury Finds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) unit violated consumer-protection laws
by sending South Carolina doctors a misleading letter about the
safety and effectiveness of the antipsychotic drug Risperdal, a
jury concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in state court in Spartanburg, South Carolina,
deliberated more than six hours before finding yesterday that
JJ&#8217;s Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit engaged in
&#8220;unfair and deceptive acts&#8221; by sending a 2003 letter touting
Risperdal as better and safer than competing drugs to more than
7,000 doctors across the state. A judge will decide later
whether the drugmaker should pay $360 million in penalties over
the mailings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The verdict they handed down is just and speaks the
truth,&#8221; John White, a Spartanburg-based lawyer representing the
state, said in an interview. Jurors also found that JJ&#8217;s
warning label information on Risperdal was deceptive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s case centered on drug-safety claims that New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ and Janssen made in November
2003 correspondence to about 700,000 doctors across the U.S.,
including 7,200 in South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration responded with a
warning letter saying JJ made false and misleading claims that
minimized the potentially fatal risks of diabetes and overstated
the drug&#8217;s superiority to competitors&#8217; products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed,&#8221; Greg Panico, a JJ spokesman, said
in a statement. &#8220;Janssen acted responsibly and believes it did
not violate&#8221; South Carolina law, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Carolina officials argued in the case that JJ sent
the letter to protect billions of dollars in sales of the
antipsychotic drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of South Carolina v. Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, 2007-CP-4201438, Circuit Court for Spartanburg
County, South Carolina (Spartanburg). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank Leumi Wins $19 Million U.K. Ruling Over Wachner Trades &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd., the country&#8217;s biggest lender,
won a U.K. lawsuit against ex-New York Stock Exchange board
member Linda Joy Wachner over 13.4 million euros ($19 million)
she lost in foreign-exchange trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wachner, 65, must repay the bank&#8217;s U.K. unit what she lost
in 2008 through dollar-euro transactions that went
&#8220;disastrously wrong,&#8221; Justice Julian Flaux ruled yesterday in
the High Court in London. Flaux rejected Wachner&#8217;s claim that
Bank Leumi irresponsibly classified her as a professional client
with direct access to dealers on the lender&#8217;s U.K. trading
floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite the somewhat helpless image she now seeks to
portray, that was certainly not her self-assessment at the time
as to her foreign-exchange experience and expertise,&#8221; Flaux
said in the 88-page ruling. &#8220;One suspects that any attempt to
reclassify her and restrict her access to the dealing room would
have been met by indignation bordering on outrage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute involves so-called reverse knock-in options,
both in the form of calls and puts, which had losses during the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) in September 2008,
according to the ruling. Wachner, a NYSE director from 1997 to
2000 who had traded foreign exchange with the bank since 2003,
portrayed herself in the case as a &#8220;novice&#8221; who was led into
trades she didn&#8217;t understand, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wachner may take legal action in New York in response to
yesterday&#8217;s ruling, her lawyer Sue Prevezer, with the firm Quinn
Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan LLP in London, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our client does not view this matter as closed,&#8221;
Prevezer said. &#8220;She maintains that she was incorrectly
classified by Bank Leumi and treated as a professional trader
which exposed her to unjustified levels of risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the court vindicated our position,
rejected Ms. Wachner&#8217;s counterclaims and found that the bank
properly discharged its regulatory responsibilities in this
matter,&#8221; Bank Leumi (U.K.) Plc said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA Loss Forecast Was at Least $12 Billion Short, Banks Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA Inc. (MBI)&#8217;s projected losses on structured-finance
guarantees were at least $11.8 billion short when New York
regulators approved the bond insurer&#8217;s 2009 split, 11 banks
seeking to annul the move claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BlackRock Inc. (BLK) unit, hired by the banks for their lawsuit
to analyze potential claims against the insurer at the time of
the regulators&#8217; review, estimated MBIA faced at least $13.8
billion in possible losses on $50.1 billion of securities backed
by home loans and commercial real estate, according to filings
yesterday in New York state Supreme Court. The regulators lacked
a basis to approve the restructuring because MBIA at the time
had loss reserves of about $2 billion, the banks argue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, including UBS AG (UBSN), Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, are fighting a split that moved more
than $5 billion from the company&#8217;s MBIA Insurance Corp. unit
into a new insurer in a bid to jumpstart its business of
guaranteeing state and municipal debt. MBIA and other bond
insurers, which sold guarantees to the banks, were shut out of
the market after rising losses on mortgages they backed prompted
ratings firms to strip them of their top rankings in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;According to BlackRock&#8217;s analysis, the expected insurance
losses on less than one quarter of MBIA Insurance&#8217;s portfolio
rendered MBIA Insurance deeply insolvent as of December 31,
2008,&#8221; the banks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Chaplin, MBIA Inc. president and chief financial
officer, said the banks&#8217; arguments &#8220;are without merit and we
remain confident that the court will affirm the New York State
Insurance Department&#8217;s decision to approve MBIA&#8217;s
transformation, which came after a thorough and careful
analysis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MBIA Insurance Corp. was solvent then and remains so
today, two years and two unqualified audit opinions later,&#8221; he
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks sued under New York state&#8217;s Article 78, which
allows court review of state administrative decisions, to
challenge former insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo&#8217;s
authorization of the split in February 2009. The approval was
based on a &#8220;rushed, cursory and inadequate&#8221; review of facts
and on assumptions that at times were outdated and inflated, the
banks claimed in a 187-page court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Klug, a spokesman for the state insurance department in
Albany, New York, declined to comment. Dinallo couldn&#8217;t be
reached for comment, said Suzanne Elio, a spokeswoman for
Debevoise  Plimpton LLP, the law firm Dinallo joined in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks separately sued the bond insurer to challenge the
restructuring in a lawsuit dismissed by a lower court. The
appeal of that suit, which claimed MBIA made the split to avoid
its obligations to policyholders and to defraud creditors, will
be argued in the state&#8217;s highest court May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Article 78 case is ABN Amro Bank NV v. Dinallo, 601846-
2009, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure Terms May Cause &#8216;Moral Hazard,&#8217; Four States Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four more Republican state attorneys general are opposing a
plan to resolve a nationwide probe of foreclosure and mortgage-
servicing practices because the terms may foster a &#8220;moral
hazard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter yesterday to Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller,
a Democrat who has taken the lead in the investigation, the
officials objected to new documentation requirements and
principal reductions outlined in the proposed settlement
submitted to the country&#8217;s top mortgage-servicing companies this
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News,
was signed by attorneys general Kenneth Cuccinelli of Virginia,
Greg Abbott of Texas, Pam Bondi of Florida and Alan Wilson of
South Carolina. The attorneys general of Oklahoma, Alabama and
Nebraska sent Miller a letter with their objections on March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement offer &#8220;appears to reach well beyond the
scope of our enforcement role, and, in some instances, far
exceeds the scope of the misconduct which was the subject of our
original investigation,&#8221; according to the letter, which was
verified by Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Cuccinelli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key objection is the &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; created by the
proposal to reduce homebuyers&#8217; loans because it &#8220;rewards those
who simply choose not to pay their mortgage,&#8221; the attorneys
general said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoff Greenwood, a spokesman for Miller, said by e-mail
that while there are disagreements among the states, there is
consensus on the need to work together on the foreclosure
problems. The current proposal is &#8220;a starting point,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gottstein and Lauren Bean, a spokesman for Abbott, declined
to comment, as did Mark Plowden, a spokesman for Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Meale, a spokeswoman for Bondi, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail message seeking comment after regular
business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal agencies and state attorneys general on March 3
delivered a 27-page settlement proposal that would set standards
for how mortgage servicers conduct foreclosures and service
loans. Those banks include Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s Jobs Must Answer Questions in ITunes Antitrust Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal magistrate judge ordered Apple Inc. (AAPL) Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs to answer questions in an antitrust
dispute alleging the company operated a music-downloading
monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for consumers who filed the 2005 complaint won
permission to conduct limited questioning of Jobs, under an
order issued March 21 by U.S. Magistrate Judge Howard R. Lloyd
in San Jose, California. The deposition can&#8217;t exceed two hours
and the only topic allowed is changes Apple made to its software
in October 2004 that rendered digital music files engineered by
RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK) inoperable with Apple&#8217;s iPod music player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court finds that Jobs has unique, non-repetitive,
firsthand knowledge about the issues at the center of the
dispute over RealNetworks software,&#8221; Lloyd wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITunes customer Thomas Slattery sued Apple in 2005 seeking
class-action status on behalf of consumers claiming the
Cupertino, California-based company illegally limited consumer
choice by linking the iPod to its iTunes music store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slattery asserted antitrust claims allegedly arising from
Apple encoding its digital music files with proprietary software
called FairPlay. This allowed music files purchased from the
iTunes Store to be played only on iPods, and not using products
by other manufacturers. FairPlay also prevented digital music
sold by other companies&#8217; online stores from being played on
iPods, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple iPod, iTunes Antitrust Litigation, C05-
0037JW, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belvedere Asset Seizure by Hedge Funds Approved by Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belvedere SA (BVD) Chief Executive Officer Jacques Rouvroy and
his deputy Christophe Trylinski lost an appeals court bid to
recover shares in the French vodka-maker seized by hedge funds
in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge fund firms Maple Leaf Capital LLP and Astin Capital
Management Ltd. may get as much as 15 million euros ($21.3
million) from the men under yesterday&#8217;s ruling by an appeals
court in Dijon, France, a lawyer for the funds said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a question of weeks until they are out of
Belvedere&#8217;s capital structure,&#8221; said Fabrice Marchisio, a
lawyer for the funds. The shares have been frozen pending the
appeals court decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maple Leaf funds seized the shares, which directly and
indirectly account for about 15.5 percent of Belvedere&#8217;s share
capital. They were executing a 2009 ruling by the High Court in
London ordering the men to compensate the funds for losses
incurred on stock options they had subscribed to in exchange for
financing the executives&#8217; efforts to regain control of the
beverage company in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order can&#8217;t be enforced because the assets are owned
jointly with Rouvroy&#8217;s and Trylinski&#8217;s wives, Belvedere lawyer
Alain Ribeyre said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Maple Leaf cannot touch any of their estates,&#8221; Ribeyre
said. &#8220;Neither their shares, nor the buildings, nor any of
their assets&#8221; because all are jointly owned with the men&#8217;s
wives, who weren&#8217;t parties to the contract with the funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experimental drug made by Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) slowed deadly pancreatic cancer in a study that revealed a
new treatment approach that tricks the immune system to attack
tissue protecting tumors, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of 21 patients with incurable pancreatic cancer had
their tumors shrink after being given the drug, known as CP-
870,893, along with Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)&#8217;s Gemzar chemotherapy,
according to the study published today in the journal Science.
The median time before the disease progressed was 5.6 months
compared with 2.3 months expected for patients taking just
chemotherapy, researchers said. More surprising, biopsied tissue
samples showed the treatment didn&#8217;t do what scientists expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed to activate immune system T-cells to attack the
tumor, tests revealed the Pfizer drug instead spurred an
abundance of white blood cells, called macrophages. Those cells,
which normally protect tumors, had been retrained to attack the
cellular structures supporting the cancer, the scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until now, we thought the immune system needed to attack
the cancer directly in order to be effective,&#8221; said lead author
Robert Vonderheide, a cancer professor at the University of
Pennsylvania&#8217;s Abramson Cancer Center, in an interview. &#8220;We
think that this may be a general approach for treating other
types of solid tumors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the four patients who had their tumors
shrink, 11 patients had their disease stabilize. The cancer
eventually progressed for all of the patients in the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Evidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that researchers understand how the drug worked, they
are working on ways to boost the macrophage response,
Vonderheide said. The trial was in the first round of human
tests typically used to evaluate safety and dosing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, is currently
conducting two early tests using the drug to treat melanoma,
said Vonderheide, who is working on one of the studies, which
combines the treatment with another experimental Pfizer
antibody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine still requires larger successful tests, which
typically take years to conduct, before the New York-based
company might seek regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 38 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $20.30 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer kills about 37,000 people in the U.S.
each year, according to estimates by the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Just 4 percent of patients are
still alive five years after being diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, based in
Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report published today includes clinical trial results
and laboratory results in mice. It is an example of a new model
of research that speeds discoveries by taking results in humans
back to the lab to conduct tests in genetically engineered mice.
The study team was made up of laboratory scientists and clinical
doctors, Vonderheide said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Aruba Networks
Inc. (ARUN) call spreads because the company may benefit from tablet
computer adoption and has a 30 percent chance of being acquired
in the next 12 months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall recommended buying Aruba&#8217;s July $33 calls and selling
January $40 calls in a trade known as a &#8220;spread&#8221; because July
implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, is &#8220;in-
line&#8221; with three-month historical volatility but &#8220;high&#8221; over
one year. The Sunnyvale, California-based builder of wireless
networks rallied 6 percent to $33.29 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in the early stages of what our tech team views as
a strong enterprise tablet adoption cycle,&#8221; the strategists
wrote in a note today. &#8220;Our analyst sees a high (30 percent)
likelihood that Aruba is acquired in 12 months,&#8221; citing data
networking analyst Kent Schofield. Options show &#8220;no premium for
mergers and acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schofield rates Aruba a &#8220;buy&#8221; and has a price forecast of
$39 on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in California
strengthened as Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s Torrance refinery in
California reported a leak and emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tubing leak has been stopped and there was no impact on
production, according to the filing with the California
Emergency Management Agency. Gasoline inventories on the West
Coast fell 1.1 million barrels to 31.1 million barrels last
week, the Energy Department reported yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend gasoline, or carbob, in
Los Angeles, increased 0.9 cent to 20 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:19 p.m.
local time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the
highest level since Feb. 18. Prompt delivery rose 2.54 cents to
$3.245 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same fuel in San Francisco gained 0.9 cent to 16.5
cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gasoline stocks are at their lowest level since
January, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Portland rose 0.75 cent to 5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., which accepts
physical gold as collateral for trading securities, has become a
custodian of Comex silver inventories, according to the owner of
the New York exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan became a depository on March 17, according to
Chris Grams, a spokesman for Comex owner CME Group Inc. The bank
had 30,844 ounces of silver eligible for delivery as of March
22, exchange data show. Total holdings in Comex-monitored
warehouses were 104.27 million ounces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver prices have more than doubled in the past year and
gold reached a record today as investors bought precious metals
as a hedge against inflation and turmoil in financial markets.
New York-based JPMorgan said last month it expects to accept
additional precious metals and commodities as collateral later
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is further indication that gold and silver are being
treated more like a currency,&#8221; said Matt Zeman, a market
strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver futures for May delivery rose 17.7 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $37.375 an ounce at 1:51 p.m. on the
Comex, after touching a 31-year high of $38.18. The price
reached a record $50.35 in 1980. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has also been authorized to hold gold, platinum
and palladium for delivery against precious metals contracts
traded on the Comex and Nymex, according to Grams, the exchange
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the inventories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper price risk is moving to the
&#8220;downside&#8221; on turbulence in the Middle East and North Africa
and this month&#8217;s earthquake in Japan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The anticipatory pricing that pushed copper prices beyond
$10,000 a metric ton earlier in the quarter is now encountering
new headwinds,&#8221; analysts including Joshua Crumb in London said
in a report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the metal is likely to remain above $9,000 a ton for
now, the bank said, citing a probable return of Chinese buying
and a &#8220;tightening impact&#8221; from Japan. That will create
&#8220;demand-pull&#8221; support for copper prices, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for three-month delivery traded at $9,743 a ton at
4:06 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange. Prices reached $10,190
on Feb. 15. Imports of refined copper into China, the world&#8217;s
biggest consumer, dropped to a two-year low in February, customs
figures showed on March 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it still expects supply shortfalls in
the &#8220;medium term&#8221; that will push inventories toward
&#8220;critically low&#8221; levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) won approval for the
first &#8220;completely new exploration&#8221; in the deep waters of the
Gulf of Mexico after BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s oil spill last year, a regulator
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will drill in Keathley Canyon Block 736 in 6,750
feet (2,057 meters) of water, about 216 miles off the Louisiana
coast, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation
and Enforcement said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Chevron is the fifth company permitted to resume work
in the area following the last year&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon rig
explosion, it&#8217;s the first to be allowed to tap a reservoir that
has never produced, according to the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 20 cents to $105.68 at 11:57 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 16 percent
this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble Energy Inc. (NBL), BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP), ATP Oil  Gas Corp.
and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) have received U.S. permits to resume work
halted after BP&#8217;s April 20 spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, will use equipment
from Marine Well Containment Co. in case of a well blowout, the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial drilling on the well began a year ago, and was
suspended on June 9, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) hired Ben Solomon
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to run commercial-mortgage backed
securities trading as banks ramp up groups dedicated to real
estate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon, who traded derivatives tied to commercial real
estate loans at New York-based Goldman Sachs, will run secondary
commercial-mortgage backed bond trading at Deutsche Bank,
according to a person familiar with the move. Renee Calabro, a
spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based lender, confirmed the hire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is seeking to bulk up trading as Wall Street
firms have issued about $8 billion of commercial-mortgage backed
securities this year, compared with $11.5 billion in all of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank and
UBS AG sold $2.2 billion of the securities last month in the
largest offering since 2007 before the market seized up amid the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of movement&#8221; between banks following

&lt;p&gt;Bonds of DirectBuy Holdings Inc.,
the consumer club being sued over its sales practices, plunged
23 percent after the company told investors new memberships
declined and the chief financial officer quit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $335 million of 12 percent notes due in February 2017
dropped as much as 31.7 cents on the dollar to 67.5 cents March
23 before climbing back to 76.5 cents yesterday, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The company sold the second-lien debt
through a private offering led by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in
January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirectBuy, based in Merrillville, Indiana, franchises
stores in the U.S. and charges customers membership fees from
$2,900 to $7,000 in exchange for the right to buy appliances,
furniture, electronics and other household items at wholesale
prices. The company disclosed on a March 22 call with investors
that Chief Financial Officer Mark Boggess resigned and new
memberships declined for the second straight quarter, according
to an analyst note by Knight Capital Group Inc.&#8217;s Kevin McCormick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call, limited to bondholders, qualified prospective
investors and certain securities analysts, &#8220;reportedly went
poorly, with disclosures including weak membership sales, a
lower club count and the resignation of the CFO helping pull
bonds down sharply,&#8221; McCormick said in the note distributed
yesterday. He declined to discuss results further when contacted
by telephone and said he wasn&#8217;t on DirectBuy&#8217;s conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boggess didn&#8217;t return three telephone calls seeking
comment. Michael Georgeff, a public relations specialist for
DirectBuy, didn&#8217;t return two phone calls. Jamie Elias, a partner
at DirectBuy&#8217;s Miami-based owner Trivest Partners LP, didn&#8217;t
return two e-mails or three phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DirectBuy Model &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of DirectBuy&#8217;s revenue is derived from its share of
new and renewal membership fees from franchisees, Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service said in a Jan. 7 note announcing it rated the
bonds B2, five levels below investment grade, with a &#8220;stable&#8221;
outlook. The business is closely linked to home sales and
renovations, the Moody&#8217;s analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New membership sales have declined since the fiscal year
ended July 2007, McCormick said in his note. They fell 33
percent to 73,778 in the fiscal year ended in July; dropped 21
percent for the quarter ended October 31 compared with the
previous year, McCormick said. &#8220;We understand&#8221; they fell again
in the period ending Jan. 31, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another company conference call is scheduled for March 28,
McCormick said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to Housing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DirectBuy&#8217;s appeal to prospective new members is
generally the ability to recoup the membership fee fairly
quickly via a large purchase, which is typically home
improvement oriented,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s analysts led by Charlie O&#8217;Shea,
a senior analyst, said in the January statement. &#8220;The ties to
the overall condition of the housing market are reasonably
significant, resulting in a relatively high risk profile given
the current weak housing market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moody&#8217;s analysts didn&#8217;t respond to a request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchases of new U.S. homes unexpectedly declined in
February to the slowest pace on record and prices dropped to the
lowest level since December 2003, the Commerce Department said
March 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In U.S. District Court in Connecticut, plaintiffs in a
class-action suit filed in April 2009 said DirectBuy receives
&#8220;tens of millions of dollars in &#8216;kickbacks&#8217; from manufacturers
and suppliers out of the purchase prices paid for products by
DirectBuy members, thereby resulting in class members paying
more than the &#8216;direct&#8217; price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dueling Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge William Garfinkel gave preliminary
approval to a settlement in December in which DirectBuy didn&#8217;t
admit wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Virginia sued DirectBuy in January in civil court
under the state&#8217;s consumer credit and protection act, claiming
it induced customers to buy memberships with &#8220;high-pressure
sales practices&#8221; and &#8220;deceptions and falsehoods,&#8221; according
to the complaint in Kanawha County Circuit Court by state
Attorney General Darrell McGraw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DirectBuy pressures consumers with its &#8216;now or never
tactic,&#8217;&#8221; McGraw&#8217;s office said in a Jan. 26 statement.
&#8220;DirectBuy warns consumers that anyone who leaves the premises
without joining the club will be banned from joining forever.
This threat is false, misleading, and unconscionable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Steps In &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garfinkel, the federal judge in Connecticut, ruled on Feb.
1 that the West Virginia lawsuit violates the preliminary
settlement order and enjoined the state from pursuing its
claims. West Virginia filed an objection to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivest, a private equity firm, purchased DirectBuy for an
undisclosed amount in November 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debtwire reported Boggess&#8217;s resignation on March 22 without
citing the source of its information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: Wilson et al v. DirectBuy Inc. et al,
09-CV-00590, United States District Court, Connecticut (New
Haven) and State of West Virginia v. DirectBuy Inc., Circuit
Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) hired Ben Solomon
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to run commercial-mortgage backed
securities trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon, who traded derivatives tied to commercial real
estate loans at New York-based Goldman Sachs, will run secondary
commercial-mortgage backed bond trading at Deutsche Bank,
according to a person familiar with the move. Renee Calabro a
Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, confirmed the hire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt-based lender is bulking up in trading
commercial-mortgage-backed securities as banks have issued about
$8 billion of the debt this year, compared with $11.5 billion in
all of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche
Bank and UBS AG sold $2.2 billion of the securities last month
in the largest offering since 2007 before the market seized up
amid the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. has added an
index of global foreign-exchange volatility that tracks options
on currencies of major and developing nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global index is designed to complement two JPMorgan
indexes that follow implied volatility on major currencies and
emerging-market currencies, which the bank began in 2006.
Implied volatility, which traders quote and use to set option
prices, signals the expected pace of swings in the underlying
currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite much faster growth in the emerging market options
market turnover over the past decade, Group of 10 currencies
still constitute almost 85 percent of foreign exchange options
turnover globally,&#8221; JPMorgan currency strategists John Normand
in London and Arindam Sandilya in New York wrote in a report to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the world&#8217;s sixth biggest currency trader,
according to Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc.  Deutsche
Bank AG is the largest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank rebalanced the weighting of options on individual
currency pairs in its two original indexes based on average
daily turnover figures reported in the latest Bank for
International Settlements&#8217; triennial survey released in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied Volatility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s indexes are formulated from implied volatility
on three-month options, with individual weightings based on BIS
daily turnover percentages. JPMorgan averaged the prior two BIS
triennial surveys, using those from 2010 and 2007. Previously,
the weightings used the 2004 and 2001 survey data. All
currencies are versus the U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implied volatility on the global index is 10.42 percent
today, down from a peak during the past 12 months of 16.8
percent touched in May. The major nations&#8217; index was at 10.69
percent and that tracking emerging currencies was at 8.93
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s index tracking major exchange rates was expanded
to include nine currencies versus the dollar, up from six.
Movements in New Zealand dollar, Norwegian krone and Swedish
krona options have been added to those for the currencies of
Japan, the euro zone, the U.K., France, Italy and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options on the euro against the dollar account for the
largest weighting in the major index at 36.3 percent, while the
dollar against the yen accounts for the second-largest at 31.8
percent. These were the top two weighted pairs in the original
index as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign-exchange trading rose 20 percent to $4 trillion a
day on average in the three years to 2007, according to details
from the 2010 BIS triennial survey reported in August. Some 85
percent of currency trades in the three-year period involved the
dollar while Europe&#8217;s single currency portion was 39 percent,
the BIS report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s emerging-market implied volatility index was
expanded to track three-month options on 13 currencies against
the U.S. dollar, up from 7. Among the additions, were the
currencies of Turkey, India and Hungary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Anderson, a senior forward on
the Yale University men&#8217;s hockey team, isn&#8217;t waiting for a call
from the New York Rangers or Detroit Red Wings. He already has
been drafted by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson, 23, interned with JP Morgan Chase last summer and
will forgo an opportunity to play hockey professionally to join
the firm&#8217;s sales and trading department after graduation this
spring. For now, he said his focus is on tonight&#8217;s start to the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, where the
Bulldogs are four wins from the school&#8217;s first national title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an exciting time, especially considering where we
were as freshmen,&#8221; Anderson said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We
are a well-rounded team that is dangerous offensively, but also
solid on defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson joined a Bulldogs team in 2007 that was 11-17-3 in
its previous season and hadn&#8217;t made it past the ECAC Hockey
quaterfinals in nine years. Yale has since won two conference
championships and now has qualified for three straight NCAA
tournaments, a program record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bulldogs (27-6-1) achieved the school&#8217;s first No. 1
national ranking on Dec. 6 and earned the overall top seed in
college hockey&#8217;s national tournament. Yale opens the single-
elimination event against the U.S. Air Force Academy in the East
Regional in Bridgeport, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bulldogs lead all Division I teams in both offense and
defense. Yale scores 4.29 goals a game and allows 2.00 goals a
game. The team won the ECAC Hockey conference championship last
weekend in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by outscoring Colgate
University and Cornell University by a cumulative score of 10-0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson&#8217;s &#8216;Hardest Decision&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A native of Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Anderson
played three years of junior hockey in Canada before attending
Yale. He said that even though there are a number of
professional hockey opportunities next year, he will end his on-
ice career to pursue other passions, such as finance and
business. He consulted family, friends and colleagues on what he
said was the hardest decision of his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An opportunity with JPMorgan does not come along every
day, and if I pursued hockey, I don&#8217;t know if it would be around
in the future,&#8221; Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Morrison, who graduated in 1967 as Yale&#8217;s career
scoring leader, made a similar decision. Morrison, 65, played
alongside Herb Brooks while leading the U.S. hockey team in
scoring at the 1968 Olympics in Grenoble, France. He opted to
attend Harvard Business School instead of playing professional
hockey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do I ever regret it? Yes, I do,&#8221; Morrison said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;You always wonder whether you could have
made it professionally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison&#8217;s Resume &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison worked on Wall Street at Kidder, Peabody  Co.
after graduating from Harvard, and in 1989, co-founded Goldner
Hawn Johnson  Morrison Inc., an investment firm in Minneapolis.
Morrison, the managing director of the firm&#8217;s investment team,
still plays hockey three times a week, and said he is both proud
and impressed when he watches the 2010-11 Bulldogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are not terribly big, but most of them are smaller
forwards that can really fly and they move the puck awfully
well,&#8221; Morrison said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Yale&#8217;s fifth overall appearance in the NCAA
tournament, where the team is 2-4. Last year the Bulldogs
advanced to the NCAA regional finals, where they lost 9-7 to
Boston College, the eventual national champion. Yale junior
forward Charles Brockett, who will intern in the securities
department at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) this summer, said that
experience will benefit the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Been Here Before&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a team loaded with upperclassmen who have been
here before,&#8221; Brockett said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We know
how hard it is to win this thing and we know what we need to do
to prepare.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is led by sophomore forward Andrew Miller and
junior forward Brian O&#8217;Neill, who have combined for 30 goals and
59 assists. Senior goaltender Ryan Rondeau, the ECAC Hockey
Championships Most Outstanding Player, leads the nation with a
1.83 goals-against average and is second with a .932 save
percentage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bulldogs have scored three or more goals in six
straight games, and have lost once in 10 games since Feb. 11.
Brockett, 22, said the team is more focused now than it has been
at any other point this season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We went into this season with one goal in mind, and
that&#8217;s winning the national championship,&#8221; Brockett said. &#8220;We
are going to be disappointed unless that happens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title Game &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yale wins tonight, it will play either Union College,
based in Schenectady, New York, or the University of Minnesota
Duluth tomorrow. The NCAA tournament finishes with the national
championship game on April 9 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson said he tries not to think about Yale&#8217;s next loss
likely being his last competitive hockey game. Instead, he said
that he and the Bulldogs remain driven toward the goal they set
at the beginning of the season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would mean more than anything I have accomplished in
my life,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there could be any
better way to go out than to win that national title.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil traded near a two-week high in
New York as continued fighting in Libya fanned concern that
unrest in the Middle East will further disrupt supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, at about $105
a barrel today, are heading for their first weekly gain in three
weeks as Allied warplanes renewed strikes against ground forces
loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi. JPMorgan Chase  Co.
raised its forecast for London-traded Brent crude to $118 a
barrel, citing the conflict in North Africa in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So long as ongoing problems in the Middle East continue
to elevate risks of a further supply disruption, there is a
strong likelihood of a price spike in the second quarter as the
market demands additional oil to meet summer demand,&#8221; JPMorgan
analysts led by New York-based Lawrence Eagles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was up 6 cents at $105.66 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. London time. It
earlier climbed to $105.88. Brent crude for May settlement
slipped 13 cents to $115.59 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London, after settling yesterday at the highest
since March 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York prices have climbed 4.5 percent this week, the
first gain in three, and are up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The commodity rose to a 2 1/2-year high of $106.95 on March 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent will average $118 a barrel in the second quarter
because of export halts in Libya, JPMorgan said in its monthly
report. Prices may &#8220;spend some time&#8221; above $120 and reach as
high as $130, according to the second-largest U.S. bank. Futures
last traded at that level in July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tolerance Friday&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York crude has rallied 25 percent since protests began
Feb. 15 in Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. The conflict is the bloodiest in a wave of
uprisings that has toppled the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt
and spread to Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Oman, Syria and Yemen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yemen&#8217;s strengthening opposition movement plans to march to
the Presidential Palace today and hold nationwide protests as
government supporters pour into Sana&#8217;a, the capital, for a rally
dubbed &#8220;Tolerance Friday.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya&#8217;s crude exports may be curbed for months due to
sanctions and damage to production facilities, the International
Energy Agency said March 15. The country is the third-biggest
producer in Africa and holds the continent&#8217;s largest reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipments from OPEC will drop to the lowest since October
because of Libya&#8217;s civil war, according to tanker-tracker Oil
Movements in Halifax, England. The producers&#8217; group, which pumps
40 percent of the world&#8217;s crude, may raise official output
targets at its next meeting June 8, said David Kirsch, an
analyst at PFC Energy, a consultant in Kansas City. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued the
Florida law firm of Ben-Ezra  Katz to force it to return files
of foreclosure cases in which the firm represented the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in a complaint filed March 25 in federal
court in Miami that the files include thousands of original
promissory notes, mortgages and other documents that &#8220;evidence
and secure&#8221; loans worth more than $400 million. The New York-
based bank seeks a court order forcing Ben-Ezra to return the
files and unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida attorney general&#8217;s office is investigating law
firms in the state that handle residential foreclosure cases on
behalf of lenders. The probes focus on whether the firms were
&#8220;fabricating and/or presenting false and misleading documents
in foreclosure cases,&#8221; according to the attorney general&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 25, the attorney general said she had reached a
$2 million settlement with one of the firms, the Law Offices of
Marshall C. Watson. Ben-Ezra, based in Fort Lauderdale, is one
of four law firms still under investigation, the office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan terminated Ben-Ezra on March 8, according to the
complaint. The law firm refuses to return the files because it
claims it is owed $5 million, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are working to resolve the issues raised in the
lawsuit,&#8221; Ben-Ezra said today in a statement. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
believe at this point that the differences are insurmountable,
and we are seeking to reach a satisfactory conclusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate lawsuit filed March 14 in state court in
Miami, the law firm of David J. Stern sued Chase Home Finance,
claiming the firm was owed $398,980. Stern&#8217;s firm is also under
investigation by the Florida attorney general&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan Chase Bank v. Ben-Ezra  Katz,
11-60655, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassino, the central Italian city
that cost taxpayers 2 million euros ($2.8 million) because of an
interest-rate swap with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), was taken to court
earlier this month over its unwillingness to disclose how it
lost the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, brought by Bloomberg News, asks an
administrative court to enforce a ruling by a regional ombudsman
that Italian law requires the city to release documents on a
swap agreement between Cassino and a unit of Bear Stearns Cos.,
which JPMorgan bought in 2008. The New York-based bank and
Cassino agreed in 2009 to terminate the contract, without
disclosing financial terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of 33,000 people, the site of some of the worst 
fighting in World War II, withheld the documents because of the
potential damages it would incur if it breached a confidentiality
clause with JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
the city said in a letter to Bloomberg last month. The news
service has a &#8220;direct, concrete&#8221; interest and should be granted
access to the swap file, the regional ombudsman of Lazio said in
its final ruling on the case in December, citing a 1990 Italian
freedom of information law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a need for greater transparency and this would
create an important precedent for accountability,&#8221; said Gustavo Piga, author of &#8220;Derivatives and Public Debt Management,&#8221; and
a professor at Tor Vergata University in Rome. &#8220;Knowing the
scale of the loss and how it was incurred is helpful to
understand how the finances are being managed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is named as an interested party in the lawsuit
because of the potential impact on the firm. A spokeswoman for
the lender in Milan declined to comment on the suit. Cassino
city officials didn&#8217;t respond to e-mails and telephone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unavoidable Obligation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt isn&#8217;t &#8220;only a contract with a bank but an unavoidable
obligation for future generations,&#8221; Bloomberg said in its
claim, filed at the administrative court in Latina, near Rome,
on March 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is separately on trial in Italy in the first
European criminal case involving swaps. The bank, together with
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Depfa Bank Plc and UBS AG, faces charges in
Milan for fraud for tricking the municipal government into
buying the contracts. Meanwhile, JPMorgan is among banks that
are suing Italian municipalities in London to enforce the swaps.
The cases are pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest bank, lost a case over
interest-rate swaps last week, the first ruling by the country&#8217;s
highest court on derivative sales. The court said the Frankfurt-
based lender didn&#8217;t adequately disclose risks and ordered it to
pay 541,074 euros in damages to its customer, Ille Papier
Service GmbH. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Extremely Risky&#8217; Bet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with shrinking income and growing expenses, Italian
cities bought swaps that would typically offer lower interest
expenses in the near-term, while exposing the buyers to the risk
of increased interest costs in later years. Italian cities faced
losses of at least 1.2 billion euros from the transactions as of
June, data compiled by the central bank show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassino entered a seven-year swap with Bear Stearns in 2003
to adjust payments on about 22 million euros of debt. The swap
switched the city&#8217;s 4.7 percent fixed interest rate payment for
a variable rate, according to a June 2009 report by Italy&#8217;s
financial police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city paid a floating rate based on the U.S.-dollar
London interbank offered rate, an &#8220;extremely risky&#8221; bet given
that Libor was at a record low, the police said in testimony to
the Italian Senate in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month U.S. dollar Libor was at a 1 percent in June
2003 and by January 2006 had surpassed 4.7 percent, according to
data compiled by the British Bankers&#8217; Association. The measure
climbed as high as 5.7 percent in September 2007 as credit
markets began to seize up, before declining to a record low of
0.25 percent by December 2009 after policy makers cut rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipalities from Cassino to Jefferson County, Alabama,
as well as institutions such as Harvard University have lost
money on swaps aimed at cutting costs that instead raised them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard completed agreements in December 2004 that locked
in interest rates on $2.3 billion of bonds. The benchmark
overnight interest rate set by the U.S. Federal Reserve was then
2.25 percent. The swaps lost value as interest rates fell in
2008 to near zero, and the university paid almost $1 billion to
terminate the agreements in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is investigating sewer
financing by Jefferson County in a nationwide probe of an
alleged conspiracy by Wall Street banks to rig bids and fix
prices on derivatives sold to municipalities, according to court
papers. In Italy, some local governments stopped making payments
and others seek to recover fees they say were hidden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battle site &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police said Cassino was one of its most significant
cases of &#8220;irregularities&#8221; involving derivative purchases,
without elaborating. The city and its mountaintop abbey were
almost entirely destroyed during the battle of Monte Cassino in
1944 amid the Allied drive to the Italian capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local government was put under special administration
by the prefect, the state&#8217;s representative in the city, in July
after the assembly failed to approve the town&#8217;s budget and the
elected mayor stepped down. Off-balance-sheet debt and lower
income were placing pressure on the town&#8217;s finances, the mayor
said in a statement in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News sued the European Central Bank in December
to make it release documents showing how Greece used derivatives
to hide its fiscal deficit and helped trigger the region&#8217;s
sovereign debt crisis. The case is pending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s South African
unit said it will invest 475 million rand ($69 million) in as
many as 10 black-owned software development companies to fulfil
its obligations to the government to uplift the country&#8217;s black
majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will support these companies over a period of seven
years,&#8221; Mteto Nyati, the unit&#8217;s managing director, said by phone
from Johannesburg yesterday. &#8220;Our consultants will work with
them to put together a package and a business plan. We will fund
whatever is relevant for that particular company to meet its own
stated objectives of growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s government has been pushing companies to
sell stakes to black investors and hire and promote more black
staff to address racial imbalances that persist in Africa&#8217;s
largest economy, 17 years after the end of all-white rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has a global policy of not selling stakes
in its units, was granted permission to implement an alternative
empowerment plan that entailed investing the equivalent of 4
percent of its sales in black-owned enterprises over seven
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will sign agreements later today with four
software developers that were selected from 683 applicants, the
company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. They are:
Chillisoft, a developer of software used in health care,
manufacturing and other industries; Maxxor, which&#160;specializes in
mobile-phone and web-based computer applications; BUI, a
computer-security company; and Home Grown Business Integrations,
which develops electricity management systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment Management Corp. (WAC),
the Tampa, Florida-based mortgage servicer and investor, agreed
to acquire GTCS Holdings LLC from Centerbridge Capital Partners
LLC for $745 million as it expands loan servicing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire transaction, including debt, is valued at $1.065
billion, Walter said today in a regulatory filing. GTCS, known
as Green Tree and based in St. Paul, Minnesota, provides
services such as billing and collection on a $37 billion
portfolio, including residential mortgages, manufactured housing
loans and consumer loans, the filing shows. After the deal,
Walter will no longer qualify as a real estate investment trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the acquisition of Green Tree, Walter Investment
will be uniquely positioned to capture a significant share of
the growing specialty mortgage-services sector,&#8221; said Mark J.
O&#8217;Brien, Walter&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, in a
separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter will issue 1.8 million shares to the seller and $765
million in new debt to acquire Green Tree&#8217;s equity, repay Green
Tree&#8217;s obligations and cover expenses of the transaction,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This acquisition allows Walter to capitalize on the
company&#8217;s strong market share and fantastic management,&#8221; New
York-based Centerbridge said in a statement. The private-equity
company purchased Green Tree for an undisclosed amount in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) advised Walter, and Simpson Thacher
 Bartlett LLP provided legal counsel. Morgan Stanley (MS) advised
Green Tree with Willkie Farr  Gallagher LLP providing legal
counsel. Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised the seller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), the world&#8217;s
biggest credit-card issuer by purchases, introduced a payment
system for smartphones and computers that competes with Visa
Inc. (V), MasterCard Inc. (MA) and PayPal Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve, as it&#8217;s called, is a prepaid electronic wallet that
can be funded by linking with a checking account, debit card or
credit card, said Dan Schulman, group president of enterprise
growth at New York-based AmEx. Starting today, Serve customers
may send money to each other through smartphones, shop online
and receive plastic cards for use at bricks-and-mortar retailers
that accept American Express. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmEx lacks a branch network and doesn&#8217;t issue debit cards
linked to checking accounts, the world&#8217;s fastest-growing payment
method. That has put AmEx at a competitive disadvantage with
lenders including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), the two biggest U.S. banks measured by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is really the first time that American Express is
going to be able to address those consumers that typically would
utilize either a debit card or checking account,&#8221; Schulman, 53,
said in a phone interview last week. &#8220;There&#8217;s a large cultural
shift happening at American Express in terms of us really moving
to becoming more of a software- and platform-based company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global consumer spending and cash transactions on Visa and
MasterCard debit cards climbed 20 percent to $3.95 trillion last
year, according to data from the companies. In the U.S.,
spending on debit cards rose 15 percent in 2010, compared with
6.3 percent for credit cards, according to the Nilson Report, an
industry newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person-to-Person &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmEx, the world&#8217;s third-biggest payments network, is
looking to take market share from PayPal, a unit of San Jose,
California-based EBay Inc. (EBAY) and larger rivals Visa and
MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York. Visa, based in San
Francisco, said in a statement on March 16 that it will let U.S.
consumers send funds worldwide from one eligible Visa card
account to another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s offering doesn&#8217;t require consumers to open a new
account, which is &#8220;a key value proposition,&#8221; Elvira Swanson, a
spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview today. Joanne Trout
of MasterCard said person-to-person payments already are part of
its network and used by banks that issue its cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal is &#8220;perfectly positioned&#8221; to provide customers
with an e-wallet, said spokesman Anuj Nayar. &#8220;Commerce is going
to change more in the next two years than it has in the last 10,
and PayPal looks forward to leading the way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revolution Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, AmEx spent $305 million to buy Internet-based
payment processor Revolution Money from the investment firm run
by Steve Case, the co-founder of America Online Inc. Revolution
Money became the technological foundation for Serve, said
Schulman, who joined AmEx in August from Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers can open accounts at www.serve.com and download
an application to their Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhones and iPads, or
smartphones using the Android operating system, Schulman said.
Users of Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)&#8217;s BlackBerry will have access
later this year, he said. There&#8217;s no initial cost for opening an
account, a minimum balance isn&#8217;t required and deposited funds
don&#8217;t expire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees for funding accounts with credit cards are waived for
the first six months. After that, AmEx will charge 2.9 percent
of the transaction total plus 30 cents, which is competitive
with PayPal&#8217;s pricing, said Joanna Lambert, an AmEx spokeswoman.
There&#8217;s no charge for using debit cards or checking accounts to
fund a Serve account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Good Business&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers can shop online without being required to enter
payment credentials, such as a credit-card number and mailing
address, each time. They also will be able to send money person-
to-person in the U.S. by entering a personal-identification
number and recipient&#8217;s e-mail address. That feature will be
available worldwide later this year, Schulman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These remittances back and forth both domestically and
internationally can be quite a good business for us,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmEx also is partnering with companies to offer coupons
that can be clicked on a website, loaded into a Serve account
and applied when a consumer shops online or in a store, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Underwhelming&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I found it a little underwhelming,&#8221; said Beth Robertson,
director of payments research for Javelin Strategy  Research,
based in Pleasanton, California. &#8220;What is going to drive people
to actually use this versus similar things already in the
market?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product is a way for AmEx to position itself as mobile
payments expand, said Mike Taiano, an analyst at Sandler O&#8217;Neill
 Partners in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to know how well it will be
received by consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Account holders will receive plastic cards linked to their
e-wallets, with the Serve logo on the front and a blue box on
the back to signal to merchants and consumers that it may be
used at any of the millions of locations accepting AmEx,
Schulman said. Customers using the card will get one free
withdrawal a month from an automated teller machine and be
charged $2 for each subsequent withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Serve card is labeled as a &#8220;prepaid&#8221; product, which
means it&#8217;s exempt from caps on debit-card transaction fees
mandated by the Dodd-Frank law that overhauled the financial
industry last year, Schulman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12-Cent Cap &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve in December proposed capping
interchange fees charged to merchants at 12 cents a transaction,
replacing a formula that averages 1.14 percent of the purchase
price. Such a cap may reduce annual revenue by $12 billion for
U.S. lenders including Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America, New York-based JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), based in
San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants who currently accept AmEx credit cards pay fees
totaling about 2.5 percent of the purchase price. Those
retailers &#8220;generally&#8221; will pay a lower rate for accepting
Serve payments, said Lambert, who didn&#8217;t elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express climbed 13 cents to $45.72 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 6.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s decision to
be the sole lender on a $20 billion loan to ATT Inc. (T) is a
&#8220;credit negative&#8221; for the bank and may encourage other lenders
to take on more risk, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPM&#8217;s large ATT commitment highlights how the risk
profile of a capital markets business can change quickly,&#8221;
analyst Sean Jones wrote today in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the lone underwriter on the bridge loan to ATT
in its $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG&#8217;s U.S. wireless
unit T-Mobile USA Inc. Moody&#8217;s called the deal a credit negative
for JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate debt because it shows the bank&#8217;s
willingness to finance riskier deals to win a spot as an adviser
on the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We assumed they would sell down the loan,&#8221; Jones said in
an interview. JPMorgan is planning to syndicate the loan to
several other lenders, according to a person involved with the
deal, who asked not to be named because the talks are private.
&#8220;The tail risk scenario is that the loan cannot be sold and
becomes non-performing,&#8221; Jones wrote. Shares of JPMorgan rose
10 cents to $46.96 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even by JPMorgan&#8217;s standards, the loan is big at 17 percent
of the New York-based bank&#8217;s Tier 1 common equity as of Dec. 31,
Moody&#8217;s said. It&#8217;s rare for a loan of that size to be
concentrated at a single bank, according to Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov must remain in jail while
appealing a 97-month prison term for stealing the firm&#8217;s
computer code, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, after sentencing Aleynikov
March 18, rejected a request by his lawyer, Kevin Marino, to
free the defendant during an appeal. Aleynikov was convicted by
a Manhattan jury in December of violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The facts that caused Aleynikov&#8217;s remand prior to his
sentencing have not changed,&#8221; Cote said in a ruling today.
&#8220;His sentence of roughly eight years&#8217; imprisonment
substantially increases his incentive to flee and he has not
shown by clear and convincing evidence that he is not likely to
do so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote said that in papers filed seeking Aleynikov&#8217;s release,
Marino repeated prior arguments that she previously rejected.
She also said the defense &#8220;largely conceded&#8221; that the amount
of loss to Goldman Sachs as a result of Aleynikov&#8217;s actions was
properly calculated at more than $7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said her sentence was on the lowest end of the
guideline range for such a crime and that Marino had failed to
show that the term would be reduced on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-Source Code &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino argued, as he had during the trial, that Aleynikov
only took open-source code he had written at Goldman Sachs and
that nothing he took was proprietary, Cote said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aleynikov continues to argue in his motion for bail, as
he has throughout these proceedings, that the acts in which he
engaged in do not constitute violations of federal criminal
statutes,&#8221; Cote said in her ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of lines of
source code from the firm&#8217;s trading system, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He circumvented Goldman Sachs&#8217;s security system, sent the
code to an outside server in Germany, and later compressed and
encrypted the code, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who started at Goldman Sachs in May 2007, left
his $400,000-a-year job to work for Chicago-based Teza
Technologies LLC, which promised him $1.2 million including
salary, bonus and profit sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonds of Portugal, Ireland and
Greece will fall versus benchmark German bunds after a European
leaders&#8217; agreement aimed at stamping out the region&#8217;s debt
crisis failed to spur buying, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish and Italian bonds will fare better as investors
discriminate between so-called &#8220;near peripherals&#8221; and &#8220;far
peripherals,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts including New York-based chief
market strategist Jan Loeys, wrote in a March 25 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU leaders last week cut the startup capital for the future
euro emergency aid mechanism in 2013 to 16 billion euros ($23
billion), less than the 40 billion euros foreseen in a March 21
accord, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded smaller
upfront payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The significant EU agreements reached this month have not
been enough to spark investor demand for the most troubled
peripherals,&#8221; the analysts said. &#8220;Portugal is moving ever
closer to an inevitable bailout, and the prospect of further
major bank recapitalizations still hangs over Ireland.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal&#8217;s 10-year bonds yielded 451 basis points more than
equivalent-maturity German securities as of 10:32 a.m. in
London. The spread reached 484 basis points on Nov. 11, the most
since at least 1997 when Bloomberg began collecting the data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s benchmark ISE National 100
Index (XU100) dropped 497.5, or 0.8 percent, to 63,763.8 at the 5:30
p.m. close of trading in Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK) , an Islamic
bank, rose the most in more than two weeks after reporting net
income rose 35 percent in 2010 to $94 million. The shares gained
4 kurus, or 1.8 percent, to 2.25 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Finansal Kiralama AS (ISFIN) , a leasing company,
plunged as much as 8 percent, the most since May, after
Bloomberg HT television cited Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek as
saying he expects a &#8220;limited&#8221; reduction in the 18 percent tax
on leasing transactions. The shares closed down 8 kurus, or 4.9
percent, to 1.54 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN TI), the nation&#8217;s biggest
provider of consumer loans, fell to a three-week low, dropping
16 kurus, or 2.1 percent, to 7.30 liras. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. lowered price estimates for the six Turkish banks it
covers, saying an increase in reserve requirements by the
central bank will hurt their profit. Investors should buy banks
outside of Turkey instead, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UniCredit SpA (UCG), Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will advise on the
sale of coal producer Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA as Poland&#8217;s
Treasury continues record share offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks will act as the global coordinators for the
initial public offering, Deputy Treasury Minister Krzysztof Walenczak told reporters in Warsaw today. PKO Bank Polski SA,
Ipopema Securities SA, Societe Generale SA (GLE) and BRE Bank SA will
also help manage the IPO of the company known as JSW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government wants to keep more than 50 percent in JSW,
the European Union&#8217;s largest coking coal producer, after the
offering, Treasury Minister Aleksander Grad said at the
conference, adding that the size of the stake sold will depend
on demand. The company won&#8217;t sell new shares in the process and
the ministry will offer some shares to JSW employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering is part of the government&#8217;s 15 billion-zloty
($5.29 billion) asset sale program this year, a target which
could increase as the cabinet announced today plans to sell as
much as 14 billion zloty of shares in the country&#8217;s biggest
lender PKO Bank Polski SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total transactions that the ministry wants to carry out
via the Warsaw Stock Exchange this year could beat last year&#8217;s
record, Grad said. In 2010, sales through the bourse initiated
by the Treasury generated 23.4 billion zloty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IPO Value &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grad didn&#8217;t comment on the value of the JSW IPO. The
company&#8217;s unaudited net income was about 1 billion zloty last
year, Chief Executive Officer Jaroslaw Zagorowski told the PAP
newswire in January. The company declined to comment on earnings
when reached by phone today. The miner produced 13.1 million
tons of coal last year, 70 percent of which was coking coal used
by steelmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Zagorowski said the value of the IPO could be
from 3 billion zloty to 5 billion zloty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing coal prices are pushing up the value of coal
producers after December floods in Australia cut the global
supply. New World Resources NV, the largest Czech producer of
coking coal, which is also listed in Warsaw, has jumped 29
percent in Warsaw trading from Dec. 3 when flooding cut
Australian production, giving a value of 11.9 billion zloty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average coking coal prices may rise to 194 euros this year
from 141 euros a year ago, Petr Bartek, an analyst at Erste
Group Bank AG, said by phone today, citing the Australian floods
and recovering economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry will file the JSW prospectus with the
securities commission by April 20 and will start the offering
about June 6, when the document is set to be published, Grad
said. The government plans for the company, based in the
southern Polish city of Jastrzebie Zdroj, to debut on the Warsaw
bourse on June 30. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Ellen Rosen" date="Mar 29, 2011  7:59 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-29/dodd-frank-hp-jpmorgan-sprint-berkshire-hathaway-compliance.html"><headline>Dodd-Frank, JPMorgan, Sprint, Berkshire Hathaway: Compliance</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank financial regulation
law may require the federal government to spend almost $1
billion and hire or transfer more than 2,000 employees in the
months ahead, according to the Government Accountability Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11 agencies implementing the law, including the
Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., told the GAO they would need as much as $973
million to establish the new rules. The agencies, which provided
the GAO with their Dodd-Frank-related costs for either the 2011
calendar year or for fiscal 2012, said that most of the expense
would be recurring, according to a GAO slide presentation sent
to U.S. House Republicans and obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxpayers are likely to bear only part of the
implementation costs. While three of the 11 agencies are at
least partly funded by congressional appropriations, six are
funded fully or partly by assessments on industry, one fully by
federal budget offsets and one, the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, by transfers from the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer bureau, which has been targeted by Republicans
for structural changes and funding cuts, may require $329
million in fiscal 2012 and more than 883 new employees, the GAO
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans requested the GAO report in advance of a
Financial Services subcommittee hearing on Dodd-Frank this week.
Republican lawmakers have proposed several changes to the law,
which was enacted last year when Democrats held majorities in
the House and Senate. Democrats still control the Senate and
White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint Asks U.S. to Block ATT&#8217;s &#8216;Anticompetitive&#8217; Purchase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp. (S), the third-largest U.S. wireless
provider, claimed that ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s planned $39 billion takeover
of T-Mobile USA will damage industry competition and called on
the government to block it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint said in a statement that the industry would be
dominated by two carriers, the combined ATT-T-Mobile and
Verizon Wireless. &#8220;We think the anticompetitive nature of the
transaction simply will not allow it to pass,&#8221; Charles McKee, a
Sprint vice president of government affairs, said yesterday in
an interview. &#8220;This is really an important transaction to
stop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint had also held talks with Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom
to buy T-Mobile, people with knowledge of the matter said this
month. McKee declined to say whether Sprint had held discussions
with T-Mobile over a possible merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKee said Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint would voice
its objections throughout the regulatory process, which ATT
said could take 12 months. Dan Hesse, Sprint&#8217;s chief executive
officer, said last week that the carrier planned to file
objections to the U.S. Congress when it begins its review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT said March 20 it agreed to buy T-Mobile from parent
Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE), pending government approval. The deal would
combine the second- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless providers.
ATT expects regulators will require it to divest wireless
spectrum and subscribers to win approval for the acquisition, a
person with knowledge of the situation said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Buckley, an ATT spokesman, said the acquisition
&#8220;will improve quality for consumers, provide a solution to
impending spectrum exhaust&#8221; and bring so-called fourth-
generation service to more Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reid Walker, a spokesman for T-Mobile in Bellevue,
Washington, and Jeff Nelson, a Verizon Wireless spokesman,
declined in e-mails to comment. Robert Kenny, a spokesman for
the Federal Communications Commission, the phone-industry
regulator, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Wrote Down U.S. Bancorp, Swiss Re After SEC Query &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) wrote down the
value of holdings in U.S. Bancorp, Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN) and Swiss
Reinsurance Co. after a query from the Securities and Exchange
Commission over valuations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adjustments to the equity stakes were made to
Berkshire&#8217;s fourth-quarter results in its annual Form 10-K
report, according to a Feb. 4 letter from Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire to the regulator. The letter was filed yesterday on
the SEC&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result of our discussions, we recognize that the
staff&#8221; of the SEC believes that impairments on the investments
may be required according to generally accepted accounting
principles, Berkshire Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire, which held $61.5 billion of equities as of Dec.
31, was asked by the SEC in January for more information about
stockholdings that traded below the prices paid by the company.
The firm recorded equity impairments of $938 million in the
fourth quarter. Berkshire told the SEC that it wasn&#8217;t writing
down its holdings of Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) and Wells Fargo  Co.
because it expects the stocks recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrealized losses of more than 12 months on equity
investments narrowed to $531 million on Dec. 31 from $2.7
billion a year earlier, Berkshire said in its annual report. The
Wells Fargo stake accounted for $384 million of that unrealized
loss, Berkshire said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Investor Can&#8217;t Get Hurd Report, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hewlett-Packard Co. investor isn&#8217;t entitled to a law
firm&#8217;s confidential report about sexual-harassment allegations
that led to Mark Hurd&#8217;s ouster last year as chief executive
officer, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons on March 25
denied Hewlett-Packard Co. shareholder Ernesto Espinoza&#8217;s
request for the report, which was prepared for the HP board by
lawyers at Covington  Burling LLP, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espinoza sued HP Nov. 18 seeking company books and records
as a part of his investigation into possible wrongdoing by
directors. The board granted Hurd a severance package worth as
much as $40 million &#8220;rather than terminate him for cause&#8221; with
no payment, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders have sued Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-
Packard in Delaware and California claiming that the computer-
maker&#8217;s officials should be held liable for wasting company
assets on Hurd&#8217;s severance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylene Mangalindan, a Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman, declined
to comment on the ruling. Felipe Arroyo, one of Espinoza&#8217;s
lawyers, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delaware case is Espinoza v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ),
CA6000, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). The California
case is Levine v. Andreessen, 10-3608, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Sues Florida Foreclosure Law Firm Over Files &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued the Florida law firm of Ben-Ezra
 Katz to force it to return files of foreclosure cases in which
the firm represented the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in a complaint filed March 25 in Miami that
the files include thousands of original promissory notes,
mortgages and other documents that &#8220;evidence and secure&#8221; loans
worth more than $400 million. The New York-based bank seeks a
court order forcing Ben-Ezra to return the files and unspecified
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida attorney general&#8217;s office is investigating law
firms in the state that handle residential foreclosure cases on
behalf of lenders. The probes focus on whether the firms were
&#8220;fabricating and/or presenting false and misleading documents
in foreclosure cases,&#8221; according to the attorney general&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 25, the attorney general said she had reached a $2
million settlement with one of the firms, the Law Offices of
Marshall C. Watson. Ben-Ezra, based in Fort Lauderdale, is one
of four law firms still under investigation, the office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan terminated Ben-Ezra on March 8, according to the
complaint. The law firm refuses to return the files because it
claims it is owned $5 million, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Sell, a spokesman for Ben-Ezra, had no immediate
comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate suit, the law firm of David J. Stern sued
Chase Home Finance, claiming the firm was owed $398,979.95.
Stern&#8217;s firm is also under investigation by the Florida attorney
general&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan Chase Bank v. Ben-Ezra  Katz,
11-60655, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora Wins Partial Judgment Against JPMorgan&#8217;s EMC in Suit 
Syncora Guarantee Inc. won part of its case against JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMC Mortgage Corp. over the securitization of
9,871 home equity line of credit loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty in New York ruled March
25 that Syncora, a New York-based insurer, notified EMC of 1,300
mortgages with defects and asked EMC to cure them. EMC agreed to
cure only 20 of the mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction in dispute began with the purchase of the
home equity lines of credit or HELOCs, which in turn served as
collateral for the issuance of $666 million in publicly offered
securities, Syncora said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora claimed in the 2009 suit that EMC sold the loan
pool to the entity that issued the notes and contracted with
Syncora to provide financial-guaranty insurance protecting
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer alleged that after it hired consultants to
investigate poor loan performance, &#8220;it learned that more than
85 percent of a randomly selected pool of loans contained
defects that breached the loan-level warranties,&#8221; Crotty wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora notified EMC of these claimed breaches, Crotty
wrote. EMC agreed to repurchase certain loans and disputed
others &#8220;because Syncora misinterpreted the representations
relied upon or because the loans were not defective,&#8221; the judge
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crotty separately rejected a bid by Syncora to add JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s Bear Stearns  Co. to the lawsuit. The insurer
said it had uncovered new evidence to support claims of fraud
and interference. The request wasn&#8217;t filed in a timely fashion,
the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Syncora gave no indication of its intention to file an
amended complaint, add a new party or assert additional claims
until September 2010, approximately fourteen months after the
amendment deadline had passed,&#8221; Crotty said. He added later,
&#8220;Syncora has failed to demonstrate the good cause necessary to
permit this late amendment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Corbally, a spokesman for Syncora, didn&#8217;t
immediately reply to a voice-mail message left at his office
seeking comment. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman,
didn&#8217;t respond to a message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. EMC Mortgage Corp.,
1:09-cv-03106, U.S. District court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Programmer Aleynikov Denied Bail During Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov must remain in jail while appealing a 97-month prison
term for stealing the firm&#8217;s computer code, a federal judge
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, after sentencing Aleynikov
March 18, rejected a request by his lawyer, Kevin Marino, to
free the defendant during an appeal. Aleynikov was convicted by
a Manhattan jury in December of violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The facts that caused Aleynikov&#8217;s remand prior to his
sentencing have not changed,&#8221; Cote said in a ruling yesterday.
&#8220;His sentence of roughly eight years&#8217; imprisonment
substantially increases his incentive to flee and he has not
shown by clear and convincing evidence that he is not likely to
do so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote said that in papers filed seeking Aleynikov&#8217;s release,
Marino repeated prior arguments that she previously rejected.
She also said the defense &#8220;largely conceded&#8221; that the amount
of loss to Goldman Sachs as a result of Aleynikov&#8217;s actions was
properly calculated at more than $7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said her sentence was on the lowest end of the
guideline range for such a crime and that Marino had failed to
show that the term would be reduced on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino argued, as he had during the trial, that Aleynikov
only took open-source code he had written at Goldman Sachs and
that nothing he took was proprietary, Cote said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Enron Broadband Executive Sentenced for Insider Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Enron Broadband Services executive Rex Shelby was
sentenced yesterday on an insider trading charge linked to the
investment fraud that destroyed the world&#8217;s largest energy
trader 10 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby, 59, pleaded guilty to one count of insider trading
and was sentenced to three months in a federal halfway house and
three months of house arrest. Shelby will also forfeit about
$2.6 million in profits from the illicit trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby&#8217;s lawyer Ed Tomko told a judge that Shelby has also
agreed to forfeit another $1 million to resolve related
Securities and Exchange Commission charges. He faced a maximum
of 10 years and a fine of $1 million on the one count before
reaching his plea deal. He&#8217;ll be in probation for two years,
including the six months of combined confinement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I take full responsibility for my actions and all the
decisions I made at Enron,&#8221; Shelby told the judge yesterday.
&#8220;No one forced me to do those things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore sentenced Shelby to
half the number of  months  confinement that he&#8217;d agreed to in a
plea deal. &#8220;Mr. Shelby&#8217;s actions ultimately did not cause the
downfall of Enron,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Only a few individuals at the
pinnacle of Enron knew of the fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilmore said she moderated the sentence to fit Shelby&#8217;s
role and the punishments given to others in the Enron fraud
scheme. She said the fact Shelby has for the last eight years
devoted himself exclusively to working on his defense, in
&#8220;self-imposed home confinement&#8217;&#8217;&#8221;, was also a consideration in
her decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby and six other EBS executives were indicted in 2003
on charges they helped the parent company&#8217;s senior management,
including Enron&#8217;s former Chairman Kenneth Lay and Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling, deceive analysts and
investors about the unit&#8217;s capabilities and financial
performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives were accused of misrepresenting EBS at a
January 2000 analysts&#8217; conference, where they portrayed it as
one of Enron&#8217;s &#8220;core&#8221; units, worth about $50 billion. In
reality, the division struggled to launch products and never
earned a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby had long maintained he sold the shares to diversify
his portfolio and not based on any inside knowledge of an
alleged conspiracy to inflate Enron&#8217;s stock price. To avoid a
trial on broader conspiracy and fraud charges, which had been
set to begin this past January, Shelby pleaded guilty to one
count of insider trading in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Shelby, H-03-093, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake Hedge Fund Operators Sentenced to 87 Months in Prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two men who in December admitted to defrauding investors of
more than $7 million though bogus hedge funds were each
sentenced to 87 months in prison, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igor Levin, 41, of Brooklyn, New York, and Yevgeny
Shvartsshteyn, 40, of Belle Harbor, New York, each pleaded
guilty last year to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and
wire fraud. The two said they operated A.R. Capital, a general
partner of A.R. Capital Global Fund LP, which they told
investors was a hedge fund that invested primarily in equity of
international real estate companies, and in oil, gas and other
commodities, according to a statement from Bharara&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. said that in reality, there were no such
investments. The defendants instead wired more than $7 million
of investor funds to bank accounts in the Ukraine. Levin and
Shvartsshteyn received the proceeds from these illegally
obtained investments, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My client wanted to get this sentence behind him,&#8221;
Joseph Mure, a lawyer for Shvartsshteyn, said yesterday in a
telephone interview. Andrew Frisch, a lawyer for Levin, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein in New York imposed the
sentences upon the two men on March 25, Bharara&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Levin, 10-CR-00031, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Standard  Poor&#8217;s Must Face Anschutz Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Standard  Poor&#8217;s must
face claims in a lawsuit brought by the Anschutz Corp. seeking
damages over its purchase of auction-rate securities, a judge
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco has
refused to throw out Anschutz&#8217;s claims of market manipulation
and fraud against Deutsche Bank and negligent misrepresentation
against SP, according to a March 27 ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks running periodic auctions abandoned the $330 billion
market for the securities in 2008 amid the fallout from the
subprime market slump. Investors were stuck with the products.
Denver-based Anschutz in 2007 bought $40 million of the
securities underwritten and rated by the defendants, the ruling
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The case is without merit and we will defend ourselves
vigorously,&#8221; Edward Sweeney, a spokesman for SP, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate lawsuit over auction rate securities, a
federal judge in San Francisco yesterday conditionally granted
Deutsche Bank Securities&#8217; request to dismiss claims by Louisiana
Pacific Corp. while giving the building products company an
opportunity to revise its lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White gave Nashville,
Tennessee-based Louisiana Pacific until April 29 to amend its
case or face dismissal of most of the lawsuit, which seeks to
recover damages from its $300 million purchase of auction-rate
securities, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Frolich, an attorney for Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Bank, had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case is Anschutz v. Merrill Lynch, 09-3780, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).
The second case is Louisiana Pacific v Money Market 1
Institutional Investment Dealer, 09-3529, U.S. District Court,
San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA Board Sued by Holders Over Mortgage Recording Paperwork &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s board and some officers were sued
by shareholders claiming they were hurt by false and misleading
statements that hid defects in mortgage recording and
foreclosure paperwork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &#8220;did not properly record many of its
mortgages when originated or acquired, which severely
complicated the foreclosure process when it became necessary,&#8221;
according to the complaint filed yesterday in New York state
Supreme Court in Manhattan. The suit also claims that the bank
also concealed that it didn&#8217;t have adequate personnel to process
the large numbers of foreclosed loans in its portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s stock traded at inflated prices, reaching a high
of $19.48 on April 15, 2010, and fell almost 42 percent after
the problems were disclosed, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directors and officers also hid the bank&#8217;s involvement
in &#8220;dollar rolling,&#8221; omitting billions of dollars in debt from
its balance sheet, according to the complaint. Bank of America
later admitted it wrongly classified the transactions as sales
when they were secured borrowing, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, after news of improprieties at Bank of America
and other large banks, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
lender temporarily halted foreclosures and admitted to possible
irregularities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, had no
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Thomas O&#8217;Hare v. Brian T. Moynihan,
103729/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Regulators Weigh Rules Clarifying Risk in Securitization &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve, said
they&#8217;re considering proposed rules this week under a law
requiring companies to retain part of the risk when they
securitize and sell loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of the agencies participating in this joint
rulemaking process are expected to consider the rule this week
and a detailed announcement will be made when this process is
complete,&#8221; the regulators said yesterday in a statement in
Washington, citing section 941 of last year&#8217;s Dodd-Frank Act
overhauling financial regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agencies include the Fed, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Federal
Housing Finance Agency, Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Equity May Lose as U.S. Reconsiders Tax Break for Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As lawmakers working on a rewrite of the U.S. tax code
examine the treatment of debt financing, the private-equity
industry could face a challenge to its business model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overhaul of the U.S. tax code, which is in the early
stages of discussion, could lessen the preference for debt that
fuels both private-equity deals and financing strategies in
other industries. That incentive is caused by the contrast
between deductible interest payments and non-deductible
dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to the value of the interest deduction would affect
all companies that use debt. Private-equity firms such as
Blackstone Group LP (BX) and KKR  Co. would experience the effects
most directly because they borrow to finance corporate takeovers
as part of an industry that manages $2.5 trillion in assets,
according to research firm Preqin Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While private-equity firms might benefit from the lower
corporate rate that lawmakers propose in a new tax system, they
would have to shift their business model, said Steven Kaplan, a
professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the University of
Chicago Booth School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you can&#8217;t fully deduct your interest, then you want
less of it,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two top tax writers in Congress, Senator Max Baucus and
Representative Dave Camp, have asked congressional analysts for
a study of the preference toward debt financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are holding hearings on the tax code and say they want
to overhaul the system. Neither Baucus, a Montana Democrat who
heads the Senate Finance Committee, nor Camp, a Michigan
Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means panel,
has released a detailed proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bias toward debt financing in this country led --
maybe slightly, but led nonetheless -- to the economic
collapse,&#8221; Baucus said March 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials from Blackstone and KKR declined to comment.
Private-equity firms pool investors&#8217; money to buy companies,
financing the purchase mostly with debt, with the intention of
later selling the companies at a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of changes to the private-equity industry
would depend on the shape of the broader tax legislation, said
Doug Lowenstein, president of the Private Equity Growth Capital
Council, the industry&#8217;s trade association in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large Banks Gain Over Smaller Rivals Under New Overdraft Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is set to begin
enforcing rules this summer aimed at reducing overdraft fees, a
move that may cut into retail banking revenue at companies such
as BBT Corp. (BBT), Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV) and Ameriana Bancorp. (ASBI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new rules may increase pressure on other U.S. banking
regulators, including the new Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, to impose industrywide overdraft rules, said Jeremy
Rosenblum, vice chairman of the consumer financial services
group at the law firm Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you don&#8217;t comply by July 1, you are really asking for
problems in the examination process,&#8221; Rosenblum said. &#8220;The
guidelines are going to really cut into overdraft revenues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and credit unions were set to earn about $38 billion
from overdraft fees in 2011, according to a Sept. 15 estimate by
Lake Bluff, Illinois-based Moebs Services. About 10 percent of
the revenue was expected to come from customers with 10 or more
overdrafts per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional rules imposed by the consumer bureau would hit
nationally chartered institutions such as JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC rules come atop industrywide regulation approved
by the Federal Reserve last year requiring banks to obtain
customers&#8217; permission to enroll them in overdraft programs.
Since the FDIC rules do not apply to nationally chartered banks,
FDIC-regulated banks argue the guidance will skew competition.

Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading Commission

&lt;p&gt;Chilton Says &#8216;Race to the Bottom&#8217; at Risk in Global Swaps Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European financial regulators would risk a &#8220;race
to the bottom&#8221; if they proposed different rules governing the
$583 trillion global swaps market, said Bart Chilton,
commissioner at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t open the door for regulatory arbitrage or
trading migration to the least or most poorly regulated trading
environments,&#8221; Chilton said in a speech prepared for delivery
yesterday in London at a Goldman Sachs Global Commodity
Conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are drafting rules for the derivatives market
after largely unregulated transactions helped fuel the 2008
credit crisis. The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission
are leading U.S. efforts required under the Dodd Frank Act,
signed into law by President Barack Obama last July. The law
seeks to reduce risk and boost transparency by having most swaps
guaranteed by clearinghouses and traded on exchanges or other
platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s focus only on derivatives traded away from
exchanges may lead to gaps in regulation in the region compared
with the U.S., Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC, said in
Brussels on March 22. U.S. lawmakers have tasked regulators with
determining whether other nations should be recognized as having
rules that are &#8220;comprehensive and comparable&#8221; with those in
the U.S., Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences in trading regulations may lead banks and other
market participants to shift where they conduct business,
according to a Feb. 18 report from a technical committee of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives, including swaps, are financial contracts tied
to a stock, bond, currency or event, such as a company default.
The global swaps market was $583 trillion as of last June,
according to the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks fluctuated as better-
than-estimated earnings in China and Hong Kong offset concerns
economic growth in Japan will falter as the nation struggled to
contain a partial meltdown at a nuclear plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s largest bank
by market value, led declines among the nation&#8217;s biggest lenders
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its forecast for the
country&#8217;s economic growth. Anhui Conch Cement Co., China&#8217;s
biggest cement maker, and Brilliance China Automotive Holdings
Ltd. (1114), the Chinese partner of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG,
climbed more than 4.7 percent after posting full-year earnings
that beat estimates. Japanese stocks pared earlier declines
after a stricken nuclear plant began pumping fresh water to a
damaged nuclear reactor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.3 percent to 133.25 as
of 7:47 p.m. in Tokyo, having declined as much as 0.9 percent
earlier. Almost five stocks advanced for every four that
declined in the index. The gauge had its biggest weekly gain
since November last week as Japan moved to stabilize nuclear
reactors damaged by a March 11 earthquake and as companies from
Cnooc Ltd. to Bank of China Ltd.&#8217;s earnings surpassed estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until the reactor can be cooled automatically, the
situation remains critical and it could impact company
earnings,&#8221; said Takeshi Fukushima, who helps manage about $37
billion at Meiji Yasuda Asset Management Co. &#8220;However, we&#8217;re
starting to find out that it probably won&#8217;t become a tragedy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Ocean Leak &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 (NKY) Stock Average swung between gains and
losses after Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the crippled
nuclear plant, said radioactive water hasn&#8217;t leaked into the sea.
The company started using freshwater to cool spent fuel in one
of the reactors, Teruaki Kobayashi, head of nuclear maintenance
at Tokyo Electric, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese benchmark index fell as much as 1.7 percent
after Goldman Sachs lowered its growth forecast for the
country&#8217;s gross domestic product this year to 0.7 percent from
1.3 percent previously in the aftermath of power cuts and damage
from the March 11 earthquake. It closed 0.2 percent lower after
rising as much as 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.9 percent, while
Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng Index was little changed. Australia&#8217;s
SP/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.5 percent, while New Zealand&#8217;s NZX
50 Index increased 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The index slipped 0.3 percent yesterday in New York as
Marriott International Inc. led consumer shares lower and
concern grew that Japan is failing to contain hazardous
materials at Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty &#8216;Very Negative&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The situation at the nuclear plant isn&#8217;t getting better,
and any improvement looks like it&#8217;ll be delayed, and that&#8217;s
weighing on the stock market,&#8221; said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. &#8220;We still don&#8217;t know how much of a
negative effect it&#8217;ll have on the economy. The uncertainty is
very negative for stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water in a tunnel outside the No. 2 reactor at the nuclear
plant in northeastern Japan had radiation levels exceeding 1
sievert an hour, a spokesman for plant operator Tokyo Electric
Power Co. said yesterday. A partial meltdown of fuel rods in the
No. 2 reactor probably caused a jump in the readings, Japan
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to that dose for 30 minutes would trigger nausea
and four hours might lead to death within two months, according
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magnitude-9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami on March 11
knocked out power at the plant, forcing Tokyo Electric to dump
thousands of tons of seawater on the complex as a stop gap
cooling measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tepco Pummeled &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electric tumbled 19 percent to 566 yen at the close
of trading, the lowest on record. The stock has declined 74
percent since the last market close before the earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government data showed Japan&#8217;s unemployment rate fell in
February and retail sales beat analysts&#8217; forecasts, indicating
that the economy was picking up before the earthquake and
tsunami that devastated northeastern regions. Goldman Sachs said
the economy will shrink next quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 2.8 percent to 378 yen in Tokyo.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s second-biggest
lender by market value, slipped 1 percent to 2,623 yen. Smaller
rival Mizuho Financial Group Inc. declined 2.1 percent to 140
yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranium suppliers dropped amid concern the worst nuclear
disaster since Chernobyl will crimp demand for the fuel. Extract
Resources Ltd. (EXT), a uranium mining company, declined 5.1 percent
to A$7.80 in Sydney, while rival Paladin Energy Ltd. decreased
2.9 percent to A$3.64. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Makers Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Taipei, Acer Inc. (2353), the world&#8217;s second-biggest maker of
personal computers, slumped 6.9 percent to NT$63.1, its lowest
close since July 2009. Goldman Sachs cut its rating to &#8220;sell&#8221;
from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and Citigroup Inc. said sales of notebook
computers are unlikely to stage a rebound in the second half of
the year. Compal Electronics Inc. (2324), the world&#8217;s second largest
maker of notebook computers, slipped 2.6 percent to NT$30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among stocks that advanced, Anhui Conch jumped 4.7 percent
to HK$45.60. The company said full-year net income increased 74
percent to 6.2 billion yuan ($945 million) from a year ago,
beating the 5.4 billion yuan average estimate of 13 analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliance China Automotive surged 5.3 percent to HK$7.13.
The company posted a full-year net income of 1.27 billion yuan,
compared with a loss of 1.64 billion yuan in the previous year.
That exceeded the average estimate of 1.09 billion yuan of 10
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippine phone company Globe Telecom Inc. jumped 7
percent to 746 pesos, the best performer on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index, on optimism industry competition will ease amid
speculation Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. may buy
Digital Telecommunications Philippines Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.

for gasoline at its Fos refinery in southern France following a
malfunction early yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit has been starting up since last night, Catherine Brun, an Exxon spokeswoman, said by phone from Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brun said earlier today there had been &#8220;a technical issue
with the catalytic reformer on Monday morning around 1 a.m.&#8221;.
The incident wasn&#8217;t related to the planned shutdown that took
place earlier in the quarter, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon started units at the 119,000 barrel-a-day refinery in
early March after maintenance that began in January. The plant
receives crude from the port of Marseille. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks fell after Goldman
Sachs cut estimates for the country&#8217;s banks and as concern
persisted about a partial meltdown at a nuclear plant in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main ISE National 100 index (XU100) dropped 506.95, or 0.8
percent, to 63,754.38 at 11:37 a.m. Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)
led losses, sliding 1.6 percent to 7.34 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman lowered price estimates for the six Turkish banks
it covers saying an increase in reserve requirements by the
central bank will hurt profit, according to an e-mailed report
today. Garanti was cut to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and Turkiye
Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN) was reduced to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221;
Goldman said. Investors should buy banks outside of Turkey
including OAO Sberbank of Russia (SBER), it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings will come under further pressure following a
substantial increase in reserve requirement ratios,&#8221; Goldman
said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week the central bank increased the reserves banks
need to set aside for the third time since the start of
December, raising the ratio to as much as 15 percent for
deposits of one month or less from 10 percent. The measures are
needed to curb lending and ensure financial stability, the bank
said on March 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has cut earnings estimates for Turkish banks by an
average of 6 percent between 2011 and 2013, the report said.
Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR) AS&#8217;s share price estimate was lowered to 5
liras from 5.5 liras and Akbank TAS (AKBNK), part-owned by Citigroup
Inc., to 6 liras from 6.7 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We find more value outside Turkey, particularly in
Sberbank, where improving earnings power is yet to be fully
captured by valuation multiples,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akbank TAS lost 1.3 percent to 7.42 liras. Vakiflar
decreased 1 percent to 3.80 liras. Sberbank gained 0.3 percent
to 3.75 liras in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister Naoto Kan said for the first time
that a damaged nuclear plant&#8217;s tsunami defenses were inadequate,
while reassuring the public that radiation leaks pose no health
threat beyond an evacuation zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lira was little changed at 1.56130 per dollar. Yields
on benchmark two-year bonds were unchanged at 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek AS (CCOLA) : The Turkish bottler of coke
drinks said net income last year increased to 197.7 million
liras ($127 million) from 169.6 million liras in 2009, according
to a statement to the Istanbul Stock Exchange after the market
closed yesterday. The 2010 profit missed an average estimate of
213.3 million liras in a Bloomberg survey of 20 analysts. Coca-
Cola Icecek gained 35 kurus, or 1.9 percent, to 18.95 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finansbank AS (FINBN TI): The Turkish bank owned by
National Bank of Greece SA, will apply to regulators to sell as
much as $750 million of bonds, with maturities of five to seven
years, to investors outside Turkey, it said in a statement to
the bourse after the market closed yesterday. Finansbank
advanced 4 kurus, or 0.8 percent, to 5.40 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurriyet Gazetecilik  Matbaacilik AS (HURGZ TI): The
publisher of Turkey&#8217;s Hurriyet newspaper said losses last year
widened to 40.1 million liras from 35.1 million liras in 2009 in
a statement to the bourse after the close yesterday. The company
was expected to have a profit of 34.7 million liras, according
to the average estimate of nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Hurriyet was unchanged at 2.02 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) : The Turkish bank in
which Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA bought a 24.9 percent
stake, was cut to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., according to a report today. Garanti fell 4 kurus,
or 0.5 percent, to 7.46 liras. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magazine&#8217;s May issue includes part of William D. Cohan&#8217;s &#8220;Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the
World,&#8221; which is being published next month by Doubleday. The
article says that in early 1998, while Corzine was still Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s sole chief executive officer, he met to discuss a
potential deal with Frank V. Cahouet, Mellon Bank&#8217;s then-CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine told Paulson, who was then serving as a senior
partner and chief operating officer, that talks were preliminary,
the article says. Paulson later learned from J. Christopher Flowers, a Goldman Sachs partner who was advising Corzine in the
negotiations, that Corzine had presented Cahouet with specifics
on how the deal&#8217;s economics would work and named people who
would run business units, the story says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson asked Corzine to describe the talks at a management
committee meeting the next day and, after Corzine provided
little information, Paulson called in Flowers, who gave a fuller
description, according to the excerpt. Most members of the
committee were upset with Corzine for discussing a deal without
telling them, although some were upset at Paulson for how he
handled it, the article says. It quotes Corzine as saying that
the extent of the merger talks were &#8220;deeply exaggerated&#8221; to
undermine his leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks Abandoned &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks were abandoned and, in June 1998, Paulson became
co-chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs after threatening to leave
if Corzine remained sole CEO and winning the backing of most of
the firm&#8217;s management committee, the excerpt says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, 64, who is now chairman and CEO of New York-based
MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF), left Goldman Sachs in 1999 and later
became a U.S. Senator from New Jersey and then the state&#8217;s
governor. Paulson, 65, ran Goldman Sachs until June 2006, when
he became U.S. Treasury Secretary until January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine was on sale at newsstands in New York
yesterday. Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman at MF Global, said
Corzine was travelling and couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached for
comment. Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Paulson, said she
couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohan, a contributing editor to Bloomberg News, wrote &#8220;The
Last Tycoons&#8221; in 2007 about the history of Lazard Ltd. and
&#8220;House of Cards&#8221; in 2009 about the 2008 collapse and sale of
Bear Stearns Cos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, extending the
biggest first-quarter rally in 13 years for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as a report showing companies added more
workers in March bolstered optimism about the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon Inc. surged 28 percent for the biggest jump in the
SP 500 after Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) offered
to buy the maker of sleep and pain drugs. Visa Inc. (V) climbed 2.8
percent on speculation that curbs on debit-card fees will be
delayed or modified. ATT Inc. (T) rallied as its chief executive
officer pitched the company&#8217;s acquisition of T-Mobile USA as a
way to boost network capacity and improve service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 gained 0.7 percent to 1,328.26 at 4 p.m. in New
York and is up 5.6 percent for the first quarter, which ends
tomorrow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 71.60
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,350.61 and has rallied 6.7 percent
so far this year. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller stocks rose
1.3 percent to 840.28, the highest level since October 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the beginning of a strong cyclical recovery in the
U.S. and a tougher environment in many of these other
international markets, it seems to us like a good place for
investors to be,&#8221; said Connor Browne, who oversees about $5
billion as co-manager of the Thornburg Value Fund at Thornburg
Investment Management Inc. in Santa Fe, New Mexico. &#8220;We&#8217;re
positively inclined toward valuations and fundamentals for the
U.S. market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First-Quarter Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is poised to complete a third straight
quarterly advance and is headed for its biggest gain in the
January-March period since 1998, when the index surged 14
percent. The benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks is trading for about
13.7 times its companies&#8217; estimated operating earnings, compared
with an average multiple of 18.1 times reported profits over the
last decade, data compiled by Bloomberg (SPX) show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report from ADP Employer Services today showed companies
hired 201,000 workers in March, marking the third time in four
months that the nation added more than 200,000 jobs. A Labor
Department report on April 1 may show total U.S. non-farm
payrolls rose 190,000 in March and the unemployment rate held at
8.9 percent, economists predicted. The jobless rate fell below 9
percent in February for the first time in 22 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s certainly some positive expectations for the jobs
numbers this Friday,&#8221; said Michael James, managing director of
equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. &#8220;The
expectation is that the U.S. economy is going to remain strong
and the equity markets are going to continue higher,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cephalon, Visa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon advanced 28 percent to $75.44 after Valeant (VRX),
Canada&#8217;s biggest drug maker, offered to buy the Frazer,
Pennsylvania-based company for $73 a share in cash. The offer is
valued at about $5.7 billion. Valeant rose 13 percent to $50.08.
Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX), another drugmaker, climbed 4.3 percent
to $32.48. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest payments network, gained 2.8
percent to $74.23 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said yesterday the central bank wouldn&#8217;t meet an April 21
deadline to come up with a final rule on debit-card transaction
fees. The cap, mandated by the Dodd-Frank law that overhauled
the financial industry last year, must be in place by July 21.
MasterCard Inc. (MA), the world&#8217;s second-biggest payments network,
rose 0.8 percent to $253.66. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. advanced 2.2 percent, the biggest increase in the
Dow, to $30.71. CEO Randall Stephenson today said the
acquisition of Deutsche Telekom AG&#8217;s T-Mobile USA would boost
network capacity and improve service for devices such as Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone. The executive spoke at an event at the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York. Apple fell 0.7 percent to
$348.63. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PPG Surges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) gained 5.9 percent to $95.93, its
highest price since at least 1980. The world&#8217;s second-biggest
paint maker forecast first-quarter profit of at least $1.30 a
share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com (CRM) rose 5.6 percent to $134.49 after the
largest supplier of customer-management software agreed to buy
Radian6 Technologies Inc. for about $340 million in cash and
stock to add software that lets companies keep abreast of the
social Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock (BLK) surged 6.6 percent to $198.84. The company will
replace Genzyme Corp. in the SP 500 after the close of trading
on April 1, SP said in a statement. Separately, Citigroup Inc.
added the shares to its &#8220;top picks&#8221; list. Genzyme, which is
being removed from the index because France&#8217;s Sanofi-Aventis SA (SNY)
is buying the company, dropped less than 0.1 percent to $76.01. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coca-Cola &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. climbed 0.5 percent to $66.04 as the company
said its bottled-water plants in Japan are operating 24 hours a
day to meet increased demand because of concern that radiation
discharges from the country&#8217;s stricken nuclear power plant have
contaminated tap water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lennar Corp. (LEN) slumped 4.2 percent to $18.27 for the biggest
decline in the SP 500. Stephen East at Ticonderoga Securities
LLC cut the homebuilder to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) slid 3.8 percent, the second-biggest drop in
the SP 500, to $18.45. ThinkEquity LLC analyst Krishna Shankar
lowered his price target for the maker of three-dimensional
graphics processors to $18 from $24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ameron International Corp. lost 6.6 percent to $69.82 after
the maker of fiberglass pipes posted a $4.3 million loss in its
fiscal first quarter ended Feb. 27 as poor weather hurt sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First-Quarter Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 usually climbs further following first-quarter
gains similar to this year&#8217;s, according to Birinyi Associates
Inc. The index rises about 7.1 percent in the final three
quarters of years following January-March gains of 5 percent to
7 percent, Birinyi data dating back to 1928 show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. stock market is about to begin one of the most-bullish months of the year, according to a March 28 note by
Bespoke Investment Group, a Harrison, New York-based research
company. The Dow has averaged an April gain of 4.2 percent over
the past five years, the note said. April has been the best
performing month for the past 50 years, it also said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People remain very bullish,&#8221; said Wedbush Securities&#8217;
James. &#8220;It&#8217;s been one of the strongest first quarters we&#8217;ve
had&#8221; in more than 10 years. &#8220;People want to make sure that
they show enough long positions in their portfolios going into
the end of the quarter tomorrow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
two biggest U.S. payment networks, posted their biggest gains of
the year on speculation that U.S. curbs on debit-card fees will
be delayed or modified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa advanced $2.03, or 2.8 percent, to $74.23 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most since
December for the San Francisco-based firm. MasterCard rose
$1.95, or 0.8 percent, to $253.66 after gaining as much as 4.2
percent, the best showing for the Purchase, New York-based firm
in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday
that the central bank wouldn&#8217;t meet an April 21 deadline to come
up with a final rule on debit-card transaction fees. The so-
called Durbin amendment&#8217;s cap on &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, mandated by the
Dodd-Frank law that overhauled the financial industry last year,
must be in place by July 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is increasingly a likelihood that the harsh first
draft may be watered down significantly,&#8221; Christopher Brendler,
an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus  Co., wrote to investors today.
&#8220;This delay and Bernanke&#8217;s comments add to the growing
political momentum against the Durbin amendment. Last week,
Durbin himself tried to delay a vote on the Tester bill until
after the April 21 Fed release of the final rules.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, is pushing for
a vote as soon as this week on a bill that could delay the cap
by two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendler rates both Visa and MasterCard &#8220;buy,&#8221; according
to his note. New York-based American Express Co. (AXP) may also
benefit to a lesser extent from the delay, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said a worker was

&lt;p&gt;The worker was hurt while performing his duties and was
hospitalized, Aarti Ramachandran, a refinery spokeswoman, said

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;According to medical personnel, the employee&#8217;s injuries

&lt;p&gt;Brevan Howard Asset Management LP
hired three Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) employees to trade for its
biggest hedge fund, according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Devine, Andrew Dausch and Brad Lord will trade for the
$25 billion Brevan Howard Master Fund Ltd., said the person, who
asked not to be named because the appointments haven&#8217;t been
announced. The three will work in Brevan Howard&#8217;s London office,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is losing traders as it complies with a
provision of the U.S.&#8217;s Dodd-Frank financial rules that
restricts banks from betting capital for their own accounts.
Devine, Dausch and Lord are opting to trade for the world&#8217;s
biggest macro fund instead of following the path of former
Goldman Sachs employees that decided to start their own firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Starting a hedge fund from scratch can obviously be a lot
more rewarding, but it&#8217;s essentially starting a business, which
requires time and advice,&#8221; said Max Ferri, head of operational
due diligence at Laven Partners, a hedge-fund consultant in
London. By going to Brevan Howard, "they can focus on what they
do best, which is trading, and can get started right away." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Connections &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called macro funds seek to profit from global economic
themes or trends. Brevan Howard co-Chief Executive Officer Nagi Kawkabani didn&#8217;t return a phone call seeking comment. Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointments were earlier reported by Financial News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devine&#8217;s registration with the U.K. Financial Services
Authority has been inactive since March 17, according to the
regulator&#8217;s website. Dausch and Lord&#8217;s registrations have been
inactive since March 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three worked in London for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global macro
proprietary desk, which the Wall Street firm decided to close
earlier this year. The eight-person desk trades currencies,
stocks and products tied to interest rates. In the first quarter
of 2011, New York-based Goldman Sachs began liquidating the
group&#8217;s positions, according to a March 1 filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The macro desk reported financial results as part of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fixed-income trading division, a person familiar
with the matter said last month. That division generated revenue
of $13.7 billion in 2010, 35 percent of the firm&#8217;s total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Alumni &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs last year also shut down an equity
proprietary-trading group, known as Goldman Sachs Principal
Strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre-Henri Flamand, the former head of the group, left in
2010 to start a hedge fund. Morgan Sze, who also ran principal
strategies, is founding a hedge fund in Hong Kong. Ariel Roskis
and Daniele Benatoff, two London-based employees who worked on
the desk, plan to start a fund in the next quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank provision that restricts banks from making
speculative bets with their own capital is known as the Volcker
rule. It was named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who advocated separating lending units from investment
banking. The rule aims to limit risky trading at depository
institutions in response to the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s biggest
soft-drink maker, said its bottled-water plants in Japan are
running 24 hours a day to meet demand amid fears of tap water
contamination from a crippled nuclear power plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The irradiated water scare affects every part of Japan,&#8221;
Kei Sakaguchi, a Tokyo-based spokesman at unit Coca-Cola (Japan)
Co., said today in a phone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re making a full
assessment of our product schedule and gave priority&#8221; to some
products including water and tea, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Coca-Cola, Fast Retailing Co. and
Toyota Motor Corp. are trying to lessen disruptions of supply to
survivors of the March 11 earthquake, the strongest on record to
hit Japan, and the ensuing tsunami. The government last week
asked beverage makers to increase production of bottled water
after revelations of rising contamination in water and food
triggered bulk buying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola may import 1 million cases of mineral water from
South Korea this weekend to meet demand in the Tohoku region,
the worst affected by the tsunami, as well as Tokyo and its
surrounding regions, Sakaguchi said. Suntory Holdings Ltd. and
Kirin Holdings Co. also boosted orders for imported water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA, the maker of Pure Life and Perrier, donated
20,000 cases, or 500,000 bottles of water to Japan, according to
an e-mailed statement. Danone (BN), which manufactures Volvic and
Evian, said in an e-mailed statement that shipments of water to
Japan have increased since the earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Demand for bottled water has led to shortages across
various supermarkets and even Japan&#8217;s ubiquitous convenience
stores,&#8221; research analysts Kentaro Taniguchi and Tomoko
Takanoura wrote in a Euromonitor International report on March
22. &#8220;Sales of bottled water may benefit from the expected
shortage of potable water.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, Japan&#8217;s second-biggest bottled-water maker by
market share, has 28 plants operated by 12 bottlers in Japan and
seven of them produce water, Sakaguchi said. Suntory had 30.9
percent of the nation&#8217;s bottled-water market last year, followed
by Coca-Cola&#8217;s 15.9 percent and Kirin&#8217;s 10.4 percent, according
to Euromonitor International. Coca-Cola sells its bottled water
through brands including Dasani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of iodine-131 found in Tokyo&#8217;s tap water on March 22
and March 23 exceeded the recommended limit for infants, the
Tokyo city government said last week. The levels have been below
the limit since March 24, according to data posted on the
government&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contamination &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevated readings of contaminated sea water were found
yesterday near Tokyo Electric Power Co.&#8217;s damaged Fukushima Dai-
Ichi atomic power plant, Japan&#8217;s nuclear safety agency said
today. Workers grappled with ways to reduce toxic radiation at
the site of the world&#8217;s worst nuclear disaster in 25 years. The
plant is 220 kilometers (135 miles) northeast of Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death toll from Japan&#8217;s worst postwar disaster climbed
to 11,232, with 16,361 people missing, according to the National
Police Agency in Tokyo. The earthquake and tsunami devastated
the country&#8217;s northern coastline and forced several hundred
thousand people to evacuate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ING Groep NV (INGA) will probably seek to
divest its U.S. online-banking unit by merging it with a local
lender rather than an international competitor, according to
analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A merger or disposal with a U.S. &#8220;domestically focused&#8221;
party would be preferential, London-based analysts Duncan Russell and Marine Collas wrote in a note to investors. &#8220;The
reason is that ING Group would still have ING Direct throughout
the rest of the world, and thus it cannot risk the newly
acquired company moving into these markets and competing with
it,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING is under European Union orders to divest its U.S.
online lender, ING Direct USA, before 2013 as a condition for
gaining approval for state aid. The Amsterdam-based company may
&#8220;free up&#8221; about 3.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) for aid
repayment by selling the unit for $10 billion, a minimal selling
price, JPMorgan said, adding it considers $12.5 billion a
&#8220;fairer price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING has talked in recent months with Citigroup Inc. (C), CIT
Group Inc. and Chrysler Financial Corp., according to people
with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING&#8217;s U.S. bank had total deposits of $77.7 billion at the
end of last year and assets of $87.8 billion, according to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailout Conditions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit held $40 billion in net loans and leases, which
gave it a Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength,
of 26.8 percent at the end of 2010, compared with an average of
12.7 percent for all banks, according to the FDIC figures. The
bank&#8217;s return on assets was 0.3 percent in 2010, less than half
the industry average of almost 0.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING also had to consent to divesting its insurance unit by
the end of 2013 to gain approval for a bailout that included 10
billion euros of state aid and the transfer of the risk on 21.6
billion euros of U.S. mortgage assets. In addition, the company,
which traces its roots to 1743, has to sell some Dutch retail-
banking assets. Some of the EU requirements are subject of an
appeal at the EU&#8217;s General Court in Luxembourg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending the risk-transfer transaction with the Dutch state
would be a requirement for any deal, which ING would probably
want to complete sooner rather than later, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fortunate thing here is that the difference between
the break-even price for the Dutch government and the current
market price has narrowed significantly, making it easier to
unwind the transaction,&#8221; Russell and Collas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A merger would be more likely than an initial public
offering or a trade sale, the analysts said. This would result
in a higher asset yield for ING Direct and allow ING to exit
gradually and benefit from &#8220;value upside&#8221; resulting from a
merger, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark&#8217;s central bank will stop
calculating and publishing the Copenhagen Interbank Offered Rate
amid uncertainty on the rates reported in by lenders, Jyllands-
Posten said, citing FinansWatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank is basing its decision on a September
probe that found a volume decline in the market for unsecured
krone loans, creating a wider spread between secured and
unsecured rates in Denmark than abroad, it said in an e-mail to
FinansWatch. The banks that provide the rates used to calculate
Cibor were unable to explain the difference, according to the e-
mail to FinansWatch, as reported by Jyllands-Posten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a consequence of the limited turnover it isn&#8217;t
possible for the central bank to assess the quality of the
reported Cibor rates,&#8221; the bank said in the e-mail to
FinansWatch. &#8220;The central bank has therefore decided to cease
collecting, calculating and publishing Cibor,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, borrowed at least $5.9 billion from
the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount window over six months during the
height of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had previously disclosed it borrowed $500 million
on Aug. 22, 2007, as similar loans were made to Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Wachovia Corp. &#8220;to display the effectiveness of the
facility,&#8221; according to a joint statement at the time. JPMorgan
accessed the program at least four more times through April
2008, according to documents released today under a Freedom of
Information Act request by Bloomberg News and Fox News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told reporters in
Washington yesterday that the release of the data &#8220;will make it
harder for people to use the discount window in the future.&#8221; At
JPMorgan, he said, &#8220;we never intend to use the discount
window&#8221; in the future. Howard Opinsky, a JPMorgan spokesman,
declined to comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took a $625 million overnight loan from the Fed on
Oct. 16, 2007, the day before the New York-based bank reported a
third-quarter profit of $3.4 billion, according to the Fed
documents. Dimon told analysts on an Oct. 17 conference call
that he was working with executives at Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank
of America to set up an $80 billion fund to buy bad assets from
structured investment vehicles, a plan later abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapping Discount Window &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan later borrowed $3.5 billion from the Fed&#8217;s
discount window, secured by $83.8 billion in mortgage, consumer
and commercial loans, on Jan. 16, 2008, the documents show. The
bank reported that day a 34 percent drop in net income to $2.97
billion for the fourth quarter of 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank accessed the Fed window again on March 7, 2008,
for a $175 million overnight loan and on April 4, 2008, for
$1.13 billion. The bank announced April 3 that it paid
$140.7 million for 11.5 million shares of Bear Stearns Cos.
about a week earlier to help close that acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had previously reported that it borrowed from the
Federal Reserve discount window as well as from other central
banks. The amount, timing and terms had never been disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although considered as a source of available liquidity,
the firm does not view borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve
Bank discount window and various other central banks as a
primary source of funding,&#8221; the lender said in a recent filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan accepted $25 billion from the U.S. Troubled Asset
Relief Program during the financial crisis and repaid the funds
in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) tapped the
Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount window at least five times since
September 2008, according to central bank data that contradict
an executive&#8217;s testimony last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Bank USA, a unit of the company, took
overnight loans from the Federal Reserve on Sept. 23, Oct. 1,
and Oct. 23 in 2008 as well as on Sept. 9, 2009, and Jan. 11,
2010, according to the data released today. The largest loan was
$50 million on Sept. 23 and the smallest was $1 million on the
most recent two occasions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission June 30 that
&#8220;we used it one night at the request of the Fed to make sure
our systems were linked with their systems, and it was for a de
minimis amount of money.&#8221; Peter J. Wallison, a member of the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, then asked, &#8220;you never had
to use it after that?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No, and as I said, we used it on the Fed&#8217;s request,&#8221;
Cohn replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amounts are dwarfed by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s overall balance
sheet, which was $911 billion at the end of 2010, and by other
banks&#8217; borrowing throughout the financial crisis. Dexia SA, the
lender based in Brussels and Paris, drew $31.5 billion on one
day as total weekly borrowing reached a record in October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) shouldn&#8217;t
&#8220;escape&#8221; a $6.4 billion lawsuit in bankruptcy court by
switching the case to district court, the trustee liquidating
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s collapsed firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issue of JPMC&#8217;s misconduct belongs before the
bankruptcy court as the court most versed in the nuances of the
Ponzi scheme and the roles of other, related wrongdoers in that
scheme,&#8221; Irving Picard, the trustee, said in a filing yesterday
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. &#8220;JPMC seeks refuge in this
court to escape the scrutiny of the bankruptcy court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard sued JPMorgan in December, claiming the bank aided
Madoff&#8217;s fraud. Denying wrongdoing, New York-based JPMorgan said
it had a right to a jury trial in the district court. Picard&#8217;s
suit raised &#8220;unsettled questions&#8221; of law beyond the expertise
of a bankruptcy court, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;no doubt hopes to distance itself both from the
thousands of victims of that scheme and from other alleged
wrongdoers,&#8221; Picard said in the filing. &#8220;Yet there is no
escaping the fact that JPMC was at the very center of Madoff&#8217;s
Ponzi scheme. It was the debtor&#8217;s primary banker for over two
decades and touched virtually every cent that flowed through the
Ponzi scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Backdoor&#8217; Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan accused Picard of fighting a &#8220;backdoor&#8221; class
action suit and said a bankruptcy trustee generally can&#8217;t sue
third parties on behalf of creditors. Calling the argument
&#8220;frivolous,&#8221; Picard disagreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Picard, JPMorgan&#8217;s case can be resolved in
bankruptcy court by a &#8220;simple application&#8221; of law and doesn&#8217;t
require the judge to &#8220;engage in significant interpretation&#8221; of
commercial banking and other law, as JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be shocking if JPMorgan managed to get the
case moved,&#8221; said Chip Bowles, a bankruptcy lawyer at
Greenebaum Doll  McDonald PLLC in Louisville, Kentucky.
&#8220;Congress has said district courts should hear cases that
involve unsettled questions of non-bankruptcy law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard said his probe of JPMorgan isn&#8217;t done. He lost
&#8220;precious time&#8221; in his investigation when JPMorgan
&#8220;unilaterally decided to revise the trustee&#8217;s definition of
JPMC to include only 11 employees and confine the search for
responsive documents to those 11 employees,&#8221; he said in the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit against JPMorgan is one of more than 1,000
adversary cases Picard is pursuing or trying to settle.
&#8220;Judicial efficiency&#8221; would be served by keeping it before
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who is handling many other
Madoff cases, Picard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. He&#8217;s serving a 150-year sentence in
federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 1:11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Keller wore an Isaia suit,
and Duff Goldman wore Seven jeans and an ostrich-leather jacket
to the Culinary Institute of America Leadership Awards Gala last
night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event at the Marriot Marquis in Manhattan brought out
an eclectic crowd to raise money for scholarships. Guests
included financier Mario Gabelli, New York City Education
Chancellor Cathie Black, interior designer Adam Tihany, and the
chairman and co-chief executive of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG),
Steve Ells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modeling his outfit on stage, Goldman, the Food Network&#8217;s
&#8220;Ace of Cakes&#8221; star, confessed he didn&#8217;t learn high style from
his one-time boss at the French Laundry, where he worked after
graduating from the Culinary Institute of America in Napa
Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman also apologized to Keller for abruptly quitting
that job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was making a sweet mission fig puree, beautiful in
color, almost lavender,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;I used rice-wine
vinegar instead of simple syrup and I got chewed out, and that
night I bailed. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman made the dessert for the evening: cardamom and
pistachio carrot cake, in the shape of the award statue that all
the honorees received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real statues went to Paul Bocuse, named Chef of the
Century, and Daniel Boulud as Chef of the Year. Tim Ryan, the
president of the Culinary Institute, said many trends today can
be traced to Bocuse. To illustrate, he produced a photograph of
Bocuse showing the rooster tattoo on his arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Energizer Rabbit&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Bernardin Inc. executive chef Eric Ripert, in his toast
to Boulud, said one of his nicknames is &#8220;the Energizer
Rabbit.&#8221; Ripert continued: &#8220;When we&#8217;ve been partying with our
friend, he is so often saying, &#8216;Oh c&#8217;mon, it&#8217;s only 5 a.m.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Marriott, the chairman of Host Hotels  Resorts
Inc. (HST) and president of the Richard E.  Nancy P. Marriott
Foundation, was the only non-chef receiving an award. Still he
proudly noted his food-service experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I spent my teen years working in hot shops,&#8221; Marriott
said, referring to the restaurants that grew out of his father&#8217;s
curbside food stand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lifted its
target for five-year Treasury yields on trade recommendation
that seeks to profit from a drop in the price of the security,
saying the outlook for growth and inflation is becoming less
friendly for bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, one of the 20 primary dealers that trade with the
Federal Reserve, lifted its target to 2.5 percent from 2.3
percent. The five-year note yielded 1.94 percent when Goldman
recommended shorting the security on March 18, which is a bet
prices will fall. The notes yield 2.19 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher global food and energy prices will keep inflation
elevated at least until the summer and core inflation, which
strips out those components, is beginning to form a bottom in
developed economies, Goldman strategists wrote in a note today.
Inflation erodes the fixed payments of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Survey-based measures of longer-dated inflation have
increased in various countries, most notably in the U.S.,&#8221;
Francesco Garzarelli, chief interest-rate strategist at Goldman
Sachs in London, said in the note. &#8220;In reaction to these
shifts, central banks will verbally emphasize their inflation-
fighting commitment or, like in euroland, start tightening
policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s bond valuation model as well as other economic
analysis &#8220;suggest fading a bigger increase in yields than the
one we envisage, as underlying inflation pressures may
ultimately remain relatively contained,&#8221; Garzarelli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer-price index increased 0.5 percent in February,
the most since June 2009, figures from the Labor Department said
March 17. Economists projected a 0.4 percent gain, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Excluding food
and fuel costs, the core gauge rose 0.2 percent for a second
month, also more than estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman predicts 10-year Treasury yields will range from 3.5
percent to 3.75 percent in the second quarter and end the year at
3.75 percent. The notes yield 3.41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A legal dispute over Myriad
Genetics Inc. (MYGN)&#8217;s patents for a breast cancer test may decide what
type of genetic research is eligible for intellectual property
protection in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test compares a patient&#8217;s DNA to a known genetic
sequence to determine the odds of breast cancer developing. A
federal judge said last year gene sequences &#8220;are not markedly
different&#8221; from what occurs in nature and can&#8217;t be patented.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington,
specializing in patent law, plans to hear arguments April 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patents limit the right to use gene sequences, reducing the
number of scientists who can discover causes or treatments of
inherited diseases, according to the American Civil Liberties
Union, which filed the suit. The Washington trade group for
makers of biotechnology drugs counters that patents create an
economic incentive to develop new products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The entire biotechnology industry is watching this
case,&#8221; said John Iwanicki, an attorney with Banner  Witcoff in
Boston who specializes in helping biotechnology companies obtain
patents. &#8220;They have spent years and invested multibillions of
dollars in isolated gene sequences and that may all go away.
Nobody is going to spend the time to find an isolated gene
sequence unless it has a commercial purpose and function.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Robert Sweet in New York
invalidated elements of seven patents held by Salt Lake City-
based Myriad last year. The appeals court will decide whether
the identification of a genetic sequence, separated from the
strand of DNA, is sufficiently inventive to qualify for patent
protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal said in a court filing
he plans to argue that some isolated DNA shouldn&#8217;t be eligible
for a patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be the first time the solicitor general, the
nation&#8217;s top courtroom lawyer, argues in the Federal Circuit
since its creation in 1982, said Don Dunner of Finnegan
Henderson in Washington, a patent lawyer who specializes in
cases before the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a court filing, the Justice Department said &#8220;the
chemical structure of native human genes is a product of nature,
and is no less a product of nature when that structure is
&#8216;isolated&#8217; from its natural environment than are cotton fibers
that have been separated from cotton seeds or coal that has been
extracted from the earth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruling limiting gene patents would hurt companies such as
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Metabolix Inc. (MBLX), which makes
biodegradable plastic without petroleum using a genetically
modified microbe, and universities studying genes to find new
treatments, he said. Metabolix didn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myriad charges as much as $3,340 for each breast cancer
test covered by the patent and Medicaid programs in 32 states
cover the costs, with another two planning to add it, according
to Rebecca Chambers, a Myriad spokeswoman. Medicaid programs in
16 states and the District of Columbia don&#8217;t pay for the tests,
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has a financial assistance program for low-
income and uninsured patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA, a chemical compound that carries genetic information
such as skin tone, eye color and sex, influences development of
conditions such as obesity, diabetes and bipolar disorder. The
information is encoded on segments of DNA called genes, which
are responsible for inherited traits and are in turn made up of
thousands of nucleotides in different sequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2005 study reported in the journal Science estimated that
20 percent of known genes are covered by patents. The patent
office, which has declined to comment publicly on the Myriad
case, still processes patent applications under guidelines it
established a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad,
10-1406, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Association for Molecular
Pathology v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 09cv4515, U.S.
District Court for the District of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM Joins HTC, Samsung in Signing License Agreement With IV &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM), the Canadian maker of the
BlackBerry smartphone, has joined Samsung Electronics Co. and
HTC Corp. (2498) in taking a license to the patent portfolio owned by
Intellectual Ventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to IV spokeswoman Kasey Hakmagyi, these are the
only three makers of mobile devices who have taken licenses to
the Bellevue, Washington-based company&#8217;s 30,000 IP assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licenses could provide the three companies with
defensive shields against future patent-infringement suits.
Already makers of mobile devices are embroiled in a number of
patent-infringement cases in federal court and before a
government agency that has the power to exclude infringing
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission said March 25 that
it would review findings that Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and RIM&#8217;s
BlackBerry didn&#8217;t violate a patent belonging to Rochester, New
York&#8217;s Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) Samsung of Gyeonggi, Korea, already
settled with Kodak  a dispute over the same patent. Taoyuan,
Taiwan-based HTC, which is the target of a patent suit filed by
Apple in March 2010, signed a license agreement with Redmond,

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Apple Bring in Language Experts in &#8216;App Store&#8217; Fight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. have turned to dueling
linguistics experts in their battle over Apple&#8217;s attempt to
register &#8220;App Store&#8221; as a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft&#8217;s corner is Ronald R. Butters, the retired
head of Duke University&#8217;s English department and linguistics
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has brought on board Robert A. Leonard, a professor
of linguistics at Hofstra University. His area of specialization
is forensic linguistics, according to his university website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Feb. 28 filing to the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, Leonard -- who said he&#8217;s been paid $350 an hour for his
services -- said his research indicated that the predominant use
of the term &#8220;app store&#8221; is as a proper noun referring to
Apple&#8217;s online marketplace for applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic use of &#8220;app store&#8221; represents &#8220;a minority of the
total uses of that term,&#8221; he said in his report. He also noted
that there were &#8220;very few hits&#8221; on that term before Cupertino,
California-based Apple announced the opening of its app store in
March 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonard also noted that Apple&#8217;s competitors may have used
either &#8220;app&#8221; or &#8220;store&#8221; in their names for similar online
marketplace, &#8220;the fact that they avoided using the combined
phrase &#8216;App Store&#8217; is further recognition that App Store has
achieved brand significance with consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 76-page report filed March 29, Butters, who said he&#8217;s
paid $400 an hour for his research, criticized Leonard&#8217;s
findings. He said Leonard gave no indication of his basis for
selecting items as generic or non generic, &#8220;thus the
reliability of his conclusions are otherwise open to
considerable doubt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He contends that &#8220;it is clear from standard linguistic
semantic and lexicographical analysis that the compound noun app
store means simply &#8216;store at which apps are offered for sale.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple applied to register the term as a trademark July 7,
2008, according to the patent office database. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft filed documents in opposition to the
registration July 6, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hokie&#8217; Mark Fraudulently Obtained, Real Estate Company Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Virginia real estate brokerage that was sued for
trademark infringement by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University has responded by claiming the school obtained
the disputed mark fraudulently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hokie Real Estate Inc., of Blacksburg, Virginia, was sued
for infringement in federal court in Roanoke, Virginia, on Oct.
18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school had objected to the use of &#8220;Hokie,&#8221; which it
claimed it had used since the 1890s. The word is &#8220;a made-up
word, a coined term with no meaning,&#8221; the school said in its
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a 2007 shooting in which 31 students and faculty
members died, the phrase &#8220;we are all hokies&#8221; was used to show
solidarity with the university. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real estate company said the school&#8217;s application to
register the term was fraudulent in its claim that the term had
been in use in the 19th century. According to its research, the
real estate company said the first documented use of the term
comes much later than the school claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to order the patent office to cancel the
school&#8217;s &#8220;Hokie&#8221; registration, and the destruction of all
items marked with the term. Additionally, it asked for an award
of the school&#8217;s profits realized from the sale of &#8220;Hokies&#8221;
items, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real estate company also asked that the infringement
case brought by the school be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia Tech is represented by John H. Thomas of Thomas 
Karceski PC of Richmond, Virginia. Hokie Real Estate is
represented by Keith Finch, Brian Scott Wheeler, and James
Robert Creekmore of the Creekmore Law Firm PC of Daleville,
Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University v. Hokie Real Estate Inc., 7:10-cv-00466-GEC, U.S.
District Court, Western District of Virginia (Roanoke). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin Mint, Victorious in Diana Case, to Make Kate Bride Doll &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin Mint LLC, the closely held maker of collectible
items that won a trademark suit in collection with a doll
depicting Princess Diana, will be offering a doll showing Prince
William&#8217;s bride in her wedding dress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Exton, Pennsylvania-based company&#8217;s
website, the doll will feature an exact copy of Catherine
Middleton&#8217;s dress and hairstyle. It will cost $295 and be
shipped sometime in the summer of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin Mint is already selling a 16&#8221; doll dressed like
Middleton on the day her engagement to Prince William was
announced. That doll sells for $195. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Princess Diana&#8217;s memorial fund sued Franklin Mint in
federal court in Los Angeles in May 1998 for selling
unauthorized mementos of the princess, who died in a car crash
in Paris in 1997. The charity lost the case and was sued for
malicious prosecution by the mint, which is presently selling a
doll depicting Princess Diana in the dress she wore to her 1981
wedding for $295. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tusker Mattresses Sued Over Use of Tuskys Mark in Uganda &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tusker Mattresses Ltd., a Kenyan supermarket chain, was
sued for trademark infringement by a Uganda company that sells
arts and crafts, Uganda&#8217;s New Vision news website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuskys, which specialized in indigenous crafts, registered
the mark in Uganda for arts and crafts in 2008, according to New
Vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company objects to the supermarket chain&#8217;s use of the
name &#8220;Tuskys&#8221; for its new stores in Uganda, according to the
news website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The craft store is seeking money damages for having been
denied exclusive use of its trademark, New Vision reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BC Tells Students Use of Wireless Router Infringes Copyrights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston College&#8217;s Information Technologies Services has told
students that the use of a wireless router is a &#8220;common example
of copyright infringement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the guidelines posted on the service&#8217;s
website, wireless routers can give others the opportunity to
share illegal material, &#8220;giving the appearance that you are the
guilty party.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act,
universities are required to make an annual disclosure to
students about campus policies related to copyright law. The
schools also must implement a plan to combat unauthorized
distribution of copyrighted content. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Mar 31, 2011  3:27 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-31/microsoft-says-it-s-filing-complaint-against-google-s-market-share-with-eu.html"><headline>Microsoft Filing Complaint With EU Against Google on Search</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) filed a formal
complaint with European antitrust regulators about Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
dominance of the Internet search market in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google bars competitors from accessing its YouTube video
site for search results and has kept phones running Microsoft&#8217;s
operating system from working properly with YouTube, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said in a blog posting by General
Counsel Brad Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft unit and two other rivals last year lodged a
complaint with the European Union, which is investigating
whether Google has violated the region&#8217;s antitrust laws. Google
is under growing pressure from global regulators that are
probing whether the company uses its dominance of Web search to
thwart competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our filing today focuses on a pattern of actions that
Google has taken to entrench its dominance in the markets for
online search and search advertising to the detriment of
European consumers,&#8221; Smith wrote in the blog posting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft and partner Yahoo! Inc. have about a
quarter of the U.S. search market and Google the rest, Google
has almost 95 percent of the market in Europe, Smith said,
citing data from regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google &#8220;is not surprised&#8221; that Microsoft has complained
because its advertising unit, Ciao from Bing, filed a complaint
last year, said Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Happy to Explain&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to discuss the case with the European
Commission and we&#8217;re happy to explain to anyone how our business
works,&#8221; he said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the European Commission in
Brussels, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google shares fell 0.7 percent to 411 euros and Microsoft
fell 0.03 percent to 18.15 euros at 9:18 a.m. in Frankfurt
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides cordoning off YouTube, Google is also seeking to
block access to content owned by book publishers and restricting
its own advertisers from accessing the data they put in Google
servers as part of ad campaigns, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unfortunately, Google has engaged in a broadening pattern
of walling off access to content and data that competitors need
to provide search results to consumers and to attract
advertisers,&#8221; Smith said in the blog. Microsoft is the world&#8217;s
largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search Boxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google also has signed contracts that block top European
websites from distributing rival search boxes, Microsoft said.
For example, Microsoft can&#8217;t distribute some e-mail and document
services through certain European telecommunications companies
that have contracts with Google because these services make use
of Bing search boxes, Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU said in November that it&#8217;s investigating whether
Google&#8217;s AdSense contracts prevent publishers from striking
deals to place ads from other services on their sites. It&#8217;s also
looking at claims Google limits advertisers&#8217; ability to move
data such as key search terms from AdWords to another service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said in a statement in November that it &#8220;worked
hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry&#8221; by
marking ads clearly and enabling users and advertisers to move
data to other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s always going to be room for improvement and so
we&#8217;ll be working with the commission to address any concerns,&#8221;
Mountain View, California-based Google said in the November
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derek Jeter&#8217;s 3,000th career hit
may come down to a ruling by Jordan Sprechman far uptown from
his Park Avenue office as a managing director at JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprechman and Howie Karpin, an on-air anchor for Sirius
Satellite Radio, will moonlight this season as the two primary
official scorers for Major League Baseball&#8217;s New York Yankees
and Mets, earning $150 a game and trying to stay unnoticed and
free of controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeter needs 74 hits to become the 28th player to reach
3,000 and the only one to do so entirely in a Yankee uniform.
His 2,000th hit, in May 2006, was on a judgment call by Bill
Shannon, Sprechman and Karpin&#8217;s scoring mentor who died on Oct.
26. Whether a milestone moment or a mid-September meeting of
last-place clubs, Shannon preached that you can&#8217;t let the
situation dictate the scoring call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as a big game in baseball,&#8221;
Sprechman, a 49-year-old wealth adviser from Manhattan, said in
an interview. &#8220;They all count for 1/162nd of a season.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseball&#8217;s regular season begins today with six games,
including the Detroit Tigers&#8217; visit to Yankee Stadium, which
will be scored by Sprechman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accredited scorer for New York baseball since 2000,
Sprechman was promoted from part-time status to succeed Shannon,
who was an official scorer at Yankees and Mets games for 32
seasons before dying at age 69 in a New Jersey house fire, six
days after handling the Yankees&#8217; final 2010 victory in Game 5 of
the American League Championship Series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was totally respected by everybody and considered the
authority,&#8221; said Karpin, 56, a lifelong Bronx resident who has
scored New York baseball since 1998. &#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for him, I
wouldn&#8217;t be a scorer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scorer&#8217;s Call &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeter&#8217;s 2,000th hit came on a slow roller in front of home
plate that produced an errant throw by Kansas City Royals
catcher Paul Bako. Shannon ruled that Jeter would have beaten
the throw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not unlike umpiring, scoring is a mostly thankless job that
draws notice only when someone thinks a ruling is controversial,
said Phyllis Merhige, who oversees the accredited scorers in
baseball&#8217;s 30 major-league ballparks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does take a special breed, a great passion for the
game and a great desire to make a contribution,&#8221; Merhige said
in a telephone interview from her New York office. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t
pay all that well, it does take a lot of free time and most of
these guys have other jobs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing the Duties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprechman and Karpin will split 140 New York area contests
while giving the rest to backups Billy Altman and David Freeman.
The scorer&#8217;s responsibilities include deciding whether a batted
ball is a hit or an error, and whether a pitch that gets by the
catcher is a passed ball or a wild pitch, and occasionally,
which pitcher gets a victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Bill always said was that the purpose of errors was
to protect the pitcher from the malfeasance of his fielders,&#8221;
Sprechman said. &#8220;Errors are not designed to be punitive.
They&#8217;re designed to protect the pitcher&#8217;s ERA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he leaves his office for the press boxes at Citi Field
in Queens or Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, Sprechman said, it&#8217;s
most important that he bring along both his judgment and
decisiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In what I do here as a wealth adviser, you have to be
confident,&#8221; he said in the interview at the headquarters of
JPMorgan Chase, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets. &#8220;You
have to do the same thing at the ballpark. Your judgment could
be outstanding as a scorer but if you don&#8217;t present well, your
judgment is always going to be suspect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historic Call &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scoring decision can have historic ramifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Tigers pitcher Virgil Trucks is one of four to throw
two no-hitters in a single major-league regular season. The
second came amid controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third inning of a 1952 game at Yankee Stadium, New
York&#8217;s Phil Rizzuto was called safe on a close play at first
base after Tigers shortstop Johnny Pesky bobbled a one-hop
ground ball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Drebinger of the New York Times, the game&#8217;s official
scorer, called the play an error, then changed his mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I went in the dugout, there was an error on the
wall,&#8221; Trucks, now 93, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;When I
came back out, I saw a hit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dugout Call &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trucks said Drebinger, under pressure from other reporters,
called the Tigers&#8217; dugout during the seventh inning to talk to
Pesky, who said he had erred. Drebinger then changed his ruling
back to an error. Six outs later, the no-hitter was secured, and
almost six decades later, Trucks still signs memorabilia with
the date -- Aug. 25, 1952. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing could overcome something like pitching a no-
hitter in Yankee Stadium,&#8221; Trucks, nicknamed &#8220;Fire,&#8221; said
from his Calera, Alabama, home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprechman, who also is the public address announcer in the
media room at tennis&#8217;s U.S. Open and a member of the New York
Jets&#8217; statistics crew, said his most memorable scoring effort
was Curt Schilling&#8217;s &#8220;Bloody Sock Game&#8221; win over the Yankees
for the Boston Red Sox in the 2004 playoffs. Schilling pitched
Boston to victory while an incision in his foot from a temporary
surgery that allowed him to play bled through his sock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karpin, the author of the new book &#8220;162-0: Imagine a Mets
Perfect Season,&#8221; is the only scorer in major league history to
name a winning pitcher in a no-hitter. He gave the victory to
Brad Lidge on June 11, 2003, after six Houston Astros combined
to no-hit the Yankees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean Play &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karpin and Sprechman said they&#8217;ve had confrontations with
players angry over their decisions. Both said their biggest hope
is that feats such as Jeter&#8217;s 3,000th hit come on clean plays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jeter performs up to his career average, he&#8217;s poised to
get No. 3,000 on June 9 at Yankee Stadium in the finale of a
three-game series against Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve got that Red Sox series,&#8221; Karpin said with a laugh.
&#8220;Oh, boy. That&#8217;ll be a beauty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and its partner in a
proposed theme park in Shanghai scheduled an April 8
groundbreaking for the project, according to people with
knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney scheduled an event, with government-owned partner
Shanghai Shendi Group Co., in an e-mail today, without
elaborating. Construction begins that day, said the people, who
weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of construction marks a milestone in a five-year
process involving negotiations with city and central government
officials. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger and Parks 
Resorts Chairman Thomas Staggs will attend, said one of the
people. The park&#8217;s size, investment commitments and final
approval from Beijing&#8217;s central government will be announced as
well, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger said at the shareholder meeting on March 23 that
Disney, the world&#8217;s largest theme-park operator, was close to
receiving final approval for its first resort on mainland China,
the world&#8217;s most-populous nation. A public-comment period on the
plans ends on April 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Kingdom will open in &#8220;about five years,&#8221; Staggs
said at an investor meeting on Feb. 17. The first phase calls
for an investment of 24.5 billion yuan ($3.7 billion), Han Zheng, Shanghai&#8217;s mayor, said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website Hexun.com reported earlier today the companies
may start construction this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourist Zone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai has designated a 7-square-kilometer (1,730 acres)
tourist zone that will include the Disney park. The first phase
will also include hotels, car parks, a lake and commuter
stations, according to a blueprint posted on the Shanghai city
website last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger declared Disney&#8217;s intention to build a Shanghai resort
in September 2005, as he was about to become CEO. The company
received an initial government approval to build the park in
2009. The company signed a contract in November with Shanghai
Shendi to build the facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 24 cents $42.85
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
added 14 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai also plans to spend 4 billion yuan on a 9.2-
kilometer (5.7-mile) subway line for the complex in the city&#8217;s
Pudong area. Construction will begin in September and the line
is scheduled to open by July 2015, according to a Jan. 18
government statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city government started building infrastructure for the
project last year, Jiang Shujie, deputy director of the city&#8217;s
construction and transport commission, said on Jan. 7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
allows employees to invest in private equity and hedge funds
that are managed by the company. Today&#8217;s filing showed Blankfein
and eight deputies reaped about $125 million from their fund
investments during the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Blankfein, the largest fund distributions
were $23.3 million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; $20.2
million to President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn,
50; $16.7 million to Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar,
55, and $13.7 million to Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans, 53. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The others disclosed in the filing today were $10.9 million
to Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; $6.4 million apiece to
Vice Chairman John S. Weinberg, 54, and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and $430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of
compliance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPC index rose 0.9 percent to 37,775.07. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, rose 2 percent to 10.84 pesos as payrolls climbed in
the company&#8217;s second-biggest market. U.S. payrolls increased by
216,000 workers last month after a revised 194,000 gain the
prior month, the Labor Department said today in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB MM), the Mexican
producer of over-the-counter drugs, advanced 3.6 percent to
27.89 pesos. The company said it got a bank loan for as much as
2 billion pesos, according to a filing today to the Mexican
stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, advanced 1.7 percent to 59.41
pesos. Televisa agreed to acquire full ownership of its Cablemas
SA unit in a deal valued at 4.7 billion pesos ($397 million),
getting the 42 percent portion of the company it didn&#8217;t already
own, according to a filing today with Mexico&#8217;s stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrias Penoles SAB (PEOLES* MM), Mexico&#8217;s largest
silver producer, dropped 1.5 percent to 431.49 pesos. Silver for
May delivery in New York retreated 0.3 percent to $37.760 an
ounce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders advanced after Credit Suisse Group AG
suggested moving exposure away from Mexico&#8217;s cyclical stocks
such as mining companies into sectors such as homebuilding that
will benefit from the domestic economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX* MM), Mexico&#8217;s largest
homebuilder, climbed 5.4 percent to 57.01 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corp. GEO SAB (GEOB MM), Mexico&#8217;s second-largest
homebuilder, rose 3.8 percent to 34.59 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, was awarded a
$5.4 million cash bonus for 2010, his first in three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award was disclosed in the New York-based firm&#8217;s proxy
statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
today. The company reported in January that it paid Blankfein a
$12.6 million restricted-stock bonus for 2010 and will raise his
annual salary to $2 million salary this year from $600,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
increased Blankfein&#8217;s compensation even though earnings dropped
38 percent and the stock price was little changed from a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telkom South Africa Ltd. agreed to
sell its CDMA-technology business in Nigeria and keep its fiber-
optic division to benefit from a possible surge in demand for
data and fixed-line services in Africa&#8217;s most populous country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telkom will sell the CDMA business of Multi-Links for $52
million to Visafone Communications Ltd., the Pretoria-based
company said in a statement today. Africa&#8217;s largest fixed-line
telephone operator will retain Multi-Links&#8217; fixed-line and
fibre-network operations as it refocuses on its &#8220;core
competencies,&#8221; Telkom said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a good strategic decision,&#8221; Chris Gilmour, an
analyst at Johannesburg-based Absa Asset Management Private
Clients, said in a phone interview. &#8220;There are not many fixed
telephones going around in Nigeria. For a growing economy like
Nigeria&#8217;s, it&#8217;s well worth keeping the fibre asset.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telkom shares jumped as much as 1.50 rand, or 4.1 percent,
to 38.50 rand, and traded at 37.67 rand as of 4:05 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Multi-Links hasn&#8217;t made a profit since Telkom
purchased it for $410 million in 2007. Nigeria&#8217;s economy, the
second-largest in sub-Saharan Africa, may expand 8 percent this
year, Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proceeds for Telkom will be net of the existing
liabilities of the Multi-Links CDMA business, Telkom said.
Telkom spokesman Pynee Chetty declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telkom on Nov. 22 said Multi-Links has 7,000 kilometers
(4,351 miles) of fiber-optic cable, 2,000 kilometers of which is
shared with MTN Group Ltd. and Nigeria&#8217;s Globacom Ltd. CDMA, or
code division multiple access, refers to radio technology used
in data phones and networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s collapsed firm said JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) shouldn&#8217;t
&#8220;escape&#8221; facing his $6.4 billion lawsuit in bankruptcy court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issue of JPMC&#8217;s misconduct belongs before the
bankruptcy court as the court most versed in the nuances of the
Ponzi scheme and the roles of other, related wrongdoers in that
scheme,&#8221; Irving Picard, the trustee, said in a filing March 30
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. &#8220;JPMC seeks refuge in this
court to escape the scrutiny of the bankruptcy court,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard sued JPMorgan in December, claiming the bank aided
the confidence man&#8217;s fraud. Denying wrongdoing, New York-based
JPMorgan said it had a right to a jury trial in the district
court. Picard&#8217;s suit raised &#8220;unsettled questions&#8221; of law
beyond the expertise of a bankruptcy court, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;no doubt hopes to distance itself both from the
thousands of victims of that scheme and from other alleged
wrongdoers,&#8221; Picard said in the filing. &#8220;Yet there is no
escaping the fact that JPMC was at the very center of Madoff&#8217;s
Ponzi scheme. It was the debtor&#8217;s primary banker for over two
decades and touched virtually every cent that flowed through the
Ponzi scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. He&#8217;s serving a 150-year sentence in
federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 1:11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mortgage Brokers Win Bid to Block Fed&#8217;s Loan Fee Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two trade groups representing mortgage brokers won an
appeals court ruling temporarily blocking a Federal Reserve rule
that limits commissions for loan officers in mortgage
transactions from taking effect today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington granted emergency
motions from the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and
the National Association of Independent Housing Professionals
which argue the rule unfairly penalize brokers, who won&#8217;t be
able to pay loan officers from consumer-paid fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the
court sufficient opportunity to consider the merits of the
motions for emergency relief,&#8221; the court said in its order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell on March 30 rejected the
groups&#8217; request to stop the provision from taking effect,
finding that public policy interests outweighed harm to the
mortgage-broker industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board has reasonably concluded that the rule will
further public policy interests, a position that is further
supported by the Dodd-Frank Act, which also includes provisions
restricting certain loan-compensation practices,&#8221; Howell said
in a 46-page opinion, referring to the law that overhauled the
financial industry last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade groups filed separate lawsuits and appeals
challenging the regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed rule, part of the central bank&#8217;s effort to fix
weaknesses in mortgage finance, is aimed at preventing mortgage
originators from receiving more compensation for selling home
loans with higher interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Stawick, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment
after regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Savitt, president of the National Association of
Independent Housing Professionals, said &#8220;We&#8217;re glad the judges
issued the stay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once they have the opportunity to review the entire case,
we think they&#8217;ll agree with us that the Fed did not have the
authority&#8221; to issue the rule,&#8221; Savitt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are National Association of Mortgage Brokers v.
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 11-5078 and
National Association of Independent Housing Professionals Inc.
v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 11-5079,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Agrees on Handling of Its Secret Code in Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) and lawyers suing the carmaker over
alleged unintended sudden acceleration reached an accord on how
to handle evidence involving the source code Toyota uses in its
vehicles, a lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do have an agreement,&#8221; said Mark Robinson, one of the
lead lawyers for the plaintiffs in the consolidated federal
lawsuits in Santa Ana, California. &#8220;The judge has approved the
plan between Toyota and the plaintiffs to allow us access to
Toyota&#8217;s source code with security protection given to Toyota.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to the source code for Toyota&#8217;s electronic throttle-
control system has been an obstacle in moving the first of the
hundreds of cases involved to trial by early 2013, U.S. District
Judge James V. Selna has said. Selna, who is overseeing the
case, yesterday ordered the details of the agreement sealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides have been wrestling for several months over
how the plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys and their experts can analyze the
source code for the automaker&#8217;s electronic system, which the
plaintiffs have said in court papers is critical to determining
whether it played a part in alleged sudden acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Toyota is pleased to have reached an agreement on a
source code protective order that ensures the security and
strict confidentiality of this invaluable intellectual
property,&#8221; Celeste Migliore, a spokeswoman for Toyota Motor
Sales USA in Torrance, California, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are combined as In re Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ Shareholders Missing Bull Market With Hip Recalls Mounting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2005, Lance Corporal Cody Perkins, a 20-year-
old U.S. Marine, was injured by a roadside bomb outside Haditha,
Iraq, Bloomberg News&#8217;s David Voreacos, Alex Nussbaum and Greg
Farrell report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perkins suffered scrapes, bruises and a fractured femur, or
thigh bone. About a year later, he received a metal-on-metal
prosthetic hip made by DePuy Orthopaedics, a unit of Johnson 
Johnson. (JNJ) The new hip was being promoted as tough and durable --
and thus perfect for younger, physically active patients like
Perkins. By late 2009, however, he began experiencing pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of his trouble, his current physician said, isn&#8217;t
a complication from his original injury but the replacement hip.
Perkins has been told he&#8217;ll need to undergo &#8220;revision&#8221; surgery
to replace the ASR hip with another implant -- a highly invasive
procedure with a heightened risk of infection and joint
dislocations down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perkins has joined more than 1,000 other people who are
suing Johnson  Johnson over its DePuy ASR implants, Bloomberg
Businessweek reports in its April 4 issue. Those plaintiffs seek
damages for medical costs, lost wages, and pain and suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With $28 billion in holdings of cash and short-term
securities at the end of 2010, JJ will likely weather the
financial blowback from the bad hips. More troubling to
customers and stakeholders, however, is that the DePuy recalls
may be symptoms of a systemic quality-control problem at the
125-year-old corporation: a pattern of behavior that is
distinctly at odds with the comforting image long enjoyed by the
creator of brands like Band-Aid and &#8220;No More Tears&#8221; Baby
Shampoo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DePuy crisis is one of more than 50 voluntary product
recalls that JJ has issued just since the start of 2010,
covering brand names that read like an inventory of the family
medicine cabinet. Tylenol and St. Joseph Aspirin were recalled
for foul odors that people said made them sick. Benadryl and
Zyrtec were recalled for botched amounts of ingredients. Rolaids
were recalled for containing bits of wood and metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson management, from Chief Executive Officer
William Weldon on down, maintains that the company&#8217;s quality-
control issues are aberrations. Any suggestion of a broader
malaise, said Weldon, &#8220;is just Monday-morning quarterbacking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winifred Jiau Withdraws Bail Application, to Remain Jailed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winifred Jiau, the expert-network consultant charged in a
U.S. probe of insider trading, withdrew her bail application and
the judge presiding over her case ruled she will remain jailed
because she is likely to flee if freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, in New York, who held two
bail hearings for Jiau that lasted more than four hours last
month, said in his order issued yesterday that it was
&#8220;unlikely&#8221; that even if Jiau found more or different people to
co-sign her bond, it &#8220;would be sufficient to change the court&#8217;s
view that no combination of conditions would reasonably assure
defendant&#8217;s appearance if she were not detained.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, a former consultant for Primary Global Research LLC,
was indicted March 9 on insider-trading charges along with
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager Donald
Longueuil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both have pleaded not guilty. Her lawyer, Joanna Hendon,
wrote to Rakoff on March 28 saying she was withdrawing the
request to grant Jiau bail. The letter was publicly filed
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, of Fremont, California, has been in custody since she
was arrested Dec. 28. She was initially granted release on
$500,000 bond, U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson in New York
on March 2 ordered Jiau held without bail, saying it was
&#8220;unmistakably clear&#8221; she would flee the U.S. if released. The
case was later reassigned to Rakoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Taylor Bean CEO Allen Named as Defendant in U.S. Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former chief executive officer of Taylor, Bean 
Whitaker Mortgage Corp., Paul R. Allen, was named as a criminal
defendant in federal court in Virginia four days before the
company&#8217;s ex-chairman is scheduled for trial on accusations of
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No charges were specified on the court&#8217;s electronic docket
against Allen, a former senior executive at Freddie Mac, the
government-supported mortgage lender. Another former Taylor Bean
official identified Allen in court yesterday as a co-conspirator
in a fraud scheme that deceived financial firms by covering up
cash shortfalls at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have charged six people in the conspiracy,
which allegedly was masterminded by the company&#8217;s former
chairman, Lee Farkas. Five people, including two officials from
Colonial Bank, have pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against
Farkas, whose trial on 16 counts of bank, wire and securities
fraud is scheduled to begin April 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Ragland, 37, a former senior financial analyst at
Taylor Bean, said in court yesterday in Alexandria, Virginia,
that Allen, who lives in Oakton, Virginia, was aware that a
Taylor Bean entity created to fund mortgage loans was running up
a significant deficit. Ragland pleaded guilty to single charge
of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen didn&#8217;t return a telephone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Allen, 11-cr-00165; U.S. v. Ragland,
11-cr-00162, and U.S. v. Farkas, 10-cr-00200, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon Accused of Failing to Weigh Valeant Buyout Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) officials were accused in a lawsuit by a
Pennsylvania pension fund of &#8220;failing to act&#8221; in the best
interests of investors regarding a $5.7 billion buyout bid by
rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon, a maker of sleep and pain drugs, said yesterday
that it will consider the bid next week. In its complaint, the
pension fund claimed the company has been shortchanging
shareholders by not considering the $73-a-share hostile offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s directors are &#8220;failing to act in the
interest of Cephalon stockholders&#8221; by turning away repeated
offers by the Canadian drugmaker, lawyers for the Dauphin County
pension plan said in a Delaware Chancery Court suit filed
yesterday in Wilmington. &#8220;The company and its board of
directors have repeatedly refused duly to consider acquisition
proposals from Valeant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon, based in Frazier, Pennsylvania, surged more than
28 percent on March 30 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after
Mississauga, Ontario-based Valeant made its cash offer public.
The acquisition would be the largest hostile takeover in the
industry since Sanofi-Aventis SA bid for Genzyme Corp. last
year. Cephalon closed at $76.08 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our board of directors will meet early next week to
consider Valeant&#8217;s proposal,&#8221; Natalie de Vane, a Cephalon
spokeswoman, said yesterday in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Bujarski, a spokeswoman for Valeant, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the suit or the
statement by Cephalon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund wants a Delaware judge to force Cephalon&#8217;s board
to consider Valeant&#8217;s offer and bar use of the company&#8217;s so-
called poison-pill defense to frustrate the buyout bid,
according to the lawsuit. That defense makes acquisitions more
expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is County of Dauphin Retirement Plan v. Winger, CA
NO. 6332, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-WestLB Employees Charged Over Volkswagen Trading Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former WestLB AG traders and two external brokers
were charged by Dusseldorf prosecutors over speculation on
Volkswagen AG (VOW) shares during 2006 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WestLB employees were betting on the gap between the
carmaker&#8217;s common and preferred shares and their trading
resulted in damages of 48 million euros ($68 million), Ralf
Moellmann, spokesman for the Dusseldorf prosecutors&#8217; office said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former WestLB traders, who worked in the bank&#8217;s global
markets section, are charged with share-price manipulation and
breach of trust. The two external brokers helped the three
WestLB workers make the trades, according to the statement. The
suspects weren&#8217;t identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses stem from transactions in which WestLB&#8217;s traders
bet the gap between common and preferred shares would narrow.
The probe led to former executives who were investigated for
failing to inform the lender&#8217;s supervisory board about the
trading risks agreeing last year to pay 445,000 euros to settle
the claims. Prosecutors at the time said the probe looked into
600 million euros in losses WestLB had from speculative trading
by its own staff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s antitrust complaint against Google Inc. (GOOG)
may expand an existing European Union probe beyond Internet
searches to online video and mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google bars rivals from search boxes on websites, hinders
advertisers from transferring campaign data between search ad
platforms and blocks phones running Microsoft&#8217;s operating system
from working properly with YouTube, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in a blog posting by General Counsel Brad Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint to EU regulators in Brussels threatens to
widen a probe started last year after a Microsoft unit and two
other rivals last year complained that the company&#8217;s dominance
chokes off advertising revenue. Google has almost 95 percent of
the search market in Europe, Microsoft&#8217;s Smith said, citing data
from regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These allegations cover new and difficult ground and, if
Google fights, clearly increase the likelihood of a long
investigation,&#8221; said Matthew Hall, an antitrust lawyer at
McGuire Woods LLP in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the European Commission,
said the antitrust investigation is &#8220;still at the preliminary
stage&#8221; and that regulators would inform Google about the
complaint and &#8220;ask for its views on it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google &#8220;is not surprised&#8221; that Microsoft complained
because its advertising subsidiary, Ciao from Bing, also filed a
complaint last year, said Al Verney, a spokesman for Mountain
View, California-based Google in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to discuss the case with the European
Commission and we&#8217;re happy to explain to anyone how our business
works,&#8221; Verney said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Galleon Manager Spars With Rajaratnam Attorney Over Trades &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Galleon Group LLC portfolio manager Adam Smith and a
defense lawyer for Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge-fund&#8217;s co-founder,
sparred over why the firm bought stock in ATI Technologies
before a 2006 takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During cross-examination yesterday, the defense attorney,
Terence Lynam, sought to show jurors that Galleon and Rajaratnam
bought shares in ATI and other companies for lawful reasons and
not because Smith, 39, had come into inside information, as he
testified this week as a prosecution witness. Lynam said, for
instance, that Rajaratnam didn&#8217;t buy stock at the same time
Smith did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s not buying when you&#8217;re buying?&#8221; Lynam asked Smith
about purchases of Intersil Corp. (ISIL) Smith had testified that he
got leaks from an Intersil insider and passed them to his boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynam also asked questions suggesting his client didn&#8217;t
grasp that Smith was referring to a source of inside information
during a phone call between the two that the government secretly
taped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have no idea that when you got on the phone and
mentioned Kamal, that he knew who that was?&#8221; Lynam asked Smith.
Jurors previously heard a recording of Smith telling Rajaratnam
that &#8220;Kamal&#8221; -- who he said was Kamal Ahmed, a Morgan Stanley
investment banker -- said Vishay Intertechnology Inc. (VSH) may be
selling itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmed, who has not been charged, denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial in Manhattan federal court in
the largest crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S.
history. The Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of making
$45 million from tips by corporate insiders. Rajaratnam denies
wrongdoing, saying he based trades on research and published
sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony Chan Seeks Top Court Review of Ruling Over Wang Estate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nina Wang&#8217;s former feng shui adviser and lover Tony Chan
asked for a review by Hong Kong&#8217;s highest court of a ruling that
denied his claim to the estate of the late property tycoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan has a right to a hearing as the amount in dispute is
more than HK$1 million ($128,400), his lawyer Anderson Chow told
the Court of Appeal yesterday. The court&#8217;s conclusion that Chan
had forged Wang&#8217;s will is also a &#8220;grave and serious&#8221; finding,
Chow said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Doreen Le Pichon adjourned the hearing after about an
hour and said the three-judge panel would deliver a decision on
Chan&#8217;s request in due course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan, 51, is free on HK$5 million bail, having been
arrested on suspicion of forgery after Hong Kong&#8217;s High Court
first ruled against him in 2010. The Court of Appeal on Feb. 14
upheld that decision and ordered Wang&#8217;s estate, valued at $12
billion by lawyers for its administrators, to go to charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan claimed Wang left him her fortune after a 15-year
intimate relationship that began when he was hired to help find
her kidnapped husband Teddy, with whom she built the Chinachem
Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang&#8217;s 2002 will, which the appeal judges said was
indisputably valid, bequeathed the estate to Chinachem
Charitable Foundation Ltd. that she created with Teddy in 1988.
Supervision of the charity was to be entrusted to a body formed
by the Secretary General of the United Nations, the premier of
China and the chief executive of Hong Kong, according to the
appeal ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is between Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited
and Chan Chun Chuen and the Secretary for Justice, CACV62/2010
in the Hong Kong High Court of Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trial Lawyers Scour Jury&#8217;s Profiles on Facebook, Twitter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When jurors were chosen for the perjury trial of baseball
star Barry Bonds last month, they were barred from using social
media in regards to the case. Such a ban doesn&#8217;t extend to
lawyers, who mine Facebook Inc. profiles of jurors to unearth a
bias that might hurt or help their side, Bloomberg&#8217;s Ryan Flinn
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Twitter Inc. and other services have become a
major resource for both prosecutors and defense attorneys,
letting them glean more insight than they can get from jury
questionnaires, said Joseph Rice, chief executive officer of
Jury Research Institute in Alamo, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Social media has given us an incredible tool, because
it&#8217;s something jurors voluntarily engage in, and they post
information about their activities or affiliations or hobbies,&#8221;
Rice said. That reveals &#8220;their life experience or attitude that
may have an impact on how they view the facts of the case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice adds fuel to the debate over social-networking
privacy and whether Internet postings should be used to reject
someone from a job or academic program -- or a seat in the jury
box. Facebook has more than 500 million users, while Twitter
members post 140 million messages daily. That yields a wealth of
data that lawyers can use to screen people or hone arguments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Releases Discount-Window Loan Records Under Court Order &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve released thousands of pages of secret
loan documents under court order, almost three years after
Bloomberg LP first requested details of the central bank&#8217;s
unprecedented support to banks during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records -- 894 files in PDF form that must be
individually opened and read -- reveal for the first time the
names of financial institutions that borrowed directly from the
central bank through the so-called discount window. The Fed
provided the documents after the U.S. Supreme Court last month
rejected a banking industry group&#8217;s attempt to shield them from
public view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an enormous breakthrough in the public
interest,&#8221; said Walker Todd, a former Cleveland Fed attorney
who has written research on the Fed lending facility. &#8220;They
have long wanted to keep the discount window confidential. They
have always felt strongly about this. They don&#8217;t want to tell
the public who they are lending to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank has never revealed identities of borrowers
since the discount window began lending in 1914. The Dodd-Frank
law exempted the facility last year when it required the Fed to
release details of emergency programs that extended $3.3
trillion to financial institutions to stem the credit crisis.
While Congress mandated disclosure of discount-window loans made
after July 21, 2010, with a two-year delay, the records released
yesterday represent the only public source of details on
discount-window lending during the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed documents released yesterday show the central bank
providing credit to borrowers large and small. A page described
as &#8220;Primary Credit Originations, February 5, 2008&#8221; lists the
New York branch of Deutsche Bank AG with a loan of $455 million
from the New York Fed. On the same day, Macon Bank is listed
with a $1,000 loan from the Richmond Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lending through the discount window soared to a peak of
$111 billion on Oct. 29, 2008, as credit markets nearly froze in
the wake of the bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) While the loans provided banks with backstop cash,
the public has never known which banks borrowed or why. Fed
officials say all the loans made through the program during the
crisis have been repaid with interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Fed officials, lawyers representing the central
bank, and even some Fed watchers have expressed concern that
revealing the names of discount-window borrowers could keep
banks away from the facility in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Lehman, Madoff Fees Might Deplete SIPC, Official Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High fees paid to the trustees of bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s brokerage and of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s collapsed firm
might deplete the $2.5 billion fund of the Securities Investor
Protection Corp., according to a report by the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s Inspector General. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report assesses how well the SEC is doing in overseeing
SIPC, which liquidates bankrupt brokerages to pay creditors.
There is &#8220;significant criticism and concern&#8221; over the
brokerage trustees&#8217; fees in the Lehman and Madoff bankruptcies,
according to the report. The SEC must make &#8220;systematic&#8221;
inspections to ensure cost-effective liquidations, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman brokerage trustee James Giddens and his law firm
were paid about $108 million in the 24 months from Lehman&#8217;s
September 2008 bankruptcy through September 2010, the report
said, citing court documents. Madoff trustee Irving Picard and
his law firm were paid about $102 million in the 21 months from
December 2008, when Madoff was arrested, through September 2010,
it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the liquidations are far from over, &#8220;fees paid to date
for both the Lehman and Madoff liquidations are a mere fraction
of the amounts that will eventually be sought,&#8221; the report
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time the SEC inspected SIPC thoroughly was in
2003, with a follow-up in 2005, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the SEC&#8217;s inspection of SIPC, the SEC identified
several deficiencies in SIPC&#8217;s operations regarding its controls
over fees, an improperly denied claim, internal policies and
guidance, education initiative and funding options,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the SEC failed to set up a review schedule and scope
for inspections, the Inspector General said. As a result, 14
liquidations from 2003 until today haven&#8217;t been scrutinized by
the SEC, according to the audit report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIPC&#8217;s board &#8220;constantly monitors the SIPC fund to assure
that the corporation has sufficient assets to fulfill all of
SIPC&#8217;s statutory missions,&#8221; Stephen Harbeck, SIPC&#8217;s president,
said in an e-mail. Adding to resources, &#8220;SIPC&#8217;s members are
currently paying assessments of one quarter of one percent of
their net operating revenues to SIPC,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, nor Jake
Sargent, a Giddens spokesman, responded to e-mails requesting
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Lisa Abramowicz" date="Apr 01, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-01/bernanke-cash-drives-junk-bond-frenzy-as-jpmorgan-faces-record-competition.html"><headline>Bernanke Cash Drives Junk Bond Frenzy as JPMorgan Faces Record Competition</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented number of
investment banks are vying to underwrite a record amount of junk
bonds as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke succeeds in
driving cash to the neediest U.S. borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) led 42 firms helping companies to
issue speculative-grade debt this year, up from 39 in the first
quarter of last year and 14 in the first three months of 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. High-yield bond sales
have reached about $88.3 billion in 2011, on pace to exceed last
year&#8217;s record $287.6 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is in the midst of buying $600 billion of
Treasuries in an attempt to pump cash into the financial system
and encourage investors to wade into riskier debt. The strategy
is allowing high-risk borrowers to cut interest expense, extend
maturities and avoid missing debt payments. Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service says the default rate in the U.S. tumbled to 3 percent
in February from a peak of 14.7 percent in November 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re all out there and they&#8217;re all pitching hard,&#8221;
said Douglas Coltharp, the chief financial officer at
Birmingham, Alabama-based HealthSouth Corp. (HLS), the nation&#8217;s
largest provider of inpatient services. &#8220;Banks go where the
activity and the opportunity is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HealthSouth has issued about $650 million of bonds with B
ratings since the end of September, compared with about $915
million of notes in the previous seven years, Bloomberg data
show. Debt rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s and lower than BBB- at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s is considered speculative grade, or junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has earmarked about $75 million of the
financing to repay more expensive bonds, reducing the coupon
paid on the debt by 3.25 percentage points annually, according
to a March 24 company presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With yields on government and other investment-grade debt
hovering at about record lows because of the Fed&#8217;s policies,
bondholders are clamoring for higher payouts. Investors poured
$14.4 billion into global high-yield mutual funds in the first
two months of the year, compared with $31.5 billion in all of
2010, according to Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on speculative-grade bonds fell to 7.4 percent on
average this week from a peak of 20.8 percent in March 2009,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The drop saves a
borrower $13.4 million a year in interest on every $100 million
of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns on junk bonds of about 88 percent since the end of
2008 are more than double those of the SP 500 stock index,
including reinvested dividends, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Leverage&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe of high-yield bonds will expand, even as
financing rates rise when the Fed stops stimulating the economy,
said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The number of issuers is growing,&#8221; Gallo said. &#8220;There
will be new issuers and there will be maybe more leverage going
forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. High Yield Master II
index tracks 2,164 bonds with a par value of $1 trillion, up
from 1,321 valued at $344 billion a decade ago. This year, 195
companies have sold debt rated below investment grade, up from
155 during the same period of 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia Beach, Virginia-based ADS Tactical Inc., Hooters
Inc. of Atlanta and Family Dollar Stores Inc. in Matthews, North
Carolina, have turned to bonds for the first time this year,
according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans Dwindle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk bond sales are also rising as banks become less
willing to offer loans amid new requirements from the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision that they hold more capital
against risky assets, according to Gallo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial and industrial loans at America&#8217;s banks totaled
$1.4 trillion as of March 16, down from a peak of $1.62 trillion
in October 2008, according to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials purchased $1.7 trillion of mortgage debt and
Treasuries through March 2010 to pull the U.S. out of the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression. They voted in
November to buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries in a
second round of a policy known as quantitative easing that will
run through June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initiative, called &#8220;QE2&#8221; by economists and investors,
initially pushed down yields on government debt, allowing
companies to issue bonds with record low yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diminishing Share &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As junk bond sales increase, the market for underwriting
the debt has become more fragmented. The three most-active
underwriters of the securities this year claimed the smallest
share since at least 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. (BAC)
in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) of
Zurich managed 36.4 percent of new high-yield debt sales, down
from 37.6 percent in all of last year and 41.3 percent in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, when companies issued less than half the volume of
speculative-grade notes that they sold in this year&#8217;s first
quarter, the three top underwriters managed about half of all
high-yield debt sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of qualified banks that want to
participate,&#8221; said Kolja Rockov, chief financial officer of
Linn Energy LLC (LINE), a Houston-based acquirer of producing oil and
gas facilities. &#8220;We picked our partners based on the
relationships that we&#8217;ve had for a long period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No More Left &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linn Energy sold $1 billion of 10.5-year debt in September
with a coupon of 7.75 percent, Bloomberg data show. In February,
it offered to repurchase outstanding notes with coupons of 9.875
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Houston-based company has no outstanding bank debt left
to refinance, so proceeds from additional sales will go toward
buying oil and gas wells, Rockov said. &#8220;Odds are the
acquisition market is very robust and we&#8217;ll be back in the
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has a 14.2 percent share of the market, followed
by Bank of America at 11.8 percent and Credit Suisse at 10.4
percent. New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C), the U.S. bank that
received the largest taxpayer bailout, fell to seventh from
third in the same period of 2010, as its share dropped to 6.5
percent from 12.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) of London showed the biggest jump of the top
10 underwriters, increasing to No. 6 from 8 as its share jumped
to 8.5 percent from 5.6 percent. The other top 10 banks this
year, in order, are Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), New York-
based Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS) -- also located in New York
-- Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) of San Francisco and UBS AG (UBSN) in Zurich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Variety of Banks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities firms are expanding into junk bonds after the
collapse of the structured finance market. Unlike corporate
debt, sales of mortgage bonds, asset-backed securities and
collateralized debt obligations have yet to rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a variety of banks actually willing to work
with you,&#8221; said Mark Wetzel, the chief financial officer of
data-center developer DuPont Fabros Technology Inc. (DFT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington-based DuPont Fabros used seven underwriters when
it sold $101.3 million of hybrid notes this month that pay
interest at a rate of 7.625 percent. &#8220;Everything is better,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We were able to tap the market at what we think is
pretty attractive rates for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some banks are finding it hard to compete. LaBranche  Co.
in New York shut its credit-brokerage business in July.
Chapdelaine Credit Partners closed after an agreement to receive
capital from Primus Financial Holdings Ltd. fell through, people
familiar with the matter said in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Natural Cycle&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market will always be competitive and there will be
firms that are either trying to gain market share or pulling
back and doing less,&#8221; said Peter Toal, the head of Americas
leveraged finance syndicate at Barclays in New York. &#8220;Today it
feels like more of the former than the latter. It&#8217;s a natural
cycle. More banks are getting into the lending game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of speculative-grade debt company debt in the U.S.
dwindled to $65.9 billion in 2008, the year Lehman Brothers
Holding Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection and as banks wrote
down $1.1 trillion of losses worldwide, Bloomberg data show.
That led to pent up demand, fueling $450.3 billion of issuance
in the following two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is surprising &#8220;that the markets got to be as ebullient
as they are so quickly,&#8221; HealthSouth&#8217;s Colthard said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think it could get much better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HealthSouth&#8217;s newest bonds are unsecured, freeing the
company to use assets to back other types of financing that are
easier to get during a less-liquid economy, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are more willing to accept looser terms after
non-financial companies boosted cash holdings to almost $1.9
trillion at the end of last year, according to Fed data. Moody&#8217;s
projects the default rate will continue dropping through this
year, to 1.7 percent in February 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Corporate America has been stockpiling a lot of cash,&#8221;
said Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at North Palm
Beach, Florida-based Bankrate.com, in an interview earlier this
month. &#8220;From the standpoint of access to credit markets, they
look like a pretty good risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities Investor Protection
Corp., which initiated the liquidation of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s money
management firm, told a judge it has a &#8220;right to be heard&#8221; in
trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s $6.4 billion suit against JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIPC lawyer Kevin Bell made the assertion in a letter to
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon, according to a filing
yesterday in Manhattan federal court. Picard has alleged
JPMorgan aided in Madoff&#8217;s $20 billion Ponzi scheme. The New
York-based bank, which is trying to move the case to U.S.
district court from U.S. bankruptcy court, has said it may
object to SIPC&#8217;s participation in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s suit raises &#8220;unsettled&#8221; questions of common and
commercial banking law that are beyond the expertise of a
bankruptcy court, JPMorgan said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee and SIPC disagreed with the bank, saying in
court filings the bankruptcy court is well-versed in the case.
They noted that the court presides over more than 1,000 lawsuits
filed by Picard that seek to return money to Madoff investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment made after regular
business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. He&#8217;s serving a 150-year sentence in
federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note on the court docket said the clerk doesn&#8217;t accept
letters for filing and instructed SIPC lawyer Bell to write
directly to the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Kroger Co.,
Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) and TiVo Inc. (TIVO) said they were
affected by a security breach that may have enabled an
unauthorized person to see some customers&#8217; names and e-mail
addresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Kroger yesterday disclosed the accessing of
the data, which occurred at Epsilon, a Dallas-based provider of
e-mail marketing services. Capital One and TiVo issued
statements today. The information was gained by a person outside
Epsilon, according to separate statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four companies said no personal identification
information or credit card details were compromised. JPMorgan,
Kroger, Capital One and TiVo all said they are investigating the
incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica Simon, a spokeswoman for Epsilon, declined to say
how many more companies might be affected, citing a continuing
investigation. She said she didn&#8217;t have details on which law
enforcement agencies might be involved in the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epsilon said the breach occurred March 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities Investor Protection
Corp., which initiated the liquidation of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s money
management firm, told a judge it has a &#8220;right to be heard&#8221; in
trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s $6.4 billion suit against JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard has alleged the New York-based bank aided in
Madoff&#8217;s $20 billion Ponzi scheme. JPMorgan, which is trying to
move the case to district court from U.S. bankruptcy court, has
said it may object to SIPC&#8217;s participation in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIPC lawyer Kevin Bell addressed the letter to U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon, according to the filing
yesterday in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein $19
million in compensation for 2010, almost double the prior year,
and granted him the first cash bonus in three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total includes $5.4 million in cash, $12.6 million in
restricted stock, a $600,000 salary and about $464,000 in other
benefits, the New York-based firm&#8217;s proxy statement showed.
Blankfein&#8217;s $9.8 million pay for 2009 included $9 million in
restricted stock plus salary and other compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
boosted Blankfein&#8217;s compensation for a year in which earnings
dropped 38 percent and the stock price was little changed. The
amount falls in the middle ground between 2008, when Blankfein,
56, and six other senior officers got no bonuses, and the
record-setting $67.9 million award he received for 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that they would return to a more market-based
pay is probably not surprising&#8221; after lower amounts for 2008
and 2009, said Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner at
Compensation Advisory Partners LLC in New York. &#8220;They&#8217;re not
quite back to anything remotely like what they paid in the prior
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 2010 share performance -- a decline of less
than half of 1 percent -- outstripped competitors including Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second-
biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs before both
converted to banks in 2008. Shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
which reported a record profit last year, rose 1.8 percent
during the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matching Bonuses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 30 members of the Goldman Sachs management committee
received only restricted stock for their 2009 bonuses and four
of them -- Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55,
President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, and Vice
Chairmen J. Michael Evans, 53, and John S. Weinberg, 54 --
received exactly the same $9 million award as Blankfein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2010, Goldman Sachs once again matched all of those
four executives&#8217; bonuses to Blankfein&#8217;s $12.6 million in
restricted stock and $5.4 million in cash. All four also
received a $600,000 salary in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve had a history of paying their top five like
partners,&#8221; Orens said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unusual, but it really comes from
their partnership mentality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm disclosed in January that Blankfein&#8217;s salary will
increase to $2 million in 2011 and that Cohn, Viniar, Evans and
Weinberg will each receive a $1.85 million salary starting this
year. Each of them had received a $600,000 salary since 1999,
the year the firm became a public company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gain From Investments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and eight deputies reaped a total of $125 million
during 2010 from their investments in private equity and hedge
funds managed by the firm, the proxy disclosed. Blankfein&#8217;s
payments, which included profits and any return of capital,
totaled $27.2 million, outstripping his compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Blankfein, the largest fund distributions were $23.3
million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; $20.2 million to
Cohn; $16.7 million to Viniar; and $13.7 million to Evans. The
others disclosed in the filing were $10.9 million to Vice
Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; $6.4 million apiece to Weinberg
and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and $430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s executives stand to earn more cash bonuses
in future years under a long-term incentive plan disclosed in
the proxy. The payments are contingent on two financial
measures: return on equity and book value per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board&#8217;s Choice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial measurement period is three years and the board
can extend it through the end of 2018. The notional value of the
award for all five executives named in the proxy was $7 million,
a figure that wasn&#8217;t included in the 2010 compensation because
it won&#8217;t be delivered for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC requires that the company&#8217;s proxy disclose how much
compensation executives received during the fiscal year. Under
that methodology, which includes awards received during 2010 for
performance in prior years, Blankfein received a total of $14.1
million in compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board has unanimously recommended that the
firm give shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting at
9:30 a.m. on May 6 in Jersey City, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong granted 270 work visas for

March 11 earthquake, the South China Morning Post said, citing
Director of Immigration Eric Chan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented fast-track approval system was put in
place so that the department is able to approve the work visas
in two days, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the visas were given to senior managers of
multinational companies in Japan, mainly in the financial
industry, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
