&lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. First U.S. Shutdown in 17 Years Unavoidable With No Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government stands poised
for its first partial shutdown in 17 years at midnight tonight,
after a weekend with no signs of negotiations or compromise from
the Congress or the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Government Shutdown Begins as Congress Divides on Spending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government began its first
partial shutdown in 17 years, idling as many as 800,000 federal
employees, closing national parks and halting some services
after Congress failed to break a partisan deadlock by a midnight
deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Goldman Said to Make $1.5 Million Error in Ford Bond Issue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. mistakenly
added about $1.5 million of interest costs to a Ford Motor Co.
bond sale last week by using the wrong Treasury note as a
benchmark for the security, according to two people with
knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Global Stocks Drop, Treasuries Gain as Government Shutdown
Looms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Global stocks fell the most in a
month, trimming the biggest quarterly advance since the start of
2012, before a potential U.S. government shutdown. Treasuries
pared early gains while crude oil slid to the lowest level in
three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Schwarzman Says Selling BlackRock in 1994 Was &#8216;Heroic&#8217; Error &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Group LP&#8217;s Steve
Schwarzman said his decision 19 years ago to sell what would
become the world&#8217;s largest money manager was a &#8220;heroic&#8221;
mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Stocks Climb as Treasuries, Commodities Fall Amid U.S.
Shutdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks rebounded from yesterday&#8217;s
slide as investors speculated the economic effects from the
shutdown of the U.S. government will be limited and counteracted
by Federal Reserve stimulus. Treasuries fell as gold tumbled and
the dollar recovered from early losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Stocks Drop on U.S. Government Shutdown as Yen, Treasuries
Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slid around the world and gold
rallied as the U.S. government shutdown entered a second day and
a report showed American employers added fewer jobs than
forecast. The dollar fell, while the yen and Treasuries rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Seaport Agrees to Merge With Global Hunter to Build Boutique &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Seaport Group LLC, the  credit-market brokerage founded in 2001, agreed to merge with boutique
investment bank Global Hunter Securities LLC to create a full-service firm with more than 300 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Debt Ceiling Wall of Worry Is Another Reason for Investing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. congressional standoff that
shut down the government for the first time in 17 years is a
buying opportunity for stock investors, if history is any guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Broncos&#8217; Point Spread Against Jaguars Seen Being NFL Record &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Peyton Manning&#8217;s record-setting start
to the season -- 16 touchdown passes as the Denver Broncos have
marched to 4-0 -- has oddsmakers eyeing what may be the highest
point spread in National Football League history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. JPMorgan&#8217;s Big Mistake Was Valuing Trades: William D. Cohan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- In the end, what have we learned
from JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $7.1 billion &#8220;London Whale&#8221;
trading debacle? For those who have lost track, the derivatives
trades resulted in losses of $6.2 billion plus an additional
$920 million in fines -- so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Steve Jobs Never Worried About Debt Ceiling: Caroline Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Everyone knows, or has heard the
cliche, that markets hate uncertainty. It&#8217;s also a given that
the future is always uncertain. How, then, do markets ever
manage to function -- or, for that matter, businesses, which
must make decisions today about investments that will pay off in
the future? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. As Party Splinters, Boehner&#8217;s Leadership Collapses: Ezra
Klein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- We&#8217;re used to brinkmanship in
Washington resulting from conflict between Democrats and
Republicans. But this shutdown is different. It&#8217;s a fight
between Republicans and Republicans -- or, more specifically,
Republicans and the Tea Party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Worried About Cancer? Ask Someone to Marry You: Virginia
Postrel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- When I mentioned my bout with
breast cancer to a new acquaintance, his first question was,
&#8220;Are you married?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Republicans Aren&#8217;t Crazy for Fighting Obamacare: Ramesh
Ponnuru &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- For many supporters of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, continued resistance to the
law isn&#8217;t just mistaken. It&#8217;s downright pathological. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Draghi Says ECB Ready to Act to Control Money Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Mario
Draghi speaks at a news conference in Paris about euro-area
inflation, money-market rates, economic activity and the process
of an asset-quality review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Bitcoin Price Swings as Startups Draw Regulators&#8217; Glare &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin, the digital currency, has
gained prominence this year for its wild price swings and for
piquing the interest of regulators from New York to Germany.
Bloomberg&#8217;s Stephanie Baker reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Italy&#8217;s Letta Urges Lawmakers to Seize the Moment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta
addresses lawmakers in the Senate in Rome seeking their support
to save his government in a confidence vote. (This report is in
Italian.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Cruise the Med on a Super-Yacht for $444,000 Per Week &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg Television takes a trip
from Nice to Monaco in the Mediterranean Sea on a super-yacht
that costs $444,000 a week to rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. The Million Dollar Cars of Christian Von Koenigsegg &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) --  Bloomberg&#8217;s Joel Weber reports on
the rare, million dollar cars of Christian Von Koenigsegg. He
speaks with Deirdre Bolton on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Money
Moves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christie Smythe" date="Oct 07, 2013  2:57 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-07/chevron-s-ecuador-defendants-denied-jury-trial-by-court.html"><headline>Chevron''s Ecuador Defendants Denied Jury Trial by Court</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) won a request to have a
judge rather than a jury decide its case over alleged fraud in
an Ecuadorian pollution verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan ruled today
that the Ecuadorians and their legal adviser, Steven Donziger,
don&#8217;t have a constitutional right to a jury trial because the
San Ramon, California-based company isn&#8217;t seeking damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants argue that they are entitled to a jury as a
matter of fairness,&#8221; Kaplan said. &#8220;But that argument -- even
if it had merit, which it does not -- is beside the point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil firm, alleges that
Donziger and others, in a case over pollution in the Ecuadorian
jungle, won a $19 billion verdict against the company by fraud.
A trial in the lawsuit is scheduled for Oct. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial was initially set to be held in two parts, with
damages being sought only against Donziger and his firm and not
the Ecuadorian plaintiffs in the environmental suit. Chevron
dropped its damages claim against the legal adviser and said it
no longer wanted a jury trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in a civil case is guaranteed only if the plaintiff
is seeking damages, Kaplan wrote. Otherwise, parties must agree
to it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents of Ecuador&#8217;s Lago Agrio area near the Colombian
border have sought damages for about 20 years for pollution in
the Amazon rainforest that they allege was caused by Texaco
before it was acquired by Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrongdoing Denied &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies there was any wrongdoing by it in Ecuador and
claims that Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at its
former oil fields, which were taken over by state-owned
PetroEcuador. The U.S. company also said that it was released
from future liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is seeking to bar the Ecuadorians from enforcing
the verdict and disgorgement of any gains they won as a result
of the alleged fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
The appeals court case is In Re Naranjo, 13-00772, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 300 people in finance wandered
the streets of Manhattan this weekend in the all-night puzzle
competition &#8220;Midnight Madness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From sunset Saturday night to around 2 p.m. on Sunday, 30
teams of 10 tapped on gravestones, assembled an electronic piano
and decoded countless ciphers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition, in its second year, lets young
professionals raise money for charity while showing off their
skills in problem-solving. The challenges are in development for
months and feature dozens of clues, cues, keys and experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a combination of solving puzzles and figuring out
the quirky, twisted stuff that goes on in the minds of Game
Control,&#8221; said Dan Sharfman, captain of Black Gold,
representing the commodities group at Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Control consisted of more than 50 people assembled by
Goldman partner Elisha Wiesel, who founded the &#8220;Madness&#8221; and
is the son of Elie Wiesel, as well as event producer Lindsi
Shine, and game designers Mat Laibowitz and Dan Michaelson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their headquarters was Big Daddy&#8217;s Diner in the East 20s,
where the hint-givers included Alan Solomon, who played the
character that planned &#8220;The Great Allnighter&#8221; in the 1980 film
&#8220;Midnight Madness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entry fee is $50,000. Employees of Citigroup Inc. (C),
Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS) turned to their senior managers for
donations. Citigroup&#8217;s global markets team orchestrated stunts,
such as paying to throw a pie at your boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money Raised &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result: $2.9 million raised for Good Shepherd Services,
which cares for the poor in New York City. It was more than
double the proceeds from last year&#8217;s inaugural event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I live close to Red Hook and knowing these guys are
engaged there in housing and health care makes this
meaningful,&#8221; said Shahzad Ali of the prime services group at
Goldman and a member of team 0xff00, which won last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition began in the parking lot of an abandoned
Pathmark near the Manhattan Bridge. The Alphanauts, a team of
Connecticut hedge-funders, arrived after dining at Nobu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hints and the clues led teams around the city from Pier
25 in Hudson River Park to the roof of a private event space and
New York Marble Cemetery in the East Village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Coast Burninators, with some high-tech types who
tackle puzzles like this on a regular basis, came in first.
Teams crossed over a miniature bridge printed with the word
&#8220;Finish,&#8221; located at 7 World Trade Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted, many saw the open arms of Sister Paulette
LoMonaco, the head of Good Shepherd Services, who was ready with
hugs and bagels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The connection with &#8216;Midnight Madness&#8217; is that every day
we are working to solve the puzzle of extreme poverty,&#8221; Sister
Paulette said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzano Papel e Celulose SA (SUZB3) and Fibria
Celulose SA (FIBR3), Brazil&#8217;s best-performing paper makers this year,
rallied as Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. recommended buying the
stocks, citing higher pulp demand and lower supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibria advanced 4.3 percent to 27.29 reais at 2:37 p.m. in
Sao Paulo trading, the biggest gain today on the MSCI
Brazil/Materials Index, which was little changed. Suzano added
2.4 percent to 8.79 reais, the second-biggest advance on that
gauge. The benchmark Ibovespa index slid 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs boosted its recommendation on both stocks
from the equivalent of hold, citing a 26 percent increase in
Brazilian pulp sales to China in August. Fibria and Suzano will
also gain as the decision by Chile&#8217;s Empresas Copec SA and
Finland&#8217;s Stora Enso Oyj to postpone the opening of a plant in
Uruguay to the first quarter of 2014 reduces supply, according
to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibria and Suzano &#8220;are best positioned to benefit from
improved demand,&#8221; Marcelo Aguiar, Diogo Miura and Humberto Meireles, analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note to
clients. &#8220;Both stocks have already significantly outperformed
the market year-to-date, but this has largely reflected
depreciation of the Brazilian currency and higher pulp prices in
2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzano gained 25 percent this year and Fibria advanced 20
percent while the real weakened 6.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Natasha Doff" date="Oct 08, 2013 12:27 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-08/ocado-rises-to-record-after-goldman-s-buy-rating-london-mover.html"><headline>Ocado Rises to Record After Goldman&#8217;s Buy Rating: London Mover</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) rose to the highest
since its initial public offering three years ago after Goldman
Sachs (GS) Group Inc. recommended buying the shares and said a tie-up
with William Morrison Supermarkets Plc. will accelerate growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s largest Internet-only grocer climbed 5.1 percent
to 450.50 pence, the highest price since July 2010. Goldman
Sachs, which previously held no rating for Ocado, said in a
report to clients that its 24-month share-price estimate for the
stock was 545 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocado struck a 25-year deal in May to provide an online
grocery service for Morrison, the U.K.&#8217;s fourth-largest grocer,
beginning in January 2014. As well as operating its own online
food-delivery service, Hatfield, England-based Ocado is trying
to license its warehouse-processing and Web technology to
domestic and international retailers. The company expects more
deals like the Morrison (MRW) agreement, Chief Executive Officer Tim Steiner said in a speech in Paris today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deal essentially gives Ocado a stake in the profit
pool of Morrison&#8217;s online business over the next 25 years,
broadening its market opportunity in the U.K.,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
analysts led by Franklin Walding said in the report. &#8220;It also
provides an element of diversification away from purely
Ocado.com sales.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocado was the second biggest gainer among stocks on the
FTSE 350 Index today. The stock has advanced more than fivefold
this year, giving the company a market value of 2.6 billion
pounds ($4.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank estimated Ocado&#8217;s sales will grow 19
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, up from 16
percent in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 11 analysts who follow Ocado and share their findings
with Bloomberg, six recommend selling the stock, three suggest
buying and two advise holding. The average 12-month price target
for the stock is 258.33 pence, based on six estimates, implying
a potential decline of 43 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of mortgage-bond investors
urged U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder not to let banks saddle
them with costs by pledging relief for borrowers to settle U.S.
investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association of Mortgage Investors, representing mutual
funds and pensions, wrote a letter Oct. 7 to Holder after
reports that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) discussed settling government
probes for $11 billion, including consumer relief. The letter,
which doesn&#8217;t mention the firm, asks that the group be included
in talks with banks to ensure costs from the settlement aren&#8217;t
passed to buyers of the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We stand firmly behind the principle that parties sued by
the government or third-parties should not be able to settle
with assets that they do not own, namely other people&#8217;s money,&#8221;
the group wrote. &#8220;We urge that any settlement must not allow
bank-servicers to meet their obligations by using mortgages
managed by them but which they do not 100 percent own.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage-securities investors have criticized banks&#8217;
previous settlements, saying that efforts to ease homeowners&#8217;
burden can lower the value the instruments. The terms and size
of New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s potential settlement changed
repeatedly during talks last month, a person familiar with the
matter said at the time. No deal has been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on the letter late
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Whitney McFerron" date="Oct 08, 2013  6:47 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-08/goldman-s-currie-says-gold-is-slam-dunk-sell-after-shutdown.html"><headline>Goldman&#8217;s Currie Says Gold Is &#8216;Slam Dunk&#8217; Sell After Shutdown</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Gold, set for its first annual loss
in 13 years, is a &#8220;slam dunk&#8221; sell for next year because the
U.S. economy will extend its recovery after lawmakers resolve
stalemates over the nation&#8217;s budget and debt ceiling, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Jeffrey Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has a target for gold prices next year at $1,050
an ounce, Currie, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head of commodities research,
said today on a panel in London. The precious metal has tumbled
21 percent this year to $1,322.28 an ounce on speculation that
the Federal Reserve would reduce its $85 billion monthly bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, as the economy
recovers. Lawmakers probably will reach an agreement on raising
the debt ceiling before the Oct. 17 deadline, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once we get past this stalemate in Washington, precious
metals are a slam dunk sell at that point,&#8221; Currie said. &#8220;You
have to argue that with significant recovery in the U.S.,
tapering of QE should put downward pressure on gold prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currie and Ric Deverell, the head of commodities research
at Credit Suisse AG, both said on a panel at the Commodities
Week conference in London today that selling gold is their top
recommendation for trading in raw materials in the next year.
Gold is heading for its first annual loss since 2000, and is the
third-worst performing commodity in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
gauge of 24 raw materials this year, after corn and silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Democrats are planning a test vote before the end of
this week on a measure that would grant President Barack Obama
authority to raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling. The U.S.
will run out of borrowing authority on Oct. 17 and will have
about $30 billion in cash after that. The country would be
unable to pay all of its bills, including benefits, salaries and
interest, some time between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31, according to
the Congressional Budget Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The downside of driving the bus off the cliff is so
significant that we will come to a resolution,&#8221; Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christian Wienberg" date="Oct 08, 2013  4:28 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-08/pandora-gains-as-jpmorgan-sees-cash-returns-copenhagen-mover.html"><headline>Pandora Gains as JPMorgan Sees Cash Returns: Copenhagen Mover</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pandora A/S (PNDORA) rose the most among
Copenhagen&#8217;s benchmark stocks today after JPMorgan Chase  Co.
said the Nordic region&#8217;s biggest jewelry maker may increase cash
returns to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora rose as much as 2.3 percent to 241.20 kroner,
making the stock the biggest winner in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen
20 index. (KFX) The shares traded 2 percent higher at 10:04 a.m. in
the Danish capital, with volume at 28 percent of the three-month
daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora on July 30 raised its 2013 revenue and profit
forecasts and two weeks later reported second-quarter net income
that beat analyst estimates as sales of its charms soared.
JPMorgan said today that third-quarter earnings, due Nov. 12,
could be a &#8220;further catalyst to the stock&#8221; and repeated its
overweight recommendation on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora&#8217;s earnings report will confirm &#8220;the strong top-line momentum and solid profitability profile,&#8221;  Chiara Battistini, a JPMorgan analyst, said in a note. &#8220;In addition,
in light of the robust cash flow generation and capital
structure policy in place, we deem the potential cash returns
particularly compelling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora, based in Glostrup, Denmark, may report third-quarter net income of 417 million kroner ($75.9 million),
according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five
analysts. That compares with net income of 380 million kroner a
year earlier. The company has beat analyst net income estimates
in 10 of the last 11 quarters, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor concern that Pandora&#8217;s biggest owners, including
private-equity company Axcel, may sell a large stake could
pressure the share &#8220;in coming weeks,&#8221; Battistini said. &#8220;We
would see any stock weakness and/or pull-back post placement as
an attractive entry point,&#8221; the analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would have predicted that the
rich fantasy world of James Thurber&#8217;s day-dreaming Walter Mitty
looks a lot like a second-rate Wes Anderson movie? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director and star Ben Stiller, nodding to Anderson&#8217;s
whimsical indie moods, turns &#8220;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&#8221;

unconvincing Hollywood uplift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Depression-era character resurrected for contemporary
downsizing and media discombobulation, Mitty is a natural fit
for Stiller, whose best performances, from &#8220;There&#8217;s Something
About Mary&#8221; to &#8220;Greenberg,&#8221; find heart and humor in the put-upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, however, Stiller seems solely interested in heart
(and cute visual flourishes). The belly laughs that accompanied
his 2008 &#8220;Tropic Thunder&#8221; are few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In screenwriter Steven Conrad&#8217;s most promising idea, Walter
is a photo researcher for Life magazine, his job doomed by the
transition to a leaner online venture -- and by the fact that
Walter has lost the photo slated for the final issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much to impress his just-divorced co-worker Cheryl (a
subdued Kristen Wiig) as to skirt the ire of his smug, head-chopping new boss Ted (Adam Scott), the usually passive Walter
jets off to far-flung locales from the Himalayas to Iceland in
search of the picture&#8217;s globe-trotting photographer (Sean Penn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s third-largest energy producer by market value, said quarterly profit
was lower than the prior three-month period amid refinery
repairs and foreign-exchange losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downstream earnings, which includes refining and retail
operations, are expected to be &#8220;significantly lower&#8221; than the
second quarter, the San Ramon, California-based company said in
a statement today. The third quarter also includes almost $300
million in foreign-exchange losses, compared with the prior
quarter that included a similar sized gain, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s wells produced the equivalent of 2.589 million
barrels of oil a day in July and August, compared with 2.516
million a day during the full third quarter of 2012. Increased
fuel production at its Richmond, California, refinery was mostly
offset by maintenance work at its El Segundo, California, plant,
Chevron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is scheduled to release complete third-quarter
results on Nov. 1. The shares fell 1.3 percent to $114.63 at
5:08 p.m. in after-hours trading in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest energy company by market
value, followed by PetroChina Co., according to data compiled by

&lt;p&gt;Persimmon Plc (PSN) rose the most in almost
two months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the stock may
increase by 70 percent within six months as it benefits from a
housing recovery outside London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s largest homebuilder by market value climbed 5
percent to 1,131 pence in London trading, the biggest increase
since Aug. 16. Goldman raised its price estimate for the stock
by 2 percent to 1,854 pence, it said in a note today. Goldman
based the estimate on a starting price of 1,089 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Persimmon&#8217;s exposure outside of London could ultimately
see the most recovery in terms of housing transactions,&#8221;
analysts including Eshan Toorabally wrote in the report. &#8220;The
circa 10 percent fall in the share price over the last three
months offers an attractive opportunity to invest in a company
which we expect to see significant earnings growth over the next
three years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though investors are increasingly betting that the Bank of
England may increase rates earlier than previously expected,
such hikes haven&#8217;t historically led to &#8220;significant weakness in
housing fundamentals&#8221; or stock price performance for home
building-related equities, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 17 analysts who follow Persimmon and share their ratings
with Bloomberg, eight recommend buying the stock, three suggest
selling and six advise holding. The average 12-month price
target is 1,247 pence, based on 10 estimates, implying a
potential gain of 11.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman added Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) to its &#8220;conviction buy
list&#8221; today. The High Wycombe, England-based homebuilder&#8217;s
share price rose 5.2 percent to 103.8 pence today. Goldman also
upgraded Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS) and Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) to
buy from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persimmon has climbed 51 percent this year, the fourth-best
performance among stocks in the Bloomberg U.K. Homebuilders
Index, which has added 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOL Inc. (AOL), the owner of the Huffington Post and TechCrunch, signed a syndication agreement with Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ESPN cable network in a bid for a bigger foothold in video advertising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ESPN will grant AOL syndication rights and join the digital publisher&#8217;s online video-programming network that already includes the Wall Street Journal, Sports Illustrated and 1,700 other publishers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong is seeking to transform the company into a content publisher driven by advertising. Online video commands higher ad rates than traditional Web placements, and marketers are increasingly looking for more outlets to run promotions. Spending on digital-video ads is projected to increase 41 percent to $4.09 billion in the U.S. this year, according to EMarketer Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Advertisers tell us there isn&#8217;t enough quality inventory, and we&#8217;re working fast to deliver that,&#8221; Ran Harnevo, the head of AOL&#8217;s video unit, said in an interview. What sets AOL apart from other digital-video networks is its &#8220;high-quality&#8221; content, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, ESPN can sell short commercials that run at the start of each video clip, with both AOL and ESPN sharing in the revenue. Publishers participating in AOL&#8217;s network can feature ESPN&#8217;s video content on their sites also receive a cut of any advertising buys. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Content Strategy &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;AOL&#8217;s ad business makes up more than two-thirds of sales, and its video network had 71.2 million viewers in August, second to Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s 167 million, according to ComScore Inc. (SCOR) AOL&#8217;s video audience is less than half of Google&#8217;s, underscoring the need to boost the amount of available video content. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s video strategy has become more important as it cuts back on other content initiatives. It recently faced setbacks with its hyper-local news service Patch. The company eliminated about 500 positions and said in August it could shutter as many as 20 percent of its over 900 Patch websites. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result of the deal, ESPN will become the anchor provider of sports-related content for AOL&#8217;s network, which also includes news, entertainment, travel and auto -- categories advertisers typically buy into. Harnevo said AOL is currently talking to other video partners for longer-form content as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AOL shares declined 1.2 percent to $32.50 at 11:46 a.m. in New York. The stock gained 11 percent this year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ksenia Galouchko" date="Oct 09, 2013 11:15 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-09/federal-grid-slides-to-4-year-low-on-goldman-cut-moscow-mover.html"><headline>Federal Grid Slides to 4-Year Low on Goldman Cut: Moscow Mover</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Federal Grid Co. dropped to the
lowest level in more than four years after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. cut Russia&#8217;s state-run power transmission company to sell
from neutral, saying a tariff-freeze plan will crimp earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock sank 2.1 percent to 9.535 kopeks, the weakest
level since February 2009 by the close in Moscow. About 3
billion shares changed hands, 97 percent of the three-month
daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government plans to freeze tariff growth next year and
match increases to consumer prices from 2015 will lead to a
&#8220;significant earnings cut&#8221; for Moscow-based Federal Grid,
Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed note dated yesterday. With
economic growth at the slowest since a 2009 recession, Russia is
seeking ways to tame inflation so the central bank can cut
interest rates and stimulate growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a bad time for the power sector, tariff growth is
being halted while investment programs remain hefty,&#8221; Mikhail Rasstrigin, an analyst at VTB Capital, said by phone from
Moscow. &#8220;Investors are pricing in the worst possible outcome
for these stocks and are selling shares.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Russian Grids, the nation&#8217;s largest electricity
distributor, sank 4 percent to 88.4 kopeks, the lowest level
since March 2009. The power companies were among the biggest
decliners on the benchmark Micex (INDEXCF) stock index, which sank 0.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman reduced its estimates for Federal Grid&#8217;s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 5
percent for 2014 and 14 percent for 2015. The reduced profit
outlook and &#8220;stretched&#8221; balance sheet won&#8217;t allow the company
to pay &#8220;attractive&#8221; dividends, analysts including Moscow-based
Artyom Golodnov said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian Grids&#8217; investment program will be cut by a range of
200 billion rubles ($6.2 billion) to 300 billion rubles over the
next five years due to the tariff freeze, Energy Minister
Alexander Novak told reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies are amending their investment programs but not
sufficiently to sustain their attractiveness for investors,&#8221;
Rasstrigin said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achates Power Inc., a developer of
efficient internal-combustion engines, raised $35.2 million from
investors including Sequoia Capital Partners and the venture
capital arm of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)&#8217;s founding family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achates, based in San Diego, will use the money to further
engine development and continue to expand in regions and
industries that need fuel-efficient power, Chief Executive
Officer David Johnson said in an interview. Achates uses opposed
pistons and cylinders in a design that the company said boosts
fuel efficiency by 55 percent for gasoline powertrains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closely held company said it has now secured more than
$90 million in four rounds. Interest has come from the
automotive, defense, shipping and power-generation sectors,
helped by regulatory pressure for increased fuel economy and
lower emissions, Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think people and industries realize that the technology
they have today, and what they are developing in their labs for
tomorrow, isn&#8217;t enough to meet the mounting challenges,&#8221;
Johnson said. &#8220;And in many cases solutions they have tend to be
very expensive. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve been able to offer a
different paradigm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposed-piston engines emit 30 percent less nitrogen
oxide and improve diesel fuel economy by 21 percent, Achates
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achates is helping develop the next-generation combat
engine for the U.S. Army. The company doesn&#8217;t have an engine in
production yet, Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madrone Capital Partners, the Walton family investment arm,
has invested in Achates since its founding in 2004, Johnson
said. Other investors include Sequoia Capital, RockPort Capital
Partners, InterWest Partners and Triangle Peak Partners, the
company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania should revise laws on
shale-gas works that led Chevron Corp. (CVX) to abandon its bid for
exploration rights, Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New environmental approval procedures and plans to raise
taxes on shale hydrocarbons were behind the U.S. energy
company&#8217;s decision yesterday to withdraw its lone bid in a
tender for exploration rights, Butkevicius said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s worth a fresh look at those laws with an eye to
preparing and eventually announcing a new tender,&#8221; the prime
minister said on Laisvoji Banga radio in Vilnius, the Lithuanian
capital. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say how long that might take.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltic nation wants to develop shale resources as an
alternative to energy imports from Russia. Some local
communities oppose the technology as environmentally unsafe. The
government is negotiating with and suing Russia&#8217;s Gazprom (GAZP) OAO,
the country&#8217;s only natural-gas supplier, seeking to reduce what
it calls &#8220;unfair&#8221; prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron submitted the only bid in a January tender for
shale-hydrocarbon exploration and production rights in the
western Lithuanian region of Silute-Taurage. The U.S. company
last year bought half of Lithuanian oil and gas recovery company
LL Investicijos, which holds a license to explore for
hydrocarbons in Rietavas, contiguous to Silute-Taurage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lost Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because of the changing regulatory and legislative
landscape, Chevron believes that its business interests in
Lithuania are best served focusing on our existing investment in
the Rietavas block,&#8221; Chevron said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was put off mainly by a legal demand that it get
local-government approval for an environmental impact assessment
before starting exploration, Butkevicius said. It was also
concerned by a proposal in Lithuania&#8217;s parliament to increase
the tax rate on income from shale-hydrocarbon production to as
much as 40 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister said he&#8217;d support a tax rate as low as
15 percent if that would help attract investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lithuania&#8217;s unfounded fears have cost it investments
worth many millions as well as new jobs and a chance to move
toward energy independence,&#8221; Environment Minister Valentinas
Mazuronis said on the ministry&#8217;s website today. &#8220;I hope that in
the future we&#8217;ll make better decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s $7.2 billion pairing with Nokia Oyj (NOK)&#8217;s handset business is failing to win over the software developers who are crucial to its success. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider Tommy Palm and Jeff Smith. Palm, who oversees development at smartphone-game maker King.com, and Smith, who runs music-application maker Smule Inc., have long avoided building apps for devices using Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone software. Closer ties with Nokia haven&#8217;t swayed them. Both say even after the acquisition closes, Microsoft still won&#8217;t have enough users to make it worth the time and money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;With or without Nokia, Microsoft needs to demonstrate that they can capture a material segment of the mobile market,&#8221; Smith said in an interview. &#8220;We will wait and see.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has struggled to lure developers since Windows Phone debuted in 2010, the plight has taken on new urgency since Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer announced the acquisition of Nokia&#8217;s handset unit last month. Microsoft, which had close ties with Nokia through a 2011 partnership, is counting on the deal to boost its share of the $280 billion smartphone market and to lure makers of games, productivity tools and other apps, who view the company&#8217;s mobile software as an afterthought compared with Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iOS and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects Kwok&#8217;s title in third paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s Independent Commission
Against Corruption removed all conditions attached to the bail
of Walter Kwok, the former chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties
Ltd. (16), the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-graft agency made the change on Oct. 9, Sun Hung
Kai said in a filing to Hong Kong&#8217;s stock exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwok, a non-executive director of Hong Kong&#8217;s second-biggest developer by value, was released on bail in May 2012,
after being arrested as part of the probe of his brothers Thomas
and Raymond Kwok and the city&#8217;s former No.2 government official,
Rafael Hui. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond and Thomas were granted cash bail of HK$10 million
($1.29 million) each last October and Hui&#8217;s bail was HK$500,000.
Walter, who is estranged from his younger brothers, had not been
charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas and Raymond, sons of the developer&#8217;s late co-founder
Kwok Tak-seng, took over running Sun Hung Kai in May 2008 after

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest provider of U.S. money-market mutual funds, said those
products had divested of U.S. Treasuries that mature between
Oct. 16 and Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it took the action, which also applies to
funds with scheduled coupon payments during the period, to help
maintain the products&#8217; stable $1 a share value. The funds have
also increased their levels of liquidity, the New York-based
company said today in a statement, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although JPMorgan Investment Management continues to
believe that the probability of a U.S. government default is
low, it has taken certain precautionary measures with respect to
the money markets,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Speaker John Boehner today proposed a plan that would
push the limit for U.S. borrowing to Nov. 22 from Oct. 17. The
White House endorsed the short debt-limit increase with no
policy conditions attached. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
warned that &#8220;uncertainty&#8221; over the debt limit is starting to
stress financial markets, speaking in testimony to the Senate
Finance Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. money funds held about $475 billion in Treasury
securities as of Aug. 31, and an additional $156 billion in
repurchase agreements collateralized by Treasuries, according to
research firm Crane Data LLC in Westborough, Massachusetts.
About $74 billion in Treasuries held by money funds matures from
Oct. 24 to Nov. 15, Crane Data estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fitch Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money funds can cope with a short-term default in U.S.
Treasuries as long as it doesn&#8217;t trigger the kind of investor
run that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
in 2008, Fitch Ratings said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch based its conclusion partly on evidence that fund
companies had reduced holdings in maturities most likely to be
affected by a default and had boosted the level of assets that
could be quickly converted into cash and returned to withdrawing
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional investors in money-market mutual funds that
focus almost exclusively on Treasury securities and other debt
backed by the U.S. government withdrew $17.5 billion in the
seven days through yesterday, according to Crane Data. That&#8217;s
about 2.6 percent of assets in those funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based company that is the
largest U.S. money-fund manager, said earlier this week that it
had moved out of Treasuries maturing in late October and early
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund provider Federated Investors Inc. (FII), based in
Pittsburgh, said it wasn&#8217;t avoiding that time period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Threat&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to hold Treasury securities that mature in
the upcoming weeks and are confident that they represent no
threat to the liquidity or stability of the portfolio,&#8221; Meghan McAndrews, a Federated spokeswoman, said today in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We believe that, at the end of the day, the parties
in this conflict will come to a resolution that will prevent the
U.S. government from defaulting on its obligations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguard Group Inc., the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based
fund company, doesn&#8217;t expect a default, Chief Executive Officer
William McNabb said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within the walls of Vanguard, we continue to be
optimistic about cooler heads prevailing,&#8221; McNabb said. &#8220;The
idea that the U.S. would actually default on Treasuries seems
almost unfathomable to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funding Standoff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican lawmakers in Washington had vowed not to approve
an increase in the government&#8217;s debt limit unless President
Barack Obama and his Democratic Party agree to change the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, known as
Obamacare. They have also refused to approve new funding for
government operations, triggering a partial government shutdown
since Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-market funds give millions of households, companies
and other institutions a safe parking spot for cash and channel
$2.6 trillion to issuers of short-term debt including the U.S.
government, financial institutions and companies. A run on funds
that hold corporate debt after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
in September 2008 helped freeze global credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the deadline for avoiding a
U.S. default looming, investors from Boston to Bangalore are
moving to cash, extending the maturities of their short-term
Treasury holdings and buying options to help protect themselves
should stock and bond prices tumble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) private bank clients are raising
cash while others are dumping Treasury bills with maturities
beyond the Oct. 17 debt ceiling deadline for longer-dated bonds.
Stewart Capital Advisors LLC in Indiana, Pennsylvania, favors
insurance companies, technology stocks and health-care
providers, which now have lower valuations. Money is flowing out
of an exchange-traded fund that tracks American banks and into
overseas equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most investors say a default will be averted, the
potential for calamity should political leaders fail to renew
U.S. borrowing authority before it runs out is moving some to
take measures to safeguard their assets. A Treasury Department
report on Oct. 3 said consequences would be &#8220;catastrophic&#8221;
should the U.S. fail to make payments, including higher interest
rates, lower investment and slow growth for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to protect capital first,&#8221; said Kevin Kearns, a
fixed-income portfolio manager at Boston-based Loomis Sayles 
Co., which manages $188 billion. While Loomis is forecasting
that a default will be avoided, the back-and-forth negotiations
may provoke some investors to sell assets. &#8220;We have our
shopping list ready if things go on sale,&#8221; Kearns said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long Short &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kearns oversees $1.4 billion in a strategy known as long-short, where an investor can speculate on a security&#8217;s price
either rising or falling. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index jumped
2.2 percent to 1,692.56 at 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks rallied as U.S. House Republican leaders embraced a
possible short-term deal to avoid default. The lawmakers will
present their members with a proposal to raise the debt limit
for six weeks without policy conditions, a congressional aide
familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House wants to &#8220;offer the president today the ability
to move&#8221; and ask &#8220;for his willingness to sit down and discuss
with us a way forward,&#8221; Speaker John Boehner said today to
reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETF Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors withdrew $4 billion from ETFs that track U.S
equities between Oct. 3 and 8, data compiled by Bloomberg on
fund flows show. At the same time, they added $418 million to
the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, which buys European, Australian and
Israeli shares, the most for any ETF tracked by Bloomberg. The
Vanguard FTSE Europe fund got $385 million, the second most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, investors withdrew $780 million from the
Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund tracking financial companies
in the SP 500, the most since April 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index, used to hedge against stock swings, saw record volume of
1.78 million contracts on Oct. 8. Traders bought almost double
the number of calls to buy compared with puts to sell that day,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Owning bullish options on the
VIX, as the index is known, can offset losses when stocks drop
because they become more valuable as price swings widen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last Minute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investors have yet to become concerned that the debt
ceiling will be breached, citing the last-minute resolution of
the August 2011 showdown as a model that shows a deal will be
achieved in time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;None of my investors have so far called me to say &#8216;I want
out,&#8217; or ask &#8216;Is this really a crisis situation?&#8217;&#8221; Jim Paulsen,
the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells
Capital Management, which oversees about $340 billion, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;The American psyche is in much better
position today. They don&#8217;t look at every issue as Armageddon.
It&#8217;s just another problem. They are not rushing to gold or U.S.
Treasuries or to the dollar.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 41 percent of investors in a TD Ameritrade Holding
Corp. survey said they haven&#8217;t made changes to their investments
as a result of the government shutdown that began Oct. 1 or a
possible default. Twelve percent said they&#8217;re &#8220;taking advantage
of opportunities,&#8221; and 10 percent said they&#8217;ve moved into cash
in the immediate term, according to the poll of 693 consumers
conducted Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury Bills &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern that a default might happen is starting to show up
in the market for short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury bill rates rose after President Barack Obama
rejected calls Oct. 8 to invoke the Constitution&#8217;s 14th
Amendment to skirt Congressional approval for issuing new debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates on Treasury bills due on Oct. 17 fell 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 0.31 percent at 5 p.m. New
York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched
0.51 percent earlier, the highest level since they were sold in
October 2012. The yield was negative as recently as Sept. 26.
The rate on bills maturing on Nov. 14 rose as high as 0.275
percent yesterday, compared with 0.02 percent on Sept. 30. Rates
on bills due Nov. 21 rose eight basis points to 0.12 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors have been &#8220;rolling out those Treasury bills
to future maturities&#8221; in December and into 2014, Megan McClellan, head of U.S. fixed income at JPMorgan Private Bank in
New York, said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday.
&#8220;For people that are nervous, rolling forward is OK, and also
going to cash. We have seen, as we saw in 2011, some percentage
going to deposits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-market mutual funds can cope with a short-term
default in U.S. Treasuries as long as it doesn&#8217;t trigger the
kind of investor run that followed the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, according to Fitch Ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds have high levels of short-term liquidity and have
reduced their holdings of Treasuries that would be most
immediately affected by the failure of the U.S. to extend its
borrowing capacity, the ratings company said yesterday in a
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have avoided maturities in the time period toward the
end of October,&#8221; Nancy Prior, head of money funds at Boston-based Fidelity Investments, said in an interview. Fidelity is
the largest manager of U.S. money funds with $427 billion in
assets as of Aug. 31, according to Crane Data LLC in
Westborough, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate Borrowing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for corporate borrowing through IOUs expanded to
the highest level in eight months as investors turned to
alternatives to short-term Treasury bills amid the impasse over
raising the U.S. debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
outstanding climbed $11 billion to $1.066 trillion in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
That&#8217;s the highest level since the market touched $1.085
trillion for the period ended Feb. 13, according to Fed data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Fidelity has sought to avoid Treasury bills maturing
near the deadline, Pacific Investment Management Co. has been
buying them as their yields have risen, said co-chief investment
officer Bill Gross, manager of the world&#8217;s largest bond fund at
Pacific Management Investment Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their selling begets opportunistic buying on the part of
Pimco,&#8221; Gross said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
&#8220;We&#8217;re picking up pennies on the street. This is a particular
penny that we think is risk-free.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equities Collars &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s futures and options market operator, Hong Kong
Exchanges  Clearing Ltd., increased the discount on Treasury
bills used as collateral for margin requirements today, citing
concern that the U.S. is at risk of a default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japan, investors sold 2.2 trillion yen ($22.5 billion)
of foreign bonds in the week ended Oct. 4, the most on record,
according to figures released by the Ministry of Finance in
Tokyo. The report didn&#8217;t reveal the amount of Treasuries sold by
the Japanese bondholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, the dip in stock prices
may become a chance to increase his ownership of U.S. equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where we are holding significant cash we have been
nibbling,&#8221; Luschini said in an e-mail response to questions on
Oct. 9. He added to his equity positions as the SP 500 fell to
1,660 and &#8220;we will buy more aggressively if we near 1,600, all
things being equal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VIX Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who are concerned about a default should use an
options strategy known as a collar on their largest or most
volatile equity holdings, according to Randy Frederick, managing
director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab
Corp. in Austin, Texas. To implement the trade, investors buy a
put, or option to sell, with an exercise price below the current
stock level, financed by selling call options with a higher
strike price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randall Warren, chief investment officer of Warren
Financial Service, purchased options on the VIX as protection
against surging stock volatility if the U.S. defaults on its
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren said he bought calls that become profitable if the
VIX rises 12 percent to 22 by Oct. 16, the day before U.S.
borrowing authority lapses. He also purchased calls with a 32
strike price for October to protect against bigger swings in the
equity market, as well as 22 and 32 contracts that expire in
November as a hedge if the talks are extended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buying these options very, very cheaply and getting the
explosive upside if something serious does occur with the
markets, then that is a way to hedge your bets without a whole
lot of money,&#8221; Warren, who oversees about $100 million, said in
a phone interview from Exton, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Worst Case&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has gained 0.7 percent since the U.S.
government shut down last week. The VIX slid 0.7 percent to
16.48 over the same period, as a 16 percent tumble today erased
an advance to as high as 20.34 on Oct. 8. That compares to a
level of 48 when SP cut the U.S. debt rating in August 2011,
the highest since before the bull market started in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supreeth S.M., the Bangalore-based chief executive officer
at Quant First Asset Advisors India, bought put options on the
nation&#8217;s CNX Nifty Index stock gauge with an exercise price 10
percent below the index level to protect against the &#8220;worst
case scenario&#8221; of a U.S. default. He&#8217;s funding the trade by
selling call options on the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A U.S. default is highly unlikely as we expect lawmakers
to come around to avert a disaster,&#8221; Supreeth, whose firm
manages about $100 million in options, said in a phone interview
on Oct. 8.  &#8220;However, something bad may happen and we are
advising clients to hedge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puts with a strike price 10 percent below the Nifty cost
8.2 points more than calls betting on a 10 percent gain on Oct.
8, the least since Sept. 19, one-month implied volatility data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The Indian stock index, which has
climbed 2 percent this year, tumbled 26 percent in October 2008,
the month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury Hedges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Global Asset Management, a money manager that oversees
$644 billion, said it has bought Treasury options to hedge
against the U.S. defaulting should politicians fail to agree on
raising the nation&#8217;s debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company bought two-year Treasury puts and sold those on
German two-year note futures to mitigate the risk, according to
Brian Fehrenbach, the company&#8217;s Chicago-based co-head of U.S.
multi-sector fixed income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s part of our defensive strategy and it&#8217;s something
we hope will not be tested,&#8221; Fehrenbach, a former derivatives
trader, said in an interview in London. &#8220;The uncertainty in
Washington doesn&#8217;t promote confidence. The longer they go
without a resolution, the more risk there is for a last-minute
mistake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese equities rallied the most in
a month in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying Home Inns  Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) and as data showed
Qihoo 360 Technology Co.&#8217;s search market share grew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. climbed 2 percent to 103.79
yesterday, the biggest gain since Sept. 3. Home Inns, China&#8217;s
largest budget hotel chain operator, climbed to the highest this
week after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its top pick list,
while China Lodging Group Ltd. (HTHT) increased the most in six days.
Software developer Qihoo rallied the most in three weeks and
21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) jumped to the highest level since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said yesterday the nation&#8217;s
economic growth probably exceeded 7.5 percent in the first nine
months of the year, a sign the government will next week report
success in halting a two-quarter slowdown. Tourism revenue
during the week-long Chinese holiday increased 21 percent from a
year earlier to 223.3 billion yuan ($36.4 billion), according to
data from the China National Tourism Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Middle-class and small-business travelers drive up
occupancy quickly at budget hotels when the economy recovers,&#8221;
Michael Ding, lead manager of the China Region Fund (USCOX) at U.S.
Global Investors, which oversees $2.2 billion, said by phone
from San Antonio, Texas yesterday. &#8220;Also, we&#8217;ve seen a boom in
travel and tourism in China during the Oct. 1-7 public
holiday.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iShares China ETF (FXI), the largest Chinese exchange-traded
fund in the U.S., climbed 1.1 percent to a two-week high of
$38.14 in New York. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index jumped 2.2
percent in a second day of rally as lawmakers moved toward an
agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Budget Hotels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Lodging&#8217;s American depositary receipts advanced 2.5
percent to $19.50, after surging as much as 6.7 percent earlier.
Shanghai-based Home Inns climbed 1.5 percent to $37.03, jumping
as much as 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget hotels tend to respond more quickly to an economic
recovery in China, according to the Goldman Sachs note
yesterday. &#8220;We believe a recovering macro to be incrementally
positive to economy hotels&#8217; RevPAR,&#8221; or revenue per available
room, the note said, adding Home Inns to the bank&#8217;s &#8220;conviction
buy&#8221; list and upgrading China Lodging to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in China&#8217;s retail and catering sectors increased 13.6
percent during the seven-day holiday from a year earlier to 870
billion yuan, the nation&#8217;s commerce ministry said on its website
Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qihoo&#8217;s ADRs gained 4.3 percent to $82.27, the most since
Sept. 19. The company, owner of China&#8217;s second-largest search
engine, has surged 177 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu (BIDU), the biggest web search engine, advanced 4.5 percent
to $153.16, rallying the most in four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qihoo&#8217;s share in the online search market rose to 21
percent by the end of September, while Baidu&#8217;s fluctuated
between 61 percent to 64.5 percent last month before sliding to
60 percent in early October, 86Research analysts said in a note
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ), a provider of mobile-security services,
rallied 4.1 percent to $19.68, snapping a three-day slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NQ&#8217;s &#8220;Music Radar&#8221; mobile app, started in September, saw
downloads jump to 15 million and daily audio search inquiries
triple to 3 million, Beijing-based NQ said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21Vianet, China&#8217;s biggest independent Internet data-center
operator, surged 8.9 percent to $18.04, the highest close since
April 2011. Trading volume was 2.4 times the 90-day average,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing-based 21Vianet yesterday appointed Wing-Dar Ker,
who formerly worked at Microsoft Corp. as the general manager of
customer service for the Greater China region, as the company&#8217;s
president of Microsoft cloud operation. 21Vianet started a
partnership in May with Microsoft to offer cloud services in
China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) slid 0.4 percent to
10,460.18, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.9
percent to 2,190.93, paring gains this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jody Shenn" date="Oct 10, 2013  4:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-10/jpmorgan-taps-taxpayer-backed-banks-for-bailout-rules.html"><headline>JPMorgan Taps Taxpayer-Backed Banks for Bailout Rules</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, is using cheap funding from government-chartered
institutions to meet new regulations designed to ensure it won&#8217;t
need a taxpayer bailout in any future crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank borrowed almost $20 billion in the first half of
the year from Federal Home Loan Banks, according to filings,
almost as much as it got from selling dollar-denominated bonds
in 2013. New York-based JPMorgan, with $2.4 trillion of assets,
obtained most of the loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Cincinnati, whose 740 members typically resemble the $139
million-asset Bank of McCreary County in Kentucky and $40
million-asset Rural Cooperatives Credit Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up during the Great Depression to help community
lenders, FHLBs raise cash by selling bonds viewed by rating
companies and investors as backed by the U.S. government.
Lending by the Congressionally chartered banks is climbing at
the fastest pace since the start of the financial crisis in
2007. The growth has little to do with most of the 7,600 banks,
thrifts, credit unions and insurers that are members. Without
JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the three
largest borrowers, lending by the FHLBs would be shrinking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold will extend losses into 2014
amid expectations the Federal Reserve will pare stimulus as the
U.S. recovers, according to Morgan Stanley, adding to bearish
calls from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We recommend staying away from gold at this point in the
cycle,&#8221; Melbourne-based analyst Joel Crane said in a video
report received today. Bullion will average $1,313 an ounce in
2014, down from the $1,420 forecast for this year, Morgan
Stanley said in its quarterly metals report on Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion is heading for the sixth weekly loss in seven and
investment holdings are shrinking even as U.S. lawmakers wrangle
over the debt ceiling and budget, seeking to avert a default and
end a government shutdown. Gold is a &#8220;slam dunk&#8221; sell for next
year because the U.S. will extend the recovery after lawmakers
resolve the stalemate, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman&#8217;s head of
commodities research, said this week. The political deadlock in
Washington is a &#8220;farce,&#8221; according to Marex Spectron Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our forecast profile heading into next year is relatively
flat against our expectations of rising real interest rates and
the U.S. dollar,&#8221; Crane said in the video. Bullion will average
lower every year through 2018, Morgan Stanley forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion, which has averaged $1,453 in 2013, is heading for
the first annual loss in 13 years after dropping 22 percent. The
price tumbled to a 34-month low of $1,180.50 in London in June
on expectations that the Fed would taper the $85-billion-a-month
of bond buying. Gold fell 0.6 percent to $1,298.19 at 6:01 p.m.
in London, dropping for a third day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Minutes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is bearish. While gold may look weak
fundamentally, &#8220;in this sort of environment, you can make a
strong argument that gold isn&#8217;t too bad a thing to hold,&#8221; said
Kevin Norrish, head of commodities research at Barclays Plc. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a slam dunk short by any means,&#8221; he said
yesterday. Short bets are wagers on declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Fed policy makers said that the central bank was
likely to taper its bond purchases this year, even as they
unexpectedly refrained from such a move in September, according
to minutes of their last meeting released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ric Deverell, Currie&#8217;s counterpart at Credit Suisse, said
on Oct. 8 that selling gold is his top recommendation for
trading in raw materials in the next year. Deverell said in May
that bullion was going to get &#8220;crushed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETP Holdings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors sold 711.8 metric tons from bullion-backed
exchange-traded products this year, erasing more than $61
billion from the value of the funds. Holdings fell to 1,920.2
tons on Oct. 8, the least since May 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Assets are down 27 percent in 2013 after
climbing every year since the first product was listed in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Republican and Senate Democratic leaders are open to
a short-term increase in the debt limit, according to
congressional aides of both parties, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. President Barack Obama has already said he could
accept a short-term deal without policy conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tapering has been postponed not canceled, and is expected
by year end,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in the Oct. 7
report. &#8220;We also expect the political stalemate in Washington
to be broken before the debt ceiling is breached. Consequently,
we see little immediate upside to the gold price either in the
immediate future or next year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s board is working toward having the successor to Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer in place by the end of this year and is winnowing a list of candidates, said people with knowledge of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board is narrowing its choices amid preliminary interviews, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Some candidates have declined to be considered, including EBay Inc. (EBAY) CEO John Donahoe, said two people. The board has also solicited advice from Silicon Valley veterans such as Charles Giancarlo, a former Cisco Systems Inc. executive and now a managing director at private-equity firm Silver Lake, said other people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Board members have already spoken with candidates such as Ford Motor Co. (F) CEO Alan Mulally; former Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) CEO Stephen Elop, who will join Microsoft when its $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia&#8217;s handset unit closes; former Microsoft No. 3 executive Paul Maritz, who is now CEO of cloud venture Pivotal; and Microsoft business development and evangelism chief Tony Bates, said the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The precise timing of a CEO announcement will depend on negotiations over matters like compensation and, in the case of an external candidate, departure from their current company, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian policy makers are in talks
with JPMorgan Chase  Co. and other companies for inclusion of

Reuters reported. The rupee surged. &lt;/p&gt;

Sgr SpA say India needs to remove all restrictions in its bond
market, and Standard Chartered Plc estimates that inclusion in
JPMorgan&#8217;s GBI-Global Diversified Index could lure as much as
$40 billion over 12 months. India caps foreign purchases of
local-currency debt at $81 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;cannot comment on market speculation,&#8221; Mumbai-based spokeswoman Beverly Mathews said in an e-mailed reply to
Bloomberg. E-mails sent to the media teams at Pimco and Standard
Life didn&#8217;t immediately get a response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential meetings follow the announcement yesterday
that International Finance Corp., the World Bank&#8217;s investment
arm, plans to sell a record $1 billion of rupee bonds offshore
to fund its investments. The move &#8220;should support investor
confidence further,&#8221; Citigroup Inc. strategist Gaurav Garg
wrote in a research report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas funds have cut holdings of rupee-denominated bonds
to $25.9 billion as of Oct. 9, official data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee rose 0.9 percent today, reversing a drop of as
much as 0.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency is still 10.4 percent weaker this year, weighed
down by a current-account deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management LP
boosted holdings of Malaysia&#8217;s ringgit and the Philippine peso
in recent weeks, betting the prospect of interest-rate increases
will spur appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ringgit will strengthen 5 percent against the dollar by
year-end and a 7.3 percent gain is likely for the peso, based on
estimates given by Philip Moffitt, head of Asia-Pacific fixed
income at Goldman Sachs Asset, which oversees $860 billion.
Benchmark rates in Malaysia and the Philippines will increase at
least 25 basis points by the end of 2014, according to the
majority of economists in Bloomberg surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect interest rates to rise over the next year in
Malaysia and the Philippines, and that&#8217;s less likely in some
other Southeast Asian economies such as Thailand,&#8221; Sydney-based
Moffitt said in an Oct. 8 phone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see a bounce
in the two currencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ringgit has led a rebound in Southeast Asian currencies
since Aug. 31 as the Federal Reserve unexpectedly held off from
reducing stimulus that fueled demand for emerging-market assets.
The region&#8217;s currencies all sank in the prior four months, led
by an 11 percent slide in Indonesia&#8217;s rupiah, as the U.S.
central bank signaled plans to rein in its $85 billion-a-month
bond-buying program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapering of the program is unlikely to start before
December, and Southeast Asian assets are being boosted by
Japanese demand for overseas investments, said Moffitt, who
oversees Goldman Sachs Asset&#8217;s unconstrained  emerging-market
local-debt funds. &#8220;Liquidity generation&#8221; in the U.S., euro
region and Japan is the highest in two years, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ringgit Outperforms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ringgit climbed 2.1 percent this month to 3.1925 per
dollar, the best performance among Asia&#8217;s 11 most-traded
currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Barclays
Plc raised its three-month forecast for the ringgit by 4.5
percent to 3.15 in September on expectations global funds will
boost holdings of the nation&#8217;s bonds, Hamish Pepper, its
currency strategist in Singapore, said in a Sept. 27 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Negara Malaysia held interest rates at 3 percent at a
Sept. 5 policy meeting and warned of increased uncertainties
surrounding the domestic growth and inflation outlook. Increases
in consumer prices are likely to quicken as the government cuts
subsidies, it said in a statement after the meeting. The last
move in borrowing costs was a 25-basis-point rise in May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subsidy Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Najib Razak reduced subsidies on gasoline
and diesel on Sept. 3 to rein in the government&#8217;s budget
shortfall. Policy makers may announce increases in flour and
sugar prices this month, according to an Oct. 6 report in the
New Straits Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. sees a chance of a 25-basis-point increase in Malaysian interest rates in the fourth
quarter of 2014 &#8220;if the pare-back in subsidies is substantial
enough to impinge on the consumer price index,&#8221; Leong Sook Mei,
the bank&#8217;s Southeast Asian head of global markets research in
Singapore, said in an interview yesterday. Consumer-price gains
eased to 1.9 percent in August from a 16 month-high of 2 percent
in July, data showed last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ringgit has room to strengthen due to improving growth
expectations in China in the near term and because of Bank
Negara&#8217;s shift to &#8220;a slight hawkish bias,&#8221; Citigroup Inc.
strategists including Siddharth Mathur in Singapore wrote in an
Oct. 3 report. China&#8217;s economy, which is second only to the U.S.
in size, has strong momentum, and imports will reach $10
trillion in the next five years, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philippine Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso has gained 0.9 percent this month to 43.155 per
dollar and Moffitt predicts a year-end exchange rate of 40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency has climbed as President Benigno Aquino
increases spending to a record in 2013 while seeking more than
$17 billion of investments in highways and airports to improve
infrastructure. Gross domestic product increased 7.5 percent in
the second quarter from a year earlier, matching China&#8217;s pace.
The nation is poised to be among the world&#8217;s five fastest-growing economies in 2013 and 2014, Bloomberg surveys show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will probably keep interest
rates steady this year and next, &#8220;barring any unforeseen
shocks,&#8221; Governor Amando Tetangco said in an Oct. 2 interview.
The central bank held its benchmark rate at a record-low 3.5
percent for a seventh meeting on Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation eased to a four-year low in August, with consumer
prices rising 2.1 percent from a year earlier. The central bank
aims to have consumer-price gains averaging 3 percent to 5
percent in 2013 and 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippine economy is in a better shape than most of
its Asian counterparts, which should provide support for the
peso, Mitul Kotecha, Hong Kong-based head of foreign exchange
strategy at Credit Agricole SA (ACA), said in an Oct. 7 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippine GDP is forecast to increase 7 percent this year,
the most since 2010, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. That compares with projected
growth rates of 4 percent for Thailand, 4.5 percent for Malaysia
and 5.8 percent for Indonesia, separate Bloomberg surveys show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arca Continental SAB, Latin
America&#8217;s second-biggest Coca-Cola bottler, extended its third
straight weekly decline after a newspaper reported that
lawmakers are considering a higher proposed tax on soda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 1.2 percent to 82.16 pesos at 11:35 a.m. in
Mexico City, extending the weekly slump to 2.1 percent. The
benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican companies rose 1.1 percent and
was little changed for the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower-house lawmakers from the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party and the opposition Democratic Revolutionary
Party plan to increase the rate of a proposed tax on sodas,
Reforma reported today on its website. The move would tax sodas
2 pesos per liter instead of 1 peso under an earlier bill,
Reforma said, citing unidentified negotiators from both parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s surely what&#8217;s hitting the share price,&#8221; Karla Miranda, an analyst at Corporativo GBM SAB, said in a telephone
interview from Mexico City. &#8220;For several weeks, beverage
company stocks have been reacting to rumors about news on the
soda tax.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arca Continental&#8217;s Mexico drinks unit accounted for 76
percent of its sparkling-beverage volume during the first half
of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. reported its first loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon after taking a $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third-quarter loss was $380 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a profit of $5.71 billion, or $1.40, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. The last time the bank failed to report a profit was the second quarter of 2004, when William Harrison was CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the last few weeks the environment has become highly charged and very volatile,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call. &#8220;Things have been very fluid and the situation escalated to the point where we are facing very large premiums and penalties, the level of which have gone far beyond what we reasonably expected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, who led JPMorgan to record earnings in each of the past three years, is grappling with regulatory investigations and tightening internal controls following a trading loss last year of more than $6.2 billion. The legal costs contributed to a 54 percent surge in non-interest expenses to $23.6 billion, as revenue dropped 8 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Painful&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is very painful for the company,&#8221; Dimon told analysts on the call. JPMorgan has spent $8 billion on litigation and set aside $20 billion toward legal and regulatory costs since January 2010. Those expenses will remain elevated for the next year or two, according to Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which today
reported its first loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, said it has scaled back stock repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank repurchased $739.7 million of shares in the third
quarter, down from $1.17 billion in the three months ended June
30 and $2.58 billion in the first quarter, according to a
supplemental filing posted on the New York-based lender&#8217;s
website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re doing very little stock buyback right now,&#8221; Dimon
said today on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
last month that the lender could be forced to halt its $6
billion repurchase program as fines and penalties on the bank
grow. The third-quarter loss was fueled by a $7.2 billion charge
tied to litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank executives were asked today about the possibility of
litigation expenses affecting capital plans submitted to
regulators or altering the pace of share repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t expect or believe that there should be any
repercussions, but they&#8217;re ultimately up to the regulators&#8217;
decisions,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan suspended a $15 billion buyback plan last year to
boost capital levels after a bet on credit derivatives in London
that ultimately cost the firm more than $6.2 billion. Dimon in
March won conditional Federal Reserve approval for $6 billion in
buybacks. The Fed required the company to &#8220;address weaknesses&#8221;
in its planning process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. lender, said it will halt clearing services for about 500
foreign banks and discontinue checking accounts for
&#8220;politically exposed persons&#8221; in other nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are part of a strategy of &#8220;de-risking through
client selection,&#8221; the New York-based bank said today in a
presentation on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" date="Oct 11, 2013  7:15 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-11/jpmorgan-shrinks-investment-bank-compensation-pool-4-4-.html"><headline>JPMorgan Shrinks Investment Bank Compensation Pool 4.4%</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s corporate and
investment bank allocated 4.4 percent less for employee
compensation in the first nine months of the year as the
division&#8217;s revenue climbed 5.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit&#8217;s $8.69 billion in compensation fell to 31 percent
of revenue, excluding accounting adjustments, from 34 percent in
the same period of 2012, according to figures posted today on
the New York-based firm&#8217;s website. The amount equals $165,774
for each of the division&#8217;s 52,445 employees. The unit employed
52,226 people a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, combined its
investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and
securities-services units last year under co-heads Mike Cavanagh, 47, and Daniel Pinto, 50. The group has more than
twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
years. Figures for average pay don&#8217;t represent what individuals
actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We really believe in pay for performance,&#8221; Cavanagh told
shareholders in February. JPMorgan&#8217;s scale can help keep the
compensation-to-revenue ratio low while offering top employees
pay at least as good as competitors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLSmidth  Co. A/S (FLS) fell in
Copenhagen trading after Goldman Sachs Global Investment
Research said profit at the Danish mining equipment maker will
stall through 2015 as a restructuring process drags on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLSmidth fell as much as 2.5 percent to 280.70 kroner,
making it the biggest loser in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20
Index. The stock declined 1.8 percent to 282.70 kroner at 9:46
a.m. in the Danish capital, with volume at 27 percent of the
three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLSmidth, which has missed analyst profit estimates in its
last six quarterly reports, presented on Aug. 23 a restructuring
plan which it said will boost profits by eliminating 1,100 jobs
and cutting other costs. Goldman said in a note distributed
today that the plan won&#8217;t lift the company fast enough out of
its &#8220;trough year in margins,&#8221; and lowered its recommendation
on the stock to neutral from sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the poor demand outlook for mining, we now believe
that restructuring will still be required post 2013 and
therefore do not expect as fast margin recovery as we did
before,&#8221; Goldman said in the note. The Copenhagen-based company
faces &#8220;too strong a headwind&#8221; in its markets, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its price estimate on the share to 310 kroner
from 325 kroner. The average price target of 14 analysts
covering the stock is 346 kroner, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Key downside risks include failure to execute on the
materials handling restructuring, lower metal prices, slowing
global growth, project execution issues,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLSmidth&#8217;s restructuring plans targets an increase in
earnings before interest, tax and amortization of 750 million
kroner ($135 million) in 2015. The company, which has missed
analyst net income estimates in its last six quarterly reports,
is scheduled to publish third-quarter earnings on Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infosys Ltd. (INFO), India&#8217;s second-largest
software exporter, reserved $35 million for a potential
settlement tied to a U.S. probe into the company&#8217;s use of visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is &#8220;engaged in discussions&#8221; to reach a civil
resolution with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office which is
investigating compliance with visa laws, Bangalore-based Infosys
said in an e-mailed statement. The company declined to elaborate
on the talks, which it said are continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infosys, which reported earnings today, resolved two
whistle-blower cases in Alabama and California in the past 14
months after employees alleged it misused so-called B-1 visas,
temporary business permits, to avoid limits on H-1B employment
visas. Proposed changes to immigration laws in Congress, which
would limit the ability of large Indian companies to access H-1B
visas, may damage Infosys&#8217; business model of relying on North
America for more than 60 percent of its revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infosys reported second-quarter net income of 24.1 billion
rupees ($394 million) in the three months ended September. That
missed the 26.6 billion-rupee median of 46 analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, due to the company&#8217;s 2.2 billion rupee
provision for &#8220;visa-related matters.&#8221; according to the
company&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks before Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer announced plans to retire, lead
independent director John Thompson spelled out the board&#8217;s
responsibility in an on-campus interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ours is not a role where we devise the strategy,&#8221;
Thompson told Microsoft&#8217;s internal Channel 9 site on Aug. 7.
&#8220;Our role is really to say, &#8216;Here&#8217;s what we think about what
we&#8217;ve heard, here&#8217;s what we like, quite frankly, here&#8217;s what we
don&#8217;t like.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Thompson&#8217;s almost 20 months on Microsoft&#8217;s board,
directors were frank about what they didn&#8217;t like about the
company&#8217;s performance under Ballmer, regulatory filings show.
The board, in annual reviews, rebuked the CEO for poor results
in Windows and tablets machines, even as it lauded areas such as
server software and expense cutting. They paid him less than his
maximum possible bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson combined candor with his experience as a 42-year
technology industry veteran to lead the board&#8217;s discussion of
company strategy, helping to create an environment that sped
Ballmer&#8217;s decision to retire, according to people with knowledge
of the matter. Thompson, 64, listened to each board member and
made sure Ballmer heard them, improving lines of communication
and making strategy talks more productive, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers shouldn&#8217;t risk a default
on U.S. debt because the impact would be devastating and the
full extent of the damage isn&#8217;t knowable in advance, said the
heads of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The United States cannot default and, in my opinion, will
not default,&#8221; JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
today during a panel discussion at a financial industry
conference in Washington. &#8220;It would ripple through the global
economy in a way you couldn&#8217;t possibly understand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy has been gaining strength and a default now
could reverse that progress, Dimon said. &#8220;Please, let&#8217;s not
shoot ourselves in the foot,&#8221; he said. Deutsche Bank co-CEO
Anshu Jain called the prospect of even a small default &#8220;utterly
catastrophic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEOs spoke while U.S. lawmakers struggled without
success to reach an agreement that would avert default and end
the 12-day government shutdown. The Senate rejected a Democratic
plan to push the debt-limit fight into 2015. The U.S. might not
be able to pay all its bills as early as Oct. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There isn&#8217;t life beyond default,&#8221; Jain said during the
panel discussion with Dimon. &#8220;This would be a very rapidly
spreading, fatal disease.&#8221; The potential consequences are so
unfathomable that Jain said he couldn&#8217;t offer the audience any
meaningful recommendations on how to react. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Foundations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe was paralyzed at the possibility of an Italian
default, which was a 2 trillion Euro economy,&#8221; Jain said,
referring to the continent&#8217;s debt crisis. A U.S. default would
be far worse with incurable legal problems, he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re
now talking about the underpinnings of finance,&#8221; Jain said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the largest U.S. bank by assets and based in
New York. Deutsche Bank, based in Frankfurt, is the biggest in
Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consequences of it would be absolutely disastrous,
considering the role of the U.S. dollar,&#8221; said Baudouin Prot,
chairman of Paris-based BNP Paribas SA, at today&#8217;s event. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe for one second that this scenario will occur.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as default looms, Jain said the dollar&#8217;s status as the
world&#8217;s reserve currency is here to stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no alternative,&#8221; and there won&#8217;t be one for at
least decade, he said. Jain said he would have liked to have
seen the euro occupy more of that role. &#8220;The European crisis

&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said the U.K. will simplify the visa application process
for Chinese visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain will start a pilot program to allow some Chinese
travel agents to apply for a visa by submitting the same form
they&#8217;ll use for a visit the European Union&#8217;s passport-free
Schengen Zone, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osborne is leading a five-day visit to China to promote
economic links between the two countries, starting in Beijing.
Among the delegates are London Mayor Boris Johnson and
representatives of British technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These changes will streamline and simplify the visa
application process for Chinese visitors, while ensuring the
system is strong and secure,&#8221; Osborne said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other visa measures include creating a &#8220;super priority&#8221;
service that will start about the middle of next year. A &#8220;VIP
mobile visa&#8221; service now operating in Beijing and Shanghai,
that reduces the collection process to about five minutes, will
be expanded to other parts of China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co.
and Manchester Airports Group said they&#8217;ve formed a venture with
other partners to build an international business district in
Manchester, the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest city. The buildings will
be worth about 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) when they&#8217;re
completed and fully leased, the partners said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;Richard Usher, JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s (JPM) chief dealer in London, wrote instant messages while he
was at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc that U.K. regulators are
scrutinizing as part of their investigation of alleged currency
manipulation, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages to traders at other firms included details of
his trading positions, said one of the people, who asked not to
be identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly.
The spot currency trader left Edinburgh-based RBS in 2010, and
his departure was unrelated to the probe, the person said. The
regulator&#8217;s review doesn&#8217;t imply wrongdoing on Usher&#8217;s part, the
other person said. The people didn&#8217;t say how many other traders&#8217;
communications are being scrutinized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities are scrutinizing electronic messages used by
currency traders as part of an investigation of potential
manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market,
according to a person with knowledge of the talks. The U.K.&#8217;s
Financial Conduct Authority is focusing on trading around the
so-called WM/Reuters rates, benchmarks used to value trillions
of dollars of investments, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in June that traders at some banks
may have pooled information about their positions through
instant messages and sought to manipulate the WM/Reuters rates
for profit by pushing through trades before and during the 60-second windows when the benchmarks are set. RBS, Britain&#8217;s
biggest publicly owned lender, opened an internal inquiry and
uncovered the transcripts after the report, one of the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $5.12
million of two-year notes that yield five times Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)&#8217;s gains, the first offering linked to the
lender since at least January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Oct. 8, pay a maximum of 40 percent
with all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. JPMorgan valued the
notes at 95 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBVA, Spain&#8217;s second-biggest bank, issued $1.5 billion of
contingent convertible bonds in April, the first European bank
to sell the securities complying with new rules governing how
they can be employed to bolster balance sheets. The bank is
using the proceeds for its Tier 1 capital, the riskiest segment.
The bonds automatically convert to stock if the bank&#8217;s Tier 1
ratio falls below 5.125 percent of assets weighted by risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bilbao-based bank rose 28 percent this year to 8.94
euros ($12.14) at the close of trading in Madrid today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg started collecting comprehensive data on U.S.
SEC-registered structured notes in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create the securities by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA,
Latin America&#8217;s biggest gold producer, climbed to a two-week
high in New York after JPMorgan Chase  Co. recommended the
stock and said output will recover in 2015 after declines this
year and next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenaventura&#8217;s American depositary receipts advanced 3.2
percent to $12.14 at 3:24 p.m. in New York, the highest level on
a closing basis since Sept. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts estimated in a note to clients that gold
production will rise to 914,000 ounces in 2015 after falling
this year to 883,000 ounces from 1.03 million ounces in 2012.
Buenaventura is expected to resolve operational difficulties at
its mines, and its partly owned Yanacocha mine will receive
authorization to develop new reserves, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see the problems at its mines as short-term,&#8221;
analysts John Bridges and Anant Inani said in the note today.
Authorities in the Peruvian department of Cajamarca, where the
Yanacocha mine is located, will encourage development of new
mining areas &#8220;rather than risk losing Yanacocha&#8217;s jobs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADRs may reach $19 by the end of 2014, JPMorgan said.
The analysts expect output of 855,000 ounces next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newmont Mining Corp., Yamacocha&#8217;s majority owner, rose 0.3
percent to $25.69 today in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenaventura&#8217;s ADRs have tumbled 66 percent this year as
operating problems at its Orcopampa and other smaller mines
reduced output, JPMorgan said in its report. Expansion of
Yanacocha has faced opposition from local community groups on
water-supply issues, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was asked by
European Union data-protection regulators to tweak policies for
its Internet products including Hotmail and Bing search engine
as part of a formal probe into possible privacy issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data regulators &#8220;identified a number of areas where
improvements are required,&#8221; the EU group said in a statement.
&#8220;Microsoft was asked to send its response very shortly,
explaining how and when it would implement&#8221; the
recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates to Microsoft&#8217;s services agreement, which took
effect last year on Oct. 19 have been formally reviewed by EU
regulators, with the data-protection commissions for Luxembourg
and France leading the investigation. Google Inc. has also come
under fire by the 28 EU data-protection regulators, who work
together in the so-called Article 29 Data Protection Working
Party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities &#8220;are confident that an agreement will soon
be found,&#8221; Gerard Lommel, head of the Luxembourg regulator,
said in an interview today. The Luxembourg and French &#8220;have
appreciated the transparent cooperation of Microsoft,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data protection is currently policed by separate regulators
across the EU. As part of an overhaul of the union&#8217;s 18-year-old
rules on the issue, its executive body wants to simplify the
system so companies deal with only one regulator in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strong commitment to privacy is a key differentiator for
Microsoft so we&#8217;ll always carefully review any feedback we
receive,&#8221; Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of EU data watchdogs wrote to Google Chief
Executive Officer Larry Page a year ago, saying the company
&#8220;empowers itself to collect vast amounts of personal data about
Internet users&#8221; without demonstrating that this &#8220;collection
was proportionate,&#8221; and asking the company to bring its policy
in line with EU rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled Windows Phone software for smartphone-tablet hybrids as well as more powerful chips as the company plays catchup to Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) in mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bigger start menu with higher-resolution displays will enable the software to run on phones with five- and six-inch screens for the first time, Microsoft said today in a blog post. The update to Windows Phone 8 will roll out to developers tomorrow and customers in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After losing out in smartphones and tablets to Google&#8217;s Android operating system and Apple&#8217;s iOS software, Microsoft is trying to appeal to consumers in the middle. Global shipments of so-called phablets will more than double to 60.4 million this year, research firm IHS predicted in January. That&#8217;s a fraction of the more than 1 billion smartphones researcher IDC expects to be shipped. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), which is selling its handset unit to Microsoft for $7.2 billion, released a promotion for its Oct. 22 Nokia World event, featuring an image of a phablet. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is acquiring the business in a bid to jumpstart its phone efforts while also trying to lure other manufacturers to its mobile operating system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newark, New Jersey, is home to one
of the poorest downtowns in the U.S., a once-exuberant
commercial retail corridor where many&#160;old movie palaces, ornate
department stores and grimy storefronts stand empty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property is cheap because real-estate profits seem elusive.
Developers aren&#8217;t flocking here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, a convention-defying $149 million project called
Teachers Village is in progress, aided by a long view and deep
pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Beit, chief executive officer of Newark-based developer
RBH Group LLC, is leading a group of well-known investors behind
three charter schools and residential buildings with
$800&#160;apartments. Pritzker Prize-winning&#160;Richard Meier is the
architect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a U.S. Senate candidate, and
Governor Chris Christie, a possible presidential contender,
thought the project important enough to participate in its Sept.
25 ribbon cutting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is that good schools, inexpensive housing and
well-chosen retail tenants would bring activity to the
neighborhood, eventually a full-blown revival and further down
the road the prospect of profits from additional 15 million
square feet of mixed-use space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Great Access &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They understood the value proposition,&#8221; Beit said, &#8220;and
that land is too cheap in Newark considering its assets and
access to the Northeast Corridor&#8217;&#8221; -- the Boston, New York,
Washington rail line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors include Nicolas Berggruen of Berggruen
Holdings Inc., Warren Lichtenstein of Steel Partners LLC,
Frederick Iseman of CI Capital Partners LLC and Jeffrey Gould&#8217;s
BRT Realty Trust. (BRT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue-chip lineup attracted Goldman Sachs, which made a
$27 million senior loan. Local, state and federal government
sources added several varieties of tax credits and subsidized
bonds to the developers&#8217; $14 million in equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meier supplied the project&#8217;s master plan, doing without the
sculptural gymnastics he&#8217;s known for -- at the Getty Museum in
Los Angeles and elsewhere -- to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm designed a clean-lined four-story box, one of the
first two buildings that have opened for the present school
term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough and smooth brick patterns echo a mix of clear and
translucent glass to make a surface composition as rich as a
Mondrian painting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nice Windows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two charter schools perch above street-level stores.
Impeccably proportioned windows pour daylight into the
classrooms of the 500-student Spark Charter Academy through
alternating clear and translucent panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most inner city schools, there are no bars on these
windows. The cheerful interiors were designed by KSS Architects
of Princeton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75 students of the Discovery Charter School, which
covers grades four through eight, share a large open space
painted lavender and dotted with houseplants. A girl named Kayla
described an &#8220;amazing&#8221; curriculum that focuses on the basics
while leaving time for botany and cooking skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KSS also designed a six-story red-brick building across the
street for the middle school students of the Great Oak Charter
School, which depends heavily on college graduates to tutor
students. There&#8217;s also a yet-to-open daycare center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KSS design lacks Meier&#8217;s unerring sense of proportion
and attention to detail and is worrisomely bare-bones inside. A
windowless fire stair is the chief way students move from floor
to floor. A caged exercise rooftop is a grim place to blow off
steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, none of the schools has a ground-level playground in
spite of an abundance of nearby parking lots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playgrounds Please &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this can change by the time some 1,000 children
attend the schools and daycare center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New shops Beit is building will appeal to parents, and
eventually to residents, when 200 rental apartments aimed at
teachers are completed. Steel is rising on the first two of
those buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beit avoided the national chains that lazy lenders prefer.
He signed leases likely to make Teachers Village a destination,
such as Harlem cupcake store Tonnie&#8217;s Minis and Chicken Jones, a
casual restaurant created by Manhattan restaurateur Michael Vann. Those magnetic tenancies should fill surrounding
storefronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Beit how he financed quality architecture and
unique rentals in a city developers shun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He praised early partners who bought land -- not just for
Teachers Village, but to eventually accommodate 8,000 residences
and millions of commercial square feet that are in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beit&#160;and his investors will really cash in if Teachers
Village proves to be a&#160;catalyst for a broader Newark revival and
the land they&#8217;ve banked rises in&#160;value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Creating financial components that made investors
stretch, but were not totally out of the realm of what they were
used to, added layers of complexity,&#8221; Beit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entrenched Poverty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does not see financing such a catalytic mix getting any
easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s too bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling communities can almost never tap Wall Street
stars and celebrated architects. Yet these are the places most
in need of such transformational investment, not the
opportunistic junk they usually get stuck with (think casinos)
that fails to ease entrenched poverty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chevron Corp. (CVS) attorney testified that he was charged with bogus crimes in a scheme to shake down the oil producer and obtain a $19 billion judgment in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ricardo Reis Veiga, a senior managing counsel for the second-largest U.S. oil company, was the first witness called by Chevron in a trial that the company says will show that the Ecuadorean verdict was fraudulently obtained by lawyers who operated a racketeering enterprise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Veiga&#8217;s testimony, portions of which were made public today, he said he and a colleague faced charges in the 1990s over their handling of a cleanup settlement for a drilling site in the Ecuadorean rain forest. The charges were dropped in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I experienced an unimaginable nightmare, ranging from stress, anger, pain and frustration from having to face such accusations,&#8221; Veiga said in written testimony filed with U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan. Veiga also took the stand today in federal court in Manhattan to answer further questions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, told Kaplan today that the verdict was obtained by fraud, coercion, extortion, money laundering and the bribery of the Ecuadorean judge who wrote it. In the U.S. case, the San Ramon, California-based company is seeking an order from Kaplan barring enforcement of the 2011 pollution judgment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Racketeering Enterprise&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mastro pointed to the Ecuadoreans&#8217; lead lawyer, Manhattan attorney Steven Donziger, and said he headed a &#8220;racketeering enterprise&#8221; that included two other attorneys, consultants, activists and others to &#8220;shake down&#8221; the oil producer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s what Steven Donziger was trying to do against Chevron -- coerce a big payday against a big company until the pain went away,&#8221; Mastro said. &#8220;But Chevron refused. It refused to be extorted and defrauded and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company wants to stop Donziger and his associates from trying to enforce the verdict in courts around the world where Chevron has assets, Mastro said. Plaintiffs have sued Chevron for payment in Canada, Argentina and Brazil without success. Donziger could collect as much as $1.2 billion if the judgment is collected in full, Mastro said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the underlying 20-year-old environmental case, Donziger and other lawyers for indigenous people in Ecuador&#8217;s Lago Agrio region sought damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes from 1964 until about 1992 that polluted about 1,500 square miles (3,885 square kilometers). The lawsuit continued against Chevron when it acquired Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Paradigm &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron contends that state-owned Petroecuador, a former Texaco partner, is responsible for most of the pollution. Texaco paid $40 million to clean up its share and was released from liability under agreements with Ecuador in 1995 and 1998, Chevron said. An international arbitration tribunal affirmed the accords&#8217; validity in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a new paradigm,&#8221; Mastro said. &#8220;It&#8217;s fraud and extortion and they&#8217;re trying to force a payoff. If they do, it will be open season on U.S. companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Richard Friedman, a lawyer for Donziger, today denied his client had committed any bribery and wrongdoing and said he had worked to hold Chevron accountable for polluting the rain forest, comparing his client to U.S. civil rights leaders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Like Thurgood Marshall, like Ralph Nader, like a host of human rights lawyers before him, Mr. Donziger understood you need legal and social change,&#8221; Friedman told the judge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Wasn&#8217;t Pretty&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friedman argued that Donziger had taken up the cause of indigenous Ecuadoreans who were mistreated and discriminated against, and had successfully persuaded the Ecuadorean courts to hold Chevron responsible for its actions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t pretty but it wasn&#8217;t bribery,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;He&#8217;s changed the way people think. He&#8217;s here today because of that judgment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nicolas Zambrano, the judge who signed the Ecuadorean judgment in favor of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, will testify on Donziger&#8217;s behalf, Friedman said. Zambrano, who is no longer a judge, submitted a declaration denying he had been bribed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mastro said today the trial also will feature another Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra, who presided over the Chevron pollution case before Zambrano. Guerra has submitted a declaration stating that Donziger and another lawyer bribed Zambrano to decide the case in favor of the Ecuadoreans and permitted them to ghostwrite the opinion which Zambrano signed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;One Half&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friedman said that Chevron also tried to bribe one of the Ecuadorean judges to disrupt the environmental case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Chevron is asking is you hear one half of what happened in Ecuador and not hear the other half,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron contends that advocates for the Ecuadoreans, guided by Donziger, &#8220;sought to inflict maximum damage to Chevron&#8217;s reputation.&#8221; The effort got more than $10 million in financing from Philadelphia lawyer Joseph Kohn and U.K.-based investment firm Burford Capital Ltd. (BUR), according to the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Burford sold its interest in the litigation in 2010, it said in July. Kohn was dropped from the litigation and criticized Donziger in an August 2010 letter uncovered by Chevron. He didn&#8217;t respond to a phone call seeking comment on the trial. Mastro said today that Kohn and a second man who helped finance the Ecuadorean litigation would testify as witnesses for Chevron. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Green Issue&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donziger&#8217;s team ran a media campaign that helped to secure an article in Vanity Fair&#8217;s May 2007 &#8220;Green Issue&#8221; and the filming of the 2009 documentary &#8220;Crude&#8221; by Joe Berlinger, featuring villagers stricken with cancer, birth defects and other diseases alleged to be related to exposure to toxins from Texaco&#8217;s drilling, according to Chevron. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the film highlighted the pollution battle, it also gave Chevron evidence for its fraud case. In May 2010, Kaplan ruled that the company could have hundreds of hours of outtakes from &#8220;Crude.&#8221; Using the footage, excerpts from Donziger&#8217;s diary and other materials obtained through U.S. court orders, the company asserts that Donziger&#8217;s team pressured environmental consultants and helped draft a report that inflated damages to $27 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donziger&#8217;s team used an &#8220;army of protesters&#8221; to intimidate the judge and met with him frequently outside of court, Chevron alleged. The plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers also hatched &#8220;trumped up&#8221; criminal charges to bring against Chevron lawyers in Ecuador, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Supervised Litigation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Veiga said today in court that he supervised Chevron&#8217;s litigation in the Ecuadorean case and updated the company about it. He told the judge in filed testimony that he also oversaw Texaco&#8217;s settlements with Ecuador releasing the company from further liability. He was charged with falsifying settlement documents and environmental crimes, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I suspected that the representatives of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, including Donziger, were colluding with the Republic of Ecuador&#8221; to bring the charges, he said in the filing. &#8220;I did not realize at the time, however, the unimaginable extent of the collusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a Nov. 17, 2005, diary entry, Donziger wrote that two of his associates &#8220;were scouring the penal code to find any provision that could be used against&#8221; Veiga, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Donziger Diary &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron contends Donziger&#8217;s diary shows that he was trying to wage a crusade to shake billions of dollars out of the company. In an April 4, 2007, entry, Donziger called his co-litigants &#8220;fellow soldiers&#8221; and mused about the possibility of obtaining a settlement from Chevron. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I sit back and dream,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I cannot believe what we have accomplished. Important people interested in us. A new paradigm of not only a case, but how to do a case. Chevron wanting to settle. Billions of dollars on the table. A movie, a possible book. I cannot keep up with it all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Harvard Law School graduate, Donziger has argued that Chevron took comments from the &#8220;Crude&#8221; footage out of context and that his team was following customary procedures in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In materials distributed to reporters at the trial, representatives for Donziger called the racketeering proceeding a &#8220;rigged show trial designed to allow the overwhelming power of one of America&#8217;s largest corporations to crush a single individual who played an instrumental role in holding the company accountable for its abuses abroad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christopher Gowen, a spokesman for Donziger, said the lawyer didn&#8217;t &#8220;trump up&#8221; charges against Chevron attorneys and that they &#8220;earned these inquiries by the way they treated the people of Ecuador.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Donziger Countersuit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donziger alleged in counterclaims that Chevron manipulated testing at the pollution site, tried to influence Ecuador&#8217;s government and unfairly attacked his reputation. Kaplan dismissed Donziger&#8217;s countersuit in July, saying he didn&#8217;t present strong enough evidence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Donziger and his associates failed in a bid to replace Kaplan as the judge overseeing the trial claiming he&#8217;s biased in favor of the company. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejected the request on Sept. 26. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaplan refused to delay the trial while the appeals court considered the request, saying it lacked merit. The judge also sanctioned Donziger and his co-defendants for withholding documents from Chevron during pretrial information sharing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp. (CVX) v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals court case is In Re Naranjo, 13-00772, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Duane D.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
beverage company, said third-quarter profit rose as sales
volumes advanced in North America and the European business
began to rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 5.9 percent to $2.45 billion, or 54 cents a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 27, compared with a year
earlier, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, profit was 53 cents a share, in line with
the average of 16 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent fought back in the
quarter against persistent consumer uncertainty in developed
nations and what he called &#8220;increasing volatility across
emerging markets&#8221; by strategically raising prices and getting
more consumers to grab a drink on the go. Kent said he still
expects the company and its bottlers to reach $200 billion in
global revenue by 2020, double that generated in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Muhtar and his team are continuing to succeed at their
game plan even though the economy in some emerging markets,
South America and some parts of Europe continue to create near-term challenges,&#8221; Thomas Mullarkey, an analyst for Morningstar
Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

raise the U.S. debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s money-market portfolios don&#8217;t own Treasuries
that mature between tomorrow and Nov. 20, the Morgan Stanley
unit said in its Investor Insights publication for this month.
The prime portfolios have no Treasury exposure, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our portfolio management team has taken a conservative
stance on U.S. Treasury bills and notes in anticipation of
congressional gridlock around raising the debt ceiling,&#8221; the

volatility near the estimated deadline as well as eliminate any
possible need to sell those securities later at potentially less
favorable prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest provider of U.S.
money-market mutual funds, said last week that those products

&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Rockies agreed on a
three-year contract with manager Walt Weiss, who guided the team
to a 10-win improvement during his first season in Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rockies had a 74-88 record this year, when they
finished last in the National League&#8217;s five-team West division.
They were 64-98 in 2012 and have missed the Major League
Baseball playoffs the last four seasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am very excited and grateful to have the opportunity to
lead this club as we work toward building a championship-level
team,&#8221; said Weiss, who grew up in Tuxedo, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiss, 49, played 14 major-league seasons at shortstop,
including with the Rockies from 1994 to 1997, and was the team&#8217;s
special assistant to the general manager from 2002 to 2008. The

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) recommended that
investors reject an offer to buy a small portion of its stock
for 4.7 percent below market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has warned
against such mini-tender offers, which bidders use to &#8220;catch
investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer
price to the current market price,&#8221; Disney said today in a

&lt;p&gt;TRC Capital Corp., a closely held investment firm, made the
proposal last week to acquire about 2 million Disney shares for

for Intel Corp. (INTC) and 21st Century Fox Inc. shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, slid 1.2 percent to

&lt;p&gt;William Demant Holding A/S (WDH), the
Nordic region&#8217;s biggest hearing-aid maker, fell the most among
Copenhagen&#8217;s benchmark stocks today after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said a rally in the share is coming to an end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WDH dropped as much as 2.1 percent, making it today&#8217;s
biggest loser in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20 index. (KFX) The stock
lost 1.1 percent to 525 kroner at 10:11 a.m. in the Danish
capital, with trading volume at 30 percent of the three-month
daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WDH shares had jumped 14 percent in the six months through
yesterday, compared with a 6.5 percent gain in the C20 index, on
bets that the company will win market share and increase
profitability amid the introduction of new hearing aids. In a
note distributed today, Goldman lowered its recommendation on
the stock to neutral from buy and said recent share gains leave
little room for further advances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we view WDH as well-positioned within European
Medtech, our 12-month price target implies limited upside
potential from current levels,&#8221; Goldman analysts, including
Veronika Dubajova, said in the note. &#8220;In addition, the company
has not achieved any significant market share gains following
the Alta launch at the beginning of 2013; this is contrary to
our expectation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has a price estimate of 550 kroner on WDH shares,
which compares with an average target of 489 kroner among 22
analysts tracking the stock, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoerum, Denmark-based WDH, which is scheduled to publish a
third-quarter trading update on Nov. 5, has missed analysts&#8217;
average net income estimates in seven of its last eight half-year earnings reports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rackspace Hosting Inc. (RAX) lawyer Van
Lindberg is fed up with what he considers dubious patent-infringement lawsuits -- such licensing company Rotatable
Technologies LLC&#8217;s demand for $75,000 to settle a February case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies negotiate to pay the plaintiff to go away,
since it&#8217;s cheaper than what may become a lengthy court battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a procedure called inter partes review created by the
2011 America Invents Act, Lindberg instead petitioned the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office for a new examination of the
computer-image display patent. If Rackspace persuades the agency
the patent never should have been issued, the suit will be
dismissed. Rotatable says in court documents its patent is
valid. Its lawyer, Austin Hansley in Dallas, didn&#8217;t return calls
seeking comment on the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We said, &#8216;No thanks&#8217;&#8221; to Rotatable&#8217;s demand, said
Lindberg, head of the intellectual property section of the San
Antonio-based Web computing services provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Google Inc., NetApp Inc. (NTAP) and Oracle
Corp. (ORCL) see the new review as a way to fend off royalty demands by
patent-assertion entities -- sometimes derided as trolls. They
like the process for the reasons patent-licensing firms don&#8217;t:
they offer quicker rulings at less cost than litigation and
shift the burden of proof to patent owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech companies say patent lawsuits -- especially targeting
end users or one aspect of a business -- drain resources and
innovation. Patent-licensing companies say litigation protects
inventions, though Congress is considering curbs on abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 592 petitions have been filed since reviews began
a year ago, exceeding the 520 the agency expected. Two cases
were decided as of Oct. 3, as the patent office stayed open
during the partial government shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new patent law, the Arlington, Virginia-based
patent office set up processes to look at some finance-related
business methods, such as SAP AG (SAP)&#8217;s challenge of Versata Software
Inc.&#8217;s patent for customized pricing, and to streamline the
older procedure for anyone challenging a patent&#8217;s validity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions on whether a patent is valid are required within
12 months. Patent reexaminations under the old rules ordinarily
can take years. Patent office officials had no comment for this
story, said Paul Fucito, an agency spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Luxury-Goods Makers Win Order Against Tradekey&#8217;s Websites &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartier International, Montblanc-Simplo GmbH, Alfred
Dunhill Ltd. and three other manufacturers of luxury goods
persuaded a federal judge in Los Angeles to issue an order
against a company that enabled the sale of counterfeit goods
through three different websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Gary Allen Fees said Oct. 8 he would
issue an order barring Tradekey Pvt. Ltd. from permitting the
use of any of the plantiffs&#8217; trademarks or imitation of their
marks on the www.Tradekey.com, www.saudicommerce.com and
www.b2bfreezone.com websites. He also said the company wouldn&#8217;t
be able to use the plaintiffs&#8217; marks as keywords, adwords or any
other type of metadata. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit began in May 2011 in federal court in Los Angeles.
The luxury goods companies hired an investigator who found that
6,000 sellers were offering unauthorized versions of the
plaintiffs&#8217; goods on Tradekey websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigator bought counterfeit products falsely
branded as made by Cartier and the other defendants from sellers
who were promoting their goods on Tradekey websites, according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also paid a $3,000 fee for a Tradekey membership through
which he purported to want to sell counterfeit merchandise.
According to court papers, the Tradekey employee told the
investigator that it wasn&#8217;t a problem selling fakes through the
websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradekey had argued that the investigation process was
sloppy and unreliable. The court said that it was worth nothing
that the investigators in the case had a &#8220;substantial track
record&#8221; in federal court litigation, and that evidence the
investigator produced in the past &#8220;has been relied on by
multiple courts finding in favor of the famous plaintiff brand
owners such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Microsoft, Gucci and
others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chloe SAS v. Sawabeh Information Services Co.,
2:11-cv-04147-GAF-MAN, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Escape From Tomorrow&#8217; Filmmakers Waiting for Disney Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official website for the black-and-white film &#8220;Escape
From Tomorrow&#8221; contains a digital clock counting down the
weeks, days, hours and minutes since the film&#8217;s release that its
producers haven&#8217;t been sued by the Walt Disney Co. (DIS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film, shot clandestinely inside the Disney theme parks
in Florida and California, was shown at the Sundance Festival
and went into general release earlier this month. The film
trailer opens with the message, &#8220;The following motion picture
has not been approved for all audiences by the Walt Disney
Company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roy Abramsohn, who plays the lead role in the film, was
interviewed in a &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; video available on Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube video-sharing website. Abramson said that he and
his fellow actors were &#8220;hiding in plain sight&#8221; when shooting
the film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Randy Moore said in that same video that filming
in the park wasn&#8217;t all that difficult because &#8220;everyone brings
in camera equipment&#8221; and is shooting videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film&#8217;s trailer features background shots of many of the
iconic Disney theme park attractions, including the swirling
teacup ride, Sleeping Beauty&#8217;s castle, the flying Dumbo elephant
ride, the Epcot sphere and the &#8220;Small World&#8221; family ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the posters for the film contains an image of the
four-fingered gloved hand associated with Mickey Mouse. Blood
drips from all four fingers. Another shows two women running
from what seems to be a giant eye centered by the Epcot sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was scored by Abel Korzeniowski, instead of using
familiar Disney theme music, such as the accompaniment to the
Small World ride, and the background music to the jungle-themed
Tiki Room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was done in an attempt to sidestep any possible
copyright claims, according to an article by Peter Sciretta on
the SlashFilm.com website. Sciretta&#8217;s piece, posted in January
after the film&#8217;s debut at the Sundance Festival, predicted that
&#8220;Escape From Tomorrow&#8221; would never go into general release
because of the number of potential intellectual-property issues
Disney lawyers could raise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Intel Sued, Accused of Trade Secret Misappropriation by Zettaset &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zettaset, a maker of database-management software and
systems, filed a trade-secrets misappropriation case against
Intel Corp. (INTC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed Oct. 10 in California state court,
accuses the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker of
extracting trade secrets from Zettaset&#8217;s products and
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California&#8217;s Zettaset said in a statement
yesterday that the misappropriation was so extensive that an
Intel product -- Apache Hadoop Software -- &#8220;now mirrors the
features and functionality of Zettaset&#8217;s Orchestrator
software.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zettaset President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Vogt
said in the statement that the company had &#8220;no alternative but
to take legal action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel spokesman Chuck Malloy said in an e-mail that his
company is aware of the suit and &#8220;in the process of developing
our defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Zettaset, a pretrial conference for the
dispute has been set for Feb. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zettaset v. Intel Corp., 1-13-cv-254447,
California Superior Court, Santa Clara County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest U.S. bank, agreed to pay $100 million to resolve Commodity Futures Trading Commission claims that the company&#8217;s London traders last year deployed a reckless strategy in derivatives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord, which stems from the bank&#8217;s chief investment office&#8217;s conduct on Feb. 29, 2012, brings JPMorgan&#8217;s settlements from the London Whale trades to more than $1 billion, the CFTC said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s traders tried to defend their position in credit derivatives &#8220;by dumping a gargantuan, record-setting, volume of swaps virtually all at once, recklessly ignoring the obvious dangers to legitimate pricing forces,&#8221; David Meister, the CFTC&#8217;s head of enforcement, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank agreed in September to pay $920 million to resolve related U.S. and U.K. probes into its internal controls and handling of the trades, which inflicted at least $6.2 billion in losses on the bank last year. The accords don&#8217;t end all of the investigations into the bets managed by Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale because his positions were large enough to move markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The selling cited by the CFTC was a &#8220;manipulative device&#8221; that disregarded consequences to the broader market, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said the bank neither admitted nor denied the CFTC&#8217;s legal conclusion that there was a violation, while admitting to &#8220;certain facts set out in the order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Middle Ground &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The admission of the facts represents a middle ground between settlements where a party neither admits nor denies anything and those where a party admits to a violation of the law, Dan Waldman, a Washington-based partner at law firm Arnold  Porter LLP, said in a telephone interview. The accord preserves the bank&#8217;s ability to defend against future civil claims related to the London trades, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The London Whale in a Nutshell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does make it easier for them to defend future cases,&#8221; said Waldman, a former CFTC general counsel who represents exchanges, brokerages and investment funds in regulatory matters before his former agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord following the CFTC&#8217;s 17-month investigation relies on Dodd-Frank Act powers to combat market manipulation. The 2010 financial-regulatory law broadened the agency&#8217;s ability to bring enforcement cases, allowing lawyers to demonstrate reckless trading instead of a higher standard of intent and success at actual manipulation of a market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Defending Position &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan traders on Feb. 29, 2012, tried to defend their position in credit-default swaps to stem losses, according to the CFTC. The bank sold more than $7 billion of swaps that day, including $4.6 billion in a three-hour period, the agency said. The sales accounted for more than 90 percent of the day&#8217;s net volume traded by the entire market, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The facts as admitted by the bank are that they acted recklessly with regard to the fundamental precept that prices in the swap market be established by legitimate forces of supply and demand,&#8221; CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bart Chilton, a Democratic CFTC commissioner, said in a statement that he wouldn&#8217;t have supported the order without the bank&#8217;s admission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;O&#8217;Malia Dissent &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott O&#8217;Malia, a Republican commissioner, dissented from the decision and said the agency should have taken more time to demonstrate whether the bank is liable for price manipulation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission&#8217;s abbreviated investigation has failed to determine whether JPMorgan intentionally or recklessly manipulated the price of a particular type of credit default swap index,&#8221; O&#8217;Malia said in his statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission has said its inquiry remains open while the U.S. Justice Department runs a parallel probe. Iksil, who prosecutors have said is cooperating with their case, hasn&#8217;t been charged. The CFTC&#8217;s enforcement division decided against recommending an enforcement against against JPMorgan traders, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April last year, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon initially dismissed reports that the derivatives bets were distorting markets, calling the attention a &#8220;tempest in a teapot.&#8221; The bank disclosed mounting losses a month later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank admitted in its SEC settlement that internal oversight of the trades suffered from lapses and that the firm violated federal securities laws. The company&#8217;s handling of the trades also has been faulted by Senate investigators, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Resolving Probes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sought in the past few months to resolve probes into businesses including energy trading, credit-card lending and bundling of mortgages into bonds. The bank said Oct. 11 it took a $7.2 billion charge for expenses tied to regulatory matters and litigation, leading to its first quarterly loss during Dimon&#8217;s tenure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has yet to resolve state and federal probes into its mortgage-bond sales, including a criminal inquiry. JPMorgan has been discussing a potential $11 billion deal with authorities looking into that business, a person with knowledge of the talks said in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Bloomberg News" date="Oct 16, 2013  3:38 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-16/china-stock-index-futures-fall-amid-jpmorgan-cut-u-s-talks.html"><headline>China&#8217;s Stocks Fall Most in 3 Weeks on Economic Concerns</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s stocks fell the most in
three weeks after JPMorgan Chase  Co. advised reducing holdings
and companies linked to Shanghai&#8217;s free-trade zone tumbled on
concern valuations are excessive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai International Port (Group) Co. and Shanghai
Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone Development Co. plunged more than 8
percent after more than doubling since Aug. 22. Aluminum
Corporation of China Ltd. and Jiangxi Copper Co., the nation&#8217;s
biggest producers of aluminum and copper, led declines for metal
producers. Poly Real Estate Group Co. fell 2.3 percent, dragging
a gauge of property developers to its biggest loss since June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) slid 1.8 percent to 2,193.07
at the close, the biggest loss since Sept. 26. JPMorgan cut
China to underweight, citing an economic slowdown and potential
policy disappointment from a Communist Party meeting in
November. Consumer prices quickened last month, while exports
unexpectedly fell, according to government reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are increasing worries about the economy,&#8221; Li Jun,
a strategist at Central China Securities Co., said from
Shanghai. &#8220;We may have reached bottom but we don&#8217;t see much
upside in the economic numbers. There are also concerns that the
meeting in November may not provide much detail and our stocks
rallied excessively on policy expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSI 300 Index fell 1.9 percent to 2,421.37, with gauges
of telecom, consumer-discretionary, technology and industrial
companies losing more than 2 percent. The ChiNext index of small
companies declined 3.9 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index retreated 0.7 percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index
slid 0.7 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite has climbed 13 percent from its
four-year low on June 27, boosted by speculation the city&#8217;s
free-trade zone will attract foreign companies and allow for
financial liberalization. The China Securities Regulatory
Commission today denied market speculation the zone will
introduce an international stocks board, saying rules don&#8217;t
allow foreign companies to sell shares in the trade area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Waigaoqiao declined 9.5 percent to 46.19 yuan,
paring gains to 211 percent since Aug. 22, when the Commerce
Ministry said the government approved a trade area in the city.
Shanghai International Port dropped 8.9 percent to 5.24 yuan,
trimming a rally since Aug. 22 to 105 percent. The company&#8217;s
estimated price-earnings ratio jumped to a three-year high of
27.3 last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Property Curbs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai, the nation&#8217;s commercial hub, last month
inaugurated an 11-square-mile trade zone as a testing ground for
free-market policies. Companies with the word &#8220;Shanghai&#8221; in
their name have paced the benchmark stock index&#8217;s rebound from a
four-year low in June and the rally has spread to shares in
Tianjin and Qingdao as investors speculated the government will
let more cities follow Shanghai&#8217;s plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of developers in the Shanghai index slid 4.2
percent, the biggest loss among five industry groups. Poly REal
Estate, the second-largest developer, fell 2.3 percent to 9.61
yuan. Gemdale Corp. declined 2.6 percent to 5.91 yuan. Shanghai
Lujiazui Finance  Trade Zone Development Co. plunged 10 percent
to 22.79 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese real-estate stocks were dragged down by concern of
potential tightening after the Communist Party plenum next
month, Credit Suisse property analyst Jinsong Du wrote in an e-mailed message. Premier Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping are
expected to seek support for national plans to reduce the
government&#8217;s hand in the economy and financial system at the
meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai index trades at 8.7 times projected earnings
for the next 12 months, compared with the five-year average of
12.6, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Trading volumes in the
stocks measure were 1 percent above the 30-day average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is scheduled to publish third-quarter gross
domestic product data on Oct. 18. The economy probably expanded
7.8 percent from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg
survey, up from the second quarter&#8217;s 7.5 percent pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The most recent rally was from late June,&#8221; Adrian Mowat,
Hong Kong-based equity strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note
dated yesterday. &#8220;This cyclical lift appears to be fading
faster than we hoped.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalco, as Aluminum Corp. of China is called, slid 4.5
percent to 4.28 yuan. The company plans to sell its stake in a
venture in Guinea to a unit of its parent for about $2.07
billion. Jiangxi Copper slumped 4 percent to 15.48 yuan. Cosco
Shipping Co. plunged 4.7 percent to 3.62 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate leaders are resuming talks aimed at avoiding a U.S.
default and ending the 15-day-old government shutdown after the
Republican-controlled House scrapped a vote on its plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, the U.S.&#8217;s largest creditor abroad, urged American
lawmakers opposed to raising the debt limit by tomorrow to get
out of the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. must &#8220;shoulder its responsibility&#8221; as the
world&#8217;s biggest economy and holder of the main reserve currency
and &#8220;take concrete measures before Oct. 17 to avoid a
default,&#8221; Deputy Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said at a
briefing with reporters yesterday in Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are also worried about the U.S. debt problem,&#8221; Zhang Haidong, strategist at Tebon Securities, said in an interview
from Shanghai. &#8220;If the deal fails, it will impact the global
economy, including China.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Frog International Holdings Ltd. plunged by the most
on record in Hong Kong after short-seller Glaucus Research Group
questioned the company&#8217;s sales and branded the baby-care
products maker a strong sell. The shares were halted after
dropping as much as 26 percent to HK$4.66, heading for the
biggest decline since its July 2011 listing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is reassigning James Bramante, who had overseen its
emerging-markets business, after a drop in the unit&#8217;s sales,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Di Leo, who formerly ran IBM&#8217;s growth markets and is
now head of sales, will be in charge of setting up a new team to
oversee the unit, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Bramante&#8217;s new
position has yet to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the division fell 9 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier, dragged down by a 22 percent decline in
China, where the government was revamping its economic policy,
Armonk, New York-based IBM said yesterday. The performance
helped contribute to the sixth straight quarterly decline in
total sales for the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the growth markets organization, the leadership team
that established that to begin with and drove that organization
is now back in the cockpit, led by Bruno Di Leo and his
leadership team,&#8221; IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said yesterday on a conference call. &#8220;They know how to get this
done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Sciales, an IBM spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately respond
to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While growth in the emerging-markets unit -- which also
includes India and countries in Africa and the Middle East --
typically exceeds developed markets by 8 to 10 percentage
points, it trailed them for the first time this quarter,
Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware Shuffle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive change is Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty&#8217;s second major leadership shuffle this year. In April,
she appointed Tom Rosamilia, who had been overseeing corporate
strategy, to take charge of the hardware division, replacing Rod Adkins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware business continues to drag the company down,
with revenue declining 17 percent in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bramante&#8217;s reassignment was reported earlier today by the
Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 6.4 percent to $174.83 at the close in New York
for the biggest decline since April. The shares have slipped 8.7
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Frier" date="Oct 17, 2013  4:33 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-17/ibm-shares-tumble-after-sixth-quarterly-sales-decline.html"><headline>IBM Shares Tumble After Sixth Quarterly Sales Decline</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services provider, dropped the most
since April after sales fell for the sixth straight quarter and
its hardware business posted a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 4 percent to $23.7 billion in the third
quarter, the Armonk, New York-based company said in a statement
after trading closed yesterday. That was $1 billion less than
analysts had estimated, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s shift to higher-margin software and services has
failed to make up for a slump in sales of servers and other
computer hardware. Even the company&#8217;s traditional growth markets
-- developing economies overseas, including China -- aren&#8217;t
helping prop up sales. IBM posted the first revenue decrease in
those markets in its history last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM has been challenged with changing the model on the
hardware front, and now the growth markets are a surprise
drop,&#8221; said Chris Ambrose, an analyst at Gartner Inc. While
pursuing higher-margin markets is the right move, &#8220;they still
have to show revenue growth at some point,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 6.4 percent to $174.83 at the close in New
York. The stock is now trading at its lowest price in more than
two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company lost $713 million in its hardware business in
the first nine months of this year, compared with $253 million
in profit in the year-earlier period. Revenue from growth
markets shrank 9 percent last quarter. Chinese sales tumbled
more than 20 percent as the country worked on a plan for
economic policy, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on
a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is reassigning James Bramante, who had overseen the
emerging-markets business, to a position it has yet to announce,
a person with knowledge of the matter said today. Bruno Di Leo,
who formerly ran the growth-markets unit and is now head of
sales, well be in charge of setting up a new team to oversee the
division, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make up for the slowdown, the company is looking to
cloud computing -- the delivery of software and services online
-- and it divulged revenue from that market for the first time
yesterday. IBM said it generated more than $1 billion in revenue
from cloud products and services in the quarter. The disclosure
follows an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission into the finances surrounding IBM&#8217;s cloud business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tax Advantage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 5.7 percent to $4 billion, or $3.68 a
share, from $3.8 billion, or $3.33, a year earlier. Excluding
some items, earnings were $3.99 a share in the period, topping
the $3.96 predicted by analysts. That number was helped by a
lower-than-anticipated tax rate of 17 percent, down 7.7 points
from a year ago. The company got a boost from foreign tax audits
and the divestiture of a retail store business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more favorable tax rate contributed 30 cents to
earnings, David Grossman, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus  Co.,
said in a note to investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM has always viewed the tax rate as an operational
lever,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is working to rid itself of commodity products,
shifting instead toward software-focused businesses that
generate higher profit margins. IBM yesterday reiterated its
goal of reaching $20 a share in earnings by 2015, up from $15.25
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trusteer Purchase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM agreed to sell off its customer-service unit to Synnex
Corp. (SNX) for $505 million in September. It&#8217;s also spending more
than $800 million to buy Trusteer Inc., a software security
company, people familiar with the deal said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, IBM acquired SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a cloud-computing storage provider that will help it compete with
Amazon.com Inc. It paid almost $2 billion this year for the
Dallas-based company, said a person with knowledge of the
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s hardware business continued to drag the company down,
with revenue declining 17 percent in the third quarter. Chief
Executive Officer Ginni Rometty shook up the management of the
division in April, replacing Rod Adkins with Tom Rosamilia, who
had been overseeing corporate strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are taking action to improve execution in our growth
markets unit and in the elements of our hardware businesses that
are under performing,&#8221; Rometty said in yesterday&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had also been trying to sell parts of its
server division to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), before discussions broke
down in early May due to disagreements over price, people
familiar with the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, IBM spent $1 billion to restructure
its workforce, cutting more than 3,300 jobs in the U.S. and
Canada alone, according to Alliance@IBM, an employee group.
Loughridge, the company&#8217;s finance chief, said earlier this year
that divestitures will make up for that expense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) declined
2.4 percent in New York trading after revenue dropped the most
among the biggest Wall Street banks and fixed-income results
were the worst since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter revenue of $6.72 billion was 20 percent lower
than a year earlier and fell short of the $7.35 billion average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bond trading
plunged 47 percent to $1.29 billion, the New York-based company
said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, cut
expenses 25 percent in the quarter to offset falling revenue,
including a 35 percent reduction in compensation. The firm was
the only major bank to post a decline in equities trading, and
revenue compared with the second quarter dropped in three of the
company&#8217;s four business units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income revenue &#8220;looks very weak, and surprisingly,
it looks clearly weaker than its peers,&#8221; said Richard Staite, a
bank analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. &#8220;It&#8217;s more than just
weak client trading, it looks like. They could&#8217;ve been badly
positioned in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to $158.32 at 4:15 p.m. in New York.
The stock had gained 27 percent this year through yesterday
after advancing 41 percent in 2012. The shares have traded below
1.5 times book value for the past 3 1/2 years, the longest such
streak in the company&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX), the owner
of an electronic bond and derivatives-trading system, appointed
ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Jane Chwick to its board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chwick, who was co-chief operating officer of technology at
Goldman Sachs, is now an advisory director at the firm, New
York-based MarketAxess said today in a statement. Chwick was
listed as a full partner at Goldman Sachs in an October 2012
filing. Advisory directors typically are former partners who are
no longer employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic bond trading is gaining momentum as new
regulations curbing risk prompt banks to trim inventories of
corporate debt, reducing their willingness to act as middlemen
between buyers and sellers. Firms including Deutsche Bank AG and
Goldman Sachs are designing systems to accommodate the shift.
MarketAxess and BlackRock Inc. (BLK) said in April they were creating
an alliance for a unified bond-trading platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MarketAxess has been at the forefront of market-structure
changes in fixed income for well over a decade and today we are
at a critical juncture in the evolution of these markets,&#8221;
Chwick said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade bond volume on the company&#8217;s electronic
system are on pace to exceed $400 billion in 2013 after surging
45 percent to $44 billion in September from a year earlier, data
from the company show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chwick joined Goldman Sachs in 1983 as a programmer and
held senior positions including global head of technology for
fixed income, currencies and commodities, and global head of
technology for the securities division, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News,
competes with MarketAxess to provide electronic-trading systems

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the world&#8217;s most profitable securities firm before the financial crisis, said earnings were little changed as the bank cut costs in response to a 20 percent drop in revenue. The firm increased its dividend 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company fell as revenue of $6.72 billion fell short of the $7.35 billion average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Third-quarter net income rose to $1.52 billion, or $2.88 a share, from $1.51 billion, or $2.85, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, is lowering expenses to show investors his firm can deliver higher returns while it waits on a cyclical climb in trading and investment-banking revenue that hasn&#8217;t arrived.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank that gets most of its revenue from trading, set aside a smaller portion for staff pay in the first nine months of the year than in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation, which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, fell 5 percent to $10.4 billion in the first three quarters from a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Revenue in the same period increased 2 percent to $25.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, allocated 41 percent of revenue, down from 44 percent in the first nine months of 2012, as he seeks to boost returns. Last year, the firm cut expenses in the fourth quarter, bringing the total pay pool to 38 percent of revenue, the second-lowest figure since Goldman Sachs has been a public company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compensation expense is enough to pay each of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 32,600 employees $319,755 for the nine months. The firm set aside $11 billion in the same period of 2012, equal to an average $336,442 for each of the 32,600 people employed by Goldman Sachs at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation for corporate and investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. lender, fell 4.4 percent in the first nine months from a year earlier. The $8.69 billion represented 31 percent of revenue at the unit, which was created last year when the company combined its investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units. &lt;/p&gt;

environmental lawsuit that led to a $19 billion verdict against
Chevron Corp. in Ecuador told a judge that he came to regret
funding the case once after learning that it may be a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burford Capital LLC Chief Executive Officer Christopher Bogart told a Manhattan federal judge yesterday that his firm,
which he described as the world&#8217;s largest dedicated litigation
financing provider, supplied $4 million to the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs and later sold the share when it became &#8220;deeply
concerned about the mounting evidence of fraud and misconduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron alleges in the non-jury trial before U.S. District
Judge Lewis Kaplan that a Manhattan lawyer, Steven Donziger, and
others involved in the pollution case engaged in a
&#8220;racketeering enterprise&#8221; and won the 2011 verdict through
coercion, manufactured evidence and bribery of the Ecuadorean
judge who wrote it. The company is seeking a ruling preventing
the plaintiffs from trying to enforce the verdict in courts
around the world. Burford reached an agreement with Chevron to
provide testimony after being described in the lawsuit as a
party involved in the scheme, Bogart said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger contends he did nothing unlawful in Ecuador and
that Chevron engaged in similar tactics. Kaplan said in a ruling
last week there&#8217;s &#8220;considerable evidence&#8221; the pollution case
was &#8220;tainted by fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a portion of testimony filed with the judge, Bogart said
&#8220;we simply do not countenance in any way the kind of behavior
this court has already found has occurred&#8221; and &#8220;we never would
have invested&#8221; in the case if they were aware of the allegedly
fraudulent activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$15 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burford is a U.S. unit of Croydon, U.K.-based Burford
Capital Ltd. (BUR), which has more than $300 million in capital,
according to Bogart&#8217;s testimony. The firm negotiated with U.S.
law firm Patton Boggs LLP, which also represented plaintiffs in
the Ecuador case, to provide as much as $15 million in
financing, Bogart said. Following an initial investment of $4
million in November 2010, Burford sold its share in 2011 to
another investor and provided no further funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of January 2011, &#8220;I think we had probably
reached the point in the investment by which we would have been
happier not to have made it,&#8221; he said in court yesterday. &#8220;But
we had made it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the underlying 20-year-old environmental case, Donziger
and other lawyers for indigenous people in Ecuador&#8217;s Lago Agrio
region sought damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s alleged dumping of toxic
drilling wastes from 1964 until about 1992 that polluted about
1,500 square miles (3,885 square kilometers). The lawsuit
continued against Chevron when it acquired Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron contends that state-owned Petroecuador, a former
Texaco partner, is responsible for most of the pollution and
that the U.S. company already cleaned up its share of the site
under agreements with Ecuador in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Maximum Damage&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its February 2011 complaint, San Ramon, California-based
Chevron contended that advocates for the Ecuadoreans, guided by
Donziger,&#8220;sought to inflict maximum damage to Chevron&#8217;s
reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s what Steven Donziger was trying to do against
Chevron -- coerce a big payday against a big company until the
pain went away,&#8221; Randy Mastro, a lawyer for the oil company,
said in court Oct. 15. Donziger stands to collect as much as
$1.2 billion if the judgment is paid in full, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company alleged that the team pressured environmental
consultants and helped draft a report that inflated damages to
$27 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former expert for the plaintiffs, David Russell,
testified yesterday that he provided a $6.114 billion damages
estimate based &#8220;largely on assumptions Donziger told me to
use.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Wildly Inaccurate&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within a year of working for Donziger, I came to learn
that my cost estimate was wildly inaccurate and had no
scientific data to back it up,&#8221; he said in written testimony
submitted to the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell said he asked Donziger not to use the figure after
learning it was cited in the plaintiffs&#8217; publicity campaign and
in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Donziger ignored the request and continued to use the number,
Russell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger alleged in counterclaims that Chevron manipulated
testing at the pollution site, tried to influence Ecuador&#8217;s
government and unfairly attacked his reputation. Kaplan
dismissed Donziger&#8217;s countersuit in July, saying he didn&#8217;t
present strong enough evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp. (CVX) v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
appeals court case is In Re Naranjo, 13-00772, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil SA&#8217;s pension fund,
Latin America&#8217;s largest, will invest in U.S. and European stocks
through funds of money managers including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as it seeks to diversify holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previ, as the Rio de Janeiro-based pension fund is known,
is setting up its first vehicle to invest in large foreign
firms, Chief Investment Officer Rene Sanda said today, adding
that it will also invest through funds run by Schroders Plc and
Franklin Templeton Investments. The fund, in which Previ will
have a 25 percent stake will be managed by BB Gestao de Recursos
DTVM SA, the asset manager that is also a Banco do Brasil unit,
he said. Other Brazilian pension funds will participate in the
fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BB DTVM will invest in funds already constituted by these
four managers, it&#8217;s a feeder,&#8221; Sanda told reporters today in
Rio. The objective is &#8220;portfolio diversification, not
returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previ, which manages 164 billion reais ($75.4 billion) for
Banco do Brasil employees, has approved global investments of as
much as 340 million reais this year in foreign stocks that may
include Google Inc. (GOOG), said Antonio Luiz Benevides, executive
manager of the fund. The pension fund may also invest in fixed-income and private equity abroad in the future as it accelerates
real-estate investments in Brazil, he said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund for international stocks is expected to be set up
by mid-November, Sanda said today, declining to give an estimate
of its size until completion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s pension funds reported an average loss of 0.7
percent in the first half, according to to the Brazilian pension
fund association, known as Abrapp. Brazil&#8217;s benchmark Ibovespa
index fell 22 percent during that period while Google, based in
Mountain View, California, rallied 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NMI Holdings Inc. (NMIH), the mortgage guarantor backed by Kyle Bass, Carlyle Group LP (CG) and BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, is seeking to be the first U.S. insurer since 2009 to file an initial public offering without posting a profit, as demand climbs for housing-related investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm had sold coverage on 22 individual loans at the end of September, is working to get its computer system running and will be unprofitable at least through next year, according to the IPO filing. NMI also competes with Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), a profitable company whose investors include George Soros and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., that&#8217;s pitching its own IPO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for home-loan guarantors is climbing as the U.S. property market rebounds at the fastest pace in seven years and the government retreats from backing mortgages. Still, NMI&#8217;s IPO filing carries warnings more often found in Internet and biotechnology offerings, said Josef Schuster, founder of a firm that tracks public offerings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In financials, it&#8217;s a rare occasion that you see such unseasoned deals,&#8221; Schuster said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Oct. 8 document, Emeryville, California-based NMI described itself as a development stage corporation started in 2011. &#8220;We have a history of losses and expect to continue to report annual net losses in the near term,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;Our ability to achieve profitability, if at all, is uncertain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss authorities seized more than 1
million fake Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Xanax anti-anxiety pills at Zurich
airport, part of a wider crackdown on counterfeit medicines
posing a public-health threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four crates weighing more than 400 kilograms (880 pounds)
were intercepted while in transit from China to Egypt and
ordered to be destroyed after tests determined the pills
contained no active ingredients, Bern-based Swissmedic, the
country&#8217;s drug regulator, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments are fighting to safeguard the distribution of
legitimate drugs and crack down on counterfeit products.
Systematic checks of medical shipments are carried out every
year, and imports of bogus medicines have been declining in
Switzerland, Swissmedic said in June. Counterfeit drugs
generated an estimated $75 billion in revenue in 2010, according
to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m angry,&#8221; Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business
at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, wrote in e-mailed
comments. &#8220;When criminals counterfeit Hermes scarves, money is
stolen. When they counterfeit pills, they kill people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year more than 100,000 people around the world may die
from substandard and counterfeit medications, according to an
estimate by Amir Attaran, an associate professor at the
University of Ottawa, and Roger Bate, an economist at the
American Enterprise Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fake Xanax couldn&#8217;t be recognized as counterfeit at
first glance, said Swissmedic, whose official name is the Swiss
Agency for Therapeutic Products. The regulator said it informed
authorities abroad of the discovery, in particular in China and
Egypt. No patients in Switzerland will be affected, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss regulator said in June that it had already seized
about 90 shipments this year representing a high-potential
health risk. It also has ordered the shutdown of Internet
websites trading drugs illegally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
price forecasts for arabica coffee traded in New York by 7.7
percent, citing favorable weather and the biggest stockpiles of
the variety favored by Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beans traded on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange will be
at $1.20 a pound in three, six and 12 months, the bank said in a
report e-mailed today. That&#8217;s down from last month&#8217;s forecast
for $1.30 a pound. Arabica coffee futures fell 20 percent this
year on signs of bigger harvests in leading producer Brazil and
Colombia, the second-biggest grower of the variety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Arabica coffee prices continued to decline last month on
larger than expected Colombian production and favorable weather
for the upcoming crop in Brazil,&#8221; Damien Courvalin, an analyst
at the bank in New York, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures are heading for a third year of declines, the
longest losing streak since 1993. The commodity is the fourth
worst performer this year in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI gauge of
24 raw materials, with only gold, silver and corn down by more.
Stockpiles at the end of this season will be 30.5 million bags,
the highest since 2008-09, estimates the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee prices could rebound if there are further cuts to
production in Central America, where leaf rust disease has hit
crops, or if funds decide to close out bets on lower prices,
Goldman said. Large and small speculators excluding index funds
have been betting on lower prices since 2011, data from the U.S.
Futures Trading Commission compiled by Bloomberg showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee for December deliver was little changed at
$1.1475 a pound on ICE by 5:53 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sugar Surplus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the global sugar surplus will be smaller this season
than previously expected because of import demand from China and
Indonesia, stockpiles will rise for a fourth consecutive season,
Goldman said. Prices rallied 11 percent last month as rainfall
reduced output in Brazil&#8217;s center south, the main growing region
of the world&#8217;s leading producer, and funds started buying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view the recent rally as likely excessive given
current fundamentals, exacerbated by the covering of large net
short ICE speculative positions,&#8221; Courvalin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar prices will be at 17.50 cents a pound in three months
and 19 cents a pound in six and 12 months, the bank forecasts.
The sweetener, which fell to as low as 15.93 cents a pound in
July, was trading today at 18.96 cents a pound for March
delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cocoa Inventories &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global cocoa inventories will decline for a second year as
processing rises. Bean grinding in Europe gained 4.7 percent in
the third quarter, according to the European Cocoa Association.
In Asia, grindings rose 12 percent and in North America advanced
8.2 percent in the same period, according to the Cocoa
Association of Asia and the National Confectioners Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures will be at $2,500 a ton in three, six and 12
months, the bank said. The forecast is below current prices
because of record bullish speculators bets at a time of &#8220;high&#8221;
stocks-to-use ratio, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocoa for December delivery was down 1 percent to $2,740 a
ton in New York. The beans used to make chocolate gained 22
percent this year, this year&#8217;s best performing commodity on the
GSCI, ahead of cotton and natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has agreed to
sell 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, the tower built by David Rockefeller, to Fosun International Ltd., the investment arm of
China&#8217;s biggest closely held industrial group, for $725 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fosun, which invests in properties, pharmaceuticals and
steel, is buying the 60-story, 2.2 million square-foot, lower
Manhattan tower, according to a statement it filed to Hong
Kong&#8217;s stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s developers and companies are expanding in overseas
property markets as the government maintains curbs on housing at
home to cool prices. Greenland Holding Group Co., a Shanghai-based, state-owned developer, this month agreed to buy a 70
percent stake in a residential and commercial real estate
project in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of excess capital in China that needs a way
out at the moment,&#8221; Simon Lo, Hong Kong-based executive
director for Asia research and advisory at property broker
Colliers International, said in a phone interview today. &#8220;Also,
by investing in markets like New York, they believe they can
gain from the recovery of the U.S. economy and real estate
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fosun (656), owned by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, fell
0.3 percent to HK$6.79 at the midday trading break in Hong Kong.
Shares in the Shanghai-based company have gained 37 percent this
year, compared with the 2.6 percent increase in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former employees of Bernard L.
Madoff who are on trial on charges they aided the convicted con
man&#8217;s $17 billion Ponzi scheme were unaware of the fraud and
were duped into helping him keep it going, lawyers told a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Bonventre, 66, the operations chief who signed
checks for Madoff&#8217;s securities firm and worked with its general
ledger, was fooled by Madoff&#8217;s &#8220;depraved and pathological
lies,&#8221; and never knew about the fraud, Andrew Frisch, his
lawyer, said yesterday in his opening statement in federal court
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his guilty plea in 2009, Madoff said the market-making
and proprietary trading side of his firm was &#8220;legitimate&#8221;
while admitting he ran the scheme from the advisory business,
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annette Bongiorno, a 40-year Madoff employee who helped run
the investment advisory business, &#8220;never understood that she
was involved in a fraud,&#8221; her lawyer Roland Riopelle told the
jury yesterday in his opening statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyers were the first among the defense to present
opening statements in the trial of the five ex-employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Schwartz Oct. 16 told
jurors that the defendants created millions of false, misleading
records, and became rich in the process. The three men and two
women on trial knew Madoff&#8217;s securities firm didn&#8217;t conduct real
trades and used money from earlier investors to pay off new
ones, the U.S. alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain has said the trial
she&#8217;s overseeing may last five months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bailey Says U.K. Regulator Wants Limits on Foreign Bank Branches &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branches of foreign banks opening in the U.K. won&#8217;t be able
to take retail deposits unless they convince the regulator they
can be easily wound down in a crisis, said Andrew Bailey, the
U.K.&#8217;s top banking supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branches from banks based outside the European Union
&#8220;should stick to straightforward wholesale banking, of the type
that supports world trade and capital flows,&#8221; Bailey, the chief
executive officer of the Prudential Regulation Authority, told
an audience of banking executives in London yesterday.
&#8220;Resolution will be a key deciding factor in the PRA&#8217;s
judgments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government said this week that branches of Chinese
banks would be approved for business in London. Chancellor of
the Exchequer George Osborne said the PRA will start talks with
Chinese banks later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey, deputy governor for prudential regulation at the
Bank of England, said it is a &#8220;general policy, not a China
policy, and it is consistent with promoting the benefits of an
open world economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators around the world have encouraged banks to open
subsidiaries rather than branches since the financial crisis
because they have to comply with tougher capital and liquidity
rules. Branches are supervised by the regulator of the home
country of their parent bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Large U.K. Companies Get Up to 10 Years to Switch Auditor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. antitrust regulators gave companies more time to seek
new bids for accounting work, saying that large corporations
must retender audits every 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement will apply to companies in the FTSE 350
Index starting in the last quarter of 2014, the U.K. Competition
Commission said in a statement. The regulator also plans to
forbid clauses limiting a company&#8217;s choice of auditor to the top
four accounting firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Competition Commission repeatedly backed away from
stricter measures during a two-year inquiry focused on KPMG LLP,
Deloitte LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
In February, the U.K. regulator said it was considering forcing
companies to change auditors, before proposing guidelines to
rebid work every five years in July. The European Union is also
working on new audit rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Competition Commission&#8217;s new rules, companies
would be required to spell out when they next intend to hold a
tender process if five or more years have elapsed since the last
one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European lawmakers voted in April on measures that would
have banks, insurers and listed companies change accountants
every 14 years, with an option for national authorities to
extend this to 25 years. Michel Barnier, the EU&#8217;s financial
services chief, had proposed legislation that would have
mandated audit rotation every six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation must be adopted by the full parliament, and
approved by governments, before it can take effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.K. Banks May Face 100 Billion-Pound Capital Gap, Exane Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. lenders may face a 100 billion-pound ($161 billion)
capital shortage under a proposal by the country&#8217;s Prudential
Regulation Authority, which could force banks to postpone
dividends and depress their returns, according to Exane BNP
Paribas analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders would need to hold a fully loaded equity Tier 1
ratio of 13 percent over time should the regulator adopt its
proposal in full, the analysts, led by Jonathan Pierce, wrote in
a note to clients yesterday. Banks will probably be given time
to build up the buffer, prompting a review of their liabilities,
the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), Britain&#8217;s biggest mortgage
lender, is the only U.K. bank likely to reach the target by
2015, Exane said. While the PRA is unlikely to force other banks
to scale back their assets quickly or sell more stock to
investors, dividend payments are at risk, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRU Steel Price Audit Finds &#8216;No Major Gaps&#8217; Amid Global Scrutiny &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRU, the publisher of business information on the metals,
mining and fertilizer industries, completed a third-party audit
of its U.S. Midwest steel prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indexes, which include hot- and cold-rolled coil, hot-dipped galvanized coil and plate price are the most widely used
in the world, London-based CRU said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audit, by a &#8220;Big Four&#8221; firm, included an electronic
survey and site visits and found &#8220;no major gaps,&#8221; according to
CRU&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At a time when some price reporting agencies have been
under attack and some are still under investigation, it is
crucial that companies like CRU continue to invest in both
excellent processes and third-party assessments of our work,&#8221;
Chief Operating Officer Fraser Murdoch said, according to
closely held CRU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Banker Bonus Link With Sales Disappearing, FCA&#8217;s Wheatley Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest banks in the U.K. are moving away from a
culture of linking sales to bonuses after a series of scandals
where products were improperly sold to consumers, the head of
the markets regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Wheatley, chief executive officer of the Financial
Conduct Authority, made the remarks yesterday at a speech in
London. He described the proposal as &#8220;one of the most
significant steps forward for the U.K. banking industry since
2008.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCA has been scrutinizing how bankers are rewarded
after lenders were forced to pay billions of pounds to
compensate customers who were sold payment-protection insurance
they didn&#8217;t need. U.K. banks have set aside about 15.5 billion
pounds ($25 billion) for PPI claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allianz CEO Says New Regulation to Create Room for Acquisitions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Diekmann, chief executive officer of Allianz SE (ALV)
said tougher financial regulation will create takeover
opportunities for Europe&#8217;s biggest insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Solvency II and Basel III mean more capital, then it&#8217;s
hard for mutuals to get that,&#8221; Diekmann, 58, said in an
interview this week at Bloomberg headquarters in New York,
referring to mutuals&#8217; customer-owned structure, which makes it
more difficult for them to raise funds. That&#8217;s why they may need
to find a buyer should they require a larger capital buffer
under Solvency II, the new risk-based rules for the industry
scheduled to be implemented in 2016, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a situation in most countries where you have
listed companies and mutual companies and there is a little bit
of an unequal playing field,&#8221; Diekmann said. &#8220;That gets
resolved through regulation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allianz, based in Munich, acquired Turkish insurer Yapi
Kredi Sigorta AS (YKSGR) in March for 684 million euros ($932 million),
displacing France&#8217;s Axa SA (CS) as Turkey&#8217;s largest insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solvency II, intended to harmonize the way insurers in
Europe allocate capital against the risks they take, was
originally scheduled to come into force in 2012. It has been
delayed several times over and may now be implemented on Jan. 1,
2016 with a transitional period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimon Said to Have Given Up Role at Bank Unit on OCC Request &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
stepped down as chairman of the bank&#8217;s main operating subsidiary
in July because of a recommendation by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency asked for the change as part of an effort to
improve corporate governance at the company, said one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because discussions were
confidential. The move wasn&#8217;t punitive, that person said. Robert
Garsson, an OCC spokesman, declined to comment on the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon stepped down as chairman of the subsidiary July 1, a
person with direct knowledge of the move said on Oct. 3. When
asked about the situation during a conference call with
reporters last week, the CEO referred to talks with government
supervisors without specifying whether any request was made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in constant dialogue with our regulators regarding
how to strengthen our governance and controls,&#8221; he said on the
Oct. 11 call to discuss the bank&#8217;s earnings. &#8220;We thought this
board change we made was consistent with our regulators&#8217; views
and governance for a banking subsidiary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move didn&#8217;t affect Dimon&#8217;s titles as chairman and CEO
of the parent company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said J. Michael Evans, a vice chairman who ran emerging markets and was
seen as a potential successor to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, is retiring after more than 20 years at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans, 56, will step down at the end of the year and become
a senior director, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans ran businesses including the securities division,
equity trading and equity-capital markets in a career that
featured positions in New York, London and Hong Kong. In 2011,
he was named to lead the emerging-markets units as part of
Blankfein&#8217;s push to be &#8220;Goldman Sachs in more places.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Michael&#8217;s deep commitment to the firm, his unrelenting
focus on our clients and his broad global market knowledge have
left an extraordinary mark at Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Blankfein, 59,
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans, one of four vice chairmen among the bank&#8217;s executive
officers, led with E. Gerald Corrigan the business-standards
committee, a group set up in 2010 to review policies and
practices after Goldman Sachs was sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for misleading investors on a 2007 sale of a
mortgage-linked investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that appointment, Evans was seen as a potential
successor to Blankfein along with President Gary Cohn, the
Financial Times wrote in 2010. Goldman Sachs paid Cohn 12
percent more than Evans&#8217;s $17 million for 2012, the first time
since the financial crisis that Blankfein&#8217;s deputies were given
differing compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein told Bloomberg Television earlier this year that
he had no plans to leave after seven years in the top job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The combination of this being who I am and what I do and
having absolutely no other interests makes me think this is what
I&#8217;ll be doing for a while,&#8221; Blankfein said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans, a Canadian, graduated from Princeton University in
1981. He won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1984, the same
year he earned a master&#8217;s degree from Oxford University. Evans
was named a partner in 1994, a year after he joined Goldman
Sachs from Salomon Brothers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans owns about $230 million of Goldman Sachs stock,
according to an April filing, which counts vested options, stock
awards and family trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, he became co-head of the equities business and
rose to co-head of the firm&#8217;s securities division, which
includes all trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conflicts, Transparency &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans was named chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific in
2004, moving to Hong Kong, where he helped develop the bank&#8217;s
business in China and its relationship with Industrial 
Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398) The firm sold its remaining stake
in ICBC this year after posting more than $3.4 billion of gains
from the investment. Evans was named a vice chairman in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business-standards committee produced a report in
January 2011 that laid out 39 recommendations to improve
practices in areas such as conflicts of interest and
transparency. In May of this year, the firm released a report
about the actions it took in implementing the recommendations
and the impact they had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We spent more than 100,000 hours training our people not
only on the things that had changed, but teaching them how these
changes were going to be implemented and driven down through the
organization,&#8221; Evans said in an interview in May. The efforts
were aimed at &#8220;making sure they stick and that they&#8217;re embraced
by the totality of our population.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, a former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) executive in Europe, will appeal findings by the
U.K. markets watchdog that criticizes his actions after losses
caused by Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macris was &#8220;deprived of the opportunity of responding&#8221; to
the Financial Conduct Authority, a spokesman for his lawyers at
Clifford Chance LLP said in an e-mailed statement today. Macris,
who led the international Chief Investment Office, said the
findings from September were &#8220;made in error&#8221; and he will
challenge them in a U.K. tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCA&#8217;s &#8220;assertions fail to take proper account of the
actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings with the
Authority at the relevant time,&#8221; the spokesman, Michael
Osborne, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of the New York-based bank, characterized the $6.2 billion loss last year as
&#8220;the stupidest and most embarrassing situation I have ever been
a part of.&#8221; The bad bets led to an earnings restatement, a U.S.
Senate subcommittee hearing and $920 million in penalties from
regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the FCA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2012, JPMorgan said it would restate its first-quarter net revenue by $660 million because it wasn&#8217;t confident
that the valuations of the bank&#8217;s derivatives trades were
accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Deliberately Misled&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;conduct of CIO London management deliberately misled
the authority about the situation&#8221; according to the FCA&#8217;s
notice on the fine, which is published on the agency&#8217;s website.
Macris wasn&#8217;t mentioned by name in the FCA&#8217;s findings following
its investigation into Iksil, who was known as the London Whale
because the size of his bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lara Joseph, a spokeswoman for the FCA, declined to
immediately comment. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment on Macris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s former boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, and junior
trader Julien Grout were indicted in the U.S. in September on
five charges each, including securities fraud and conspiracy,
for allegedly seeking to hide losses as they began to mount.
Prosecutors have said Iksil, who wasn&#8217;t charged, is cooperating
with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo and Grout are not in the U.S. and haven&#8217;t
returned to face the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) tentative agreement to pay a record $13 billion to end civil claims over its sales of mortgage bonds, a deal that won&#8217;t absolve the bank of potential criminal liability, hasn&#8217;t shaken some investors&#8217; faith in Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Home Depot Inc. founder Ken Langone said he sees the accord as a buying opportunity. The pact with the U.S. Justice Department would resolve claims that the bank, Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc. misleadingly packaged and sold mortgage-backed securities. JPMorgan, which acquired both lenders at the government&#8217;s urging in 2008, fell 10 cents to $54.20 at 12:28 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The brunt of this misbehavior occurred before Jamie or JPMorgan had anything to do with these two companies,&#8221; Langone, 78, said yesterday in a telephone interview. &#8220;I&#8217;m very, very comfortable as an investor in JPMorgan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, personally negotiated the terms in a call with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder after markets closed Oct. 18. The government&#8217;s mounting demand for payments tied to Bear Stearns and WaMu had frustrated the CEO&#8217;s push to end probes this year, driving legal reserves to $23 billion and causing the New York-based bank&#8217;s first quarterly loss under his watch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns that Dubai&#8217;s property
market is a bubble are exaggerated as new regulations focused on
curbing speculation and an increasing supply helps keep values
down, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property prices are 36 percent below their 2008 peak even
after rising by about a third from a low in the second quarter
of 2011, analysts including Eyad Faraj, Matija Gergolet and
Harsh Mehta wrote in a report published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai home values climbed at the fastest pace in the world
in the second quarter, a survey by broker Knight Frank LLP
showed, stoking concern that the market may be overheating. The
increases will slow down over the next 12 months after the
return of speculators sparked &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; gains, Jones
Lang LaSalle Inc. said in an Oct. 3 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge prompted the sheikhdom&#8217;s Land Department to
double property registration fees to 4 percent starting Oct. 6.
The real estate regulator is requiring developers to set aside a
portion of a project&#8217;s costs to limit the effect of advance
sales in financing construction. Restrictions on mortgage
lending, expected from the United Arab Emirates central bank
this year, will also help cool the market, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Stability &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai&#8217;s relative political stability and high rental yields
of 5 percent to 6 percent will maintain its attractiveness to
investors, according to Goldman. That compares with global
yields of 2 percent to 3 percent, the analysts wrote. Last year,
approximately 34 percent of Dubai&#8217;s property investors were from
South Asia, followed by 15 percent from Arab countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In neighboring Abu Dhabi, residential prices have
stabilized and rents are increasing in the best areas, helped by
the relocation of around 10,000 state employees from Dubai in
the past eight months, the analysts estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi&#8217;s government in Sept. 2012 required all its
employees and those of state-related companies to live in the
capital to receive housing allowances. The law sparked the
relocation of workers who for years had commuted from Dubai
where they enjoyed lower rents and better infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR) had its rating raised two levels to
BB at Standard  Poor&#8217;s with a stable outlook, the ratings
company said in a statement today. The rating is two levels
below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldar, Abu Dhabi&#8217;s largest developer, is taking a more
cautious approach to new projects, aims to increase sources of
recurring income and is reducing its debt, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co., Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and TPG Capital, the firms that led the $48 billion buyout of Energy Future Holdings Corp. in 2007, are fighting to receive barely 3 percent of their initial investment when the power generator files for bankruptcy as soon as this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Negotiations with senior creditors including Leon Black&#8217;s Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) and Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC, which are poised to seize control of the former TXU Corp., are at a crucial juncture today when agreements that allow them to view nonpublic information to foster talks expire. A proposal disclosed last week that wasn&#8217;t accepted would have given the company&#8217;s owners as little as $270 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KKR, Goldman and TPG took Dallas-based Energy Future private in the largest leveraged buyout in history, an investment that was predicated on rising gas prices. Instead, they fell as the development of hydraulic fracturing created a surge in U.S. gas supplies, triggering 10 straight quarterly losses at the company since 2011 and leading Warren Buffett to say his $2 billion investment in Energy Future bonds was &#8220;a big mistake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see bigger potential for value leakage if this bankruptcy restructuring turns highly contentious, highly litigious and disorganized,&#8221; Jim Hempstead, an analyst at bond-rating company Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in New York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is preparing to
pay $13 billion to end U.S. civil probes of its mortgage-bond
sales, an amount that ranks among the largest settlements by a
single company and dwarfs fines previously imposed by the
Justice Department. Past accords include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- The $246 billion settlement by the biggest U.S. tobacco
companies in 1998 to resolve state government claims for the
costs of treating sick smokers. Philip Morris Cos. and R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. were among firms that reached
agreement with 50 state attorneys general to pay out the money
over 25 years, scale back marketing and take steps to reduce
youth smoking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Pledges by Wall Street firms including UBS AG and Citigroup
Inc. to repurchase more than $50 billion of auction-rate
securities to settle state and federal complaints. Firms
allegedly touted the instruments as safe, cash-like investments
before the $330 billion market froze in February 2008, stranding
investors who could no longer sell their holdings. The accords
returned more than $67 billion to investors, the Securities and
Exchange Commission has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- The $25 billion in payments and relief for troubled borrowers
that five U.S. lenders -- JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp.,
Citigroup, Wells Fargo  Co. and Ally Financial Inc. -- pledged
to resolve probes into mishandled foreclosures as part of a
February 2012 deal with federal regulators and state attorneys
general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- BP Plc&#8217;s $4.53 billion in settlements last year with the
Justice Department and SEC, including a $1.26 billion criminal
fine, relating to the April 2010 Macondo well blowout and
explosion in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 workers and set
off the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, BP promised President Barack Obama it would set up
a $20 billion trust fund for claims and costs. The company has
so far spent at least $26 billion on the cleanup, reimbursements
and other payments, and booked more than $42 billion in pretax
charges related to the spill, according to statements on its
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- GlaxoSmithKline Plc&#8217;s $3 billion to resolve criminal and
civil allegations that it illegally promoted prescription drugs
and failed to report safety data. The July 2012 settlement, the
largest ever in a health-care fraud case in the U.S., included a
$956.8 million criminal fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s $2.3 billion settlement in 2009, which included
a $1.2 billion criminal fine, for illegally marketing the anti-inflammatory drug Bextra for uses that the Food and Drug
Administration specifically had declined to approve because of
safety concerns. The criminal fine was the largest ever imposed
in the U.S. for any matter, then-Associate Attorney General Tom
Perrelli said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- HSBC Holdings Plc&#8217;s $1.9 billion deal to resolve charges it
enabled Latin American drug cartels to launder billions of
dollars. The bank, Europe&#8217;s largest by market value, agreed to
pay a $1.25 billion forfeiture and $665 million in civil
penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- UBS $1.2 billion in fines from the Justice Department and
Commodity Futures Trading Commission for trying to rig the
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more
than $300 trillion of financial products worldwide. The bank
also agreed to pay 160 million pounds ($259 million) to the U.K.
Financial Services Authority, the largest fine imposed by the
regulator, and disgorge 59 million francs ($65.3 million) in
estimated profits to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory
Authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profits aren&#8217;t the only thing
lacking at Twitter Inc. (TWTR) ahead of its planned initial public
offering. It&#8217;s got a dearth of patents, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microblogging service said in its prospectus last week
that it has nine issued U.S. patents. That compares with 774
cited by Facebook Inc. before its initial public offering in May
2012 and International Business Machines Corp.&#8217;s 6,478 patents
accrued last year alone. Twitter&#8217;s smaller patent trove reflects
its philosophy of letting engineers and designers own their
inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that policy is meant to limit patent litigation, some
investors and analysts are concerned it could backfire. Evidence
shows that intellectual property can help companies raise more
funds in their offerings, as patents enable investors to
quantify the value of technological breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lack of a large number of issued patents is a little
concerning,&#8221; Maulin Shah, managing director at Envision IP LLC,
an advisory and research firm in New York, said by phone. &#8220;If
Twitter does deal with patent-infringement lawsuits, they don&#8217;t
have too many patents to lean on to countersue. That does put
Twitter at a disadvantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter said in its prospectus that many competitors have
&#8220;substantially larger patent&#8221; portfolios, which could make it
a target for litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Twitter has said that too many patents
may hinder innovation. In May, the San Francisco-based company
implemented the Innovator&#8217;s Patent Agreement, or IPA, to keep
ownership of inventions in the hands of the people who created
them. As part of the policy, Twitter can&#8217;t pursue offensive
litigation without the inventor&#8217;s permission. The IPA ensures
that the patents &#8220;will be used only as a shield rather than as
a weapon,&#8221; according to Twitter&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPA will help the company lure and retain more talented
engineers, said Robert Clarkson, a partner in the capital
markets practice at law firm Jones Day. More than 5,000 patent
actions were filed last year, the most ever recorded, according
to a 2013 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy&#8217;s biggest risk is that employees will take their
inventions with them, posing a competitive threat if they leave,
according to Jeff Sica, president and chief investment officer
of Sica Wealth Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swiss Seize 1 Million Bogus Pfizer Xanax Pills in Zurich &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss authorities seized more than 1 million fake Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) Xanax anti-anxiety pills at Zurich airport, part of a wider
crackdown on counterfeit medicines posing a public-health
threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four crates weighing more than 400 kilograms (880 pounds)
were intercepted while in transit from China to Egypt and
ordered to be destroyed after tests determined the pills
contained no active ingredients, Bern-based Swissmedic, the
country&#8217;s drug regulator, said in a statement Oct. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments are fighting to safeguard the distribution of
legitimate drugs and crack down on counterfeit products.
Systematic checks of medical shipments are carried out every
year, and imports of bogus medicines have been declining in
Switzerland, Swissmedic said in June. Counterfeit drugs
generated an estimated $75 billion in revenue in 2010, according
to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m angry,&#8221; Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business
at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, wrote in an e-mail.
&#8220;When criminals counterfeit Hermes scarves, money is stolen.
When they counterfeit pills, they kill people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon specializes in technology commercialization,
including the pharmaceutical industry and intellectual property
licensing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year more than 100,000 people around the world may die
from substandard and counterfeit medications, according to an
estimate by Amir Attaran, an associate professor at the
University of Ottawa, and Roger Bate, an economist at the
American Enterprise Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fake Xanax couldn&#8217;t be recognized as counterfeit at
first glance, said Swissmedic, whose official name is the Swiss
Agency for Therapeutic Products. The regulator said it informed
authorities abroad of the discovery, in particular in China and
Egypt. No patients in Switzerland will be affected, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss regulator said in June that it had already seized

&lt;p&gt;Prada Sues Maker of &#8216;Designer-Inspired&#8217; Perfumes Over Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prada SpA (PRDSY), the luxury fashion house, sued a New York
perfume company for trademark infringement over a line of
&#8220;designer inspired&#8221; fragrances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred Fragrance Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;Party Candy&#8221; has similar
packaging and a name and is intended to convey a connection with
the &#8220;Prada Candy&#8221; line, according to a complaint filed Oct. 18
in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred Fragrance describes itself on its website as
&#8220;the leading distributor of designer-inspired perfumes.&#8221; The
company said it creates scents that &#8220;combine the same premium
quality of a designer fragrance with affordable pricing and mass
availability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has also been sued for trademark infringement
by Elizabeth Arden Inc., Estee Lauder Inc. and Summit
Entertainment Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Prada Candy&#8221; line, which was introduced in August
2011, is &#8220;an elegant mix of white musks combined with a sensual
balsamic vanilliac accord of benzoin and sweet caramel,&#8221;
according to Prada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Prada has sold &#8220;tens of
millions of dollars&#8221; worth of the product in the two years it
has been on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prada is seeking court orders barring the use of &#8220;Party
Candy&#8221; as a trade name, the registration of the name as a U.S.
trademark and sales of &#8220;Party Candy&#8221; products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prada also asked for money damages, Preferred Fragrance&#8217;s
profits attributable to the alleged infringement, attorney fees
and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred Fragrance didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mailed request
for comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Prada v. Preferred Fragrance Inc., 13-cv-07371,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;University of Illinois Settles Mascot Dispute, AP Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Illinois and a group that honors the
school&#8217;s former mascot settled a dispute over the use of the
mascot&#8217;s name and official logo, the Associated Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school dropped the mascot -- Chief Illiniwek -- in 2007
under pressure from the National Collegiate Athletic Association
to quit using a symbol some considered a demeaning portrayal of
American Indian culture, according to the AP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement bars the Honor the Chief Society from using
Chief Illiniwek and his image, and the group must post a
disclaimer on its website and promotional materials disavowing a
connection to the university, the AP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group can hold events with a performance in the nature
of &#8220;a choreographed tribe to the dance&#8221; that was performed by
the mascot at school athletic events, the AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Dotcom&#8217;s Mega Site Not Used by Pirates, CEO Tells Conference &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mega cloud storage system started in January by Kim
Dotcom, who is accused of criminal copyright infringement, is
mainly being used by professionals rather than pirates, Chief
Executive Officer Vikram Kumar told London&#8217;s conference on
copyright and technology, the Guardian newspaper reported last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar said that accountants, lawyers, financial advisers
and architects are willing to pay to use Mega because of the
company&#8217;s end-to-end encryption technology, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that very few -- around 100 per day -- of the
service&#8217;s 5 million customers are receiving takedown notices
under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Guardian
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar said that the number is very small for any online
service provider and that the company is working against
external search engines that claim to be able to index files
stored on the service, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will open a
local broker-dealer in Mexico early next year as part of its
expansion in Latin America, said Stephen Scherr, the firm&#8217;s
chief for the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move will allow Goldman Sachs to trade in peso-denominated securities, Scherr said today in a broadcast on the
firm&#8217;s website. The New York-based investment bank won
authorization for a Mexican brokerage unit last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a very bullish view on Mexico,&#8221; said Scherr, 49,
who is also global head of the company&#8217;s financing group. &#8220;We
have a very strong presence in Mexico City, and in fact, by the
early part of next year, we&#8217;ll have a local broker-dealer in the
country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
opened a local office in Santiago, Chile, earlier this year.
Foreign companies with Mexican brokerages include Morgan Stanley (MS)
and Credit Suisse Group AG, according to the Mexican Association
of Brokerages. Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s Banamex unit also owns a major
brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reforms planned by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto,
who was elected last year, and efforts to develop the country&#8217;s
capital markets will probably attract investors, Scherr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anytime a market can become larger, deeper, more liquid,
like what the Mexicans are doing, it is inevitably to the
benefit of the economy, because I think the market will
demonstrate greater price rationality, and will attract more and
more investors to that market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is why we&#8217;re
going there in bigger size.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri and Andy Fixmer" date="Oct 22, 2013  4:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-22/disney-reaches-record-high-as-media-stocks-gain-on-program-fees.html"><headline>Disney Reaches Record as Media Stocks Gain on Program Fees</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) rose the most in
almost two weeks, reaching an all-time high as investors bet
rising fees from pay-television services will extend gains for
media stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company gained
2.1 percent to $69 at the close in New York, eclipsing the May
15 all-time closing high of $67.67. The stock is up 39 percent
for the year, compared with 23 percent for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index (SPX), which closed at a record 1,754.67 today, and 38
percent for the SP 500 Media Index of 16 stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertainment companies including Disney, Viacom Inc. (VIAB) and
CBS Corp. (CBS) are benefiting from the increasing fees they are able
to charge pay-television services for their broadcast and cable
shows. Analysts project shares of Disney, the owner of theme
parks, TV networks and film studios, will reach $72.46 within 12
months, the average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. CBS
and 21st Century Fox Inc. also made new highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s profit is forecast to increase 9 percent to $1.36
billion, or 75 cents a share, in the just-ended fourth quarter,
the average of 19 analysts&#8217; estimates. The company, based in
Burbank, California, reports results after markets close on Nov.
7. Of 34 analysts who rate the stock, 21 recommend buying, while
11 say hold and one says sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit growth stalled at $1.85 billion, or $1.01 a share,
in the third quarter ended June 29, crimped by costs to market
the July film &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; higher TV programming
expenses and lower ratings at the ABC network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said last month that it may double its stock
purchases to $8 billion next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cash Flow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the buyback cost will exceed discretionary cash flow,
Standard  Poor&#8217;s said in a Sept. 12 report that the company
will be able to maintain its A corporate credit rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney remains the preeminent company for monetizing
intellectual property across a breadth of businesses,&#8221; Naveen Sarma, a credit analyst at SP, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyback comes as capital spending shrinks from a peak
of $3.78 billion in fiscal 2012. In recent years, Disney has
expanded parks in California and Florida, built cruise ships and
developed a resort in Hawaii. A new destination in Shanghai is
scheduled to open at the end of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on projects and acquisitions will continue, Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said in September, citing as
examples Marvel, Lucasfilm and purchases in games and
international TV networks. The company is interested in deals
that increase its distribution capability, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon went to Washington almost a month ago to see if U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder would settle a criminal probe of mortgage fraud at the bank if it paid more money to resolve related civil investigations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holder&#8217;s team, which included Deputy Attorney General James Cole and Associate Attorney General Tony West, said ending the investigation by the U.S. attorney in Sacramento would require the bank to plead guilty to something, according to a person familiar with the talks, which were held in a conference room that was Robert F. Kennedy&#8217;s office when he had Holder&#8217;s job. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, the department proposed the bank plead guilty to making false statements related to sales of toxic mortgage bonds. The bank proposed a nonprosecution agreement, which Holder rejected, the person said. The bank agreed to assist the continuing criminal probe. The negotiation typifies the harder line the Obama administration is taking in its second term. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holder, 62, in an interview with Bloomberg News about the department&#8217;s new aggressiveness on bank probes, said: &#8220;It was clearly a priority for the president, it was a priority for me and for this Justice Department. One look at the magnitude of harm and the number of people suffering as a result of these acts that we&#8217;re looking into made sense to me that my personal involvement was needed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) must
advance computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov the legal fees he
needs to fight New York state charges that he stole confidential
source code from the company, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs at this time doesn&#8217;t have to pay the fees
Aleynikov incurred defending federal charges that led to his
conviction and imprisonment before the verdict was overturned,
said U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty in Newark, New Jersey. He
said the two sides must engage in a pretrial exchange of
evidence on that question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Immediate advancement of fees is required, subject only
to an unsecured undertaking to repay them if the applicant is
unsuccessful in the underlying litigation,&#8221; McNulty said in an
opinion made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted in federal court in Manhattan in
2010 of stealing hundreds of thousands of lines of code and
sentenced to 97 months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was ordered freed in February 2012 when the U.S. Court
of Appeals in New York reversed his conviction. In August of
that year, he was arraigned in Manhattan on state charges of
unlawful use of scientific material and duplication of computer-related material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vice President &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which employed Aleynikov from May 2007
through June 2009, argued that it didn&#8217;t have to pay Aleynikov&#8217;s
fees in his state prosecution because he wasn&#8217;t an officer of
the company, even though he was a vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McNulty disagreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may be the case that Goldman (or the industry of which
it is a part) has been profligate in conferring the title of
vice president,&#8221; the judge wrote. &#8220;If so, Goldman must bear
the consequences of that profligacy. Goldman might easily have
chosen to be more sparing with job titles, or to confer them in
some other way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov&#8217;s attorney Kevin Marino said he will proceed with
evidence exchanges on the question of whether Goldman Sachs must
indemnify his client for the federal case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs used its considerable power and influence
to procure Mr. Aleynikov&#8217;s prosecution for crimes he did not
commit,&#8221; Marino said in an interview. &#8220;It is only fitting that
Goldman should now be forced to bear the cost of his restoring
his reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 12-cv-05994, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Phil Mattingly and Dawn Kopecki" date="Oct 22, 2013  2:24 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-22/jpmorgan-settlement-said-to-include-money-for-investors.html"><headline>JPMorgan Settlement Said to Include Money for Investors</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s tentative $13
billion settlement will include about $3 billion for states and
federal regulators, much of which may be passed on to investors
who bought faulty mortgage-backed securities, according to two
people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement will also cover a $2 billion penalty against
the bank, $4 billion for the Federal Housing Finance Agency,
which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and about $4 billion
to help homeowners in hard-hit metropolitan areas, according to
the people, who asked not to be identified because the accord
hasn&#8217;t been finalized and negotiations aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
settle multiple civil claims that the company misrepresented the
quality of mortgage-bonds that were packaged and sold at the
height of the U.S. housing boom by JPMorgan as well as by Bear
Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc., both of which were
acquired by the New York-based bank in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the settlement will help compensate investors who
bought securities from all three entities, the bank won&#8217;t pay
fines for misdeeds committed by Bear Stearns and Washington
Mutual, the people said. The accord wouldn&#8217;t release JPMorgan or
its executives from possible criminal liability, a person
familiar with the settlement&#8217;s terms said on Oct. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is still working
out final details of the record settlement with the U.S.
Department of Justice, including a statement of facts, the
people said. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New
York, didn&#8217;t reply to calls and e-mails seeking comment. Adora
Andy Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New York &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pieces might not be concluded by the time a deal is
announced, they said. Both sides are still working out the
details of how to disburse the relief to homeowners and
investors, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $3 billion portion will be split between California
Attorney General Kamala Harris, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., National
Credit Union Administration and possibly another state, the
people said. New York state will receive about $500 million and
will probably use it to reimburse investors, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported the
breakdown of the settlement earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) fell the most in a
month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Perry Capital LLC sold
7 million shares in the residential landlord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG dropped 3 percent to 42.28 euros, the biggest decline
since Sept. 23. Goldman&#8217;s Whitehall Street Real Estate money
manager and Perry Capital, which took LEG public in February,
raised 289 million euros selling the shares to institutional
investors for 41.25 euros each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG, Germany&#8217;s second-largest property company by market
value, had the biggest initial public offering of a German real
estate company. Goldman raised 1.3 billion euros in the deal,
which left Whitehall with 41 percent of the shares and Perry
with a 9 percent stake. During the IPO, 30.5 million shares were
sold at 44 euros each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares have dropped about 3.9 percent since the IPO,
while the EPRA/FTSE Nareit Index of German property stocks has
declined by 2.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG, based in Dusseldorf, owns about 91,000 apartments in
North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany&#8217;s most populous state. The stock
sale today was managed by Goldman and represents about 13.2
percent of the company&#8217;s share capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said Bill Gates&#8217;s focus on philanthropy makes it impossible that the Microsoft Corp. co-founder will return to the company as chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The chances of that are zero,&#8221; Buffett told Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Betty Liu in an interview today. &#8220;He is doing exactly what he wants to do in life, and he&#8217;s doing it well and it takes his full-time energy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is searching for a new CEO after Steve Ballmer said he would step down from the world&#8217;s largest software maker. Gates, 57, is chairman of Microsoft and serves on the board of Berkshire. In 2006, Buffett committed a majority of his wealth to the foundation run by Gates and his wife, Melinda. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates is &#8220;flying around the world a very significant percentage of the time, and he is engaging governments in his efforts,&#8221; said Buffett, 83. &#8220;He has got more than a full-time job at the Gates Foundation, and obviously cares about Microsoft, but he&#8217;s not going back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett appeared today alongside his son and grandson, both named Howard, to promote a new book, &#8220;40 Chances: Finding Hope in a Hungry World.&#8221; The text describes lessons the billionaire&#8217;s son learned from his years working to improve food security around the world. The elder Buffett has also given funds to foundations overseen by his three children. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Jones" date="Oct 22, 2013  8:50 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-22/blackstone-gic-buy-stake-in-goldman-s-european-insurer.html"><headline>Blackstone, GIC Buy Stake in Goldman''s European Insurer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP and GIC Pte,
Singapore&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, agreed to buy a majority
stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s European insurance business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world&#8217;s biggest private-equity firm, and
GIC will each buy 28.5 percent of the shares in Rothesay Life
Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner Addy Loudiadis, Goldman Sachs said in a statement today.
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. will also buy 7 percent,
and Goldman will retain 36 percent. The price wasn&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is more capital efficient for Goldman Sachs to share
its ownership with other investors,&#8221; said Michael Sherwood,
vice chairman of New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in the
statement. &#8220;Rothesay Life can continue its growth as a
standalone business with the benefit of diversified ownership.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures about 12 billion pounds ($19.4 billion) of
insurance contracts for companies including IAG SA&#8217;s British
Airways and General Motors Co. (GM)&#8217;s U.K. division. Firms such as
Rothesay promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a
certain age and use derivatives to hedge the risk. The insurer
typically receives a portion of the pension plan&#8217;s assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in August that it planned to sell a
majority stake in Rothesay, which has about $9.66 billion in
assets, in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent
capital rules. The bank has already sold about 80 percent of
Global Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in
Bermuda, to institutions and high-net-worth clients this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Strong Pipeline&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loudiadis said in the statement that diversifying
Rothesay&#8217;s shareholder base was the next stage in the company&#8217;s
strategy, adding that the insurer will continue to work on a
&#8220;strong pipeline&#8221; of opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chad Pike, Blackstone (BX)&#8217;s head of tactical opportunities in
Europe, said in the statement that Rothesay was &#8220;well placed&#8221;
to benefit from the growth potential in the U.K. pension
insurance market as interest rates climb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tay Lim Hock, president of GIC&#8217;s Special Investment. said
the fund sees &#8220;long-term potential&#8221; of the expanding market
for Rothesay&#8217;s pension-insurance business. GIC is the world&#8217;s
eighth-biggest state fund with an estimated $248 billion of
assets under management, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund
Institute&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass. Mutual, which invested 100 million pounds in
subordinated debt in Rothesay earlier this year, said demand for
risk management from U.K. defined-benefit pension plans offered
significant growth opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory and
antitrust approvals, which includes the U.K.&#8217;s Prudential
Regulation Authority, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

introduction since agreeing to sell its handset business to
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), showed a tablet and smartphones that give a
glimpse of how the merged businesses will try to revive demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 2520, Nokia&#8217;s first tablet, runs Microsoft&#8217;s
Windows RT 8.1 software and has a 10.1-inch display. It costs
$499 before taxes and carrier subsidies and will start selling
this quarter, initially in the U.K., Finland and the U.S. by
carriers including ATT Inc. (T) Nokia also showed two smartphones
with six-inch screens, a category often dubbed phablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The products expand the Windows mobile-device lineup and
signal the type of features that Microsoft will bet on in its
hardware push after its first products failed to win over users.
Its $7.2 billion deal for Espoo, Finland-based Nokia&#8217;s devices
unit, set to be completed next quarter, are part of the
company&#8217;s plan to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics
Co.&#8217;s dominance of the tablet and smartphone markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We talk a lot about Lumia and Nokia and Microsoft talks
about Microsoft and Windows Phone. As we market our products you
get a cacophony of different brands,&#8221; Stephen Elop, head of the

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which took
LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) public in February, raised 289 million euros
($395 million) by selling 7 million shares of the German
landlord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares, owned by Goldman&#8217;s Whitehall Street Real Estate
and co-investor Perry Capital, were priced at 41.25 euros each,
Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. The stake represents
about 13 percent of LEG&#8217;s share capital, according to the
statement. Goldman managed the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG, Germany&#8217;s second-largest property company by market
value, was sold in the biggest initial public offering of a
German real estate company. Goldman raised 1.3 billion euros in
the deal, which left Whitehall with 41 percent of the shares and
Perry with 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG fell as much as 5.2 percent in Frankfurt trading. There
shares were down 4.6 percent to 41.56 euros at 11:27 a.m.
They&#8217;ve have dropped about 5.6 percent since the IPO, while the
EPRA/FTSE Nareit Index of German property stocks has slid 1.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the IPO, 30.5 million shares were sold at 44 euros
each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG, based in Dusseldorf, owns about 91,000 apartments in
North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany&#8217;s most populous state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., which took
LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) public in February, may raise as much as 294
million euros ($402 million) by selling 7 million shares of the
German landlord, a person with knowledge of the transaction said
yesterday. LEG fell as much as 5.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman offered the shares at 41 euros to 42 euros each,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn&#8217;t public. The shares were owned by Whitehall
Street Real Estate, a Goldman Sachs money manager, and Perry
Capital. Goldman is also managing the share sale, the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) hired Liam Pepper from JPMorgan Chase  Co. to lead the agriculture sales
team as the bank is expanding its commodity business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore-based Pepper started this month and reports to
Tim Wilson, who oversees global commodities sales, the bank said
today in a statement. Pepper was with JPMorgan since 2009 where
he marketed agricultural derivatives and commodity-related
financing in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered also hired Wilson from JPMorgan last
year. Pepper worked at National Australia Bank Ltd. before
joining JPMorgan, according to Standard Chartered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve may not taper
its stimulus efforts soon as the U.S. economy has failed to pick
up and inflation remains low, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary D. Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you look at where we are economically, versus where we
were a year ago, we&#8217;re virtually in the exact same place,&#8221;
Cohn, 53, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with
Stephanie Ruhle. &#8220;So if quantitative easing made sense a year
ago, it probably still makes sense today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed decided in September not to taper its $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases designed to help stimulate the U.S.
economy. The decision&#8217;s announcement sent the yield on 10-year
Treasury bonds down the most in almost a year. Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Oct. 21 that this
month&#8217;s government shutdown amid congressional budget
disagreement will probably further delay tapering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline in the U.S. jobless rate to 7.2 percent in
September occurred as people gave up looking for work, not by
creation of &#8220;real jobs,&#8221; Cohn said. Janet Yellen, President
Barack Obama&#8217;s nominee to be the next Fed chairman, understands
the competing objectives the central bank faces, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re in a position where they know they can&#8217;t
quantitatively ease forever, they know they&#8217;re building a bigger
and bigger balance sheet, but their No. 1 objective is to try
and grow the U.S. economy,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;I do believe
eventually they will taper. Eventually can be a very long
time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised $226
million selling stock in TCS Group Holding Plc (TCS)&#8217;s initial public
offering yesterday, cashing out almost two-thirds of its stake
in the Russian consumer lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank, through its ELQ Investors II unit,
sold 12.9 million of its 21 million shares, reducing its stake
from 12 percent to 4.5 percent. A spokesman for the New York-based company declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is vying to compete with Russia&#8217;s leading
foreign investment banks such as Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup
Inc. by using the more than $1 billion it invested in private
equity since 2007 as leverage to win deals and woo the Kremlin
for roles in asset sales. Goldman Sachs bought stakes in Russian
companies on condition that it gets equity and debt mandates
later, a person familiar with the deals said in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing sinister here,&#8221; Jason Hurwitz, senior
banking analyst at Alfa Bank, said today in a phone interview.
&#8220;It is not the first time Goldman Sachs has shown greater
foresight than other investment banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCS priced the IPO at $17.50 a global depositary receipt,
valuing the firm at $3.2 billion. The GDRs fell 0.8 percent to
$18.15 today in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and other investment banks managing the sale
may benefit from selling as much as $163 million in additional
shares, TCS said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Branchless Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCS, founded as Tinkoff Credit Systems in 2007 by serial
entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov, has issued more than 2 million cards
in Russia and now ranks fifth in lending, according to the
company. The branchless bank is modeled on McLean, Virginia-based Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which pioneered the
distribution of credit cards through direct mail, which Tinkov
said he learned about firsthand while living in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinkov has created and sold businesses including a retail
electronics chain, frozen-food producer brewery and restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired its initial 10 percent holding in
Tinkoff in October 2007, according to a prospectus. In 2008,
Swedish fund Vostok Nafta Investment Ltd. became a shareholder,
and Baring Vostok, Russia&#8217;s most successful private equity firm,
and Ukraine&#8217;s Horizon Capital bought stakes last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO, the largest by a Russian company in 11 months,
values the lender at 4 to 5 times book value, according to
Natalia Berezina, banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. OAO
Sberbank, Russia&#8217;s largest lender, trades at about 1.3 times
book value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Heightened Risks&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s consumer-finance banks face an increase in bad
loans in the unsecured retail-lending market and TCS is among
those with &#8220;heightened risks,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said
in a Sept. 12 report. Russian bank lending to households rose 34
percent as of Aug. 1 from a year earlier, while unsecured loans
surged 39 percent, according to central bank data. That&#8217;s higher
than the regulator deems &#8220;comfortable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is &#8220;an unique story, but in my opinion in current
conditions of overheated consumer lending, Central Bank
regulations, rising asset-quality problems and general cost of
equity for Russia and Russian banks, it&#8217;s still too high a price
for Tinkoff,&#8221; Berezina, who values TCS at $1.6 billion, said in
e-mailed comments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said while he doesn&#8217;t know what drove his firm&#8217;s
underperformance in fixed-income trading in the third quarter,
he&#8217;s vowing to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t know precisely why we had a tough quarter, but
the results are in, and I can tell you we had a tough quarter in
fixed-income,&#8221; Cohn said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview with Stephanie Ruhle. &#8220;We&#8217;re very committed, we&#8217;re
going to redouble or triple our efforts in fixed-income. We
believe ourselves to be a very powerful, very dominant, top-tier
fixed-income shop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported last week that fixed-income,
currency and commodities, or FICC, trading revenue dropped 47
percent to $1.29 billion, the lowest since the financial crisis.
The firm&#8217;s share of revenue among the five largest Wall Street
banks is 17 percent so far this year, down from 22 percent in
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision not to taper its stimulus
efforts didn&#8217;t cause a big change for the firm&#8217;s business, Cohn,
53, said. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last week
that clients were cautious leading up to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Goldman, it meant business as usual,&#8221; Cohn said.
&#8220;Not tapering is the world that we&#8217;ve been in for the last
year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to improve in fixed-income will include hiring, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for seasoned traders, we&#8217;re replenishing
our trading supply,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for seasoned
salespeople, salespeople who have real client relationships and
can come in and help us manage our client relationships.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daimler AG (DAI)&#8217;s contention that a patent covering sleepiness detection for vehicle operators is invalid, a federal appeals court said, upholding a lower court ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The German automaker was sued for patent infringement in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, in October 2010. Ibormeith IP LLC of Longview, Texas, claimed that Daimler&#8217;s Mercedes-Benz Attention Assist driver drowsiness detector infringed patent 6,313,749. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The patent, issued in November 2001, was acquired by Ibormeith LLC in August 2010, and then transferred to Ibormeith IP LLC the same month the suit was filed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ibormeith is named for the Irish princess Caer Ibormeith, who would change into a swan every other year. According to court filings, the company is one of the entities that make up Medici Portfolio LLC, a patent firm begun by Michael Connolly, a former partner in Chicago&#8217;s McDermott Will  Emery LLP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In September 2012, U.S. District Judge Faith S. Hochberg ruled the claims in the patent were too indefinite. Ibormeith then filed an appeal with the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The appeals court said yesterday that the lower court&#8217;s ruling was correct. The patent didn&#8217;t disclose enough information to make it possible to understand how the technology would work, the court said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The patent application was handled by Young  Thompson of Alexandria, Virginia, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Ibormeith IP LLC v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, 13-1007, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The lower-court case is Ibormeith IP LLC v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, 10-cv-05378, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;BlackBerry Bidders Weigh Patent Hoard Valued at Up to $3 Billion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)&#8217;s sales tumbled in recent years, the company continued amassing patents, building an intellectual-property hoard that&#8217;s now central to its effort to entice bidders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The struggling smartphone maker received 986 patents last year, a 49 percent increase from 2011, according to figures compiled by the Intellectual Property Owners Association. BlackBerry&#8217;s patents are valued at from $1 billion to $3 billion, depending on how many have been licensed out, analysts and patent experts estimate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working in BlackBerry&#8217;s favor: The patents cover similar technology as Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s intellectual property, and much of the portfolio is only a few years old. The downside is that the market for such assets has cooled. Previous patent buyers such as Apple and Google Inc. amassed broad portfolios in patent deals two years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an incredibly volatile market,&#8221; said Ron Laurie, managing director of Palo Alto, California-based Inflexion Point Strategy, who advises companies on patents. &#8220;It all depends on perceived demand and strategic value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lisette Kwong, a Waterloo, Ontario-based spokeswoman for BlackBerry, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more patent news, click here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Samsung&#8217;s Trademark Application Points to Extended Warranty &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) filed for a U.S. trademark that may indicate the Korean maker of mobile devices is planning to compete with rival Apple Inc. over extended warranties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both companies manufacture smart phones and are presently involved in a patent dispute in federal court in San Jose, California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung is seeking to register &#8220;Samsung Protection Plus&#8221; as a trademark for &#8220;providing extended warranties on consumer electronic products and appliances,&#8221; according to database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The trademark application was filed Oct. 15. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc.&#8217;s extended warranty is known as Applecare Protection Plan. The Cupertino, California-based company was sued by a Belgian consumer group in January over its extended warranty practices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleges that Apple misled consumers by advertising that its products had a one-year warranty and then selling a two-year extended warranty. European Union customers have an automatic two-year warranty on products they buy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Facebook Tells Developer to Dismantle BreakYourFacebook site &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) sent a cease-and-desist e-mail to the developer of a tool that allows users to take scheduled breaks from the social media site. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The developer, Cody Romano, said on his blog that he received the e-mail from the Menlo Park, California-based company objecting to the web app he created, &#8220;Break Your Facebook.&#8221; He said he created the tool in the wake of recent revelations about the National Security Administration&#8217;s alleged snooping into users e-mail and social-media accounts, and the &#8220;frenetic pace&#8221; and &#8220;poor quality&#8221; of Facebook&#8217;s News Feed feature. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the e-mail, Facebook said that Romano&#8217;s breakyourfacebook.com domain name infringes the social media company&#8217;s trademarks, and demanded that he quit using the name &#8220;Break Your Facebook&#8221; and disable the website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company also warned him not to &#8220;sell, offer to sell, or transfer&#8221; the domain name to a third party, and told him he should let his Internet domain name registration expire. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Romano said on his website that he knows he has to &#8220;break my app and let the domain die&#8221; because he lacks the resources for a legal battle with Facebook. He did take issue with the tone of the cease-and-desist letter, saying that he was &#8220;turned off&#8221; by the e-mail&#8217;s language. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more trademark news, click here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Norwegian Director Plays Trick on Potential Infringers of Film &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Norwegian director is having the last laugh at those who are downloading a copy of his film through a website that uses the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol, according to the TorrentFreak anti-copyright news website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johan Kaos uploaded a copy of his film &#8220;Pornopung&#8221; to the Pirate Bay website, saying he thought the movie would end up there anyway and he wanted to have some fun with those who used the site to download and share it without authorization, according to TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The film is a comedy about two men who give a third man advice about how to be attractive to women, with one of their tips involving removal of body hair from his genitals, TorrentFreak reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaos said the film he uploaded to PirateBay starts with 10 minutes of the film just as he made it, with the remaining two hours showing only an image of a shaven scrotum, according to TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more copyright news, click here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Ordered to Advance Ex-Programmer Fees for N.Y. Case &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) must advance computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov the legal fees he needs to fight New York state charges that he stole confidential source code from the company, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs at this time doesn&#8217;t have to pay the fees Aleynikov incurred defending federal charges that led to his conviction and imprisonment before the verdict was overturned, said U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty in Newark, New Jersey. He said the two sides must engage in a pretrial exchange of evidence on that question. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Immediate advancement of fees is required, subject only to an unsecured undertaking to repay them if the applicant is unsuccessful in the underlying litigation,&#8221; McNulty said in an opinion made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted in federal court in Manhattan in 2010 of stealing hundreds of thousands of lines of code and sentenced to 97 months in prison. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was ordered freed in February 2012 when the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed his conviction. In August of that year, he was arraigned in Manhattan on state charges of unlawful use of scientific material and duplication of computer-related material. He was the subject of a sympathetic profile in Vanity Fair magazine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which employed Aleynikov from May 2007 through June 2009, argued that it didn&#8217;t have to pay his fees in a state prosecution because he wasn&#8217;t an officer of the company, even though he was a vice president. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McNulty disagreed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may be the case that Goldman (or the industry of which it is a part) has been profligate in conferring the title of vice president,&#8221; the judge wrote. &#8220;If so, Goldman must bear the consequences of that profligacy. Goldman might easily have chosen to be more sparing with job titles, or to confer them in some other way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 12-cv-05994, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;IP Moves &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Article One Partners Names Marshall Phelps CEO &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Article One Partners hired Marshall Phelps as chief executive officer, the New York-based provider of crowd-sourced patent research said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phelps is the former corporate vice president of IP policy and Strategy at Microsoft Corp.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s advantage
over its Wall Street peers is fading in the eyes of credit-derivatives traders as fines and regulator probes hobble profits
while firms from Citigroup Inc. to Morgan Stanley rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps traders are demanding 16 basis points
less to protect against losses on JPMorgan bonds than the
average cost to insure debt of the bank&#8217;s five-biggest U.S.
rivals, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The gap, a
measure of the bank&#8217;s credit strength relative to its
competitors, has narrowed from an average 80 basis points since
2008 and 152 in April 2012, the month before JPMorgan disclosed
a trading loss that reached $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regulatory fines and penalties that are poised to
approach $15 billion, the playing field is leveling between the
only Wall Street bank to stay profitable through the financial
crisis and rivals that the credit seizure pushed to the edge of
failure. Swaps tied to Citigroup, which last month removed the
final vestiges of its government bailout, narrowed to within 6
basis points of JPMorgan&#8217;s for the first time since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;JPMorgan&#8217;s Turn&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s JPMorgan&#8217;s turn to have its own types of concerns,
albeit ones that are much less severe from a credit perspective
than the others&#8221; and in an improved economy, said Pri De Silva,
a bank analyst at debt-research firm CreditSights Inc. in New
York. For lenders such as Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan
Stanley, &#8220;the balance sheets are in much better shape now
compared with credit-crisis days,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
hired Ian M. Smith from Citigroup (C) Inc. as head of electronic
trading for the Asia-Pacific region as the U.S. firm seeks to
expand its system globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, most recently head of execution trading for the
region at Citigroup, will be a managing director, said Connie
Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs. The
hiring follows the departure of Shuya Kekke, former co-head of
electronic trading, from Goldman Sachs earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith becomes the fifth senior electronic trading
specialist the Wall Street firm has recruited in the region in
the past two years, spanning from Japan to Australia, Ling said.
New York-based Goldman Sachs spent a year developing an
electronic trading system for corporate bonds called GSessions
that started operating in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been building out our electronic trading platform
in Asia, tripling the number of clients on the algorithmic
customization platform and adding access to three new markets in
the past year,&#8221; Canute Dalmasse, Asia-Pacific head of execution
services, wrote in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith will be based in Hong Kong, Ling said. Before
Citigroup, he worked at Credit Suisse Group AG and led the
development of the Swiss bank&#8217;s algorithmic trading strategies
and related product development, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Griffiths, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Citigroup,
declined to comment on Smith&#8217;s departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) are among securities
firms that bought execution-management systems starting in the
mid-2000s to give clients including mutual funds access to
exchanges and algorithms, or trading strategies that allow them
to process larger orders in small pieces over a preset period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has added six people to its Asia electronic
trading team in the past three months, including Kekke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. reported first-quarter sales and profit that exceeded analysts&#8217; projections as the company, which is looking for a replacement for Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, relied on corporate software demand to make up for weak consumer personal-computer purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income in the period that ended Sept. 30 rose to $5.24 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $4.47 billion, or 53 cents, a year earlier, Microsoft said today in a statement. Sales climbed 16 percent to $18.5 billion. Analysts on average had predicted profit of 54 cents on $17.8 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares jumped in late trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker is undergoing unprecedented changes, conducting its first-ever CEO search and starting an organizational overhaul aimed at bolstering sales by focusing on devices and services. Demand for Microsoft&#8217;s Office productivity software has helped compensate for declining consumer purchases of PCs running Windows, and the company has been cutting costs to shore up profit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Business has been driving the train,&#8221; said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York, who recommends holding the shares. &#8220;Most people are really looking through the quarter to the new CEO.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the largest
Spanish-language TV producer, reported a gain in third-quarter
profit as new cable and satellite customers led revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating-segment profit, which leaves out items such as
depreciation and amortization, rose 6.1 percent to 7.96 billion
pesos ($614 million), Mexico City-based Televisa said today in a
statement. Sales rose 8.1 percent to 18.8 billion pesos,
compared with the 18.6 billion-peso average of seven analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Emilio Azcarraga is turning to pay-TV services for growth as advertising sales level off for
Televisa&#8217;s broadcast-television networks. Cable-TV subscriptions
rose by more than 58,000 to 2.46 million. Sky satellite-service
users rose by almost 233,000, in line with the 233,500 average
estimate of four analysts polled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto reduced government
spending on advertising this year, while lawmakers set new
&#8220;must-offer&#8221; rules, which require Televisa to offer its over-the-air programming to pay-TV rivals for free. Televisa reported
8.79 billion pesos in revenue from television advertising and
licensing in the third quarter, compared with an average
estimate of 8.7 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income was 2.39 billion pesos, or 84
centavos a share, compared with 2.86 billion pesos, or 1.01
pesos, a year earlier, on higher costs for items such as taxes
and depreciation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The naked men and women at the Whitney Museum of American Art gala stood on a platform surrounded by luggage from sponsor Louis Vuitton. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the fully clothed last night were Citadel LLC Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin; J. Michael Evans, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice chairman who will leave his post at year&#8217;s end; and William Ruprecht, the CEO of Sotheby&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guests looked on as artists sketched the models, capturing the curve of an arm or a fine rump resting on the trunks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one gawked too long during the party held at Skylight at Moynihan Station, which raised more than $2.7 million. There were just too many distractions, from the strips of bacon being served at the bar (crispy, not caramelized, by the way), to greeting Leonard Lauder, one of the Whitney&#8217;s biggest patrons. There were also chances to spot actress Michelle Williams, dealer Larry Gagosian and honoree Ed Ruscha. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the evening, Ruscha was sketching a portrait of Salman Rushdie&#8217;s girlfriend, Missy Brody, fully clothed. She provided Ruscha with a notebook -- every guest received one at their place setting along with a Sharpie. Ruscha made a text portrait. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During dinner, the artist received a gift from the Whitney: a booklet titled &#8220;A Few Various Colorful People and a Glass of Milk,&#8221; filled with personal notes collected for the occasion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Aunt Gertie &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said he would read every page, then made a joke about the Metropolitan Museum of Art renting space at &#8220;Aunt Gertie&#8217;s boardinghouse&#8221; -- the Whitney&#8217;s uptown building, being vacated next year when it moves to the Meatpacking District. &#8220;Gertie&#8221; of course is Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who founded the museum after the Met turned down a gift of hundreds of paintings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ruscha got to choose the musical entertainment: David Byrne, who serenaded guests with three songs including &#8220;I Should Watch TV,&#8221; from his album with St. Vincent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goody bag offered a copy of the album as well as a copy of Ruscha&#8217;s book &#8220;They Called Her Styrene,&#8221; donated by the owners of Phaidon Press, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)&#8217;s Leon Black and his wife, Debra Black. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the after party, watching artists sketch live models was replaced by a photo booth where people could pose with signs showing phrases from Ruscha paintings, such as: &#8220;Headlights Are Similar to People&#8217;s Eyes&#8221; and &#8220;Those of Us Who Have Double Parked.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The guests here included actresses Taylor Schilling, who stars in &#8220;Orange Is the New Black,&#8221; and Zoe Kravitz. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Amanda Gordon is a writer and photographer for Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News.

&lt;p&gt;Bonds of companies controlled by
billionaires Sunil Mittal and Mukesh Ambani, added in August to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s most-favored list, helped investors
to the biggest gains in 20 months for India&#8217;s dollar debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes of the nation&#8217;s issuers returned 5.6 percent since
Aug. 30, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Asian Credit Index,
poised for the best performance since a 7.9 percent advance in
the first two months of 2012. The premium investors pay over
Treasuries has slid 57 basis points in the period, the biggest
decline after Indonesia and Pakistan among 13 Asian markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are signaling their faith in Indian borrowers
after the central bank stemmed a rout in the rupee and companies
in the benchmark SP BSE Sensex index of shares surpassed or
matched profit forecasts. Indian debt also rallied on bets the
Federal Reserve will delay tapering its record stimulus that has
buoyed emerging-market assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is some positivity after the earnings,&#8221; Philipp Good, who manages $800 million including Indian debt in Zurich
at Fisch Asset Management Ltd., said in an Oct. 22 telephone
interview. &#8220;Investors are probably of the opinion that
impending risks to India and emerging markets have receded,
therefore the bonds become more appealing in the short term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mittal, Ambani &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mittal&#8217;s Bharti Airtel Ltd. andAmbani&#8217;s Reliance
Industries Ltd. are the only Indian companies on Goldman&#8217;s
most-favored list of Asian credit, an Oct. 16 report by the
U.S. bank shows. The lender added them on Aug. 26 amid a selloff
in emerging-market debt triggered by speculation the Fed will
cut its monthly bond purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharti&#8217;s 5.125 percent notes maturing March 2023 have
returned 6.5 percent this month, data compiled by Bloomberg
show, the most among 67 Indian bonds included in JPMorgan&#8217;s
Asian Credit Index. The yield fell to 5.93 percent from a record
8.04 percent on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance&#8217;s 5.4 percent bonds due February 2022 gained 4.3
percent in October, pushing the yield to 4.94 percent from an
unprecedented 6.088 percent on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income at nine 30 Sensex members, including Reliance,
that have published results for the quarter through Sept. 30 met
or beat forecasts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About half
of them trailed forecasts in the April-June quarter. Bharti
reports Oct. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Some Optimism&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings have surprised and may have prompted some
rethinking,&#8221; M. Narendra, Chairman of Chennai-based Indian
Overseas Bank Ltd., said in a telephone interview yesterday.
&#8220;The rupee&#8217;s reversal has also brought back some optimism. The
economy and markets were probably not on as weak a footing as
they were made out to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average of insuring bonds eight Indian issuers against
non-payment using credit-default swaps has dropped 58 basis
points from this year&#8217;s high of 395 touched last month,
according to CMA data, the day the Reserve Bank of India
unexpectedly raised borrowing costs for the first time since
2011. The RBI will raise the repurchase rate by 50 basis points,
or 0.50 percentage point, to 8 percent at its Oct. 29 meeting to
contain inflation induced by food prices, Deutsche Bank AG said
in an Oct. 16 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee has climbed 12 percent from its record-low
reached on Aug. 28, the most among Asia&#8217;s 11 most traded
currencies. It was little changed today at 61.56 per dollar as
of 1:54 p.m. Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. Benchmark 10-year sovereign yield fell
four basis points to 8.60 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Risk Events&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While returns on Indian corporate debt have rebounded from
a four-month slump that ended in August, foreign investors still
need to negotiate several &#8220;risk events,&#8221; Desmond Soon, a
Singapore-based money manager at Western Asset Management Co.,
said in an interview yesterday. These include national elections
due in 2014 and the start of the Fed&#8217;s tapering, he said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian companies have raised $25.6 billion in overseas
loans and bonds this year through Oct. 22, 14 percent more than
a year earlier. HDFC Bank Ltd. completed a $500 million of
three-year notes offering yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average yield on Indian dollar debt fell to 5.55
percent on Oct. 23, according to a JPMorgan index, the least
since Aug. 1. That compares a 9.53 percent average for five-year
rupee notes, indicative yields compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Indian corporate asset prices will benefit as risk
appetite is increasing gradually,&#8221; said Zsolt Papp, who helps
oversees $2.6 billion of emerging-market debt at Union Bancaire
Privee in Zurich. &#8220;Pessimism is waning.&#8221; Non-bank securities
are likely to outperform lenders, he said by phone on Oct. 22. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) tentative
agreement to pay a record $13 billion to end civil claims over
its sales of mortgage bonds has hit a snag because of the bank&#8217;s
bid to make the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. liable for part
of the payment, a person familiar with the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is opposing JPMorgan&#8217;s request
that the FDIC assume liability for investors&#8217; losses stemming
from Washington Mutual Inc., the person, who sought anonymity to
discuss the private negotiations, said today. JPMorgan acquired
Washington Mutual&#8217;s assets in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolving part of the $13 billion tentative agreement
today, JPMorgan agreed to pay $5.1 billion to settle Federal
Housing Finance Agency claims related to home loans and
mortgage-backed securities the bank sold to Fannie Mae (FNMA) and
Freddie Mac. (FMCC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes $4 billion to resolve claims over
mortgage bonds and $1.1 billion to settle claims that JPMorgan
sold faulty mortgages directly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
that the companies packaged into their own securities, the FHFA
said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the FHFA agreement, JPMorgan preserved its right to seek
FDIC reimbursement for FHFA claims stemming from Washington
Mutual&#8217;s estate, which is managed by the FDIC. JPMorgan has been
in a legal battle with the FDIC over who should pay certain
liabilities from the failed thrift, which the agency placed into
receivership in 2008, selling JPMorgan the remaining assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is weathering slumping personal-computer sales by focusing on Xboxes, business software and cloud services, as departing Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer seeks to make the company less dependent on its Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported fiscal first-quarter sales and profit yesterday that topped analysts&#8217; average estimates on demand for Office programs and database servers. The company&#8217;s revenue forecast for the current quarter was also ahead of projections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker is undergoing unprecedented changes, conducting its first-ever CEO search and starting an organizational overhaul aimed at bolstering sales by focusing on devices and services. Companies are snapping up products such as Web-based cloud services and the Lync instant messaging and voice software, bolstering sales even as consumers purchase fewer PCs running Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s good revenue growth, but the question going forward with these new initiatives is, will they generate the billion-dollar numbers we need to drive the top line number and to say Microsoft is really invigorated,&#8221; said Daniel Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust Co. in Atlanta, which owns Microsoft shares. &lt;/p&gt;

Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s corporate and investment bank, sold $7.6 million
in company stock in a pair of previously undisclosed
transactions months ago, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A delay in reporting the sales, which occurred in April and
July, &#8220;was an error which we caught and corrected,&#8221; said Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the New York-based firm. The
Securities and Exchange Commission requires transactions by
corporate insiders to be disclosed within two business days,
according to the agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinto, 50, sold 73,000 shares valued at $3.56 million on
April 29 and 73,247 shares valued at $4.06 million on July 15,
according to yesterday&#8217;s filing. The deals disposed of almost
all of his direct holdings that would have been eligible for
sale at the time, according to descriptions of his awards and
their terms in January filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has risen 19 percent this year to $52.52 at 10:52
a.m. in New York, trailing the 26 percent increase in the KBW
Bank Index (BKX) of 24 U.S. lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinto also exercised 400,000 stock options that gave him
shares valued at about $22 million and sold 263,057 shares for
$14.5 million to cover the cost of the transaction as well as
his tax obligations on July 15, according to a July 17 filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies from IBM to Starbucks are struggling with new obstacles in China as Communist Party officials tussle over the direction and depth of economic reforms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s state-controlled media last week accused Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) with charging too much for coffee and said Samsung Electronics Co.&#8217;s smartphones don&#8217;t work properly. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) IBM&#8217;s China revenue slipped 22 percent in the third quarter, contributing to the first-ever sales decline in the company&#8217;s growth-markets division, as state-owned companies started delaying orders, including mainframes and servers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The operating environment for foreign firms has deteriorated in the last year in a serious way,&#8221; said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. &#8220;In my 16 years in China, it&#8217;s some of the worst business sentiment among foreign executives. They don&#8217;t feel as welcome as they used to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based trade group, surveyed U.S. executives this month, the chief complaints included rising costs and bureaucratic red tape. Almost 70 percent of the more than 100 U.S. firms polled said profit margin would be flat or narrow this year. Only 39 percent are optimistic about the next five years in China; 58 percent felt that way in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Wagner, the top U.S.
prosecutor for mostly rural eastern California, has busted the
head of a tomato-packing company for racketeering and wrangled a
settlement from a lumber company over a wildfire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s also prosecuted more than 250 people for mortgage
fraud in a district that includes six of the 10 U.S. cities
hardest hit by foreclosures since the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the typical bad guys Wagner targets are local
mortgage brokers and foreclosure scam artists, he has one
investigation that stands out. He&#8217;s leading the criminal probe
of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
refused to close down when the government and the bank reached a
tentative $13 billion settlement over mortgage-related
malfeasance, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Wagner&#8217;s appointment by President Barack Obama in
2009 as the U.S. attorney in Sacramento, the state capital, he&#8217;s
taken on the role of sheriff of the region&#8217;s housing market.
He&#8217;s prosecuted people such as Eric Hernandez, a Bakersfield,
California, home loan broker sentenced last month to about 11
years in prison for cheating lenders, including JPMorgan, out of
$6 million by submitting fraudulent applications to obtain
loans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) raised $5 billion in
its biggest bond offering ever as the world&#8217;s largest beverage
company prepares to refinance debt with borrowing costs falling
back toward a record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soft-drinks maker issued equal $500 million portions of
fixed- and floating-rate securities due in 2016, two $1.25
billion pieces that mature in 2018 and 2020 and $1.5 billion of
10-year bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction comes two weeks after the Atlanta-based
company reported a 5.9 percent increase in third-quarter profit
to $2.45 billion with Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent
working to raise prices and entice customers to grab a drink on
the go. Kent has forecast the company and its bottlers would
reach $200 billion in global revenue by 2020, double the amount
generated in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company remains on track to deliver on its 2020
vision of doubling revenues,&#8221; Edward Mui, an analyst at New
York-based debt researcher CreditSights Inc., wrote today in a
report that maintained an &#8220;outperform&#8221; ranking on Coca-Cola
bonds. The beverage maker has a &#8220;large and diverse
international footprint, stable and robust free cash flows, and
healthy credit metrics,&#8221; Mui wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2010 Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s sale exceeds a $4.5 billion offering in November
2010, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used to repay or
redeem its $1.25 billion of 0.75 percent bonds due Nov. 15, as
well as $1 billion of floaters and $900 million of 3.625 percent
notes both maturing in March, Coca-Cola said today in a
regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-year floaters pay 10 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, and the similar-maturity 0.75
percent bonds yield 22 basis points more than Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. The 1.65 percent five-year debentures have
a spread of 42, the 2.45 percent seven-year securities pay an
extra 60, and the 3.2 percent 10-year bonds yield 70 more than
benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread on the 2023 bonds exceeds the relative yield on
Coca-Cola&#8217;s similar-maturity outstanding bonds as of yesterday
by 7 basis points, Bloomberg Valuation estimates show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average yields on dollar-denominated investment-grade bonds
fell to 3.19 percent yesterday from a more than 19-month high of
3.67 percent on Sept. 5, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. They reached a record-low 2.65 percent in May
and have averaged 5.87 percent during the past two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola is ranked Aa3 at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, an
equivalent AA- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s and a step lower at A+ by
Fitch Ratings. Libor (US0003M), the rate at which banks say they can
borrow from each other, was set at 0.24 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc
and Morgan Stanley helped to manage the sale, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magid N. Shenouda, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s London-based co-head of commodities trading, is
leaving the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenouda joined the firm in 1999 and became a partner in
2008, according to an internal memo from Pablo Salame and
Isabelle Ealet, co-heads of the trading division. Michael DuVally, a company spokesman, confirmed the contents of the memo
and declined to elaborate. Gregory A. Agran is Shenouda&#8217;s New
York-based co-head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is among banks whose ability to participate
in the commodities markets is being examined by the Federal
Reserve. The Fed is conducting a review while U.S. lawmakers and
regulators raise concerns that banks might abuse their various
roles in physical commodities markets, or that the businesses
pose risks to the firms&#8217; financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a long, long investment in the commodity
business, and we have at this stage no intention of selling our
business,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in a
conference call this month after Goldman Sachs reported third-quarter results. &#8220;We&#8217;re very committed to our clients here. And
so we&#8217;ll just work with the regulators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenouda previously ran the New York-based bank&#8217;s European
crude oil and products trading unit and its European gas and
power trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has been responsible for driving several key
acquisitions, as well as the expansion of our business
activities into new regions and products, including the build-out of our energy, coal, freight and emissions franchise,&#8221;
Ealet and Salame wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spark Spread reported on the departure earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A measure of U.S. company credit
risk declined as Federal Reserve policy makers began a two-day
meeting. Coca-Cola Co. (KO) raised $5 billion in its biggest bond
offering ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
0.7 basis point to 71.1 basis points at 5:16 p.m. in New York,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark closed
Oct. 22 at 70.1 basis points, the lowest level since November
2007 in data that adjust for the effects of the market&#8217;s shift
to a new version in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank, which concludes the meeting tomorrow,
will delay the first reduction in its asset buying until March
after a partial government shutdown slowed fourth-quarter
growth, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The
Federal Open Market Committee&#8217;s policy statement may help
investors gauge when the Fed will start reducing its $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases, which have boosted credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are waiting on direction from the Fed rather
than committing to one view or another,&#8221; Edward Marrinan, a
macro credit strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc&#8217;s
securities unit in Stamford, Connecticut, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps index typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coca-Cola &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola issued fixed- and floating-rate debt maturing in
three to 10 years in a five-part offering, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The largest portion was for $1.5 billion
of 3.2 percent, 10-year bonds that yield 70 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries. Proceeds from the sale, which
exceeded a $4.5 billion offering in November 2010, will be used
to repay or redeem debt, the Atlanta-based company said in a
regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings, a clinical testing
company based in Burlington, North Carolina, sold $400 million
in 2.5 percent, five-year bonds that yield 125 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and $300 million in 4 percent,
10-year notes with a relative yield of 165 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade
bonds, declined 1.5 basis points to 345.4 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate bonds rather than
similar-maturity Treasuries increased 0.5 basis point to 125.8
basis points, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade debt is rated Baa3 or higher at Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and at least BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market for initial public
offerings is &#8220;alive and well&#8221; and it&#8217;s a great time for
companies to raise financing, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told CNBC today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The IPO market is alive and well,&#8221; Blankfein, 59, said
in the interview. &#8220;We have high equity prices, we have an
economy that&#8217;s growing -- people would like it to be growing at
a faster rate, but there&#8217;s no doubt it&#8217;s growing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein declined to comment on the planned IPO for
Twitter Inc. (TWTR), which Goldman Sachs is managing. Goldman Sachs
ranks first among managers of global equity offerings so far
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ken Duberstein&#8217;s secretary told him Michael Dell was on the phone on the afternoon of July 31, there was little doubt about the topic. That morning, Dell Inc.&#8217;s special board committee had rejected the latest offer from Dell to take the personal-computer company private, a battle that was dragging into its 11th month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;What do we need to do to get this deal over the goal line?&#8221; Dell&#8217;s founder and chief executive officer recalled asking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raise the bid, responded Duberstein, a 69-year-old tough-talking former chief of staff for Ronald Reagan who sat on the special committee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Duberstein, now a Washington, D.C., lobbyist, laid out the stakes for the 48-year-old executive in another call later that evening. If the deal wasn&#8217;t approved -- a shareholder vote was scheduled for two days later -- Dell might lose control of the company he founded in his University of Texas dorm room in 1984. A no vote would indicate a lack of confidence in Dell, and some board members had already lost faith in his management, according to three people familiar with the directors&#8217; thinking. If activist shareholders began calling for Dell&#8217;s ouster, the board might be inclined to honor the request, these people said. Dell declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) added $15 billion to its buyback plan as it reduces stock
in circulation to increase earnings per share with sales
continuing to decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board authorized the funding today along with its
quarterly dividend, according to a statement from the world&#8217;s
largest computer-services provider. With the addition, the
company now has $20.6 billion in its repurchase program, and it
will request more next October, it said. IBM&#8217;s market value is
about $199 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is rewarding
shareholders who held on as the stock fell 7.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with the 24 percent gain in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. With sales dropping, the company is
counting on the buyback to help reach its goal of $20 in
adjusted earnings a share by 2015, up from $15.25 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one of the biggest tools they have to increase
earnings per share if their growth rate is flat,&#8221; said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial
Partners, who doesn&#8217;t own IBM shares. &#8220;If they&#8217;re not growing,
they can reduce their share count.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales have fallen for six straight quarters, and IBM&#8217;s
hardware unit reported a loss for the three months that ended in
September. At the same time, earnings have continued to climb.
In addition to buying back shares, IBM has sold less-profitable
businesses, acquired more lucrative software companies and
lowered its tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217;
estimates as the company cut costs and sales of its top vaccine
and pain drugs increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings (PFE) excluding one-time items were 58 cents a share, 2
cents more than the average of 16 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. New York-based Pfizer raised the lower end of its
full-year forecast range, excluding certain items, narrowing it
to $2.15 to $2.20 a share from $2.10 to $2.20 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is pushing to expand sales of Prevnar, a
pneumococcal vaccine and its second-biggest product, since
losing marketing exclusivity for Lipitor, once the world&#8217;s top-selling drug. It also used proceeds from the divestiture of
units to buy back stock and boost earnings per share. Investors
are now looking for detail on whether Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read will break the company into two or three pieces, keep
them separately in-house or sell part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re focused on setting up the new
organizational model,&#8221; Read said today on a conference call
with investors. &#8220;It&#8217;s too early to speculate on the future
developments of those businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 1.7 percent to $31.25 at 4 p.m. New York time,
its highest price since October 2004. The shares have gained 23
percent in the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium for Los Angeles gasoline
widened versus futures for the first time in seven days as
refineries operated by Tesoro Corp. (TSO) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
reported upsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro&#8217;s 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle plant in
Northern California reported a small fire in a crude unit Oct.
26, a notice to Contra Costa county regulators showed. The blaze
didn&#8217;t damage equipment or affect the refinery&#8217;s ability to meet
supply commitments, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at Tesoro&#8217;s
headquarters in San Antonio, said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant in Southern
California reported a breakdown that caused emissions early
today, a notice to the South Coast Air Quality Management
District showed. The refinery said in a separate notice that it
plans to flare gases tomorrow through Nov. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles broadened 2.25 cents to 9.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
differential in four days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg at 1:50 p.m. New York time. Prompt delivery slipped
0.86 cent to $2.6742 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco strengthened 2.25 cents against
futures to a discount of 1.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tesoro Flaring &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson section of Tesoro&#8217;s Los
Angeles refinery reported plans to flare from Nov. 1 to Nov. 7,
a notice to the South Coast air agency showed. The flaring is
associated with work that won&#8217;t affect the company&#8217;s ability to
meet commitments, Barbee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
a benchmark for the U.S. Pacific Northwest, was unchanged at 13
cents a gallon below futures. Diesel in Portland was unchanged
at 18.5 cents a gallon above ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures
traded on the Nymex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discounts for California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los
Angeles and San Francisco held at 1.75 cents and 3.25 cents a
gallon, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed $1.70 a
barrel to $10.24. The spread, a rough indicator of refining
profitability, is the smallest in more than three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castaldo will be based in New York report to Hernan Cristerna and Christopher Ventresca, JPMorgan&#8217;s global co-heads
of mergers and acquisitions, the document shows. The contents of
the memo were confirmed by the bank&#8217;s New York-based spokeswoman

&lt;p&gt;Castaldo, who worked at Citigroup Inc. before joining Bank

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s El Segundo complex,
the largest single refinery on the U.S. West Coast, delayed
maintenance on crude and coker units to late April, a person
familiar with the schedule said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on the coker originally set for January will begin in
the last week of April and is expected to last about two months,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn&#8217;t public. Repairs on the No. 4 crude unit will
start at the same time and take about three weeks, according to
the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rod Spackman, a spokesman for Chevron in El Segundo, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to e-mailed and phoned requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The El Segundo refinery can process 279,000 barrels of
crude a day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The plant supplies
40 percent of the jet fuel to the Los Angeles International
Airport and has a 20 percent share of the Southern California
gasoline market, the company&#8217;s website said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other equipment including a naphtha hydrotreater and a
sulfur recovery unit are also scheduled to shut for repairs
during the turnaround, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is planning to replace six coke drums at the El
Segundo refinery that arrived from Spain in late January, the
company&#8217;s website said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant receives about 50,000 barrels a day of its oil by
pipeline from fields in California and 225,000 barrels a day by
tanker, the company&#8217;s website shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said crude
production in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
will decline this year by more than the bank previously
estimated because of renewed disruptions in Libya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC&#8217;s output will decline by 760,000 barrels per day from
last year, according to the bank, which had previously projected
an annual loss of 570,000 a day. The supply reduction will keep
Brent futures supported at $110 a barrel despite an accumulation
in oil inventories amid weaker-than-expected fuel demand,
Goldman said. Libya&#8217;s production will remain capped at 650,000
barrels a day this year as a result of political disputes, the
bank predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The conflicts in the country&#8217;s east appear more permanent
in nature given the diversity of involved parties, which makes a
near-term resolution seem increasingly unlikely,&#8221; analysts led
by Jeffrey Currie in New York said in a note to clients on Oct.
28. &#8220;We believe that production levels will only recover to
around 1.3 million barrels per day through 2014.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output losses among OPEC members have buoyed oil prices
against muted growth in world oil demand, which expanded by
400,000 barrels a day in the third quarter from a year ago
compared with 1.5 million a day in the second, Goldman said.
Saudi Arabia, the group&#8217;s biggest member, will need to keep
output near record levels above 10 million barrels a day for the
rest of the year to compensate for the disruptions in other OPEC
nations, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC&#8217;s production slumped to a near two-year low of less
than 30 million barrels a day in September as labor unrest
crippled Libya&#8217;s export facilities and as Iraq conducted
maintenance at its southern oil terminal, the International
Energy Agency said on Oct. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The potential for further disruptions in Libya&#8221; means
that crude prices may exceed the bank&#8217;s current forecasts,
according to Goldman. Brent, trading today at $108.95 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, will advance to
about $110 in three months&#8217; time, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production from OPEC member Iran will also remain
&#8220;materially affected by international sanctions through to the
end of the year and 2014,&#8221; despite the resumption of talks with
western governments about the country&#8217;s nuclear program, Goldman
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lithuanian Geology Service was instructed by a tender
commission &#8220;to assess the changed legal and tax environment and
present the documents to organize a new tender,&#8217; Vice
Environment Minister Daiva Matoniene said today in a statement
on the ministry&#8217;s website in Vilnius, the capital. The rights
for the sale are to explore and produce shale hydrocarbons in
the western Lithuanian region of Silute-Taurage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltic nation wants to know if its shale resources are
sufficient to be an alternative to energy imports from Russia.
U.S. energy company Chevron abandoned its bid for exploration
rights on Oct. 8, put off by regulatory and tax issues, Prime
Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;This is a good decision,&#8221; Economy Minister Valentinas
Mazuronis said in the same statement. &#8220;Refusing to explore for
shale gas or oil would be unfair to Lithuania as a whole.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) are putting their top London currency dealers on leave after regulators probing the manipulation of foreign-exchange rates started investigating the traders&#8217; use of an instant-message group, three people with knowledge of the moves said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rohan Ramchandani, Citigroup&#8217;s head of European spot trading, was told yesterday he will be placed on leave, said one of the people who asked not to be identified because he wasn&#8217;t authorized to talk publicly. Richard Usher, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief dealer in London, went on leave two weeks ago, said another person. Both are taking leave by mutual agreement with their employers and neither has been suspended, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) has also placed Matt Gardiner, its assistant chief dealer in the U.K. capital, on leave, a fourth person said Oct. 29. None of the traders has been accused of any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulators are focusing on an instant-message group the traders set up to share information about their positions and client orders over a period of at least three years, four people with knowledge of the probe said this month. The roster of banks in the group changed as the men moved firms and also included Barclays Plc (BARC), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG (UBSN), three people with knowledge of the communications said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A measure of U.S. company credit
risk rose to the highest level in two weeks as the Federal
Reserve said it needs to see more evidence that the economy will
continue to improve before reducing monetary stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps gauge that investors use to hedge against
losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased 1.9 basis
points to 73 basis points at 5:26 p.m. in New York, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the highest level for the
index since it closed at 73.6 basis points on Oct. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are interpreting the Federal Open Market
Committee&#8217;s mention of economic growth since the Fed&#8217;s bond-buying program began as a signal that the central bank may cut
back stimulus sooner than anticipated, according to Scott MacDonald, head of research at Stamford, Connecticut-based MC
Asset Management Holdings LLC. The FOMC won&#8217;t reduce the pace of
purchases until its March 18-19 meeting, according to the median
estimate of an Oct. 17-18 Bloomberg News survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Maybe people are reading that this might indicate the
FOMC might move sooner than March, but we have a ways to go
here,&#8221; MacDonald said in a telephone interview. The statement
was &#8220;slightly more hawkish than people anticipated, especially
considering the downtick in economic data lately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Evidence&#8217; Awaited &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps gauge typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal
retrenchment over the past year, the committee sees the
improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions
since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with
growing underlying strength in the broader economy,&#8221; the FOMC
said in a statement released at 2 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed repeated that it will &#8220;await more evidence that
progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace&#8221; of its
purchases, which will remain divided between $40 billion a month
of mortgage bonds and $45 billion in Treasury securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank left unchanged its statement that it will
probably hold its target interest rate near zero &#8220;at least as
long as&#8221; unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent, so long as the
outlook for inflation is no higher than 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Procter  Gamble &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the world&#8217;s largest consumer-products
maker, sold $2 billion of bonds in three parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent issued $1
billion of three-year notes, split evenly between 0.75 percent,
fixed-rate debentures to yield 20 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and floating-rate debt to yield 8
basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $1
billion of 1.6 percent, five-year debt at a relative yield of 40
basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds are expected to be rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next wave of company defaults isn&#8217;t likely to reach the
rate triggered by the financial crisis five years ago, according
to a report from Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll get a longer default cycle, but not as sharp,&#8221;
David Keisman, lead author of the report, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speculative-grade default rate in the U.S. will be
&#8220;relatively stable&#8221; over the next year after ending the third
quarter at 2.6 percent, according to a Moody&#8217;s report dated Oct.
16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit rater forecast a high-yield default rate at
year-end of 2.7 percent, declining to 2.6 percent by September
2014, according to the Oct. 16 report. The rates compare with a
cyclical peak of more than 14 percent in late 2009 and a 20-year
average of 4.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade
bonds, increased 8.6 basis points to 354 basis points, Bloomberg
prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate bonds rather than
similar-maturity Treasuries fell 0.7 basis point to 124.7 basis
points, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade debt is rated Baa3 or higher at Moody&#8217;s
and at least BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest bank-card network, posted a fiscal fourth-quarter profit that matched
analysts&#8217; estimates as U.S. retail spending strengthened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 28
percent to $1.19 billion, or $1.85 a share, from $1.66 billion,
or $2.47, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
company said today in a statement. That equaled the average
estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Results for the
fourth quarter of 2012 were helped by a $627 million tax
adjustment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail sales in the U.S., where Visa gets more than half
its revenue, rose toward the end of the quarter as September&#8217;s
0.4 percent gain in purchases excluding vehicles followed a 0.1
percent increase in August. Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf also has pushed to expand abroad, particularly in
emerging economies, where most spending is still done with cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continued investing in high-growth regions of the
world, in products and technology to drive our performance,
while maintaining disciplined expense control,&#8221; Scharf, 48,
said in the statement. &#8220;We also have been consistent and
decisive in returning excess cash to shareholders and maintain
this commitment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa fell 0.2 percent to $203.82 at 4 p.m. in New York. The
shares have increased 34 percent this year, outpacing the 19
percent advance for the 30-company Dow Jones Industrial Average. (INDU) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, which has returned more than $15 billion to investors
since its 2008 initial public offering, increased the quarterly
dividend 21 percent to 40 cents last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s still a lot more to do considering how much
excess cash this company has on its balance sheet,&#8221; Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC, said in an
interview before results were announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MasterCard Results &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases and operator of the third-largest U.S. payments
network, said Oct. 16 that quarterly profit rose 9.3 percent to
$1.37 billion on higher spending worldwide. Discover Financial
Services (DFS), the No. 4 network, said last week that net income
declined 6.9 percent as the company increased the amount of
money set aside to cover future loan losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest payments network by
processed transactions, is scheduled to announce results before
U.S. markets open tomorrow. The Purchase, New York-based company
may report that third-quarter net income rose 9 percent to
$841.4 million from a year earlier, according to the average
estimate of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard and the biggest U.S. banks are awaiting
approval of a multibillion-dollar settlement over fees charged
to merchants when consumers pay with credit cards. The decision
by U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, could
end an eight-year legal battle pitting the financial firms
against retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) abandoned its court fight with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) over
a $600 million cloud computing contract for the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency, citing the government&#8217;s urgency to begin
work on the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM withdrew its bid for a stay of U.S. Court of Claims
Judge Thomas Wheeler&#8217;s Oct. 8 ruling in favor of Amazon after
the Justice Department said in court papers that further delay
in resolving the contract would bring &#8220;harm to the United
States&#8221; and create &#8220;significant challenges&#8221; for the CIA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon sued the U.S. in July after the Government
Accountability Office, the agency that makes recommendations on
challenges to contracts, sided with IBM and agreed that the CIA
had failed to properly evaluate prices and had waived a contract
requirement only for Seattle-based Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In light of the government&#8217;s recent submissions
emphasizing its need to move forward on the contract, IBM has
withdrawn its motion,&#8221; Clint Roswell, an IBM spokesman, said in
a statement. &#8220;IBM maintains its position that the GAO&#8217;s
findings were appropriate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roswell declined to say what further action on the
contract, if any, Armonk, New York-based IBM would pursue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Osako, a spokeswoman for Amazon, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Amazon Web Services Inc. v. U.S., 13-cv-00506,

&lt;p&gt;Jason Armstrong, a 13-year veteran
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who oversaw analysis of phone and
cable companies, is leaving to become Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s head of
investor relations, according to a person with knowledge of the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armstrong starts in late January, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the move hasn&#8217;t been publicly
announced. Comcast, based in Philadelphia, is the largest U.S.
cable company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the lead analyst for the investment bank&#8217;s North
American communications equity research group, Armstrong covered
the pay-TV industry, including Comcast, Dish Network Corp. and
Time Warner Cable Inc., as well as their competitors in the
phone industry, such as ATT Inc. and Verizon Communications
Inc. He joined Goldman in 2000 and was previously with Ernst 
Young LLP in Chicago, according to Goldman&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment, as did John Demming, a spokesman for
Comcast. Armstrong couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment through his
Goldman Sachs office and e-mail address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armstrong had a buy rating on Comcast for most of the past
four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. and Coca-Cola HBC AG (CCH)
invested 22 million euros ($30 million) in a new production line
at a Romanian bottling plant to help transform the Balkan state
into an export hub for 100 million consumers in eastern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the new line, which was completed in July,
the company has built a new warehouse and a power plant in 2009,
investing 45 million-euros, Coca-Cola HBC Chief Executive
Officer Dimitris Lois told reporters in the southern town of
Ploiesti today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant, Coca-Cola HBC&#8217;s largest in southeast Europe,
will sell Coca-Cola products in six European countries, Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said at the same

about 525 million euros in Romania since 1991, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This wonderful investment is growing this business and it

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the biggest oil
company by market value, lifted production for the first time in
more than two years as net income slumped 18 percent on
dwindling refining returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s oil and natural gas output rose 1.5 percent to the
equivalent of 4.02 million barrels a day, the first increase
since the second quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Crude prices also climbed, raising costs and
contributing to an 81 percent plunge in profit at the company&#8217;s
refineries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were hurt on the cost side,&#8221; said Ernie Cecilia,
who helps manage $7 billion, including Exxon shares, as chief
investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $7.87 billion, or $1.79 a share, from
$9.57 billion, or $2.09, a year earlier, Irving, Texas-based
Exxon said in a statement today. The per-share result was 2
cents higher than the average of 21 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average of 30 blue-chip stocks today. The shares rose 0.9
percent to $89.62 at the close in New York. Sales declined by
2.4 percent to $112.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refining Crude &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from processing crude into fuels fell to $592
million during the quarter from $3.19 billion a year earlier,
according to the statement. Returns from oil and gas sales rose
12 percent to $6.7 billion and chemical profit climbed 30
percent to $1.03 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. profit margins from refining oil into products such as
gasoline and diesel declined 43 percent to an average of $17.54
a barrel during the July-to-September period as the cost of U.S.
crude feed stocks rose. It was the first time the average
quarterly spread fell below $20 since late 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been processing output from its Kearl oil-sands development in western Canada at plants in Joliet,
Illinois; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Sarnia, Ontario, David Rosenthal, vice president of investor relations, said during a
conference call with analysts today. Some of the Kearl
production also has been sold to other refiners, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is
seeking to revive production growth and curb cost increases amid
stagnant energy demand in the world&#8217;s largest economy and
shrinking access to the world&#8217;s remaining untapped crude
reservoirs. The company&#8217;s growth prospects include gas-export
developments in Australia and Papua New Guinea, oil-sands
production in western Canada and Arctic forays in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less Downtime &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output in the quarter rose on the contributions from new
projects and less downtime at existing projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon stock has languished among the poorest performers of
the world&#8217;s largest oil producers, advancing 2.6 percent this
year to yesterday, less than one-third the gain of its largest
rival Chevron Corp. (CVX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s oil, were little changed during the quarter from a year
earlier, trading at an average price of $109.65 a barrel. The
premier U.S. crude, West Texas Intermediate, rose 15 percent to
average $105.81-a-barrel average in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas climbed by 23 percent to $3.555 per
million British thermal units from $2.893 a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gas accounted for about
49 percent of the company&#8217;s worldwide reserves at the end of
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boost Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, 61, has been telling investors and analysts
since March that output from Exxon&#8217;s wells will decline by 1
percent this year before new projects boost production as much
as 3 percent annually through 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is the second-to-last major non-state oil producer to
report third-quarter results. Earlier today, Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) said net income declined 35 percent and Total SA (FP) reported a
10 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 29, BP Plc (BP/) said profit adjusted for one-time items
and inventory changes declined 26 percent to $3.7 billion. That
exceeded the average estimate from analysts who forecast $3.4
billion in profit. Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is
scheduled to release results tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crown Holdings Inc. (CCK), a U.S.
consumer-goods packaging manufacturer, agreed to buy Spanish
food-can maker Mivisa Envases SAU for 1.2 billion euros ($1.64
billion) including debt from Blackstone Group LP (BX), N+1 Mercapital
and the company&#8217;s management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close next year, Philadelphia-based
Crown said today in a statement. The acquisition has committed
debt financing and is subject to review by the European
Commission and other regulatory authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crown plans to purchase Mivisa, the largest food-can
producer in the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, to expand in
Europe and the Middle East where Crown generated $4 billion of
sales in 2012, or 47 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue, according
to a filing. The Murcia, Spain-based company had sales of 555
million euros and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of 133 million euros in the year ended June 30,
Crown said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That implies Crown paid about 9 times Mivisa&#8217;s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The
average Ebitda multiple in four acquisitions of packaging
companies in the past 5 years valued at $100 million or more is
7.7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mivisa&#8217;s food-can business earns 24 percent Ebitda margins,
or double Crown&#8217;s European food-can margins, due to a much lower
cost structure, Philip Ng, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC,
wrote in a note today, referring to Crown by its stock ticker.
&#8220;With investors&#8217; appetite for companies with leverage to a
potential recovery in Europe, we view the acquisition as a
positive for Crown&#8217;s margin profile.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crown, which makes containers from beer and soft-drink cans
to candy boxes and aerosol spray bottles, rose 7.3 percent to
$43.60 at the close in New York, the most since Aug. 9, 2011.
The shares have climbed 18 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is marketing its biggest ever bond sale in euros, fueling
the busiest week for deals in the currency by U.S. borrowers in
six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider is marketing
2.5 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of seven- and 12-year
securities after Procter  Gamble Co. (PG) and Coca-Cola Enterprises
Inc. (CCE) sold a combined 1.1 billion euros of debt this week. The
average yield on investment-grade bonds in euros fell to a four-month low of 2 percent, 118 basis points below dollar rates,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies are seeking to lock in lower borrowing costs
as the European Central Bank pledged to hold down interest rates
to support the region&#8217;s nascent economic recovery. The Federal
Reserve fueled speculation it will begin scaling back stimulus
sooner than previously expected, with policy makers saying
yesterday the U.S. economy is showing signs of &#8220;underlying
strength.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies can raise funds quite a lot cheaper in
Europe,&#8221; said Jens Vanbrabant, lead money manager at London-based investment firm ECM Asset Management Ltd., which has $8.6
billion in credit under management and will invest in IBM&#8217;s
seven-year bonds. &#8220;Yields are a lot higher in the U.S. because
the tapering sell-off was much stronger there. This should
continue because the U.S. economy is growing faster, there is
more focus on tapering and potential rising yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two-Part Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is marketing 1.5 billion euros of notes maturing
November 2020 to yield 42 basis points more than the mid-swap
rate. It&#8217;s also offering 1 billion euros of securities due
November 2025 with a spread of 68 basis points, according to a
person familiar with the matter. The Armonk, New York-based
company last sold debt in euros in November 2012, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The euro market is strong and the conditions were right
to access the market,&#8221; said Doug Shelton, a spokesman for IBM
in New York. Proceeds from the bond sale will be used for
general corporate purposes, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average spread investors demand to hold high-grade
bonds in euros dropped to 80 basis points more than swaps, the
lowest in five weeks, according to Bloomberg bond index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;European bond investors are hungry for issuance as
European corporates reduced their net borrowings this year in
the wake of rating downgrades and austerity,&#8221; said Georg Grodzki, head of credit research at Legal  General Investment
Management in London. &#8220;By contrast, U.S. corporates are
massively buying back shares and need to raise more debt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PIK Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in European credit markets, AA Group Ltd., the
roadside recovery and insurance division of Folkestone, England-based Acromas Holdings Ltd., sold payment-in-kind toggle notes
to refinance existing debt, according to a person familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AA issued 350 million pounds ($561 million) of six-year
senior PIK toggle notes yielding 9.5 percent through its AA PIK
Co. Ltd. unit, the person said. The notes, which can be bought
back by the company after 1 1/2 years, give borrowers the option
of paying coupons with cash or more debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NH Hoteles SA (NHH), Spain&#8217;s largest business hotel chain, is
selling 250 million euros of six-year senior secured notes to
yield about 7 percent. The Madrid-based company is also
marketing 250 million euros of convertible notes paying a coupon
of 4 percent to refinance debt, according to a regulatory
filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. reiterated its preference for X5 Retail Group NV among
Russian retailers, Morgan Stanley (MS) reinforced its backing of
competitor OAO Magnit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders are siding with Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global depositary receipts of Magnit gained 0.6 percent to
$64.50 by 9:46 a.m. in London, after touching a record high of
8,719 rubles in Moscow yesterday. The stock has gained 80
percent this year, the best performance on Russia&#8217;s benchmark
Micex index. X5 slipped 1 percent to $16.08 yesterday and was
set for a 9.8 percent decline in 2013. The Bloomberg Russia-US
Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S.
slumped 0.5 percent as futures on Russia&#8217;s RTS Index fell in
U.S. hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley boosted its price estimate on Magnit&#8217;s
global depositary receipts by 23 percent, reiterating a buy
rating, a day after Goldman Sachs said a turnaround in the
management of X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE), Russia&#8217;s second-largest
retailer, will boost competition for the No.1 supermarket chain.
Magnit said on Oct. 28 that profit margin rose to a record high
while X5&#8217;s third-quarter revenue fell short of analysts
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I side with Morgan Stanley as we own Magnit and believe
in its potential to expand in Russian regions and further
increase revenue,&#8221; Mansur Mammadov, a money manager at Kazimir
Partners, which oversees $300 million in assets, said in a phone
interview from Moscow Oct. 30. &#8220;I was surprised with Goldman&#8217;s
report on X5. It will take another several quarters for X5 to
actually turn around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moscow Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X5, which has lost almost two-thirds of its market value
since mid-2011, formed a new management team as it plans to
refurbish stores in a bid to bolster sales. X5 seeks to improve
focus on the &#8220;individual needs&#8221; of its store formats and
improve supplier relationships, Chief Executive Officer Stephan
Ducharme told investors Oct. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnit, owned by billionaire Sergey Galitskiy, plans to
expand in Moscow and St. Petersburg, traditionally X5
strongholds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley increased its price estimate on Magnit to
$80 per London-listed depositary receipt. Goldman said in an
Oct. 29 note that X5 &#8220;can win the race&#8221;, reiterating a buy on
the stock and keeping it on the bank&#8217;s list of the most
recommended shares in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanya Barkas, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in New York,
said the firm&#8217;s office in London, which was closed after regular
business hours, oversees Magnit coverage. An e-mailed message to
Anna Leath, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in New York, wasn&#8217;t
immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADRs of OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), the worst-performing Russian oil
stock in New York in at the time, have jumped 18 percent since
Goldman Sachs predicted in August that it would rebound on
prospects of higher output and dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnit, which reported a record-high profit margin in the
third quarter, can double its market share in the next three to
four years, Natalya Kolupaeva, senior analyst at ZAO
Raiffeisenbank at Moscow, said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Magnit keeps amazing everyone,&#8221; Kolupaeva said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stable, clear and transparent company. It is a leader in the
market and will remain a leader. X5 can rise from the ashes, but
the risks it may fail to do so are also great.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolupaeva rates both stocks a hold and is in the process of
revising her recommendation on Magnit, she said, declining to
comment on whether she plans to upgrade it to a buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Moscow-listed shares of Magnit are a real opportunity for
investors,&#8221; Kolupaeva said. &#8220;The gap between London and Moscow
is still wide and will shrink over time because the local shares
become more accessible by foreign investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London Premium &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnit&#8217;s London depositary receipts traded at an 18 percent
premium to the Moscow-listed shares yesterday, the narrowest gap
since April 10, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Raiffeisenbank&#8217;s Kolupaeva expects the gap will shrink to about
5 percent in a year from now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While none of the analysts covering Magnit recommends
selling it, sell recommendation on X5 rose to an eight-month
high in October, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch raised X5 to a buy on Oct. 24, 10 days
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. and HSBC Holdings Plc cut their
recommendations to the equivalent of sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;World&#8217;s major banks have been lately showing a very
different vision on how to play Russia&#8217;s retail sector,&#8221;
Mammadov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge dropped to 103.69. The Market
Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S.-traded exchange-traded fund
that holds Russian shares, slipped 0.7 percent to $29.34. The
RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
index futures, dropped 7 percent to 21.70 today, while RTS
stock-index futures decreased 0.5 percent to 147,960 in U.S.
hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Co. Rusal, a Moscow-based aluminum producer dropped
0.8 percent to HK$2.37 in Hong Kong trading. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index fell 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
world&#8217;s largest dairy exporter, is seeking as much as a 10
percent stake in Australia&#8217;s Bega Cheese Ltd. (BGA), according to a
person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. is approaching Bega shareholders
on behalf of Fonterra and offering A$4.95 per share, said the
person, asking not to be identified as the information is
private. Bega, based in New South Wales state, closed today in
Sydney at A$4.41, giving it a market value of A$670 million
($636 million). Its shares have gained 10 percent this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bega, one of three bidders for Warrnambool Cheese  Butter
Factory Co., won Australian regulatory approval today to proceed
with its A$408 million offer for the dairy producer. Its cash
and stock offer is below the A$8 per bid offer made last week by
Montreal-based Saputo Inc. (SAP), which has support from Warrnambool&#8217;s
board, and is also lower than a A$7.50 per share cash proposal
from Murray Goulburn Cooperative Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonterra, which operates 10 manufacturing sites in
Australia with 1.7 billion liters of annual milk production,
this week hired Reunion Capital Partners&#8217; Mike Everett to advise
on &#8220;corporate activity in the dairy sector,&#8221; spokesman Carl
Stephens said Oct. 29. Everett is a former Goldman Sachs head of
equity capital markets in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Fonterra, Goldman Sachs and Bega declined to
comment or weren&#8217;t immediately available. The Australian
Financial Review reported on Fonterra&#8217;s stake purchase earlier
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), Japan&#8217;s largest beverage maker, bought
a 9.99 percent stake in Warrnambool on Oct. 29. Kirin&#8217;s
Australian unit Lion has a contract with Warrnambool to
manufacture cheese for its Coon and Cracker Barrel brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bega Cheese holds 18 percent of Warrnambool and Murray
Goulburn owns 17 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said that the
U.S. Department of Justice is conducting at least eight separate
investigations into the bank&#8217;s activities, ranging from
recruitment in Asia to its relationship with Ponzi scheme
operator Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank disclosed for the first time in a 
filing yesterday that the Justice Department is examining its
energy-trading practices, which were subject to a $410 million
civil settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
in July. Investigations are also focusing on mortgage-bond
sales, interest-rate rigging, the credit-derivatives market, and
the bank&#8217;s trading loss last year, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said that it&#8217;s a
priority for his department and for President Barack Obama to
hold banks accountable. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
visited Holder in September to try to negotiate a settlement of
mortgage-related cases against the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scope and breadth of risky practices at JPMorgan are
mind-boggling,&#8221; said Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve
bank examiner who teaches risk management at Boston University.
&#8220;Some of these probes are criminal, they&#8217;re not even just civil
anymore, and I think it&#8217;s very telling about the broad risk-taking culture that was allowed under Jamie Dimon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currency Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight Justice Department investigations disclosed in
JPMorgan&#8217;s filing compare with one in Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s.
Citigroup has disclosed two other investigations that weren&#8217;t
included in the latest filing because there was no material
change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosures don&#8217;t always specify whether the Justice
Department is involved. For instance, both JPMorgan and
Citigroup said they&#8217;re cooperating with inquiries into the
currency market without saying who&#8217;s doing the investigating.
The Justice Department is taking a leading role in the global
probe into possible manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day
foreign-exchange market, a department official said earlier this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose $2.4 trillion in assets make it the biggest
U.S. bank, last month reported its first quarterly loss under
Dimon, 57, after taking a $7.2 billion after-tax charge to cover
the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has tapped $8 billion of $28 billion in reserves
set aside since 2010 to cover legal costs. JPMorgan said
yesterday it may need as much as $5.7 billion more to cover
&#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses in excess of the reserve, even
after it added $9.2 billion in pretax cash to its litigation
funds in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Wrong Message&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s purchase of Bear Stearns Cos. and some of
Washington Mutual Inc.&#8217;s assets during the financial crisis have
contributed to the bank&#8217;s legal costs. American International
Group Inc. CEO Robert Benmosche said the tough line taken
against JPMorgan fails to account for the role that borrowers,
regulators and government played in the crisis and may dissuade
companies from making similar purchases in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No good deed will go unpunished, and I think it&#8217;s the
wrong message to send, but the politicians want to punish
someone here,&#8221; Benmosche, 69, said in an interview with Betty
Liu on Bloomberg Television yesterday. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to stop the
rhetoric about &#8216;We&#8217;ve got to get the bad guys,&#8217; because I think
most of us were the bad guys.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last week agreed to pay $5.1 billion to settle
claims from the Federal Housing Finance Agency that the bank
misrepresented the quality of mortgage bonds it sold to Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac. That resolved part of a $13 billion
settlement the company is seeking with state and federal
authorities to close multiple investigations into its mortgage-securities sales practices. The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in
Sacramento, California, is leading a criminal probe of the
bank&#8217;s mortgage business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities in the U.S. and overseas are also looking at
the bank&#8217;s employment of people referred by clients, potential
clients and government officials as well as hiring &#8220;of certain
former employees in Hong Kong, its business relationships with
certain related clients in the Asia Pacific region and its
engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region,&#8221;
according to JPMorgan&#8217;s filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office in Manhattan, run by Preet Bharara, is examining whether JPMorgan violated criminal anti-bribery laws in hiring the children and other relatives of well-connected politicians and clients in hopes of steering business
to the firm, a person with knowledge of the investigation said
in August. JPMorgan said it was cooperating with the
investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Madoff Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea, Singapore and India are among the locations
where hiring practices are being scrutinized, the New York Times
reported yesterday, citing unidentified people briefed on the
matter. Investigators include authorities in the U.K., it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharara&#8217;s office is also is conducting an investigation
into how JPMorgan handled Madoff&#8217;s funds and whether it turned a
blind eye to his multibillion-dollar fraud, the biggest Ponzi
scheme in U.S. history. Bharara is weighing a deferred
prosecution agreement or fine for JPMorgan in the Madoff probe,
a person familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed yesterday that Bharara&#8217;s office is
examining whether the bank manipulated the electricity market.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into JPMorgan&#8217;s
settlement with the FERC to see if any individuals committed any
crimes, a person briefed on the matter said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office is also conducting an investigation into
JPMorgan&#8217;s record trading loss last year by Bruno Iksil, who
became known as the London whale because of the size of his
trading bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Libor, CDS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan trader Julien Grout and his former boss,
Javier Martin-Artajo, both of whom are in Europe and worked with
Iksil, were indicted on securities fraud charges after being
accused of trying to hide some of the more than $6.2 billion in
losses in their unit last year. Grout and Martin-Artajo have
denied wrongdoing, while Iksil is cooperating in the
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, JPMorgan is part of an industrywide
investigation by the Justice Department and others looking at
whether banks in the U.S. and abroad rigged benchmark interest
rates tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The
bank is cooperating with a probe of the credit-default swaps
market that started in 2009, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said that it&#8217;s also facing a civil investigation
into its compliance with the Federal Housing Administration&#8217;s
direct endorsement program, which streamlines origination of
federally insured home loans by banks and other lenders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Core Bond Fund
reported a $2.3 billion withdrawal this week that spurred the
biggest weekly outflow from U.S. investment-grade debt funds
since June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund&#8217;s net assets dropped 9.2 percent to $22.38 billion
on Oct. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investment-grade funds reported a $2.67 billion outflow during the past
week, with most of it coming from one fund, Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) credit strategists Hans Mikkelsen and Yuriy Shchuchinov
said in an Oct. 31 report, citing data from EPFR Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The withdrawal reported &#8220;was likely a one-off event and no
signal of a broader rotation out of high-grade bond funds,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade bonds in the U.S. gained 1.5 percent in
October as speculation mounted that the Federal Reserve will
maintain its $85 billion of monthly asset purchases through
March. Companies have sold $991.4 billion of the debt so far
this year, on pace for the most ever, from $945.4 billion during
the same period last year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Core Bond Fund (WOBDX) was started on Dec. 31, 1983,
and focuses on investment-grade notes with medium-term
maturities, according to the data. It had 25 percent of its
assets in corporate bonds and 55.8 percent in mortgage debt as
of Aug. 31, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest U.S. payments network, is poised to further outperform bigger rival Visa Inc. amid a 3 percent gain by the euro this year and signs that European consumer spending is picking up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MasterCard, whose stock has outpaced Visa&#8217;s in 2013, could gain another 15 percent in two years as the sovereign-debt crisis eases, said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC. Europe can boost MasterCard&#8217;s purchase volume, transactions and revenue for at least the next two quarters, Sterne Agee  Leach Inc.&#8217;s Greg Smith said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MasterCard does more business in Europe than Visa, which generates about 2 percent of its revenue in the region. Should Europe&#8217;s economy and currency continue to strengthen at their current pace, Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is more likely to see a boost in profits and stock performance, both analysts said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe is a significant catalyst for MasterCard relative to Visa,&#8221; Smith, who has a neutral rating on the company, said yesterday in a telephone interview. &#8220;Assuming these general short trends continue, the underlying metrics are going to look a little better for MasterCard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MasterCard said yesterday in a statement that third-quarter net income rose 14 percent to $879 million, or $7.27 a share, as Europe credit- and debit-card spending climbed 14 percent. Visa, led by Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, said on Oct. 30 that net income fell 28 percent as revenue missed analysts&#8217; forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
Inc. (C), two of the three largest U.S. banks, said they&#8217;re
cooperating with various probes into the firms&#8217; foreign-exchange
trading businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These investigations are in the early stages and the firm
is cooperating with the relevant authorities,&#8221; New York-based
JPMorgan said today in a quarterly filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Citigroup, also based in New
York, said in its 10-Q filing that it&#8217;s responding to requests
for information on probes by government agencies in the U.S. and
other jurisdictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in London, Zurich, the U.S. and Asia are probing

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy producer by market value, reported third-quarter
profit below estimates as weaker refining margins eroded gains
from higher commodity prices and output from wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was $4.95 billion, or $2.57 a share, compared
with $5.25 billion, or $2.69, a year earlier, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement today. The per-share result was 13 cents lower than the $2.70 average of 21
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron warned in an Oct. 9 statement that quarterly profit
had been eroded by &#8220;significantly lower&#8221; earnings in its so-called downstream business, which includes refining and filling
stations. Maintenance work at the company&#8217;s El Segundo,
California, refinery mostly offset an increase in fuel
production at a separate Chevron plant near San Francisco,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson is
spending $36.7 billion this year in a push to raise oil and
natural gas production by 1.5 percent to the equivalent of 2.65
million barrels of oil a day. The capital spending budget
represents a 7.3 percent increase from 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s stock has increased 11 percent this year,
outperforming the company&#8217;s bigger U.S. rival, Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM), which has gained less than 3 percent. Today&#8217;s statement
was released before the opening of regular U.S. stock trading.
Chevron fell 0.3 percent to $119.96 in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, disclosed that authorities in the U.S. and abroad are
investigating the lender&#8217;s hiring practices in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has received subpoenas from the Securities and
Exchange Commission and document requests from both the SEC and
the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a company filing
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities in the U.S. and abroad are looking at the
bank&#8217;s employment of people referred by clients, potential
clients and government officials as well as hiring &#8220;of certain
former employees in Hong Kong, its business relationships with
certain related clients in the Asia Pacific region and its
engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region,&#8221; the bank
said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and SEC are examining whether
JPMorgan hired the children and other relatives of well-connected politicians and clients in hopes of steering business
to the firm, possibly violating anti-bribery laws, a person with
knowledge of the investigation said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm is cooperating with these investigations,&#8221; the
New York-based bank said in the filing today. &#8220;Separate
inquiries on these or similar topics have been made by other
authorities, including authorities in other jurisdictions, and
the firm is responding to those inquiries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) traders
generated profits every day in the third quarter, extending
their perfect record for 2013 as the Federal Reserve backed off
plans to curtail a bond-purchase program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders made more than $200 million on three days this
year, JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. The New York-based company is the biggest U.S. lender by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has been whipsawed as the Federal Reserve
debates whether the economy is strong enough to justify reducing
monthly bond purchases of about $85 billion that have kept
borrowing costs low. Ten-year Treasury yields, which are used to
set rates for some consumer and corporate loans, rose from this
year&#8217;s low of 1.63 percent on May 2 to 3 percent on Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading revenue at JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate and investment
bank, run by Daniel Pinto and Michael Cavanagh, fell 2 percent
to $4.69 billion in the third quarter, the bank said when it
reported earnings on Oct. 11. Fixed-income trading revenue
declined 8 percent to $3.44 billion from a year earlier while
equity-trading revenue rose 20 percent to $1.25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, said it&#8217;s cooperating with various government
authorities investigating the firm&#8217;s foreign-exchange trading
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These investigations are in the early stages and the firm
is cooperating with the relevant authorities,&#8221; the New York-based company said today in a quarterly filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc. (C) put their top London currency
dealers on leave after regulators probing the manipulation of
foreign-exchange rates started investigating the traders&#8217; use of
an instant-message group, three people with knowledge of the
moves said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are focusing on an instant-message group the
traders set up to share information about their positions and
client orders over a period of at least three years, four people
with knowledge of the probe said last month. The roster of banks
in the group changed as the men moved firms and also included
Barclays Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG, three
people with knowledge of the communications said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators are weighing whether the messages amounted to
attempts to manipulate the market, two people said. The five
firms account for about 47 percent of the $5.3 trillion-a-day
foreign-exchange market, according to a May survey by Euromoney
Institutional Investor Plc. Two other traders, who weren&#8217;t part
of the conversations and who asked to not be identified because
they do business with those involved, said that they and others
in the market referred to the message group as &#8220;The Cartel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve decided to press

&lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Obamacare rollout is leading to

&lt;p&gt;Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc has suspended three

&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Apple&#8217;s New IPad Is Slimmed Down, Speeded Up: Rich
Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Apple calls the latest version of

&#8220;iPad Semi Mini.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If Fed Can&#8217;t Get Good Numbers, Check the Leaders: Caroline
Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Financial markets have become
increasingly dependent on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is
dependent on data (just in case you didn&#8217;t know). The data for
the next few months will be distorted by the federal government
shutdown during the first half of October. So what&#8217;s a
responsible policy maker or investor to do to get a handle on
how the U.S. economy is faring? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. China Mimics the Worst of Abenomics at Worst Time: William
Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- If imitation really is the greatest

Weil &lt;/p&gt;

Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Shinzo Abe is so obsessed with China
eclipsing Japan on the global stage that he&#8217;s adopting some of
his neighbor&#8217;s policies. What else can we say about the secrecy
law the prime minister&#8217;s cabinet approved on Oct. 25, an act
that would do so much to undermine and constrain his people&#8217;s
right to know? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
most-read Bloomberg News reports during October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Stocks Rally Most Since January, Bill Rates Fall on Debt
Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks jumped the most since
January and Treasury bill rates tumbled as lawmakers moved
toward an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a

&lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks surged while the

&lt;h2&gt;4. Goldman Shrinking Pay Shows Wall Street Set for Bonus Gloom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which set

many as eight Olympians and even more of their world- or Olympic

&lt;p&gt;Oct. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Anyone who remembers the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. little more than five years ago
knows what a global financial disaster is. A U.S. government
default, just weeks away if Congress fails to raise the debt
ceiling as it now threatens to do, will be an economic calamity
like none the world has ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Ex-RBS Trader in U.K. Currency Probe Said to Be JPMorgan&#8217;s
Usher &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Richard Usher, JPMorgan Chase

&lt;p&gt;Oct. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc has

concluding a former currency trader&#8217;s communications with
counterparts at other firms may have been inappropriate,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

Shilling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- After the recent recession, the
personal-taxes-to-personal-income ratio dropped well below the
12.3 percent long-run average, a casualty of the tax cuts,
depressed household incomes and the weak recovery. In
combination with depressed corporate tax collections and
increased federal spending -- especially in 2009, when outlays
equaled 6 percent of gross domestic product -- these forces
pushed the federal deficit to more than $1 trillion a year. &lt;/p&gt;

announcer Biff Burns came to mind this weekend amid all of the
anonymously attributed news reports that the Justice Department
had reached a tentative settlement agreement with JPMorgan Chase
 Co. worth $13 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  Steve Jobs Never Worried About Debt Ceiling: Caroline Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Everyone knows, or has heard the
cliche, that markets hate uncertainty. It&#8217;s also a given that
the future is always uncertain. How, then, do markets ever
manage to function -- or, for that matter, businesses, which
must make decisions today about investments that will pay off in
the future? &lt;/p&gt;
