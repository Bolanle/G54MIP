<p>Walt Disney Co. named Playdom Chief
Executive Officer John Pleasants and James Pitaro, head of
Yahoo! Inc.''s media unit, co-presidents of the interactive media
group, revamping digital operations to reverse losses. </p>
<p>The pair replace Steve Wadsworth, a 17-year Disney division
head who left in September, the company said today in a
statement. Pleasants and Pitaro, who start Oct. 18, will oversee
the unit focused on the digital-games market and selling online
sites based on Disney''s TV shows, movies and characters. </p>
<p>The appointments will allow Disney, world''s largest media
company, to build upon the digital assets acquired in the past
three years, Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said. The
interactive business lost $130 million through the first nine
months of the year, making it the only unprofitable division. </p>
<p>We see this as a growth area and we need people
experienced in how to best operate them, Iger, 59, said in an
interview today. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 24 cents to
$33.34 on Oct. 1. The shares have gained 22 percent during the
past year, compared with an 11 percent increase for the Standard
 Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>In 2007, Disney bought children''s social network Club
Penguin for $350 million, following that this July with social-
gaming site Playdom, paying $563 million. The company also has
bought Wideload Games and mobile-content site Tapulous. </p>
<p>Iger said he intends to allow the two men freedom to
run the units, and Pleasants will keep working from Playdom''s
office in Palo Alto, California. Iger described the arrangement
as similar to Disney''s acquisition of Pixar, which operates
mostly independently of Disney''s film studio. </p>
<p>Pleasants, a former CEO at Ticketmaster, will oversee
Playdom, Disney''s Club Penguin, the World of Cars virtual unit
and Tapulous. Pitaro will run Disney.com, Family.com, and its
social-media marketing agency DigiSynd. At Yahoo, Pitaro
expanded Yahoo! Sports and upgraded its news, finance,
entertainment and lifestyle coverage, Disney said. </p>

<p>A Pfizer Inc. unit failed to properly
warn doctors and consumers that its Prempro menopause drug could
cause breast cancer, a lawyer for an Arkansas woman who
developed the disease told jurors. </p>
<p>Officials of Pfizer''s Wyeth subsidiary knew women like
Margaret Wilson were at risk for the disease by taking the
hormone-replacement drug and kept quiet to pump up sales, Chris
Kirchmer, a lawyer for Wilson, told a federal court jury in
Little Rock, Arkansas. </p>
<p>After studies showed the risks of Prempro, they never
once changed their warnings, Kirchmer said today in opening
statements in the trial of Wilson''s lawsuit over the drug. The
evidence will show you that they did not act responsibly. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth''s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women''s Health Initiative, a National Institutes of
Health-sponsored study, concluded they posed an increased risk
of cancer. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn''s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Safety Label </p>
<p>Wyeth officials contend they provided adequate warnings
about Prempro''s cancer risks on the drug''s safety label.
Wilson''s lawyers won''t be able to show the pills caused her
cancer, said Lyn Pruitt, a lawyer for the company, in her
opening statement. </p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson would have gotten breast cancer whether she
took Prempro or not, said Pruitt of Mitchell Williams Selig
Gates  Woodyard in Little Rock. Prempro didn''t cause it and
nobody knows what caused it. </p>
<p>Pruitt said Wilson had other possible risk factors for
cancer. They included her age, weight and menopause as well as
having a daughter who died of breast cancer, Pruitt said. </p>
<p>Wyeth has lost seven of the 12 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. The drugmaker got some of
those verdicts thrown out after trial or had the awards reduced. </p>
<p>Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, according to court filings. Pfizer, the world''s
largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
last year. </p>
<p>Wilson, a 68-year-old bank teller from Trumann, Arkansas,
took the drug for six years before being diagnosed with breast
cancer in 2002, according to court filings. </p>
<p>Corporate Responsibility'' </p>
<p>It is a case about the breast cancer that they caused,
Kirchmer said. It is a case about corporate responsibility. </p>
<p>The first witness, Donald Austin, an epidemiologist from
the University of Oregon, testified that Prempro causes breast
cancer. He said that after the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative study, use of Prempro dropped precipitously
because of concerns over breast cancer. </p>
<p>Wyeth attorney David Dukes asked Austin whether the vast
majority of women taking hormone replacement therapy drugs
don''t get breast cancer. Austin replied that they didn''t. </p>
<p>Austin also acknowledged there are other risk factors for
breast cancer, including age, obesity, breast density and having
a first-degree relative, such as a daughter, who had breast
cancer. </p>
<p>8,000 Cases </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Wilson, who is presiding over
the case, is overseeing more than 8,000 cases over the drugs
that have been consolidated in his court for pre-trial
information exchanges and some early trials. The plaintiff in
the current trial isn''t related to the judge. </p>
<p>Wyeth officials have faced repeated criticism over the
marketing of their menopause drugs, including allegations that
the company paid for ghostwritten articles in medical journals
that overstated the effectiveness of the medicines. </p>
<p>The case is Wilson v. Wyeth, MDL 03-cv-1507-WRW, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas (Little Rock). </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp.
is starting an online video game that simulates business and
city problems and provides different technologies to solve them,
aiming to boost sales of services and software. </p>
<p>Users choose from four sectors -- banking, retail, water or
energy -- and solve related problems, such as monitoring a
city''s water quality or power supply. Users can download the
game, called CityOne, for free starting today, Nancy Pearson, a
vice president in IBM''s software business, said in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>The game, which lets users pick different technology
options and compare results, may increase awareness and sales of
new services at IBM, Pearson said. IBM has been investing in
technology for its Smarter Planet program, the idea that
anything from buildings to utility grids can be digitally
measured to be more efficient. Such technology will generate
about $10 billion in sales by 2015, Armonk, New York-based IBM
said in May. </p>
<p>This is a way to engage people who may not have thought
of IBM before in this way, Pearson said. </p>
<p>More than 7,000 people have signed up to download the game,
including members of universities, governments and businesses,
she said. Users will be able to chat via the Internet with IBM
representatives if they have questions. </p>
<p>The banking and retail paths of the game will present more
business-related problems, such as boosting risk management,
Pearson said. The company plans to add more sectors and
scenarios to the game, Pearson said. </p>
<p>IBM fell 39 cents to $135.25 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 3.3 percent

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. won
extensions for loans backed by its Hudson New York hotel in
Manhattan and the Mondrian Los Angeles after paying down a
portion of the money owed on the two properties. </p>
<p>The debts now will expire in October 2011, the New York-
based hotelier said. Morgans paid down $16 million of the Hudson
loan and $17 million of the Mondrian debt, bringing the
outstanding amount on the Hudson''s first mortgage to $201.2
million and the Mondrian''s remaining debt to $103.5 million. </p>
<p>Both properties are luxury hotels developed by Ian Schrager. Bookings have started to rise at luxury chains, hurt
more than their cheaper competitors by the U.S. recession. Hotel
occupancies in the top 25 U.S. markets climbed to 65 percent
this year through August from 61 percent a year earlier, Smith
Travel Research Inc. said. Luxury hotels had the biggest gain,
with occupancies rising to 67 percent from 62 percent. </p>
<p>Morgans exchanged interest rates tied to the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, for a fixed 5 percent rate
four years ago, when rates were higher, Chief Financial Officer
Richard Szymanski said in a telephone interview. The loans
expired in July. Morgans now pays Libor plus 1.03 percent on the
Hudson loan and Libor plus 1.64 percent on the Mondrian loan.
The Libor for three-month loans was 0.291 percent today. </p>
<p>We got very attractive financing, which is giving us
breathing room, President Marc Gordon said in a telephone
interview. This is a culmination of a series of transactions,
the result of which is that none of our debt is an issue at this
time. Income in our top markets has been up. </p>
<p>Rising Rates </p>
<p>Mid-week rates for a standard room start at $349 at the
Hudson and $345 at the Mondrian for the week of Oct. 18,
according to the hotels'' websites. That''s up from $229 in May at
the New York hotel and $295 at the West Hollywood, California,
property. </p>
<p>The loans on the Hudson and Mondrian had been sent to a
special servicer in May because of imminent default, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The special servicer on both
loans was CWCapital Asset Management LLC. </p>
<p>Rooms at the Hudson boast wood-paneled walls and floors
imported from Africa. Hudson Hall, the hotel''s renovated
restaurant, is reminiscent of an Ivy League mess hall with long,
wooden communal tables. In the lobby, designed by Philippe Starck, ivy climbs along the 40-foot ceilings. At the Mondrian,
on Sunset Boulevard, the lobby features a swing. </p>
<p>Schrager, the hotels'' developer, created the Studio 54 and
Palladium nightclubs together with his late business partner,
Steve Rubell. Schrager helped revive the concept of the boutique
hotel in 1984 with the opening of the Morgans Hotel in New York. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts cut
Microsoft Corp. shares to neutral, citing the world''s
largest software company''s struggles to gain market share in
mobile devices. </p>
<p>Microsoft was removed from the bank''s Americas Buy List,
with a price target of $28 rather than $32, Goldman Sachs
analysts including Sarah Friar wrote in a note to clients. The
company needs to win a firmer foothold in the growing
migration to mobile devices in order to improve investor
sentiment, they wrote. </p>
<p>Microsoft has struggled to match mobile offerings from
rivals including Apple Inc. and Google Inc., whose Android
software powers high-end phones and tablet computers. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft has yet to release a tablet computer
to compete with Apple''s iPad, 3 million of which were sold in
the first 80 days of its release. </p>
<p>A rebound by Microsoft is unlikely this year since
Apple''s iPad and iPhone plus Google''s Android operating system
are well established, the Goldman analysts wrote. </p>
<p>The company may also be held back by corporate clients
replacing computers more slowly because of budget pressures, and
cannibalization of laptop computer sales in favor of
tablets, they said. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 48 cents, or 2 percent, to $23.90 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading at 9:35 a.m. New York time. The stock had
lost 20 percent this year before today. </p>

<p>Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc, said that while the Federal Reserve
will very likely take more steps to ease monetary policy,
asset purchases will have a limited effect on the economy. </p>
<p>They''re going to do quite a lot but it''s probably still
going to fall short, Hatzius said today at a fiscal policy
conference in Washington. There is going to be a natural bias
towards caution among monetary policy makers. </p>
<p>Hatzius, who''s based in New York, said another $1 trillion
worth of asset purchases by the Fed would probably lower long-
term interest rates by about 0.25 percentage point, adding a
few tenths of additional GDP growth. The Fed bought $1.7
trillion worth of Treasury and mortgage debt in a program that
ended in March. The purchases helped push mortgage rates to
historic lows, stabilizing housing. </p>
<p>New York Fed Bank President William Dudley on Oct. 1 said
the Fed would probably need to take action to spur the recovery
and avert deflation, one of the clearest signs policy makers
would start a second round of unconventional monetary easing as
soon as the central bankers'' next meeting Nov. 2-3. </p>
<p>Dudley, who serves as vice chairman of the Fed''s policy
making Open Market Committee, said in last week''s speech that
$500 billion of asset purchases, for example, would add as much
stimulus as reducing the Fed''s benchmark rate 0.5 percentage
point to 0.75 percentage point, depending on how long investors
expect the Fed to hold the assets. </p>
<p>Hatzius, 41, said his two scenarios for the U.S. economy
were pretty bad and very bad. </p>
<p>10% Unemployment </p>
<p>The economy will grow between 1 percent and 2 percent
through early next year, with unemployment drifting up to
somewhere around 10 percent, maybe a little above 10 percent,
he said. In August, the jobless rate was 9.6 percent, close to
the 26-year high of 10.1 percent reached in October 2009. </p>
<p>It''s going to take many years before you get back to
anything approaching full unemployment, and 2014 is very likely
too early, said Hatzius. </p>
<p>He placed the odds of a renewed recession at 25 percent to
30 percent, which he told reporters was up from 15 percent to 20
percent at the beginning of the year. The double-dip recession
scenario was based on a renewed decline in housing prices and
failure to extend most of former President George W. Bush''s tax
cuts when they expire at the end of this year. </p>
<p>Hatzius was rated by Bloomberg Markets Magazine last year
as top forecaster of the U.S. economy for the period spanning
the second half of 2008 through the first six months of 2009. He
and his team were also No. 1 in forecasting GDP and No. 2 in
estimating unemployment and Federal Reserve changes to the fed
funds rate. </p>

<p>Jerome Kerviel was sentenced to three
years in prison and ordered to repay Societe Generale SA''s 4.9
billion-euro ($6.8 billion) trading loss by a judge who said the
former trader''s actions threatened the bank''s existence. </p>
<p>By his deliberate actions, he put in peril the existence
of the bank that employed 140,000 people, of which he was a
part, and whose future was threatened, Judge Dominique Pauthe
said today in finding Kerviel guilty of breach of trust, forging
documents and computer hacking. </p>
<p>The trading loss, announced Jan. 24, 2008, was the biggest
ever and prompted then-chief executive officer Daniel Bouton to
describe Kerviel as a terrorist. The court placed the blame
for the loss on Kerviel alone, rejecting defense arguments
during a three-week trial in June that his superiors knew of his
actions and that the bank''s decision to unwind the bets over
three days of falling markets caused the loss. </p>
<p>The 4.9 billion-euro award is obviously symbolic,
Christopher Mesnooh, a Paris-based lawyer with Field Fisher
Waterhouse LLP, said in a telephone interview. It goes a very
long way in exonerating the bank and putting responsibility for
the losses, including the winding down of the positions by
Societe Generale, entirely in Jerome''s court. </p>
<p>No one has any expectation that he''ll pay, said
Mesnooh, who isn''t involved in the Kerviel case. </p>
<p>Olivier Metzner, Kerviel''s lawyer, said he would appeal the
ruling, and that Kerviel would obviously not be able to
repay the loss. Dressed in a dark suit, Kerviel, 33, sat in
court following the decision reading on his iPhone. He will
remain free during the appeal. </p>
<p>The former trader is revolted that those that created him
put all responsibility on him, Metzner said, noting Kerviel
wouldn''t comment directly. Prison is unacceptable for a man
who didn''t make a penny. </p>
<p>Pauthe said problems with Societe Generale''s computer
controls and management''s encouragement of traders to speculate
wasn''t enough to absolve Kerviel. </p>
<p>The lack of vigilance by the bank in monitoring the only
existing limits, acting as alert signs, hardly exempted Jerome
Kerviel from his duty to inform his hierarchy of the reality of
his excesses or to come back to the limits imposed, Pauthe
said in reading excerpts of the decision. </p>
<p>Jean Veil, the lawyer representing Societe Generale, said
he was satisfied by the guilty verdict and award, which the
Paris-based bank had requested at trial. </p>
<p>The award confirms what Societe Generale has always told
its shareholders and employees, Veil said. </p>

<p>MasterCard, Visa Settle as Amex Fights U.S. Lawsuit </p>
<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. reached a settlement with the
U.S. Justice Department to resolve a two-year antitrust
investigation over restrictions on merchants. </p>
<p>The settlement was filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New
York, yesterday as the Justice Department filed charges against
Visa, MasterCard and American Express Co. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s settlement means that about 4 million merchants
across the U.S. that accept just Visa and MasterCard are now
free to steer customers to different credit cards or forms of
payment by offering discounts, rebates or other special
treatment, the Justice Department said. Six million more
retailers who also accept cards from American Express are still
subject to restrictions until the lawsuit is resolved, the
Justice Department said. </p>
<p>We want to put money in consumers'' pockets, said
Attorney General Eric Holder at a press conference. By
eliminating credit-card companies'' anticompetitive rules, we
will accomplish that. </p>
<p>American Express spokesman Michael O''Neill said his company
would fight the charges. We do not intend to settle, he
said. </p>
<p>The U.S. probe focused on rules that bar merchants from
charging extra to customers who use credit cards and steering
them to competing cards, and that require retailers to accept
every type of card banks issue. </p>

<p>Merck Verdict Cut to $1.5 Million From $8 Million </p>
<p>A federal judge cut a jury award against Merck  Co. in a
lawsuit over its Fosamax osteoporosis drug to $1.5 million from
$8 million while upholding the verdict in the case. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan in Manhattan yesterday
denied Merck''s request for a defense verdict or a new trial. The
case resulted in a verdict for Shirley Boles, a 72-year-old Fort
Walton Beach, Florida, woman who claimed she developed
osteonecrosis of the jaw, or so-called jaw death, from taking
Fosamax. </p>
<p>Keenan ruled that the $8 million verdict was unreasonably
high. He said Boles may choose between a reduced award of $1.5
million or a retrial to determine damages. </p>
<p>A significant damage award is warranted, but the $8
million deviates substantially from what would be reasonable
compensation, Keenan wrote. </p>
<p>Merck said it will appeal Keenan''s refusal to throw out the
verdict entirely or to order a new trial. </p>
<p>Both the finding and the amount of compensatory damages
are against the weight of the evidence, Bruce N. Kuhlik,
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck''s general counsel,
said in a statement. The evidence showed that Fosamax did not
cause the plaintiff''s injury and that it is a safe and effective
medication that was properly designed. </p>
<p>The case is Boles v. Merck  Co., 06-cv-09455, and the
lawsuits are combined in In Re Fosamax Products Liability
Litigation, MDL 1789, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>Rajaratnam Asks Court to Find U.S. Wiretaps Illegal </p>
<p>Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam is seeking to show
that U.S. agents illegally wiretapped his communications and
that the recordings can''t be used in his criminal insider-
trading trial. </p>
<p>At a hearing yesterday in federal court in Manhattan,
Rajaratnam tried to convince U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell
that the government misled a different judge into authorizing
the wiretaps in March 2008. As a result, the wiretaps, the
centerpiece of the biggest insider-trading prosecution in
history, must be thrown out, he claims. </p>
<p>They gamed the system, John Dowd, a lawyer for
Rajaratnam, said. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 53, is accused of using tips from company
executives, hedge-fund employees and others in a multimillion-
dollar insider-trading scheme. He''s the central figure in an
investigation in which 21 were charged. Rajaratnam, who denies
wrongdoing, faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted. </p>
<p>Dowd argued that U.S. investigators hid from Gerard Lynch,
the federal judge who issued the wiretap warrant, the fact that
the Securities and Exchange Commission had already assembled the
elements of a classic insider-trading case against
Rajaratnam and others. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said the government secretly recorded about

<p>Swiss Re Wins Dismissal of Credit Default Swaps Suit </p>
<p>Swiss Reinsurance Co. the world''s second-biggest reinsurer,
won dismissal of an investor suit in which it was accused of
failing to disclose risk that led to a 1.2 billion franc ($1.1
billion) derivative loss over credit-default swaps. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in New York yesterday
dismissed the suit on grounds including a June ruling by the
U.S. Supreme Court that limits the reach of civil claims for
acts occurring outside the country. Koeltl said the plaintiffs
also failed to supply sufficient details of their fraud claims. </p>
<p>Swiss Re made false and misleading statements about the
company''s financial condition, the shareholders claimed in the
2008 lawsuit. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs have failed to allege with particularity
that the defendants made any material misstatements or omissions
with respect to the CDSs it had insured or that the defendants
had any obligation to provide further disclosure with respect to
the CDSs it had issued, Koeltl said. </p>
<p>The lead plaintiff, Plumbers Union Local No. 12 Pension
Fund, sued on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of Swiss
Re''s common shares from March 1, 2007, to Nov. 19, 2007. </p>
<p>The complaint described statements that the defendants made
about Swiss Re''s involvement with mortgage-related securities,
with the subprime mortgage market, Swiss Re''s management
practices and the value of its earnings and accounts. </p>
<p>Koeltl cited the Supreme Court ruling in Morrison v.
National Australia Bank issued in June that limits the reach of
civil claims for acts occurring outside the U.S. He said that
ruling disagreed with the plaintiffs'' argument that a purchase
occurs when and where an investor places a buy order. </p>
<p>Neither a lawyer for the plaintiffs nor a spokeswoman for
Swiss Re could be reached yesterday for comment. </p>
<p>The case is Plumbers'' Union Local No.12 v. Swiss
Reinsurance Co., 1:08-cv-1958, U.S. District Court, Southern

<p>Deutsche Bank Wins Order for Singapore End to Indonesia Dispute </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG won a court order that a company
controlled by two of Indonesia''s richest men must end legal
attempts outside Singapore to regain pledged shares that
Germany''s biggest bank sold. </p>
<p>Beckkett Pte, controlled by Sukanto Tanoto and Hashim
Djojohadikusumo, can''t pursue duplicate proceedings after six
years in the Singapore courts, Singapore High Court Judge Judith
Prakash said in SGHC 284notShowClose=y] a ruling made public yesterday. </p>
<p>The ruling was made on an appeal by Deutsche Bank, which
had asked Beckkett to withdraw a separate Indonesian lawsuit
from 2008, and challenged a February decision by Singapore''s
assistant registrar not to order the Indonesian proceedings to
be halted. Singapore''s Court of Appeal last year ruled that the
bank didn''t take proper steps to sell the shares in companies
including coal miner PT Adaro Indonesia at the best price. </p>
<p>Beckkett, which had pledged the shares as collateral for a
1997 loan to its unit PT Asminco Baru Utama, was entitled to
have any losses determined. The Court of Appeal also allowed
Deutsche Bank to make a counterclaim for an outstanding loan. </p>
<p>Beckkett had no business starting the Indonesian action
in the first place, Judge Prakash wrote. There was no excuse
for it to attempt to bypass a possibly unfavorable decision of
the Singapore courts by taking action in Indonesia. </p>
<p>Laurel Teo, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Beckkett,
declined to comment, as did Michael West, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman at Deutsche Bank. </p>
<p>The case is Beckkett Pte Ltd. v. Deutsche Bank AG and Anor,
S326/2004, Singapore High Court. </p>
<p>Tyco Wins Bid to Exclude Some Evidence Against Walsh </p>
<p>Tyco International Ltd. won a bid to exclude some evidence
in a lawsuit that centers on ex-director Frank E. Walsh Jr.''s
$20 million finder''s fee related to the purchase of CIT
Group Inc. </p>
<p>Walsh had asked U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York
to bar Tyco from putting attorneys'' fees into evidence at trial.
Tyco persuaded Cote that the fees were evidence of damages
sustained by the company and that Walsh''s conduct triggered an
internal investigation by the law firm of Boies, Schiller 
Flexner LLP, which was hired to investigate the payment. </p>
<p>Tyco has shown that the evidence is properly admitted at
trial, Cote said. </p>
<p>In a separate ruling, Cote denied a bid by Tyco to exclude
the testimony of an expert witness Walsh wants at a trial about
Bermuda law. Walsh said he relied upon the advice in connection
with his receipt of the $20 million from Tyco. </p>
<p>Walsh, who was lead director and a member of the
corporate governance committee, hid the payment from the board
and later refused to return it, Tyco alleges in a suit filed in
New York in 2002. Tyco alleges seven causes of action, including
that Walsh breached his fiduciary duty when he accepted the
payment. He denies allegations of any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Mark Levine, a lawyer for Tyco, declined comment. Michele
Pahmer, a lawyer for Walsh, didn''t return a voice-mail message
left at her office seeking comment. </p>
<p>The case is Tyco International Ltd. v. Frank Walsh Jr. 02-

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Sued Over German Bank''s $37 Million Loss on CDO </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which served as the placement
agent for a collateralized debt obligation named Davis Square
Funding VI, was sued by Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg over its
$37 million loss on the investment. </p>
<p>The CDO held 95 percent residential mortgage-backed
securities, of which 33 percent were subprime and 46 percent
were midprime, the German bank said in a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. TCW Group Inc., the
investment adviser on the CDO, was also sued by the bank. </p>
<p>When Goldman sold the investments to a Luxembourg affiliate
of LBBW in March 2006, they were represented as safe, secure,
and nearly risk free, according to the complaint. At the same
time, Goldman senior executives privately observed that it was
game over for subprime lenders and were reducing their
exposure to the mortgages, LBBW said. </p>
<p>Goldman knew at the highest levels of its organization
that its representations to LBBW Luxemburg that the notes
merited triple-A ratings and were high grade were blatantly
false, the Stuttgart-based bank said. Goldman committed
fraud and, or, was negligent in marketing and selling the notes
to LBBW Luxemburg. </p>
<p>TCW has acted appropriately in managing Davis Square VI
and any allegation to the contrary is without merit, the
company said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said yesterday that the company had no immediate comment. </p>
<p>The case is Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg v. Goldman Sachs,
10-7549, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York

<p>Citigroup, Ally Accused of Racketeering With Mortgage Database </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. and Ally Financial Inc. units were sued by
homeowners in Kentucky who allege they conspired with Mortgage
Electronic Registration Systems Inc. to falsely foreclose on
mortgages. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed as a civil racketeering class action on
behalf all Kentucky homeowners facing foreclosure, also names as
a defendant Reston, Virginia-based MERS, the company that
handles mortgage transfers among member banks. The suit claims
that through MERS the banks are foreclosing on homes even when
they don''t hold titles to the properties. </p>
<p>Defendants have filed foreclosures throughout the State
of Kentucky and the United States of America knowing that they
were not the owners'' or beneficiaries of the loan they filed
foreclosure upon, the home owners wrote in their complaint
filed Sept. 28 in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is one of multiple cases against MERS and banks
alleging that the process allows wrongful foreclosures. Several
of these cases, combined in a multidistrict litigation in
Phoenix were dismissed Sept. 30, with the judge allowing the
plaintiffs to re-file their complaints. </p>
<p>The allegation is inflammatory and without merit and we
intend to defend our position fully in a court of law, Gina
Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to
comment. Karmela Lejarde, a spokeswoman for MERS, didn''t have an
immediate comment. </p>

<p>Air Products Executive Says Airgas Bid Attractive'' </p>
<p>Air Products  Chemicals Inc.''s $5.5 billion bid for Airgas
Inc. is an attractive offer, an Air Products executive
testified as the producer of industrial gases presses its rival
to consider a sale. </p>
<p>At $65.50 a share, Air Products would be paying full
price, Chief Financial Officer Paul Huck told a Delaware
Chancery Court judge yesterday. Air Products, based in
Allentown, Pennsylvania, sued Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Airgas
on Feb. 4 to force consideration of the bid. </p>
<p>A number of long-time Airgas holders found it to be a
very attractive offer, Huck testified in Georgetown, Delaware.
The courtroom earlier was closed to the public during part of
Huck''s testimony about Airgas''s value. </p>
<p>As part of the case, Airgas is asking Chancery Court Judge
William B. Chandler III to invalidate a bylaw approved by
shareholders in a Sept. 15 vote that added three Air Products
nominees to the Airgas board. The bylaw would move Airgas''s
annual meeting to January from as early as April. </p>
<p>Airgas contends that moving up the annual meeting will
unfairly allow Air Products to try to knock more Airgas nominees
off the board and take control. Chandler has agreed to hear both
issues in the trial. </p>
<p>The cases are Air Products  Chemicals Inc. v. Airgas Inc.,
5249, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington); and Airgas Inc. v.
Air Products  Chemicals Inc., 5817, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). </p>

<p>Halliburton Investors Draw Top U.S. Court Inquiry in Fraud Case </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court signaled interest in an appeal from
shareholders trying to sue Halliburton Co. for securities fraud,
seeking the Obama administration''s advice on the case. </p>
<p>The appeal potentially would make it easier for investors
to press class-action suits in some states. A federal appeals
court in New Orleans said the Halliburton shareholders couldn''t
sue as a group because they hadn''t established that they lost
money as a result of the alleged fraud. </p>
<p>The Halliburton shareholders'' lawyer, David Boies, argued
in his appeal that the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had
established a virtually unattainable standard. </p>
<p>The shareholders, led by the Erica P. John Fund, contend
that Halliburton from 1999 to 2001 falsified earnings reports,
played down estimated asbestos liability and overstated the
benefits of a merger. The company was led during part of that
period by Dick Cheney, later the U.S. vice president. </p>
<p>The high court appeal concerns the standard that applies at
the so-called class certification stage, not at final judgment.
The Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that to recover damages
shareholders ultimately must show a direct connection between a
misrepresentation and a decline in stock prices. </p>
<p>Boies''s appeal contends that shareholders shouldn''t have to
make that showing at the class certification stage, when they
haven''t yet had a chance to marshal their evidence. </p>
<p>The case is Erica P. John Fund v. Halliburton, 09-1403,
U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). </p>
<p>U.K. Lawsuits Against FTSE 100 Companies Rise 16%, Survey Says </p>
<p>U.K. lawsuits against the country''s 100 biggest companies
increased 16 percent in a year, suggesting an inevitable
flood of litigation from the financial crisis hasn''t peaked, a
legal publisher said. </p>
<p>Cases against FTSE 100-listed companies in the High Court
in London rose to 179 from 154 in the year ended June 30, the
publisher Sweet  Maxwell said Oct. 3 in a statement. </p>
<p>Combined lawsuits against HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Barclays Plc
fell 6 percent, and comprised 43 percent of the FTSE 100 cases,
Sweet  Maxwell said. Financial services companies make up 18
percent of the FTSE 100, Sweet  Maxwell said. </p>
<p>Banks are likely to feature frequently in hard-fought
litigation by virtue of the huge volume of complex financial
transactions that they are involved with, said Sweet 
Maxwell, a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters Corp. </p>
<p>Lawsuits against FTSE 100 companies weren''t the only ones
to increase. Cases to shield corporate secrets more than
quadrupled in London last year and trademark cases rose 20
percent, the U.K. Ministry of Justice said last month. </p>
<p>Abu Ghraib Contractor Suit Draws U.S. Supreme Court Interest </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court signaled it may consider whether two
military contractors can be sued for allegedly abusing inmates
at Iraq''s Abu Ghraib prison in a case that could make companies
more vulnerable to human rights suits. </p>
<p>The justices yesterday asked the Obama administration for
advice on an appeal from 26 Abu Ghraib inmates seeking to sue
CACI International Inc., which helped interrogate prisoners at
the facility, and Titan Corp., which provided translation
services. Titan has since been renamed and is now part of L-3
Communications Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>The appeal asks the court to decide whether companies and
other private parties can be sued under a federal law that
authorizes some suits against foreign governments for human
rights abuses. The inmates also want the justices to consider
whether contractors are immune from state-law suits stemming
from activities that take place on the battlefield. </p>
<p>The inmates, who were civilian detainees, say they were
subjected to abuses by CACI and Titan employees including
beatings, sexual humiliation, exposure to extreme temperatures
and rape. In court papers, the inmates say some prisoners were
tortured into unconsciousness and several were murdered. </p>
<p>Two groups of inmates are seeking to sue under the 1789
U.S. Alien Tort Statute and District of Columbia law. </p>
<p>The case is Saleh v. CACI International, 09-1313, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). </p>

<p>Accused Tax Cheat Cohen Denies Owning New York Hotel </p>
<p>Hotel developer Leon Cohen Levy, accused by U.S.
prosecutors of hiding a $33 million hotel sale from the Internal
Revenue Service, testified that he never cheated on his taxes or
made more than $40,000 a year. </p>
<p>Cohen, 46, is charged with his father, Mauricio Cohen
Assor, 77, with conspiring to defraud the IRS and filing false
tax returns that hid income and more than $150 million in
assets. Prosecutors say the men, who built hotels in Europe
under the Flatotel brand, failed to declare their sale of a
New York hotel in 2000 that they owned in the names of friends,
relatives and employees. </p>
<p>Leon Cohen said he never owned the Flatotel and never made
more than $40,000 a year working for its owners. He said that he
never paid taxes for his use of a Miami Beach house that
prosecutors say was once worth $26 million. Cohen said he used
the house for business and never paid taxes for the benefit of
its use or of luxury cars he drove. </p>
<p>Why would I pay taxes? Cohen told jurors in federal
court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I was a professional person
working in a professional residence. That''s where I slept. I was
just doing my job. </p>
<p>Cohen, like his father, who testified Sept. 30, said he
believed an accountant had prepared his taxes properly. </p>
<p>I thought that all the returns and documents that had to
be filed had been filed, absolutely, he said, testifying in
French through an interpreter. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said the Cohens put $33 million in proceeds
from the New York Flatotel sale in a Swiss account of HSBC
Holdings Plc, Europe''s largest bank by market value, and failed
to tell the IRS. </p>

<p>Kagan Full of Questions in Her First U.S. Supreme Court Hearing </p>
<p>Elena Kagan wasted no time joining the conversation in her
first hearing as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. </p>
<p>Kagan, who will take part in only four of the 12 cases
during the court''s first two-week argument session, asked
questions of all three lawyers during the one-hour hearing in a
bankruptcy case that marked the opening of the court''s nine-
month term. </p>
<p>Kagan has recused herself from 24 of the court''s 51
scheduled cases because she played a role in the litigation
while serving as U.S. solicitor general, the government''s top
courtroom advocate. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s hearing focused on whether people seeking
bankruptcy protection can limit the amount they must pay to
creditors by claiming an auto expense deduction for a car that
has already been paid off. </p>
<p>What would happen if the debtor had a car that was
200,000 miles old and it was going to break down, you know,
within the next five years? Kagan asked Deanne Maynard, the
attorney representing Bank of America Corp. in the case. </p>
<p>Both Maynard and Nicole Saharsky, the federal government
lawyer in the case, worked under Kagan in the solicitor''s
office. </p>
<p>Kagan sat at the far end of the bench, in the spot assigned
to the most-junior justice on the court. She made eye contact
with each speaker and at one point whispered to Justice Samuel
Alito, who was seated to her right. Several of her questions
built off comments and queries from the other justices. </p>
<p>The case is Ransom v. FIA Card Services, 09-907,U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Italy''s
biggest insurer, had the outlook on its ratings raised at Fitch
because of improved capital adequacy and resilience to adverse
trading conditions. </p>
<p>The revision of the rating outlooks reflects Generali''s
improved capital adequacy through retained 2009 earnings and the
consolidation at this level in the course of 2010, Fitch said
in a report today. The outlook on the AA- long-term issuer
default rating was lifted to stable from negative. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto expects to
report higher operating margins and a rise in profit this year,
he said Aug. 5. The company is expanding in emerging markets in
Asia, the Middle East and eastern Europe. </p>
<p>The insurer, due to release third-quarter figures on Nov.
11, also passed a euro-zone sovereign-risk stress test as
calculated by Fitch. Generali should be able to withstand
deterioration of the credit quality of certain sovereigns and
sharp changes in market values, the firm said </p>
<p>The Trieste, Italy-based insurer rose as much as 1.8
percent, and was up 1.5 percent at 14.52 euros as of 3:40 p.m.
local time, giving the company a market value of 22.6 billion
euros ($31.2 billion). </p>

<p>The Bank of Japan may intervene in
currency markets should the yen strengthen to more than 82 per
dollar, according to Jim O''Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs
Asset Management. </p>
<p>I think if the yen were to strengthen above 82 for
example, even if it were in the next couple of days, I think
they probably would intervene, O''Neill said in an interview
with Deirdre Bolton and Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television''s
InsideTrack'' today. The case for intervention to weaken the
yen is actually quite strong. </p>
<p>The yen fell against the majority of its most-traded
counterparts today after the Bank of Japan cut its benchmark
interest rate and increased purchases of bonds to combat
deflation and stimulate the economy. The currency''s rally to a
15-year high of 82.88 per dollar on Sept. 15 spurred Japan to
weaken the currency and help exporters for the first time since
2004. The yen was at 83.31 as of 12:36 p.m. in London. </p>
<p>What they''ve done this morning is something that should
be happening -- they probably should''ve done it earlier -- and I
think they should do more to stop the yen''s strength, O''Neill
said. I''m pretty sure at some stage we will see more
currency intervention by Japan, he said. </p>
<p>The Bank of Japan''s decision to create a fund to buy bonds
and other assets comes as policy makers in the U.S. and the U.K.
consider similar steps to support their flagging economies. At
the same time, governments in emerging markets from Brazil to
South Korea are increasing currency controls as investment
inflows threaten export growth. </p>
<p>Washington Meetings </p>
<p>We''re going to see some interesting focus on that at
the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank in Washington on Oct. 8-10, O''Neill said. Some
countries clearly have currencies that are too strong and some
kind of interventional activity to stop it is justified. I would
include, even though the circumstances are very different, both
Brazil, Japan and maybe even Switzerland in that category. </p>
<p>The excessively strong yen is partly due to the U.S.
Federal Reserve being so aggressive in its monetary policy,
O''Neill said. The Fed has made it pretty clear that
officials will extend quantitative-easing measures at the next
Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 3, he said. </p>
<p>If the Fed sticks with the strategy it looks like its
adopting, the dollar is going to be under pressure further
against many currencies all over the world, O''Neill said.
It''s not a bad strategy seen from a U.S. perspective, but of
course it puts challenges on other countries. </p>
<p>O''Neill also said it was less likely that the central banks
in the U.K. and on mainland Europe would loosen monetary policy
in the near term because the economic need is not as strong
as in the U.S. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. wants to double
client assets under management in Switzerland over the next five
years by targeting wealthy families, said Andrea Tardy, managing
director of the Geneva-based business. </p>
<p>JPMorgan (Suisse) SA''s current clientele includes foreign
residents in Switzerland and family offices, said Tardy, 45, in
an interview at his office on Geneva''s main shopping street. The
global reach of JPMorgan, which caters to ultra-high-net-worth
clients willing to invest more than $25 million, may appeal to
Swiss families already with other private banks, he said. </p>
<p>We''d like to be big, said Tardy, declining to give a
figure for assets under management in Switzerland. Ultra-high
net worth''s are global and need a global player. </p>
<p>The Geneva unit is JPMorgan''s second-biggest private
banking office after New York, and Tardy plans to add two or
three bankers over the next 12 to 15 months to the five
relationship managers working on the Swiss market. JPMorgan, the
world''s sixth-largest wealth manager at the end of 2009
according to London-based Scorpio Partnership, manages more than
$720 billion of private assets globally, said Tardy. </p>
<p>We''re seeing a flight to a quality experience and people
are making different choices, said Tardy, who became head of
JPMorgan''s Swiss business 12 months ago, after heading Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.''s Geneva private bank between August 2007 and
February 2009. </p>
<p>Tardy, an Italian national with a law degree from Turin,
worked as a relationship manager at Union Bancaire Prive''s
London office for a year until May 2007, after working for
JPMorgan in London since 1997. </p>
<p>New Appointments </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which has more than 600 staff in Geneva, last
month appointed Romain Pasche from Vontobel Asset Management as
senior investment adviser and Audrey Childe-Freeman from Brown
Brothers Harriman as head of currency strategy. The bank also
named Rhian Horgan as international head of alternative
investments, based in London. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said last week that over the next five years it
plans to triple private banking assets in Asia, its fastest-
growing market, after moving Douglas Wurth, chief executive
officer for international private banking, to the region. </p>

as Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, Fitch said in a statement
today. The rating for Detroit-based GM, 61 percent owned by the
U.S. government, reflects its strong liquidity position, low
leverage, improved cost structure and increasingly competitive
product portfolio, wrote Stephen Brown, a Fitch analyst. </p>
<p>Although they have similar ratings, you sort of get to
them from different paths, Brown, who is based in Chicago, said
today in a telephone interview. GM doesn''t have a whole lot of
debt, but they have very large pension obligations. Ford''s
pension obligations are significant, but they''re lower than GM''s
by quite a bit. But Ford has a lot of debt. </p>
<p>GM emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009 having received $50
billion in federal aid. GM and the U.S. Treasury aim to hold an
$8 billion to $10 billion IPO in November, two people familiar
with the plans said last month. </p>
<p>The company''s pension plans were underfunded by $27 billion
through 2009, Fitch said. Ford''s pensions were underfunded by
about $6.1 billion through last year, down from $16 billion in
2008, Fitch said in an Aug. 6 report. Fitch raised its rating on
Ford in that report two steps to BB-, three levels below
investment grade. </p>
<p>GM Debt </p>
<p>GM had $8.2 billion of debt at the end of the second
quarter, compared to $32 billion in cash, Fitch said. Ford had
about $27 billion in debt and $22 billion in cash for its
automotive operations at the end of the first half of 2010. </p>
<p>With the significant shedding of debt, the balance sheet
at GM is going to look much better than it did a year and a half
ago, said Greg Petryszyn, a fixed-income analyst at
Minneapolis-based Thrivent Financial. </p>
<p>GM''s 8.375 percent bonds due July 2033, which were issued
by old General Motors Corp. and convert to shares in the new GM,
were unchanged at 34.5 cents on the dollar at 4:20 p.m. today in
New York, according to Trace, the bond-pricing service of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Ford''s 7.45 percent notes due in July 2031 rose 1.19 cents
to 108.44 cents on the dollar at 1:38 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America
Corp. and Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY), defending allegations of
fraudulent home foreclosures from customers and Congress, may
face the most financial peril from investigations by state
attorneys general. </p>
<p>Authorities in at least seven states are probing whether
lenders used false documents and signatures to justify hundreds
of thousands of foreclosures, and the number of these inquiries
will grow, according to state officials and legal experts. </p>
<p>You''re going to see a tremendous amount of activity with
all the AGs in the U.S., Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray
said in an interview. We have a high degree of skepticism that
the corners that were cut are truly legal. </p>
<p>Cordray announced today that he filed a lawsuit against
Ally in state court, claiming its GMAC unit committed fraud and
violated state consumer law by filing false affidavits in
foreclosure proceedings. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Bank of America and Ally have curtailed
foreclosures or evictions in 23 states where courts have
jurisdiction over home seizures. </p>
<p>While homeowners in those states and elsewhere must usually
show damages to win a lawsuit, attorneys general can just sue
over deceptive sales practices and get penalties, said
Christopher Peterson, a University of Utah law professor who
specializes in commercial and contract law. </p>
<h2>Ohio Penalties </h2>
<p>In Ohio, penalties include fines of up to $25,000 per
violation, with each false affidavit or document considered a
violation, according to state law enforcement officials. In
Iowa, fines rise to a maximum of $40,000 for each violation. </p>
<p>This penalty would apply to every instance of an
affidavit that was filed improperly or every time facts were
attested to that weren''t true, Cordray said. His counterpart
in Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, has called for a freeze on
foreclosures and said the submissions are a possible fraud on
the court. </p>
<p>Officials in Ohio and Connecticut, along with Florida,
Texas, North Carolina, Iowa and Illinois, said they are
investigating mortgage foreclosure practices. </p>
<p>Attorneys general in Colorado and California asked Ally''s
GMAC unit to halt foreclosures in their states. GMAC and
Colorado Attorney General John W. Suthers plan to meet to
discuss the matter, said Mike Saccone, spokesman for Suthers. </p>
<h2>Talking to Them'' </h2>
<p>We''re talking to them, Jim Finefrock, spokesman for
California Attorney General Jerry Brown, said in a telephone
interview about Detroit-based Ally. </p>
<p>Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley yesterday
asked GMAC, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo  Co. to
suspend foreclosures and evictions in that state. </p>
<p>North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper said today he
was expanding his investigation into questionable foreclosure
tactics to include 14 more lenders. Cooper, who announced
earlier he was looking into allegations about GMAC, also asked
lenders to stop foreclosures in his state until they can confirm
they are complying with laws. </p>
<p>In addition to the investigation of Ally which began last
month, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott on Oct. 4 asked 30
loan servicers operating in his state -- including Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America and New York-based JPMorgan
-- to stop foreclosures pending a review of business practices.
Abbott also asked lenders and servicers to halt all sales of
properties previously foreclosed upon and stop all evictions. </p>
<h2>Multiple Fronts </h2>
<p>Lenders took possession of a record 95,364 U.S. homes in
August and issued foreclosure filings to 338,836 homeowners, or
one of every 381 U.S. households, according to RealtyTrac Inc.,
an Irvine, California-based data seller. </p>
<p>Lenders, loan servicers and even title insurance companies
are facing litigation on multiple fronts, said Peter Henning, a
law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and a former
federal prosecutor who worked on cases involving bank fraud. </p>
<p>This is going to become a hydra, he said in an
interview. You''ve got so many potential avenues of liability.
You don''t even know the parameters of this yet. </p>
<p>Reviews of affidavits and other loan documents that may
have been signed without personal examination by the signers
should be completed in a few weeks, JPMorgan and Bank of America
said last week. </p>
<p>We believe the accuracy of the factual loan information
contained in the affidavits was not affected by whether or not
the signer had personal knowledge of the precise details,
JPMorgan said in its statement. The affidavits were prepared
by appropriate personnel with knowledge of the relevant facts. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan Spokesman </h2>
<p>Tom Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to comment
further yesterday and a call to Dan Frahm, a spokesman for Bank
of America, wasn''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>We don''t believe the procedural errors in these
affidavits led to inappropriate foreclosures, Gina Proia, a
spokeswoman for Ally, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Some lenders have acknowledged that employees may have
completed court affidavits without confirming their accuracy. In
December, a GMAC employee said in a deposition in a foreclosure
case filed in West Palm Beach, Florida, that his team of 13
people signed about 10,000 documents a month without verifying
their accuracy. </p>
<p>My suspicion is that this will wind up being an
industrywide issue, said Patrick Madigan, an Iowa assistant
attorney general. Many companies were using robo-signers. </p>
<h2>Iowa Probe </h2>
<p>His boss, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, is
investigating GMAC, JPMorgan, Bank of America and OneWest Bank,
the successor to IndyMac. </p>
<p>We would intend to pursue any company that is engaged in
this behavior, Madigan said in an interview. </p>
<p>Homeowners in multiple lawsuits claim lenders have been
using falsified documents to foreclose on homes, at times when
they don''t even hold titles to the properties. </p>
<p>Reports of false affidavits will stall foreclosures for
months and will aid homeowners fighting to retain their
properties, University of Utah''s Peterson said. </p>
<p>That''s what we''re seeing right now, he said. It''s
making it harder to foreclose and recover costs for a bad
loan. </p>
<p>Lawyers for some homeowners blame Reston, Virginia-based
Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc., or MERS, which
handles mortgage transfers between member banks. Multiple
lawsuits claim that the system allows false foreclosures and
muddies ownership of titles. MERS has denied any wrongdoing. </p>
<h2>Kentucky Homeowners </h2>
<p>In a lawsuit filed on behalf of Kentucky homeowners last
week, plaintiffs claimed banks, MERS and loan servicers filed
mortgages with forged signatures, submitted foreclosure actions
months before they acquired any legal interest in the properties
and falsely claimed to own notes executed with mortgages. </p>
<p>Karmela Lejarde, a spokeswoman for MERS, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The banks have to be very concerned about class-action
lawsuits, Peterson said. I guarantee there are all sorts of
class-action lawyers brainstorming, trying to figure out ways to
file these lawsuits. </p>
<p>Borrowers in the average foreclosure case haven''t made a
payment in more than a year, said Guy Cecala, publisher of
Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. More than 5
million homes are in the process of foreclosure, so millions of
people are living mortgage-free right now, he said. </p>
<h2>Screwed Up'' Paperwork </h2>
<p>The question is what kind of deals the plaintiffs''
attorneys will reach with lenders, Cecala said. If someone
hasn''t made any mortgage payments in a year, are we really going
to give them a home just because someone screwed up the
paperwork? </p>
<p>Title insurers will also face -- and file -- lawsuits,
Wayne State''s Henning said. </p>
<p>If you foreclose on a house and sell it, the title
should be certain, he said. </p>
<p>Title insurers will be on the hook if foreclosures are
reopened, Henning said. The title insurers will be going
after the banks or whoever assured them there was a clear
title. </p>
<p>Fidelity National Financial Corp. (FNF), the largest U.S. title
insurer, and First American Financial Co. (FAF), the second-largest,
have declined more than 5 percent since Sept. 30 over concerns
that investigations into foreclosures would cause legal problems
affecting title companies. The Standard  Poor''s 500 index of
large U.S. stocks has gained about 1.7 percent in that period. </p>
<h2>Adverse Impact </h2>
<p>Questionable foreclosures will ultimately have little
adverse impact on new owners of properties or title insurance
claims, the American Land Title Association said in an Oct. 1
statement. </p>
<p>If a new homeowner''s title is challenged because of a
faulty foreclosure, the title insurer may have an obligation to
defend the challenge, Kurt Pfotenhauer, chief executive
officer of the trade group, said in the release. However, it
is unlikely that a court will take property from an innocent
current homeowner and return it to a previous homeowner who
failed to make payments. </p>
<p>Individuals who signed false affidavits or falsely claimed
clear titles to properties can be subject to criminal
prosecution, including perjury charges, Peterson said. </p>
<p>Corporations would probably face obstruction charges rather
than perjury, according to legal experts. </p>
<p>Did they know about gaps in the system and lie about
it, Henning said, referring to companies. This is certainly
a concern for MERS but it could be, too, for the banks. Any
action of any employee can be looked at, but what they''re
looking at is the volume of transactions and the involvement of
senior level management. </p>
<p>More civil litigation is a certainty, Henning said. </p>
<p>The sandstorm is coming, he said. You can see it off
in the distance and know it''s about to hit, but no one knows how
long it''s going to last. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. may sell its Capsugel
business, which makes gelatin capsules for drugs and dietary
supplements, after a review that will be completed in the first
quarter of 2011. </p>
<p>Capsugel, the smallest of Pfizer''s nine business units, had
revenue of $740 million last year. Pfizer is reviewing
strategic alternatives, which may include a sale, the New
York-based company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, is looking to offset
some of the revenue it will start losing next year, when the
company faces competition from cheaper generic copies of its
cholesterol pill Lipitor, which had $11.4 billion in sales last
year. Pfizer gained Capsugel with its acquisition of Warner-
Lambert Co. for $116 billion in 2000. </p>
<p>Pfizer has the Lipitor patent coming up and they might
just want the extra cash to bolster themselves, said Les Funtleyder, a health-care analyst with New York-based Miller
Tabak  Co., in a telephone interview. Capsugel is an asset
that seems like it might be better off somewhere else. If you''re
Pfizer, do you really want what amounts to be an outsourcing and
manufacturing business? </p>
<p>Funtleyder said Capsugel won''t demand a massive premium
price, because it is largely a manufacturing business. </p>
<p>Pfizer hired Morgan Stanley to conduct a strategic review
for the unit, a process that will be completed by the end of the
first quarter of next year, according to today''s statement. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 3 cents to $17.26 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has declined 5.1 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Every health-care spinoff in the last 15 years has
increased shareholder value, wrote analyst Jami Rubin of Goldman
Sachs in a Sept. 21 note. Pfizer would have the most to gain of
all the big pharmaceutical companies from a spinoff, she wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman rates Pfizer a buy, but see further upside
potential if they took aggressive action to unlock value in non-
core assets, wrote Rubin, who is based in New York. </p>

<p>Sidney J. Weinberg Jr., a senior
director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall Street firm once
led by his father and his younger brother, has died. He was 87. </p>
<p>Weinberg, known as Jim, died on Oct. 4 of prostate cancer,
according to a memo sent to Goldman Sachs employees by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn. He maintained his office
at the firm and his influence upon our people until his death,
the memo said. </p>
<p>Although Weinberg was affiliated with Goldman Sachs for 45
years, he played a less prominent role at the firm than his late
father, Sidney J. Weinberg, who was chief executive officer from
1939 to 1969, or his late brother, John L. Weinberg, who ran the
company from 1976 until 1990. </p>
<p>Weinberg treasured privacy and argued successfully at a
1986 partners'' meeting against taking the firm public, according
to the book Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success by Lisa Endlich (Knopf, 1999). </p>
<p>Jimmy told the group that the proposal made no sense.
Goldman Sachs had a heritage, and he was on the side of
preserving it, Endlich wrote. He would feel uncomfortable
reading about partners in the newspapers, of having the details
of their financial situation made available for public
consumption. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs went public in 1999, later than many of its
U.S. competitors, and 11 years after Weinberg retired from a
full-time role at the company. </p>
<p>Joins Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>Sidney James Weinberg Jr. was born in Scarsdale, New York,
on March 27, 1923. He served in the Philippines as a first
lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War II. Weinberg
received a bachelor''s degree from Princeton University and then
a master''s in business administration from Harvard University in
1949. He worked as a vice president of the textile division at
Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., now Owens Corning Inc., before
joining Goldman Sachs''s investment-banking department in 1965. </p>
<p>For a decade beginning in 1978, Weinberg ran the firm''s
investment-banking services department, a unit created by former
Goldman Sachs Co-Chairman John C. Whitehead to help manage
client relationships and win business. Weinberg retired from the
general partnership in 1988 when he turned 65. He remained a
limited partner until the firm went public and then became a
senior director. </p>
<p>Culture Carrier </p>
<p>Jim was one of the most important culture carriers at
Goldman Sachs, Whitehead said in a telephone interview. He was
an advocate of team play, no internal ugly competition, service
to customers, putting the customers'' interests before the firm''s
interests and all of those good things that make a
partnership. </p>
<p>He was also the model banker for winning new business
from clients, said Whitehead. We had a lot of good ones, but I
can''t say that anyone was his equal, he said. He had
personality, judgment, knowledge of the products, and a good
sales ability. His clients were his friends. </p>
<p>Thomas S. Murphy, the former chairman and chief executive
officer of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., was a close friend of
Weinberg since they attended Harvard Business School together. </p>
<p>His whole reputation in the business world was as a
person of honesty and integrity, said Murphy. We had to sell
a lot of things when we bought ABC, and he did a great job. You
could really count on Jim. </p>
<p>Unpretentious, Congenial'' </p>
<p>In his book on the history of Goldman Sachs, The
Partnership (Penguin Press, 2008), author Charles D. Ellis
described Weinberg as his younger brother''s closest and most
objective confidant and adviser on policy and strategy. </p>
<p>Jim Weinberg was consistently unpretentious, congenial,
and insightful, Ellis wrote. He took subways and once, at a
fabulous Los Angeles restaurant, asked the captain, Don''t you
have anything less expensive?'' </p>
<p>Stephen Friedman, a Goldman Sachs board member and a former
chairman of the firm, remembered working with Weinberg when
Friedman was a junior mergers and acquisitions banker. </p>
<p>I''d watch Jim pace things, giving the client a chance to
think and adjust to what he was saying, Friedman said in a
telephone interview. He was quite good at the strategic
pause. </p>
<p>Weinberg''s success with clients was no magic potion,
Friedman said. He just had a great demeanor, and people would
develop confidence in him because he wasn''t pandering to them,
he would tell them what he thought. </p>
<p>Identified With Clients </p>
<p>Robert E. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs who
later became U.S. Treasury secretary and chairman of Citigroup
Inc., also singled out Weinberg''s skill with customers. </p>
<p>I watched Jim as he dealt with clients and I learned a
lot about how to deal with people more generally, Rubin said
in a telephone interview. He was very effective at relating to
what they cared about and what their issues were and then really
identifying with them and helping them solve their problems. </p>
<p>For the last five years, Weinberg served on the board of
directors of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the company''s
philanthropic arm that was created in 1999. He was also a senior
trustee of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, a
life trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and a
trustee emeritus and former chairman of the board of trustees of
Scripps College in Claremont, California. </p>
<p>Weinberg was also the founding chairman of the board of the
Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences in Claremont,
California, and an honorary trustee and honorary member of the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod in
Massachusetts. In 2005, he was elected a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts  Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>Weinberg, who died at his home in Marion, Massachusetts, is
survived by his wife of 59 years, Elizabeth Betty Houghton
Weinberg; six children, Jay, Alan, Laurie, Betsy, Sydney and
Peter, 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. </p>

<p>Investment banks in India face
pressure on fees as competition intensifies for state asset
sales in a record year for equity offerings, said the head of
JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s local operations. </p>
<p>We didn''t start the low-fee game. But we now have to
pitch lower fees if we want to be on deals since everyone is
doing it, Kalpana Morparia said in an interview in Mumbai. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is among six banks that agreed to split a fee of
less than one paisa (0.02 cent) for underwriting the latest
state deal, a secondary sale of shares in Steel Authority of
India Ltd., according to two people with knowledge of the
matter. Banks must match the lowest fees to win work on state
deals, according to government guidelines. </p>
<p>The Wall Street firm, ranked first globally in managing
equity sales, slipped to eighth in India this year for domestic
stock sales and rights offerings from sixth in 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup is No. 1 this year. </p>
<p>We don''t look at our rankings on the basis of just
domestic deals, Morparia, 61, said. We weigh ourselves on
all the deals done for an Indian company, overseas or
domestically. </p>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan won assignments to work on two
other state deals in the past three months: A stake sale in
Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. and an initial public
offering of Manganese Ore (India) Ltd. It will earn near-zero
fees for those transactions as well. </p>
<p>A bank could lose anywhere between 20 million and 40
million rupees ($895,000) on deals that don''t pay any fees,
said S. Venkatraghavan, head of equity capital markets at IDFC
Capital Ltd. in Mumbai. </p>
<p>Government Guidelines </p>
<p>Losses from share sales in government-owned companies won''t
affect JPMorgan''s profit significantly because there''s also
a huge private sector pipeline with higher commissions, said
Morparia. India is making good money for the JP franchise. </p>
<p>The benchmark Sensex Index on the Bombay Stock Exchange has
gained 17.6 percent this year, making it the best performer
among the world''s 10 largest stock markets. Indian companies
raised 753 billion rupees in equity and rights offerings in
2010, 33 percent more than in the same period in 2007, the
record year for domestic equity issuance, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>At least 95 companies have lodged draft offer documents
with the securities regulator seeking approval for initial share
sales, according to filings. </p>
<p>In India, small deals usually pay more for the banks than
being one of five or 10 banks on a large mandate, Morparia
said. </p>
<p>Don''t Blame System </p>
<p>The government''s selection process isn''t to blame for low
investment-banking fees, Disinvestment Secretary Sumit Bose said
in an interview on Sept. 30. The government tweaked the bidding
process this year to score a bank''s proposal 70 percent on its
technical presentation and 30 percent on its fees. </p>
<p>This system in no way asks for zero bids or near-zero
bids, it just asks for competitive bids and that''s the way we
would like to proceed, Bose said. </p>
<p>Morparia said she agrees with that assessment. The
government''s bidding system is not to blame for near-zero fee
bids. This is a function of intense competition, she said. </p>
<p>India''s government plans to raise 400 billion rupees from
state share sales in the year through to March 31. It has met 5
percent of that target so far. </p>
<p>The government aims to sell shares in eight companies in
the remaining six months of the fiscal year, starting with Coal
India Ltd. Its IPO is expected to raise more than $3 billion,
said people involved in the deal, making it India''s largest. </p>
<p>Twenty banks, including JPMorgan, bid to manage the share
sale, according to disinvestment department notices. </p>
<p>India is one of the most competitive markets in the
region, and it''s not one of the most profitable, Morparia
said. Yet banks want to expand here because the country is
growing at a phenomenal pace. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised its
forecasts for the euro against the dollar on the expectation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will step up asset purchases at
its November interest-rates meeting. </p>
<p>The euro will trade at $1.40 in three months, $1.50 in six
months and $1.55 in 12 months, Dominic Wilson, a senior global
economist at Goldman Sachs in New York wrote in a research
report today. The bank did not say what its previous forecasts
were. </p>
<p>The market has responded to the expectation of QE2 in a
way that is broadly consistent with our work on the first round
of QE, sending bond yields lower, equities higher and the USD
weaker, Wilson wrote, referring to so-called quantitative
easing. The move in the dollar has been particularly striking
and relevant for the broader global picture. While our last FX
monthly laid out our long-standing view of dollar weakness,
things have unfolded more rapidly than our original forecasts
anticipated. </p>

<p>A group of technology company
executives led by IBM Corp. chairman Samuel J. Palmisano is
releasing a report saying the federal government could save $1
trillion by 2020 through more efficient use of computers and
information systems. </p>
<p>The executives, who include Michael Dell, chairman and
chief executive of Dell Inc., say in the report they plan to
present to government officials that better use of existing
technology would save money by consolidating data centers and
networks, cutting duplication and providing better tracking of
fraud and waste. </p>
<p>Our report contains straightforward, proven ways to pare
back $1 trillion from the deficit while increasing productivity
and enabling sustainable competitiveness, Dell said in a
statement issued by Technology CEO Council, a Washington-based
advocacy group. </p>
<p>The government has fallen behind private industry in
adopting new systems for information processing, administration
officials said earlier this year. President Barack Obama in
April created an advisory board of business executives to
recommend ways to streamline government operations using
technology. </p>
<p>Then-budget director Peter Orszag said in June that closing
the IT gap will be a key step in finding the savings needed
to shrink the deficit, which is forecast by the administration
to hit a record $1.47 trillion in the 2010 fiscal year. </p>

enhancing job growth. For example, it says as much as 30 percent
of the $76 billion spent to support and manage information

systems and standardizing applications. Greater use of digital
records management would save $50 billion over 10 years,
according to the council''s statement. </p>

<p>Oberoi Realty Ltd., a Morgan Stanley-
backed developer, began selling shares in an initial public
offering today, testing demand for property IPOs in India after
a five-month lull. </p>
<p>Oberoi, which mostly develops residential real estate in
Mumbai, aims to raise as much as 10.3 billion rupees ($231
million) from the sale. The company, founded by billionaire
Vikas Oberoi, will sell 39.5 million shares for as much as 260
rupees each, according to an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The success of Oberoi''s IPO may prompt $3 billion of
property share sales at a time when real estate stocks have
underperformed the Bombay Stock Exchange''s benchmark Sensitive
Index. The BSE Realty Index has gained 1.4 percent this year,
compared with a 17 percent advance in the Sensex. </p>
<p>Oberoi operates in the Mumbai market, which is very
resilient, and the background of the promoters is strong, said
Anubhav Gupta, an analyst with Kim Eng Securities India Pvt. in
Mumbai. Strong demand and high prices in Mumbai will result in
a good set of numbers for Oberoi''s earnings. </p>
<p>Demand for luxury apartments in India is rising as the
biggest rally in stocks in 18 years boosts the ranks of the
affluent in the third-fastest growing major economy. The South
Asian nation has 84,000 millionaires, according to the 2009
World Wealth Report by Cap Gemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth
Management. The number of millionaires in India is expected to
triple between 2008 and 2018, according to the report. </p>
<p>Billionaire City </p>
<p>About 40 percent of India''s 52 billionaires, the most in
Asia after China, live in Mumbai, according to Forbes magazine. </p>
<p>That has helped Oberoi make it to the Forbes billionaire
list of India''s richest, ranking 46th with a net worth of $1.4
billion. Oberoi, 41, has built the 11.2 million square feet
Oberoi Garden City complex, which houses the Westin Hotel, in
the city''s north. He recently bought himself a single-engine,
four-seater Cirrus airplane, according to Forbes. </p>
<p>Indian realty companies such as Lodha Developers Ltd. and
Emaar MGF Land Ltd. are among at least 11 builders waiting to
tap the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>IPO Size Cut </p>
<p>Emaar MGF, a joint venture with the United Arab Emirates''
biggest developer, reduced the size of its initial share sale to
16 billion rupees, two people with direct knowledge of the
matter said Sept. 30. The builder, a unit of Emaar Properties
PJSC, abandoned plans to raise as much as 70.8 billion rupees in
February 2008 even after cutting the offer price as global
equity markets slumped, the company said at the time. </p>
<p>The planned $3 billion of share sales by Indian real estate
companies would be the most since $4.3 billion was raised by
developers in 2007, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Real estate IPOs in India will have to compete with state-
owned companies for investor interest. India''s government plans
to raise $8.9 billion selling shares in companies it owns in the
fiscal year through March 2011 -- more than half the total value
of all of last year''s offerings in the nation. </p>
<p>Oberoi plans to use the proceeds from the IPO to complete
pending projects and buy land in Mumbai, Oberoi, who is managing
director, has said. </p>
<p>Mumbai, being the archetypal city of opportunity,
generates an unprecedented demand for properties across the
residential, commercial and retail sectors, said Anuj Puri,
Mumbai-based chairman of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj. </p>
<p>Saleable Area </p>
<p>The builder is currently working on 13 projects with
another 11 being planned, according to its offer document. The
total saleable area of these projects is expected to be about
20.25 million square feet. </p>
<p>Oberoi has a strong presence in Mumbai, the creme of
Indian real estate,'''' said Mumbai-based Aashiesh Agarwaal, an
analyst at Edelweiss Securities Ltd. The developer has more than
90 percent of its land bank in the suburbs and the city. </p>
<p>The company has kept its balance sheet in check and its
construction costs are largely funded through internal accruals
in the form of pre-sales and rental income from premium
properties, Agarwaal said. He has a subscribe'''' rating on the
stock at 253 rupees, the lowest end of the IPO price range. </p>
<p>Oberoi''s profit rose 84 percent to 4.6 billion rupees in
the year ended March 31, 2010. Sales climbed 77 percent to 8.05
billion rupees. </p>
<p>A Morgan Stanley real estate fund in January 2007 invested
6.75 billion rupees for a 10.76 percent stake in Oberoi,
according to the offer document. </p>
<p>Kotak Mahindra Capital Co., Enam Securities Pvt., J.P.
Morgan India Pvt. and Morgan Stanley India Co. are managing the
sale. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp.
rose to the highest level since it went public in 1915 as
investors show support for Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano''s strategy of remaking the 99-year-old company. </p>
<p>IBM gained 88 cents to $138.72 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, topping the previous record of
$137.88, adjusting for stock splits, reached in July 1999.
Palmisano has focused on services and software, making the
company once known for mainframe computers into the world''s
biggest computer-services provider. </p>
<p>Since Palmisano became CEO in March 2002, IBM shares have
risen a third as he divested hardware units, including the
personal-computer business sold to China''s Lenovo Group Ltd. in
2005. In May, he said he expects Armonk, New York-based IBM to
almost double operating earnings to $20 a share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more profitable software and services. </p>
<p>The shares are also benefiting as investors predict
corporate customers will invest in information technology, said
Lou Miscioscia, an analyst at Collins Stewart Plc. </p>
<p>There was a big concern investors had about IT succumbing
to the macro slowing -- that was overblown, said Boston-based
Miscioscia, who has a buy rating on the shares and has the
highest price target of any analyst tracked by Bloomberg, at
$160. Companies continue to want to invest. </p>
<p>IBM has also boosted shares by buying its own stock. Since
2002, the company has spent more than $68 billion on buybacks,
equal to almost 39 percent of its current market value. </p>
<p>Help From HP </p>
<p>Of the 26 analysts who rate IBM, 18 recommend buying,
including nine who predict the stock will reach at least $150.
Eight analysts recommend holding the shares and none recommend
selling them. </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes IBM, lost
19.07 points today to 10,948.58. </p>
<p>IBM shares are also likely gaining as investors leave its
closest rival, Hewlett-Packard Co., amid uncertainty at the
company, Miscioscia said. HP''s CEO Mark Hurd retired Aug. 6
after an investigation found he violated business-conduct
standards. Last week, HP hired Leo Apotheker, former CEO of
software maker SAP AG, to replace him. </p>
<p>Given that the new CEO at HP has to prove himself, that
does create more of a cloud of uncertainty, Miscioscia said.
HP shares have dropped 12 percent since the announcement of
Hurd''s departure. </p>
<p>The company that became IBM was incorporated on June 16,
1911, as Computer Tabulating Recording Co. Created by a merger
of three businesses, CTR sold items ranging from punched cards
to cheese slicers, according to the company''s website. </p>
<p>Watson, Gerstner </p>
<p>Thomas J. Watson Sr., known as IBM''s founder, joined the
company in 1914. He became president less than a year later, and
began focusing on building large tabulating machines for
businesses. In 1924, after expanding the company outside the
U.S. and building other corporate machines, he changed the name
to International Business Machines Corp. </p>
<p>By 1993, the company had posted three straight years of
losses, including $8.1 billion that year. The company faced a
possible breakup when IBM chose Lou Gerstner as its chief that
year -- the first time IBM went outside the company for a CEO. </p>
<p>He helped increase the share price about ninefold by
cutting thousands of jobs, keeping the company''s units together
and marketing software and services along with hardware.
Gerstner wrote a book about his experience called Who Says
Elephants Can''t Dance? </p>
<p>IBM Investments </p>
<p>Palmisano continued the transition of what was once the
world''s largest computer maker. The focus on software and
services has helped expand IBM''s gross-profit margins more than
8.5 percentage points since he took over. He''s spent more than
$20 billion on over 100 purchases. </p>
<p>In May, Palmisano said he plans to spend another $20
billion in acquisitions through 2015. Last month, IBM announced
three acquisitions, including the $1.7 billion deal for storage-
analytics maker Netezza Corp. and a purchase of software maker
OpenPages Inc. for an undisclosed sum. </p>
<p>IBM is investing in markets such as analytics software,
which helps companies predict trends, and cloud computing, which
lets them store and access information on shared servers. The
company is also developing services to monitor highways,
electrical grids and other infrastructure systems to help them
run more efficiently. </p>
<p>Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth in
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said. The software segment, the
company''s most profitable, will make up about half of total
profit by then. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp.''s Kazakh oil venture is
expected to submit an expansion plan next year for the Central
Asian country''s largest producing oil field, Oil  Gas Minister
Sauat Mynbayev said today in Almaty. </p>
<p>Mynbayev didn''t answer questions about the budget or
planned output increases at the TengizChevroil LLP project.
Linsi Crain, an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for the venture wasn''t
immediately available for comment. </p>
<p>In January, KazMunaiGaz National Co. Chief Executive
Officer Kairgeldy Kabyldin said TengizChevroil plans to invest
$15.2 billion to boost oil output at the country''s largest
producing field to 36.4 million metric tons a year after 2016.
The state-run energy company owns 20 percent of the project. </p>
<p>The government''s cost and production estimates exceed those
given by TengizChevroil in October 2009. The venture said then
it may spend $10 billion on boosting oil output at the onshore
field by about 12 million metric tons by the end of 2016. It
produced 22.53 million metric tons last year, an increase of 30
percent from the previous year. The venture''s oil output is
expected to total 640 million tons from 2016 to 2032, Kabyldin
said at the time. </p>
<p>San Ramon, California-based Chevron holds 50 percent of
TengizChevroil, Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent and OAO
Lukoil''s Lukarco has 5 percent. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software company, said it will require employees to contribute
to their health-care benefits starting in 2013, citing the
rising cost of providing worker coverage. </p>
<p>About 95 percent of the company''s roughly 90,000 employees
have benefits covered completely, Lou Gellos, a spokesman for
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, said in an interview today.
He said he didn''t know what portion employees will be asked to
provide. </p>
<p>The cost of health care has, over the years, increased
dramatically, Gellos said in an interview today. The
projections going forward have them going way up, and in order
to be sustainable, some sort of evolution of our health benefit
was necessary. </p>
<p>Some of the largest companies in the U.S. project a median
8.3 percent increase in health-care costs next year, according
to the National Business Group on Health, a Washington-based
nonprofit organization. Microsoft may be considering a modest
change in benefits, said Helen Darling, the group''s president. </p>
<p>Even with the evolution and changes they have in mind,
which I think are modest, it will still be way up there in terms
of comprehensiveness and relatively low cost to the employee,
Darling said. Her group has nearly 300 members, including
Microsoft. </p>
<p>The average U.S. employee contribution to health-care plans
is 20 percent, she said. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest mall owner in the U.S., won court approval to
proceed with its plan for a $2 billion stock offering after it
emerges from bankruptcy. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan approved
an underwriting agreement that will allow General Growth to
replace financing from a group of investors that has agreed to
help fund its bankruptcy restructuring. The judge also approved
a $1.8 billion commitment for debt financing. </p>
<p>Gropper said the financing agreements are an indication
of the enormous success of General Growth''s turnaround while
in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Tom Nolan, General Growth''s president, said in an interview
in court that General Growth intends to raise about $2 billion
in the stock offering. That will replace half of the commitments
from Fairholme Capital Management LLC, Pershing Square Capital
Management LP and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, Nolan
said. </p>
<p>There''s going to be a fair amount of demand for the
stock, he said. </p>
<p>Gropper''s approval of the underwriting comes as General
Growth is nearing the end of its bankruptcy case, which began in
April 2009. Later this month, it is scheduled to seek court
approval for its restructuring plan, clearing the way for the
mall owner to emerge from bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Equity Commitments </p>
<p>Under the equity commitments it lined up earlier this year,
General Growth has the right to replace portions of the
financing by selling, while in bankruptcy, notes that convert to
shares or by a post-bankruptcy stock offering. </p>
<p>General Growth negotiated the underwriting agreement with
Goldman  Sachs Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo Securities,
RBC Capital Markets Corp., Barclays PLC, UBS Securities LLC,
Macquarie Bank Ltd. and TD Securities (USA) LLC, according to
court papers. </p>
<p>The U.S. Trustee''s office, an arm of the Justice Department
that monitors bankruptcy cases, objected to UBS''s role as
underwriter and lender. UBS is one of General Growth''s financial
advisers and suffers from disabling conflicts of interest,
the government said in a court filing yesterday. </p>
<p>UBS Securities'' advice may be susceptible to claims that
the advice is not unbiased in that UBS Securities may have, and
may currently be perceived to be directing the debtors toward
the direction where UBS Securities may earn the most fees,
lawyers for the U.S. Trustee said. </p>
<p>The objection was resolved during a closed-door meeting
with the judge. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p> General Growth Properties Inc.''s
reorganization plan doesn''t properly compound interest,
according to Wilmington Trust Co., the indenture trustee for
6.75 percent senior notes issued by Rouse Co. and the 3.98
percent exchangeable senior notes due 2027. </p>
<p>The indenture trustee contends the formula contained in the
plan is incorrect because interest isn''t compounded correctly.
The indenture trustee also contends that the plan impermissibly
discriminates against the noteholders. </p>
<p>New investors have the option under the plan to receive
cash for their existing notes, thus providing some of the cash
they need in making new investments in a reorganized General
Growth. Other noteholders aren''t offered the same cash-out
option, the indenture trustee says. </p>
<p>By not making the cash-out option available to all
noteholders, the indenture trustee contends that the plan
improperly discriminates against similarly situated creditors. </p>
<p>The issue will be decided by the bankruptcy judge at the
Oct. 21 hearing where General Growth banks on walking out with a
confirmation order approving the reorganization for the top-tier
companies. </p>
<p>The official creditors'' committee goes along with the
discrimination argument, to a point. At present, according to
the committee, trading prices on the notes indicate the holders
will receive payment at least equal to investors who cash out.
The committee is reserving its right to object if the price of
the notes falls in the market. </p>
<p>Creditors of General Growth''s four top-tier companies are
to receive full payment under the Chapter 11 plan. The plan
preserves some of the stock for existing shareholders. The plan
is financed in part with an $8.55 billion debt and equity
commitment from a group led by Brookfield Asset Management Inc.
General Growth''s property-owning subsidiaries already confirmed
Chapter 11 plans paying their creditors in full. </p>
<p>General Growth, the second-largest mall owner in the U.S.
with 180 properties in 43 states, began the largest real-estate
reorganization in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April
2009. The books of Chicago-based General Growth had assets of

<p>Spyglass Entertainment Group will acquire the remainder of
the new equity in exchange for contributing assets including
Cypress Entertainment Group Inc. and Garoge Inc. When MGM
emerges from Chapter 11, Gary Berger and Roger Birnbaum from
Burbank, California-based Spyglass will become MGM''s co-chairman

<p>The voting deadline for the so-called prepack is Oct. 22.
When the votes are in hand, MGM will file the Chapter 11
petition, likely intending to emerge from Chapter 11 within
about four to six weeks. In addition to finding compliance with
technical aspects of Chapter 11, the bankruptcy judge can
approve the plan by signing a confirmation if the courts
determines that that the voting solicitation materials were
adequate. </p>

<p>Meruelo Maddux Committee Wants Executives'' Bonuses Cut Off </p>
<p>The Meruelo Maddux Properties Inc. creditors'' committee
said the company should be compelled to terminate employment
agreements with the top three officers, to avoid large priority
claims if one of the competing reorganization plans is
eventually confirmed. </p>
<p>According to a motion filed by the committee on Oct. 6,
Chief Executive Officer Richard Meruelo and Chief Operating
Officer John Maddux are entitled to so-called golden parachutes
if their employment is terminated without cause. The payment
would equal three times the officers'' base salary and bonus. </p>
<p>If a competing plan is eventually approved by the
bankruptcy judge, the services of the three officers won''t be
required, thus kicking in claims that would be entitled to
priority and require payment in full. The committee wants the
judge to require the company to give notices beginning in
November that the employments agreements won''t be renewed. </p>
<p>The motion to cut off the employment agreements is
scheduled for a Nov. 10 hearing in bankruptcy court in Woodland
Hills, California. The third officer with an employment contract
is Chief Financial Officer Andrew Murray. </p>
<p>The court is in the process of approving disclosure
statements explaining three competing reorganizations plans. One
plan is proposed by lenders Legendary Investors Group No. 1 LLC
and East West Bank. The company has another, as do shareholders
Charlestown Capital Advisors LLC and Hartland Asset Management
Corp. The committee again said it isn''t supporting the company''s
plan. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy court permitted the filing of other plans in
May. The Chapter 11 petition filed in March 2009 listed assets
of $682 million against debt totaling $342 million. </p>
<p>The case is In re Meruelo Maddux Properties Inc., 09-13356,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Woodland
Hills). </p>
<p>Bank of America May Sell Cabi Downtown Loan </p>
<p>Cabi Downtown LLC, the owner of the 49-story Everglades on
the Bay condominium in Miami, was scheduled to confirm a Chapter
11 plan yesterday where ownership would transfer to Bank of
America NA, the construction lender owed $207 million. </p>
<p>The hearing was pushed back to Oct. 27 because the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is receiving offers to
purchase the loan. The adjournment of the confirmation hearing
is intended to give the bank time to complete a sale. </p>
<p>Cabi said in a court filing that it is ready to implement
the plan. Cabi agreed not to interfere with a sale of the loan
and is committed to allowing buyers to inspect the property. </p>
<p>The plan resulted from a settlement between Cabi and the
bank. While the bank would take ownership, the developer would
remain manager. </p>
<p>The plan gives unsecured creditors $750,000, for a 25
percent recovery on $3 million in claims. The plan was revised
so large, disputed claims wouldn''t dilute the recovery by
unsecured creditors. </p>
<p>Cabi filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in August 2009,
just after the bank began foreclosure. The company is owned by
GICSA, which says it is the largest and most profitable real-
estate developer in Mexico. </p>
<p>The case is In re Cabi Downtown LLC, 09-27168, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami). </p>
<p>Tubo Again Reports Progress on Plan Negotiations </p>
<p>Tubo de Pasteje SA and subsidiary Cambridge-Lee Holdings
Inc. for a second time are seeking an extension of the exclusive
right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. </p>
<p>The company reports significant progress in discussions
with noteholders on a Chapter 11 plan. The motion for longer
exclusivity recites the company''s hope that it will soon
have agreement allowing the filing of a consensual
reorganization plan. </p>
<p>If granted by the bankruptcy court at a Nov. 2 hearing, the
new plan deadline would be Jan. 5. </p>
<p>In the first motion in March for longer exclusivity, the
company said there had been significant progress in talks
with noteholders about a plan. </p>
<p>The companies sought Chapter 11 protection after a payment
default in November 2009 on $200 million in 11.5 percent senior
notes due 2016. </p>
<p>Tubo is a subsidiary of Mexico City-based Industrias Unidas
SA, a diversified manufacturer of copper and electrical
products. The U.S. subsidiary Cambridge-Lee is based in Reading, Pennsylvania. IUSA is the issuer of the notes which were secured
by a pledge of the stock of Cambridge-Lee. </p>

<p>Statistics </p>
<p>Defaults by Junk-Rated Companies Continue to Decline </p>
<p>Worldwide defaults for junk-rated companies declined from
6.2 percent in the second quarter to 4 percent at the end of the
third quarter, Moody''s Investors Service said in a report. </p>
<p>In the U.S., the junk default rate contracted to 4 percent
from 6.4 percent between the second and third quarters. </p>
<p>One year ago, the global junk default rate was 13.2
percent. The default rate now is below the 4.8 percent average
for the years 1983 through 2009. </p>
<p>While the default rate is down between quarters, the number
of companies with debt trading at so-called distressed levels
hasn''t declined as much. Moody''s index for distressed debt was
15 percent at the end of the third quarter, down from 16 percent
at the close of the second quarter. One year ago, the distress
index was 32.5 percent. </p>
<p>So far this year, there have been 40 defaults by companies
that Moody''s rates. In the first nine months of 2009, there were
237 defaults. </p>
<p>Debt is considered distressed if the yield is 10 percentage
points more than comparable Treasury securities. </p>
<p>Moody''s predicts that the global default rate will decline
to 2.7 percent by the end of 2010 and to 2 percent by the third
quarter of 2011. </p>

<p>Madden Converts Betsy Johnson Debt to Mark Ownership </p>
<p> Steven Madden Ltd., a footwear designer and marketer,
swapped $27.6 million of secured debt for ownership of the
trademarks and intellectual property of 60-store women''s wear
retailer Betsey Johnson LLC. </p>
<p>In a regulatory filing this morning, Madden, based in Long
Island City, New York, gave a license for the marks back to
Johnson in return for royalties. The statement said that Madden
purchased $48.8 million of secured debt owed by Johnson for
$27.6 million. The debt is secured by all of Johnson''s assets. </p>
<p>As part of the arrangement, Madden also acquired 10 percent
of the Class B preferred shares. At the same time, Madden made a
$3 million loan to Johnson. The loan will pay interest at 8
percent and mature in December 2015. </p>
<p>Castanea Partners, the majority owner of Johnson, made a
new capital investment, the statement said. </p>
<p>New Filing </p>
<p>Five Southern Dairy Farms File to Stop Foreclosure </p>
<p>Dairy Production Systems-Georgia LLC filed for Chapter 11
protection yesterday in Albany, Georgia, along with four
affiliates. They operate five dairy farms in Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi and Texas. </p>
<p>Together, the farms, based in High Springs, Florida, have
about 10,500 head of cattle on farms that collectively encompass
about 3,350 acres. The dairies blamed their financial problems
on the decline in the price of fluid milk, coupled with
increases in feed and operating costs. </p>
<p>The dairies owe $76.2 million to Agricultural Funding
Solutions LLC, which purchased the loan from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. after the original lender, New Frontier Bank of
Greeley, Colorado, was taken over by regulators. </p>
<p>The Chapter 11 filing occurred after Agricultural Funding
filed foreclosure proceedings and asked for the appointment of
receivers. Agricultural Funding bought the loans from the FDIC
for about $22 million, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>Revenue declined to $48 million last year from $57.2
million in 2008 and the farms are operating at no more than 65
percent of capacity, court papers show. </p>
<p>The farms are owned by David P. Sumrall, who guaranteed
much of the bank debt. </p>
<p>The case is In re Dairy Production Systems-Georgia LLC, 10-
11752, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Middle District of Georgia
(Albany). </p>

<p>Walrath Lays Down Rules for Delaware Auction and Bids </p>
<p>The sale of American Safety Razor Co. gave U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Mary F. Walrath an opportunity to expound upon what are
and what aren''t permissible restrictions on bidding at a
bankruptcy auction. </p>
<p>ASR, the fourth-largest maker of wet-shaving blades, asked
Walrath to approve a sale to first-lien lenders. Instead,
Walrath required the company to hold another auction in the
courtroom today. </p>
<p>At a Sept. 30 hearing, Walrath ruled it was improper for
ASR to preclude bidding by Energizer Holdings Inc. on the theory
that federal antitrust regulators would disapprove an
acquisition by the maker of Schick shavers. </p>
<p>Walrath said the bidding process isn''t covered by the so-
called business judgment rule. She said the court has the right
to decide what sale procedures are fair and reasonable
without deference to the company''s business judgment. </p>
<p>The judge in Wilmington, Delaware, decided that several
provisions in the bidding qualifications and procedures were
improper. Walrath said it was not reasonable for the debtor
to have power to exclude a bidder based on the company''s opinion
about whether there is a reasonable likelihood the buyer can
complete the acquisition. She said such a loose provision would
give a bankrupt company the ability to prevent bidding by any
prospective buyer already in the industry. </p>
<p>Walrath said it was even more remarkable to prevent a
prospective bidder from receiving due diligence material until
after being designed as a so-called qualified bidder. </p>
<p>The judge said it wasn''t fair for the bankrupt company to
have discretion to require different deposits from different
bidders. </p>
<p>She said her biggest problem was ASR''s insistence that
there must be a nonrefundable deposit or some other form of a
hell-or-high-water provision accompanying a bid by
Energizer. Walrath said there could be several means for dealing
with the possibility that antitrust regulators might block a
sale to Energizer. </p>
<p>Walrath said it would be acceptable for ASR to have the
ability to terminate a sale contract if antitrust clearance
wasn''t given within about two months. </p>
<p>To be sure the new auction today would be conducted on a
level playing field, Walrath reminded the parties there are
criminal sanctions for anybody who proceeds with a sale process
in bankruptcy court for ulterior and improper motives. </p>
<p>For details on ASR''s debt structure and the bids, click
here for the Oct. 1 Bloomberg bankruptcy report. </p>
<p>ASR, based in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, has U.S. plants in
Virginia and Tennessee. Affiliates abroad aren''t in bankruptcy.
It was acquired for $625 million in July 2006 by London-based
Lion Capital LLP. </p>
<p>ASR has the largest market share for private-label blades,
although only 8 percent when branded goods are included,
according to Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>The case is In re American Safety Razor Co., 10-12351, U.S.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., DBS Group
Holdings Ltd., Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas SA will be audited
by South Korean regulators on their foreign-exchange derivatives
holdings as policy makers seek to curb won gains. </p>
<p>The audit will begin Oct. 19 and focus on trades in non-
deliverable forwards, said Doh Bo Eun, head of the foreign-
exchange coordination team at the Financial Supervisory Service.
The contracts, settled in dollars, enable investors to speculate
on exchange-rate fluctuations. </p>
<p>The won''s 5.6 percent gain against the dollar in the past
month makes South Korean exports more expensive at a time when
the economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe shows signs of
faltering. The regulator wants to ensure that the value of
outstanding currency derivatives, which the government estimates
are declining, falls to below mandated limits. </p>
<p>We want to check if the banks have been abiding by the
rules, Doh said by telephone today. The very high level of
derivatives held by overseas banks has fallen a lot. </p>
<p>Shinhan Financial Group Co. and Korea Exchange Bank will
also be audited, from Oct. 26, Doh said. </p>
<p>Lee You Chul, a spokesman for Shinhan, said the company
hadn''t been told by the regulators of the audit, while Korea
Exchange Bank spokesman Kim Sun Gyu declined to comment.
Officials at JPMorgan, BNP Paribas and DBS didn''t immediately
respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Capital Inflows </p>
<p>Local banks in June were ordered to reduce holdings of the
derivatives to 50 percent of equity capital within a two-year
period, starting Oct. 9. The limit for overseas banks was set at
250 percent of equity capital. All banks were banned from
raising their derivatives above the levels held on July 9. </p>
<p>Governments from South Korea to Brazil are stepping up
attempts to control their currencies as near-zero interest rates
in the U.S. and Japan spur demand for higher-yielding assets in
developing nations, whose economies are leading global growth.
Investors poured almost $90 billion into emerging-market stock
and bond funds in the first nine months of this year, an EPFR
Global data show. </p>
<p>Trading in non-deliverable forwards in South Korea rose
considerably in September, Doh said. The won advanced 5.1
percent during the same period, its biggest monthly advance in a
year. </p>
<p>The value of outstanding currency derivatives held by
domestic and overseas banks currently exceeds new limits by $2.7
billion, compared with 12.1 billion in July, Lawrence H. Lee,
director of the foreign-exchange policy division at the Ministry
of Strategy and Finance, said this week in Seoul. </p>
<p>No Choice'' </p>
<p>Overseas banks operating in South Korea have no choice
but to cut their holdings of swaps and bonds in the country
because of new limits, Lee Sung Hee, managing director at
JPMorgan in Seoul, said Oct. 6. </p>
<p>Korean regulators announced their audit plans after Brazil
doubled a tax it charges foreigners on investments in fixed-
income securities to 4 percent. </p>
<p>South Korea is a small, open economy that is vulnerable to
surges in capital flows, Vice Finance Minister Yim Jong Yong
said on June 9. He said $65 billion was taken out of country in
the four to five months after the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>

<p>Explorers face being stripped of licenses or awarded less

revenue coming into the national coffers, said Rolake Akinola,

<p>Ghana blocked Exxon''s $4 billion bid to buy a stake in the

Tullow''s plans to start pumping from fields in Uganda with 1
billion barrels of oil have been held up by a tax dispute. Both
countries are set to become major oil exporters for the first

<p>Government interference in Uganda and Ghana is a major
concern, said Dougie Youngson, an analyst at Arbuthnot

operating in Africa. </p>

<p>General Motors Co.''s GMC and Buick,
the fastest-growing brand in the U.S. this year, are considering
a courtesy loaner program for customers getting warranty service
on their vehicles to build awareness of the company''s products. </p>
<p>GM, the largest U.S. automaker, may start the service in
the next couple weeks, Brian Sweeney, vice president of
sales for Buick and GMC, said in a telephone interview. The
program would seek to get GMC Acadia owners into a Buick
Enclave, for example, and build recognition of more GM vehicles,
he said. </p>
<p>We want to expose customers to other Buick and GMC
products, said Sweeney, who met with about 900 dealers that
sell the two brands last week. </p>
<p>Dealers selling Buick need to change and meet the
expectations customers have when shopping for a premium car,
said Mike Bowsher, co-chairman of the national dealer council
for Buick-GMC and president of Carl Black Automotive Group. </p>
<p>We can''t sell Buicks like we did Pontiac, Bowsher, who
runs dealerships in Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, said in a
telephone interview. A lot of us were old Pontiac dealers, and
we now have to learn how to handle the Lexus, Ritz-Carlton,
Cadillac, Mercedes kind of crowd. </p>
<p>Some Buick-GMC dealers already make loaner vehicles
available to customers, Bowsher said. GM may push dealers to
make the practice standard, he said. </p>
<p>Buick outpaced all other brands with a 58 percent increase
in U.S. sales through September, according to Autodata Corp. GMC
sales rose 31 percent, according to the Woodcliff Lake, New
Jersey-based researcher. </p>
<p>Pared Brands </p>
<p>GM pared its U.S. brands to Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and
GMC as part of its bankruptcy last year. Hummer, Saturn and
Pontiac were shuttered and Saab was sold as the company received
$50 billion from the federal government while restructuring. </p>
<p>GM said last week it would add the Verano compact car to
Buick, the brand''s first small car in more than 20 years. The
company hasn''t announced when production of the Verano will
begin at GM''s Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan. </p>
<p>Buick also will add a sport-utility vehicle that will be
smaller than the Enclave, and a higher performance version of
the Regal sedan called the Regal GS, Sweeney said. The Verano
and smaller SUV follow new models including the Regal earlier
this year and the LaCrosse mid-sized sedan last year. </p>

<p>Nigeria, Africa''s biggest oil
producer, will be the next gold rush on the continent as
investors take advantage of a booming economy, former South
African central bank Governor Tito Mboweni said. </p>
<p>Nigeria''s gross domestic product will overtake South
Africa''s in the next three decades, Mboweni, who is now an
adviser for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in an interview in
Johannesburg on Oct. 8. Its economy of $169 billion compares
with South Africa''s $286 billion, according to World Bank data. </p>
<p>Nigeria is going to be Africa''s growth story for the next
15 to 20 years, Mboweni said after returning from a visit to
Nigeria''s capital, Abuja, and the commercial hub, Lagos, as part
of a delegation from Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The West African nation, the continent''s most populous with
140 million people, is targeting economic growth of 10 percent
in the coming years as it boosts spending on power plants and
attracts more investment, Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga, a
former Goldman Sachs executive, said Sept. 3. The government is
preparing to sell its first Eurobond of $500 million this year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which doesn''t have an office in Nigeria, is
bidding to advise on the sale of state-owned power-generation
and distribution companies, the Bureau of Public Enterprises
said on Aug. 31. The government hasn''t said who will manage the
Eurobond sale yet. </p>
<p>Mboweni is also chairman of Nampak Ltd., Africa''s biggest
packaging maker, which is benefiting from its business in
Nigeria, he said. Nampak manufactures bottles for Guinness beer
and cigarette packages in the country. </p>
<p>Banking Crisis </p>
<p>Nigeria has previously failed to convert its oil wealth
into economic development. In its latest crisis, central bank
Governor Lamido Sanusi, who took office in June last year, fired
the chief executive officers of eight of the 24 commercial
lenders and pumped 620 billion naira ($4 billion) to bail out 10
of them as the industry risked collapse. Sanusi said on Sept. 21
that the economy will probably expand 7.8 percent this year, up
from 7 percent in 2009. </p>
<p>Nigeria has oil production capacity of more than 3 million
barrels a day, Oil Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said on Sept.
27, making it the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries''
sixth-largest supplier. Oil accounts for more than 80 percent of
government revenue, according to the Finance Ministry. </p>
<p>There are a number of good, young technocrats in Nigeria''s
government who will help sort out the chaos in the country,
Mboweni said. </p>
<p>Good Job'' </p>
<p>A former labor minister in President Nelson Mandela''s first
Cabinet in 1994, Mboweni, 51, left the South African Reserve
Bank in November after a decade at its helm, declining President
Jacob Zuma''s offer to serve a third term. He was named chairman
of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., Africa''s biggest gold producer, on
Feb. 24, three weeks after he was appointed to the same position
at Nampak. </p>
<p>Mboweni, who is a patron of the South African Ballet
Theater, is currently raising $130 million for a planned
specialist children''s hospital in Johannesburg. </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of South Africa is doing a good job,
Mboweni said. Interest rate increases between June 2006 and June
2008 helped to curb price gains, he said. </p>
<p>Inflation has been inside the central bank''s 3 percent to 6
percent target range since February, easing to an annual 3.5
percent in August. </p>
<p>Union Criticism </p>
<p>Mboweni was criticized by South African labor unions for
not cutting interest rates fast enough in 2009, which they said
prolonged the economy''s first recession in 17 years. He lowered
the benchmark rate six times to 7 percent between December 2008
and August 2009. His replacement, Gill Marcus, has cut the rate
by 1 percentage point since then. </p>
<p>In his new role at Goldman Sachs, Mboweni said he has met
with foreign investors, who raised concerns about calls from the
youth wing of the ruling African National Congress to
nationalize the country''s mines. His response to them is that
the center will hold in the ANC, he said. </p>
<p>The ANC agreed at its National General Council meeting,
which ended on Sept. 24, to study nationalizing mines and other
key industries over the next two years. The ANC Youth League,
led by Julius Malema, argued at the meeting that South Africa
didn''t derive enough benefit from mining, which generates 30
percent of export revenue in the country. </p>

<p>Citadel Broadcasting Corp., a Las
Vegas-based owner of 224 radio stations, violated the terms of
the confirmed reorganization plan by making stock awards to the
chief executive officer and board, R2 Investments LDC alleged in
a bankruptcy court filing last week. </p>
<p>R2, which supported the Citadel Chapter 11 plan implemented
in June, says that management and directors gave themselves
stock worth $110 million while the plan only permitted granting
options to vest over three years at strike prices equaling the
market or higher. </p>
<p>R2 said the stock grants to management and directors were a
shocking display of corporate greed and dishonesty. The
creditor said that whether to issue stock or options to
management was a hotly contested topic during the bankruptcy
process. </p>
<p>R2 wants the bankruptcy judge at a Nov. 3 hearing to
enforce the plan and compel the stock to be given back.
Otherwise, Citadel will stand as a blueprint for all other
management teams to emulate in order to loot company coffers.
R2 called the stock awards one of the most egregious frauds by
a company emerging from bankruptcy under Chapter 11. </p>
<p>The papers by R2, filed Oct. 6, say that stock awards cost
creditors 7.5 percent of the value of the shares they received
under the reorganization plan that was confirmed on May 19. </p>
<p>R2 contends that Chief Executive Officer Farid Suleman
received $55 million in stock while each board member was given
stock worth $1.35 million. </p>
<p>R2 reserved the right to seek revocation of plan
confirmation on account of fraud. A call to a lawyer at Kirkland
 Ellis LLP, attorneys for Citadel, was  returned. </p>
<p>The predicted recovery for Citadel''s secured creditors was
82 percent. For unsecured creditors, it was 36 percent. For
details on the plan, click here for the May 18 Bloomberg
bankruptcy report. </p>
<p>Citadel has operations in more than 50 markets. It filed a
prepackaged Chapter 11 petition in January. The creditors''
committee supported the plan after a settlement improving
treatment of unsecured creditors. Citadel and subsidiaries
listed assets of $1.4 billion against debt totaling $2.46
billion. Citadel is the third-largest radio station owner in the
U.S., with 166 FM and 58 AM stations. </p>
<p>After emergence from Chapter 11, Citadel stock traded
sporadically in the over-the-counter market. The last reported
trade was $22.88 on Oct. 8. </p>
<p>The case is Citadel Broadcasting Corp., 09-17442, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Updates </p>
<p>UBS Beats Back Opposition to Underwriting for GGP </p>
<p>General Growth Properties Inc. received approval from the
bankruptcy judge on Oct. 8 for financing to accompany approval
of the Chapter 11 plan scheduled for an Oct. 21 confirmation
hearing. For Bloomberg coverage of the hearing, click here. </p>
<p>The U.S. Trustee objected to allowing UBS Securities LLC to
serve as an underwriter and lender in part of the so-called exit
financing. The U.S. Trustee contended UBS didn''t meet the
requirement of being disinterested because it was already
serving as one of General Growth''s two financial advisers. </p>
<p>The objection of the U.S. Trustee was resolved in a
chambers conference that was closed to the public. UBS said in
response to the objection of the U.S. Trustee that no party
with an economic stake in the outcome of these Chapter 11 cases
opposes UBS''s participation as an underwriter. UBS also said
that its prior efforts have undeniably contributed to the
Debtor''s success. </p>
<p>The General Growth subsidiaries owning the properties
already confirmed Chapter 11 plans paying their creditors in
full. Creditors of General Growth''s top-tier companies are to
receive full payment under the parents'' Chapter 11 plan up for
confirmation on Oct. 21. The plan preserves some of the stock
for existing shareholders. The plan is financed in part with an
$8.55 billion debt and equity commitment from a group led by
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. </p>
<p>General Growth, the second-largest mall owner in the U.S.
with 180 properties in 43 states, began the largest real-estate
reorganization in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April
2009. The books of Chicago-based General Growth had assets of
$29.6 billion and total liabilities of $27.3 billion as of Dec.
31, 2008. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Energizer Wins Second Auction for American Safety Razor </p>
<p>The bankruptcy judge authorized American Safety Razor Co.
to sell the business for $301 million cash to Energizer Holdings
Inc., the maker of Schick shavers. </p>
<p>At the Oct. 8 auction and hearing, Energizer beat out the
original bid from secured lenders who offered to buy the
business in exchange for the $244.4 million they were owed on a
first-lien revolving credit and term loan. </p>
<p>ASR originally turned down the offer from Energizer in
light of concerns that a sale would never close given the
possibility of objection from federal antitrust regulators. At a
hearing on Sept. 30, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath
overruled ASR''s decision and required holding another auction
where Energizer could bid. </p>
<p>Energizer is required to complete the acquisition by Nov.
23. Otherwise, the lenders will take title in exchange for debt.
Second-lien creditors, owed $178.1 million, had urged Walrath to
hold the second auction where Energizer could bid. </p>
<p>For Bloomberg coverage of the Oct. 8 hearing, click here. </p>
<p>ASR filed under Chapter 11 in July, saying at the time that
it would give second-lien creditors an opportunity to arrange a
sale at a price more favorable than swapping the business for
the first-lien debt. </p>
<p>Mezzanine lenders are owed $60 million. The agent for the
first-lien lenders is UBS AG. ASR had revenue of $330 million in
2009. </p>
<p>Cedar Knolls, New Jersey-based ASR has plants in Virginia
and Tennessee. Affiliates abroad aren''t in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>ASR was acquired for $625 million in July 2006 by London-
based Lion Capital LLP. </p>
<p>ASR has the largest market share for private-label blades,
although only 8 percent when branded goods are included,
according to Moody''s Investors Service. </p>

Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>
<p>Schutt Sports Wants Riddell Cited for Contempt Over Statements </p>
<p>Schutt Sports Inc., the Illinois football-helmet maker,
accused rival Riddell Inc. of violating a stay order and asked
that it be cited for contempt in a request that raises issues
about free speech in bankruptcy cases. </p>
<p>The new controversy results from a $29 million patent-
infringement judgment won by Riddell. Schutt filed under Chapter
11 on Sept. 6 to halt collection on the judgment. </p>
<p>Schutt alleged in papers filed last week that sales
representatives from Riddell are telling Schutt customers that
the company filed in Chapter 11 and may go out of business. </p>
<p>Schutt contends that the communications violate the so-
called automatic stay in bankruptcy that prohibits attempting to
collect a pre-bankruptcy debt. The stay also prohibits
interference with a bankrupt company''s property. </p>
<p>Riddell should be held in contempt of the automatic stay,
Schutt said in Oct. 6 court papers. The contempt motion is on
the bankruptcy court calendar for Oct. 21. A call to Riddell''s
lawyers from Perkins Coie LLP wasn''t returned. </p>
<p>Trying to drive away a bankrupt''s customers is a violation
of the stay, according to Schutt. Likewise, communications
designed to erode the value of the debtor''s assets violates
the stay. Schutt didn''t cite case law saying when the
prohibitions in the automatic stay give way to the right of free
speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. </p>
<p>Schutt said in the Chapter 11 petition that assets and debt
both exceed $50 million. </p>
<p>The case is In re Schutt Sports Inc., 10-12795, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>

<p>American Apparel Names President from Blockbuster </p>
<p>American Apparel Inc., a Los Angeles-based designer,
manufacturer and apparel retailer, said in a statement that Tom
Casey, the former chief financial officer of Blockbuster Inc.,
was appointed as acting president. </p>
<p>Casey will have primary responsibility for developing the
going forward operating strategy, according to the statement. </p>
<p>American Apparel had a $42.8 million net loss and a $21.6
million loss from operations in the first quarter. Revenue in
the quarter was $121.8 million. The company is late in filing
financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission
for the second quarter. </p>
<p>The preliminary report for the second quarter said the loss
from operations would range between $5 million and $7 million.
Comparable store sales declined 16 percent in the quarter. The
expected net sales for the quarter are $132 to $134 million,
compared with $136.1 million in the same quarter the year
before. </p>
<p>Casey resigned from Blockbuster in August. </p>
<p>Deloitte  Touche LLP, the auditor for American Apparel in
2009, resigned and said the company has not maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte
warned that it needed further information to be sure there
should be no change in the 2009 financials. </p>

<p>Manitowoc Gets Downgrade from SP on Crane Weakness </p>
<p>Although Manitowoc Co. is selling $500 million in new
unsecured notes to pay down an existing term loan, the
manufacturer of cranes and food-service equipment nonetheless
received a downgrade from Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>SP lowered the corporate rating by one peg on Oct. 8 to
B+. SP said the prolonged difficult crane operating
environment is being offset by modest improvements in its
food segment. </p>
<p>The new rating by SP is one level higher than the
downgrade issued in May 2009 by Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>The company is located in its namesake Wisconsin town of
Manitowoc. The stock closed on Oct. 8 at $12.42, up 35 cents a
share in New York Stock Exchange trading. The three-year high
was $50.98 on Dec. 24, 2007. The three-year low was $2.42 on
March 6, 2009. </p>
<p>Advance Sheets </p>
<p>Lack of Federal Jurisdiction Requires Remand to State </p>
<p>When a federal court lack jurisdiction, it can only remand
a lawsuit to state court and cannot dismiss the case on the
merits, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the 8th Circuit ruled
on Oct. 8. </p>
<p>The case involved National Benevolent Association, which
confirmed a full-payment Chapter 11 plan in 2005 in bankrupt
court in Texas. After confirmation, the company sued its
bankruptcy lawyer for malpractice allegedly committed before the
Chapter 11 filing. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy court dismissed the malpractice suit, saying
that an order approving a sale and confirming the plan
conclusively decided that the legal advice was proper. Although
the district court in Texas upheld dismissal, the Court of
Appeals in New Orleans ruled there was no federal jurisdiction
because the company lacked standing. </p>
<p>The 5th Circuit in New Orleans said there was no standing
because the plan didn''t unequivocally list the suit as surviving
confirmation of the plan. </p>
<p>The company sued the firm again in Missouri state court.
The firm removed the suit to a federal bankruptcy court in
Missouri where the bankruptcy judge dismissed, saying that the
5th Circuit ruling barred a suit in state or federal court. </p>
<p>The Appellate Panel for the 8th Circuit ruled on Oct. 8
that it was improper to dismiss on the merits. Instead, the case
should have been remanded to state court, where the state court
could decide if dismissal on the merits was proper. </p>
<p>The Appellate Panel based its ruling on Section 1447(c) of
the federal Judiciary Code which says that a case shall be
remanded to the state court when the federal court lacks
jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The result may have been different had the bankruptcy case
been pending in any circuit other than the 5th. The Court of
Appeals for the 5th Circuit has a rule not existing in other
circuits which requires that a lawsuit must be listed
specifically if it''s to survive confirmation of a plan. </p>
<p>The case is National Benevolent Association v. Weil Gotshal
 Manges LLP, 09-6084, Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the 8th
Circuit (St. Louis). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s stock
research group won the top slot in Institutional Investor
magazine''s 39th annual ranking for the first time, breaking
Barclays Plc''s two-year winning streak. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, had 46 analysts on the list,
two more than last year, the magazine said. Institutional
Investor said the rankings were dominated this year by analysts
who best understood global economic developments such as U.S.
health-care and financial reform, Europe''s government debt
crisis and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. (Click here for the
list of 2010 All-America Research Team First-Teamers.) </p>
<p>The market was driven by macro events, and analysts needed
to understand and interpret those events to provide perspective
on which sectors and stocks would outperform, Thomas Schmidt,
the New York-based head of Americas equity research at JPMorgan,
told Institutional Investor. JPMorgan also won first place in
the magazine''s ranking in September of fixed-income analysts. </p>
<p>Barclays of London was voted second, with 43 analysts on
the list compared with 46 last year. It won in 2008 and 2009,
and it owns the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., which was ranked highest during the five prior years. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp.''s Merrill Lynch Global Research held
its third-place position, while Credit Suisse Group AG came in
fourth and UBS AG took fifth. Bank of America is based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, while Credit Suisse and UBS have
their headquarters in Zurich. </p>
<p>Biggest Increase </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had the biggest climb in the top 10, rising
from ninth place to seventh after increasing the number of
analysts on the list by eight to 24. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
slipped to tenth from eighth place with 10 analysts. Both
companies are based in New York. </p>
<p>The magazine surveyed 3,500 investors at 970 companies with
assets of $10.2 trillion to produce the stock-analyst ranking. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s antidepressant
reboxetine, sold for more than a decade in Europe, is no more
effective than a placebo at treating symptoms of depression,
according to an analysis that included unpublished studies. </p>
<p>After examining unpublished data on the drug, researchers
at the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health
Care found that published studies overestimated reboxetine''s
benefit by 115 percent when compared to a dummy pill and 23
percent compared with other antidepressants, according to a
report today in the British Medical Journal. </p>
<p>The variation between the results of the published and
unpublished studies shows that pharmaceutical companies need
stricter rules about disclosing the test results, the
researchers said. Drugmakers must reveal study findings for
products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and
European regulators are considering a similar policy. </p>
<p>There''s still a regulatory gap in Europe, Dirk Eyding,
lead author of the analysis and the head of the clinical study
department at a unit of the German Cancer Society, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. Citing the unpublished
studies, the researchers called reboxetine an ineffective and
potentially harmful antidepressant. </p>
<p>Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said in an e-mailed statement
that it is reviewing the analysis in the British Medical Journal
and that reboxetine is an effective treatment option to
clinicians for use in patients suffering from depressive
illness/major depression and for maintaining the clinical
improvement in patients initially responding to treatment." </p>
<p>The analysis looked at 13 studies of reboxetine involving
4,098 patients. Data on almost three-quarters of those patients
had never been published, the study said. </p>
<p>Not Acceptable'' </p>
<p>It is not acceptable to be shown only positive data,''''
said Anthony Cleare, a psychiatrist and head of the Affective
Disorders Unit at the Maudsley Hospital and Institute of
Psychiatry at King''s College London, in a statement.
Clinicians treating patients with depression absolutely need
the full picture in order to help their patients make the right
choices about the various treatments that are available.'''' </p>
<p>Concern that positive studies were more likely to get
published in medical journals than negative ones led Congress in
2007 to pass a law creating a registry for clinical trials. The
U.S. law doesn''t require disclosure of data from studies
completed before Sept. 27, 2007, or on drugs rejected by
regulators. </p>
<p>German Panel Recommendation </p>
<p>Pfizer turned over the data after the German institute
issued a preliminary version of its report in June 2009 saying
reboxetine doesn''t benefit patients, citing the volume of
unpublished studies, the researchers said. The institute, a
nonprofit group that provides recommendations to the country''s
health insurance system, also funded today''s research. After
reviewing the report, a separate panel recommended the German
health system stop paying for the drug. </p>
<p>Pfizer discloses the results of its clinical trials to
regulatory authorities all around the world, Loder said in the
statement. These regulatory authorities carefully balance the
risks and benefits of each medication, and reflect all important
safety and efficacy information in the approved product
labeling.  </p>
<p>Reboxetine has been sold since 1997 in Germany, the U.K.
and other European Union countries under the brand names
Edronax, Norebox, Davedax and Vestra, the researchers said. U.S.
regulators refused to approve the treatment in 2001. </p>
<p>The drug works differently than most antidepressants
because it only blocks the reabsorption of the chemical
norepinephrine, while other drugs target serotonin. Reboxetine
was developed by Pharmacia Corp., which Pfizer acquired in 2003. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said third-quarter earnings were eroded by
a weakening U.S. dollar, costs associated with a deep-water
drilling ban and lower prices for crude. </p>
<p>Earnings for the period that ended Sept. 30 declined from
the second quarter, the San Ramon, California-based company said
in a Business Wire statement. Oil and natural-gas production,
which accounted for more than 95 percent of Chevron''s 2009
profit, rose 1.1 percent during the first two months of the
quarter. </p>
<p>Chevron is scheduled to release full third-quarter results
on Oct. 29. The company has been reducing investment in lower-
profit businesses such as crude refining and retail fuel sales
to focus on discovering untapped oil and natural-gas fields. </p>
<p>Chevron said expenses in its U.S. exploration business
increased as a result of the federal government''s prohibition on
deep-water drilling, imposed after BP Plc''s Macondo well erupted
in April, killing 11 workers and triggering the biggest oil
spill in U.S. history. The Interior Department, which oversees
offshore drilling, lifted the ban today after new safety
standards were devised. </p>
<p>Chevron fell 44 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $83.40 at 5:20
p.m. New York time. The stock has gained 8.7 percent this year,
outperforming its four largest publicly traded rivals: Exxon
Mobil Corp., PetroChina Co., Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc. </p>
<p>In July, Chevron raised its full-year oil and gas
production estimate to the equivalent of 2.78 million barrels of
crude, which would be a company record. </p>
<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is the biggest U.S. energy
company. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s $3.6 billion purchase
of King Pharmaceuticals Inc. adds abuse-resistant narcotics to
help the drugmaker expand its share of the $22 billion market
for painkillers. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, will pay $14.25 a
share in cash, a 40 percent premium over King''s closing price
yesterday, for the morphine pill Embeda and two other tamper-
resistant painkillers turned away once by U.S. regulators. The
companies announced the deal today and expect it to close by the
first quarter of 2011. </p>
<p>Pfizer is looking for new products before its top-selling
cholesterol pill Lipitor, with $11.4 billion in 2009 sales,
loses revenue to generic competition next year. The New York-
based drugmaker sold more than $5 billion in painkillers in 2009
led by Celebrex for arthritis and Lyrica for nerve pain. </p>
<p>Pfizer is looking to expand into pain to buffer the fall
from the Lipitor precipice, said Corey Davis, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. in New York, in an e-mail today. I wouldn''t
have predicted this deal, but I can see where it makes sense
given the predicament Pfizer is in. </p>
<p>The acquisition would be Pfizer''s biggest since its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. The company has done 30
deals in the past five years with an average size of $4.13
billion. The average premium paid for pharmaceutical
acquisitions over the past 12 months was 24 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>King Shares Rise </p>
<p>Pfizer shares rose 10 cents to $17.48, while King surged
$3.99, or 39 percent, to $14.14 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Before today, King''s shares had
declined 17 percent since Jan. 1 as the Bristol, Tennessee-based
company faced competition from generic copies of the muscle
relaxant Skelaxin, its top-seller last year. </p>
<p>King has been focused on making new painkillers since its
top-selling blood-pressure pill Altace went generic in 2007. The
company acquired Alpharma Inc. the following year for about $1.3
billion to gain rights to Embeda, which was approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration in August 2009. </p>
<p>Tamper-Resistant </p>
<p>King is also developing Remoxy, a long-acting oxycodone
capsule with tamper-resistant features, with Pain Therapeutics
Inc., of San Mateo, California. The drug is designed to be a
safer alternative to OxyContin, made by Stamford, Connecticut-
based Purdue Pharma LP. King has said it plans to re-file Remoxy
to the FDA before the end of the year. The drug was delayed in
December 2008 when the agency asked for more data. </p>
<p>Pfizer felt that they wanted to get in before Remoxy was
re-filed, a catalyst that may spark King shares to move up
pretty aggressively, said Ian Sanderson, an analyst at Cowen 
Co. in Boston, in a telephone interview today. They are taking
advantage of price, although from a discounted cash flow
perspective, they''re paying fair value, maybe a little bit
below. </p>
<p>The agreement includes a $110 million breakup fee King
would pay Pfizer if the deal is terminated under certain
circumstances. </p>
<p>Pain Therapeutics rose $1.16, or 19 percent, to $7.41 in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading as investors felt Pfizer
would be able to better promote Remoxy with doctors if it''s
approved. Remoxy may bring in peak annual sales of $500 million
and Embeda may have peak sales of $350 million, Sanderson said. </p>
<p>The global market for narcotic and non-narcotic pain
treatments was $22.4 billion in 2009, according to health
research firm IMS Health Inc. King is also developing a short-
acting oxycodone pill called Acurox with Palatine, Illinois-
based Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc. The drug failed to win an FDA
panel''s backing in April and plans to re-file it next year may
be tabled if Pfizer isn''t convinced the drug has value in a
market dominated by lower-cost generics, Sanderson said. </p>
<p>King Product Revenue </p>
<p>King, with $1.78 billion in revenue last year, also makes
the non-narcotic Flector pain patch, Thrombin-JMI to control
bleeding during surgery and Levoxyl for thyroid disorders. It
also has an animal health business with $359 million in sales
last year that Pfizer said will complement its own animal
division. </p>
<p>Pfizer said it plans to eliminate $200 million in costs
from King within three years, an estimate that most analysts
said was conservative. </p>
<p>We view King as a solid asset at a somewhat elevated
price for Pfizer, said Joel Levington, managing director with
Brookfield Investment Management Inc., said in an email. The
transaction should modestly help Pfizer''s growth profile in 2012
through 2013, and we do not see the deal having an impact on the
company''s strong creditworthiness. </p>
<p>Bolt-On'' Acquisitions </p>
<p>Pfizer plans to continue looking for bolt on
acquisitions in emerging markets, generic drugs and in targeted
disease areas, Chief Financial Officer Frank D''Amelio said on a
conference call with analysts. The company had $1.88 billion in
cash as of June. </p>
<p>We will continue to be opportunistic regarding additional
business development opportunities going forward, D''Amelio
said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s financial adviser was J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
and its legal adviser was Cadwalader, Wickersham  Taft LLP.
Credit Suisse was King''s financial adviser and Covington 
Burling LLP was its legal adviser. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vaulted
past Morgan Stanley to become the top arranger of stock sales in
Asia outside Japan for the first time since 2005 after divesting
a $2.25 billion stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China
Ltd. two days before the end of the third quarter. </p>
<p>The ICBC sale was one of four deals Goldman Sachs completed
in the last two days of September to overtake Morgan Stanley
with 14.9 percent of the market, its biggest share since 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs pushed into the top slot as equity offerings
in the region surged to $81 billion, marking the best first nine
months since 2007, Bloomberg data show. Helping drive the climb
from third a year earlier were stake sales in ICBC and China
Mobile Ltd., the phone carrier Goldman Sachs took public in 1997
that''s now the world''s sixth-largest company by market value. </p>
<p>Asia ex-Japan has been a hot spot for equity capital
markets and it can easily bear more deals given the recent
stock-market rally there, said Christopher Palmer, who
oversees about $6 billion as the London-based head of global
emerging markets at Gartmore Investment Management Ltd. </p>
<p>The MSCI Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Index rallied 12 percent in
September, its best monthly performance since July 2009. </p>
<p>The four offerings Goldman Sachs completed on Sept. 29 and
Sept. 30 raised a combined $3.15 billion, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Morgan Stanley finished three deals from Sept.
28 to Sept. 30 worth a total of $925 million, taking its nine-
month market share to 12 percent. Before Sept. 28, the two firms
were almost in a tie for the No. 1 spot, the data show. Both
banks are based in New York. </p>
<p>Right Investments'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs expanded its investment-banking workforce in
China by 40 percent this year as part of a push to help more
local companies sell shares, Thomas Deng, the firm''s head of
China equity capital markets, said last month. </p>
<p>Deng, formerly Goldman Sachs''s chief China strategist in
Hong Kong, was appointed to his current role in March. The same
month, the bank said it hired William Smiley from HSBC Holdings
Plc as equity syndicate co-head in Hong Kong. Steven Barg, the
former UBS AG capital-markets chief for Asia, joined two months
later as regional co-head of equity capital markets. </p>
<p>We''ve made the right investments in people and clients
ahead of what''s become an extraordinary level of market
activity, Dan Dees, head of Goldman Sachs''s Asia financing
group, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Nineteen of the 33 stock offers Goldman Sachs arranged in
the nine-month period were by Chinese companies, according to
Bloomberg data. Those deals raised a combined $25.4 billion. </p>
<p>Future Business </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was first in stock underwriting in Asia
outside Japan in the year-earlier period, Bloomberg data show.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been among the five top-
ranked equity sale arrangers in the region since 2006. Morgan
Stanley worked on 43 deals in this year''s first nine months, 10
more than Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>In initial public offerings, Goldman Sachs ranked third in
the nine-month period behind JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche
Bank AG, according to Bloomberg data. That was still its best
showing since 2007. Morgan Stanley was fourth in IPOs in the
region through Sept. 30. </p>
<p>Being one of the top players consistently can certainly
help capture future business, especially for IPOs, said Kester Ng, co-head of equity capital and derivatives markets for Asia-
Pacific at JPMorgan. Clients seeking initial public offerings
will look for banks with credibility and track record. </p>
<p>China, India </p>
<p>Asia has led a recovery in global share sales this year,
powered by China and India. Chinese companies raised $37.5
billion from overseas stock sales through Sept. 30, a 29 percent
jump from a year earlier, Bloomberg data show. China''s domestic
equity underwriting market is only open to overseas investment
banks that have ventures with local partners. </p>
<p>India''s government aims to raise 400 billion rupees ($8.9
billion) in the year through March 2011 selling shares in state
companies. Those deals typically generate near-zero fees. </p>
<p>We expect significant new issue volume for the remainder
of the year, with a healthy balance of large and mid-size IPOs,
follow-ons and convertible bonds, Gokul Laroia, Morgan
Stanley''s co-head of Asia investment banking, said in an email. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s relationship with ICBC stretches back to
2006, when the firm and affiliated funds paid $2.59 billion for
a 4.9 percent stake in the Chinese lender, now the world''s
largest bank by market value. The value of Goldman Sachs''s
holding has swelled to $7.7 billion, even after it raised $4.25
billion in two sales of ICBC stock over the past 16 months. </p>
<p>China Mobile IPO </p>
<p>Vodafone Group Plc turned to Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley
and UBS AG last month to help the U.K. carrier sell a stake in
China Mobile for $6.5 billion. Vodafone bought its holding in
the Beijing-based company in two transactions between 2000 and
2002. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs helped arrange the IPO of China Mobile, then
called China Telecom (H.K.) Ltd., in October 1997 in what was at
the time the biggest-ever stock sale in Asia outside Japan. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also worked on this year''s
IPOs of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and AIA Group Ltd. At
$22.1 billion, Agricultural Bank''s offering was the world''s
largest-ever first-time sale. American International Group Inc.
is raising as much as $14.9 billion by taking its AIA unit
public in what would be Asia''s third-biggest IPO. </p>
<p>Banks all want to achieve that number one status in the
league table as it generally shows the companies that they have
a good track record, a global reach, distribution and research
capabilities and most importantly, a competitive fee, said
Palmer of Gartmore. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. principal-
strategies traders in Asia, which make bets with the bank''s own
money, hired former prime broker Roger Denby-Jones as chief
operating officer of a hedge fund firm they''re leaving the bank
to start, four people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Denby-Jones, 46, will become COO of the new Hong Kong-based
hedge-fund firm to be led by Morgan Sze, global head of Goldman
Sachs''s principal strategies business, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. He will
help set up the company, though he won''t be a Goldman Sachs
employee, they said yesterday. </p>
<p>Banks including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are
complying with the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul act in the U.S.
that prohibits them from risking capital by betting for their
own accounts. Goldman Sachs, which makes about 10 percent of its
revenue from proprietary trading, decided to disband the
principal-strategies group, two people with knowledge of the
decision said last month. </p>
<p>The recruitment of Denby-Jones is likely to help the new
firm raise capital by easing investor concerns that proprietary
traders are not experienced at managing risks, businesses or
even calculating fund performances like hedge funds do. </p>
<p>Hedge-fund teams out of proprietary desks are used to
having all operational tasks and risk management taken care of
by the bank, said Francois Hora, Hong Kong-based Asia head 
of fund of hedge funds firm Signet Capital Management Ltd. which
oversees $1.5 billion. There is therefore a risk that they 
don''t give enough importance to the operational side of the 
business when setting up the hedge fund. </p>
<p>Prop-Trading </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs principal-strategies traders in Asia,
still employed by the bank at the moment, are expected to leave
after the end of this year, said the people. Their fund may
start after the first quarter, two of them added. Edward Naylor,
a Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Denby-Jones joined Boyer Allan Investment Management LLP,
an Asia-focused fund manager that oversees more than $775
million, in 2005 after 14 years at Goldman Sachs, where one of
his roles was head of prime brokerage sales for Europe. He left
as chief executive officer of Boyer Allan to pursue a new
business opportunity, the firm said in a Sept. 30 statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s principal-strategies team members in New
York, led by Bob Howard, are in talks to join another asset-
management firm, people familiar with the matter said last month.
Some other traders and support staff of the group are likely to
get roles within the New York-based firm, they said. </p>
<p>Sze is leading the Asia team to raise money for a new Asia-
focused hedge fund, the people said last month. The group has
more than 10 people in Asia, two of the people said yesterday. </p>
<p>Goldman to Hedge Funds </p>
<p>From Eric Mindich and Dinakar Singh to Hyder Ahmad and
Shafiq Karmali, there is a good track record of Goldman Sachs
principal strategies alumni building successful hedge funds,
said Dan McNicholas, head of Asia financing sales at Bank of
America Corp.''s Merrill Lynch  Co. unit. He declined to comment
on Denby-Jones''s appointment. </p>
<p>Mindich started New York-based Eton Park Capital Management
LP with $3 billion in 2004 with former principal-strategies
department co-head Erland Karlsson. Singh, a former head of the
principal strategies group, co-founded TPG-Axon the same year. </p>
<p>Ahmad raised about $1 billion for his Singapore-based hedge
fund Broad Peak in 2007, Wall Street Journal reported then.
Karmali last year founded Hong Kong-based hedge fund Cypress
Lane Capital LLC. </p>
<p>Turiya Advisors </p>
<p>Davide Erro, who led the Asia arm of a Goldman Sachs desk
that later folded into principal strategies, managed as much as
$3.8 billion as chief investment officer of Gandhara Capital.
Turiya Advisors Asia, the Hong Kong-based hedge fund firm he set
up after Gandhara''s closure, raised $320 million for its fund
by last month. </p>
<p>Pierre-Henri Flamand, Sze''s predecessor as global head of
the group, left earlier this year to set up London-based hedge
fund called Edoma Capital Partners LLP, two people with direct
knowledge told Bloomberg this week. He is expected to raise half
a billion dollars in the coming months, they said. </p>
<p>The key question for a proprietary desk spinoff to answer
is not one about their talent, but one about their business-
management ability as their careers have been cocooned with an
investment bank, said Paul Smith, a Hong Kong-based managing
director of asset manager and hedge-fund distributor Triple A
Partners Ltd. </p>
<p>A strong COO who is also a partner and gets the necessary
resources would help free up the fund manager''s time to focus on
investments, Hora said. </p>

<p>Brazilian mining companies, banks,
homebuilders and transportation companies will likely eclipse
gains for retailers, which have led this year''s advance in Latin
America''s largest market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>Homebuilder PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos  Participacoes,
payment processor Cielo SA and private equity firm GP
Investments Ltd. were added to the Goldman Sachs focus list of
Latin American stocks, analysts at the New York-based bank said
in a note today. Consumer-goods company Hypermarcas SA was
removed. </p>
<p>With great disparities in performance among Brazilian
stocks and sectors so far in 2010, we believe it is time to
rotate sectorally out of consumer and retail stocks that have
been the top performers into other parts of the market,
strategist Stephen Graham wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman also said it expects the Bovespa stock index to
rise 10 percent to 78,000 by yearend from the Oct. 11 close. </p>
<p>Consumer goods companies led gains the MSCI Brazil index''s
6.2 percent rise this year, while energy producers were the
biggest laggards. As the Bovespa rose 4.5 percent this year,
retailer Lojas Renner SA and tobacco maker Souza Cruz SA surged
more than 50 percent. </p>
<p>This contrasts a 27 percent drop for pulp producer Fibria
Celulose SA and a 30 percent decline for Petroleo Brasileiro SA,
Brazil''s state-controlled oil company. Goldman has buy
ratings on Fibria and Petroleo Brasileiros, along with iron ore
miner Vale SA and pulp producer Suzano Papel e Celulose SA. </p>
<p>Builders Rally </p>
<p>Homebuilders, banks and transportation stocks led gains
today on the Bovespa. Builder MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA
surged 6.5 percent, leading a rally that pushed the BMFBovespa
Real Estate index up 3.7 percent. Airlines Gol Linhas Aereas
Inteligentes SA and Tam SA, jumped, rising 4.9 percent and 6
percent, respectively. The MSCI Brazil Financial index rose 2.6
percent, led by federally controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA. </p>
<p>Vale gained 0.5 percent to 47.64 reais. Fibria fell 2.1
percent to 28.62 reais. </p>
<p>Commodity stocks we think will especially shine, as
developed-market central banks provide a continued flow of
liquidity, wrote Graham, who is bearish on Brazilian
steelmakers. Defensive utilities and telcos may not perform in
the strong market we expect. </p>
<p>Fed Policy </p>
<p>Commodities have gained since U.S. Federal Reserve policy
makers said at their most recent meeting on Sept. 21 that too-
low inflation would warrant looser monetary policy. The Fed will
keep its benchmark interest rate on overnight loans between
banks near zero through 2011, according to the survey median,
longer than previously estimated. </p>
<p>Brazilian steelmakers won''t benefit as much from higher
commodity prices because profit margins will be squeezed by
rising iron ore and coal costs and steel imports will
pressure prices domestically, wrote Graham. </p>
<p>Banks in Brazil will post earnings growth of 39 percent in
2010 and 31 percent in 2011, more than higher-flying
retailers that have surged this year, he wrote. </p>
<p>Financials of course face a different set of risks from
retailers, and generally we do not expect their multiples to be
as high, but the gap at the moment seems excessive, Graham
wrote. </p>

solid, representing another positive catalyst for the stocks,
Adam Frisch, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to
clients. Visa is based in San Francisco. </p>

adjusted earnings of 88 cents a share. </p>
<p>Profit margins at JPMorgan, the first of the largest U.S.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, sold $4 billion of 10- and 30-year
debt as the lender bypasses concern over home foreclosure
practices. </p>
<p>The company issued $2.75 billion of 4.25 percent, 10-year
notes that yield 180 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, and $1.25 billion of 5.5 percent, 30-year bonds at a
spread of 165 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold the debt after attorneys general from all 50
states said yesterday they have opened an investigation into
whether lenders and mortgage companies falsified documents in
foreclosure proceedings. JPMorgan said it was adding $1 billion
to reserves set aside for repurchasing mortgages and also
expanded a review of foreclosures to about 115,000 files in 41
states from at least 56,000 loans in 23 states on Sept. 23. </p>
<p>There was at least an estimate for the liability that
people could chew on and deal with when they announced the
reserves they took for the problem, said Lon Erickson, who
helps oversee $9 billion of fixed-income assets, including
JPMorgan bonds, at Thornburg Investment Management. It makes
the market feel better when there''s a black-and-white number to
start with as a base and they can adjust up or down from
there. </p>
<p>Investors Comforted'' </p>
<p>The estimates comforted investors, said Erickson, a
managing director at the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based company. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the review will
cost more money, though expenses will probably be
incremental. </p>
<p>The spreads on JPMorgan''s debt compare with 222 basis
points on the average bank bond, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch''s U.S. Corporates, Banks index. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The bank''s last benchmark sale in dollars was Sept. 27,
when it issued $1.15 billion of three-year fixed- and floating-
rate debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Moody''s
Investors Service assigns JPMorgan a grade of Aa3 and Standard 
Poor''s ranks it A+, one step lower. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. is the largest U.S. bank by assets,

Treasury rather than in the best interest of its customers,
Robert Hillman, a securities law professor at the University of
California, Davis, said in a telephone interview. By investing
any of its clients'' money over which it has control in GM stock
-- which is in the Treasury''s interest -- Treasury benefits from
any money that Citi invests in GM. </p>
<p>Mark Paustenbach, a Treasury spokesman, and Noreen
Pratscher, a GM spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Offering Size </p>
<p>GM filed a registration statement for the IPO on Aug. 18
and amended it today. The company plans to sell $8 billion to
$10 billion in stock in November, two people familiar with the
matter said last month. The offering could be as low as
$6 billion if there isn''t enough demand for the shares, they
said. </p>
<p>In the amended filing, GM said the Treasury has set
guidelines to maximize taxpayer returns. The U.S. government
acquired its stake as part of GM receiving $50 billion from the
federal government in its 2009 bankruptcy. </p>
<p>GM said the Treasury''s guidelines balance price per share,
total proceeds to the taxpayer, a stable shareholder base,
and broad interest in follow-on offerings to the extent
practicable, the filing said. </p>
<p>Potential investors will be sought across multiple
geographies, according to the filing. The offering should give
so-called retail investors an opportunity to participate, the
filing said. </p>
<p>For the U.S. to recoup its $50 billion investment in GM, it
needs to sell at an average price, before splits, of $131 a
share, a person familiar with the matter said earlier this
month. The stock will likely be split to sell at an initial
price of around $20 a share in part to attract retail investors,
the person said. </p>
<p>Sovereign Wealth Funds </p>
<p>Investment bankers for GM have met with sovereign wealth
funds and private investors in the Middle East and Asia to gauge
interest in the offering, Bloomberg reported Oct. 5, citing two
people familiar with the meetings. </p>
<p>GM''s bankers planned to approach Riyadh, Saudi Arabia-based
Kingdom Holding Co., Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Development Co.,
Qatar Holdings LLC and Singapore-based Temasek Holdings Pte.
about GM''s initial public offering, said one of the people. </p>
<p>SAIC Motor Corp., which has partnered with GM to make cars
together in China for more than a decade, also has said it may
participate in the offering. SAIC will consider investing in GM
if conditions are favorable, Chairman Hu Maoyuan said last
month. </p>
<p>GM''s underwriters have reserved as much as 5 percent of the
shares of common stock being sold through a directed share
program to employees, retirees and dealers in the U.S. and
Canada, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Directed Share Program </p>
<p>GM and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney have set up a website
where workers, retirees, dealers and directors can buy shares.
The minimum investment for the program is expected to be $1,000,
according to the website. </p>
<p>The amended filing also adds new language stating that if
the Treasury elects to exert more control over the company, as a
government entity it may have a greater interest in promoting
U.S. economic growth and jobs than other shareholders. </p>
<p>A covenant to GM''s loan agreement with the Treasury as part
of its bankruptcy last year requires that the automaker use
commercially reasonable best efforts to be within 90 percent
of U.S. manufacturing targets that project 25 percent growth in
domestic production by 2014. Those targets were disclosed in a
previous GM filing last month. </p>
<p>Today''s filing says that GM''s Chevrolet Volt, scheduled to
start production next month, always makes use of electric
power within the drive unit at all times and at all speeds. </p>
<p>Volt Reviews </p>
<p>The language has been added after auto publications
including Edmunds.com, Motor Trend and Popular Mechanics
questioned in reviews this week whether the Volt was truly an
electric car because its four-cylinder gasoline engine
indirectly helps turn the car''s wheels. </p>
<p>GM said in an Oct. 11 statement that there is no direct
mechanical connection between the Volt''s gasoline engine and the
drive wheels. </p>
<p>Separately, GM said litigation related to GM Daewoo, GM''s
majority-owned affiliate in Korea, may result in a loss of as
much as 332 billion Korean won, or about $290 million, according
to the company''s preliminary estimate. </p>
<p>The three separate group actions filed by current and
former hourly employees of GM Daewoo allege that the company
excluded certain allowances in its wages that were due under the
Presidential Decree of the Korean Labor Standards Act, GM said. </p>

<p>It''s been a rough three years for
banks, securities firms and insurers -- even rougher for the
analysts whose job it is to predict how the stocks of these
firms will perform, Bloomberg Markets reports in its November
issue. </p>
<p>Starting in the second half of 2007, the financial system
unraveled. First, the market for securities backed by subprime
mortgages collapsed. By the second half of 2008, stock markets
around the world were in free fall. Then, starting in March
2009, stocks roared back in the most powerful rally since the
1930s. </p>
<p>I don''t even remember when things were normal, says
Daniel Harris, a financial services analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. Every analyst that has been around in financial
services during this time has a newfound respect for the depth
that stock prices can go to. </p>
<p>A semblance of normalcy returned to the markets in the
summer of 2010, says Frederick Cannon, co-director of research
at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc. We actually had
a stretch this August when most of Wall Street went off to the
Hamptons and you could finally take a little bit of a breather
for the first time in three years. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and KBW did better than most at figuring out
where markets were headed. Goldman is No. 1 and KBW No. 2 in the
Bloomberg Markets ranking of the world''s best financial sector
research firms. Goldman''s Harris is one of the top three
analysts of financial service firms, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>2,500 Analysts </p>
<p>The ranking is based on stock recommendations made by more
than 2,500 analysts worldwide at 77 research firms and
investment banks from January 2008 to July 2010. It looks at the
analysts'' buy, hold and sell calls on shares of 90 of the
largest banks, diversified financial service companies and
insurers in the U.S., Europe and Asia with at least 20 analysts
covering them. </p>
<p>Even the best of the firms and individual stock pickers
failed to accurately predict the fall and rise of most big
financial stocks. Goldman Sachs''s analysts won their No. 1 rank
by making 30 accurate calls on the 79 financial stocks they
follow, or 38 percent, while KBW''s No. 2 post was based on 27
prescient calls on 78 stocks. </p>
<p>It was a very difficult climate to make stock
recommendations in, says S.P. Kothari, a professor of
management and deputy dean at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology''s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge. First,
you had to predict the downfall of the financial sector in 2008,
which only very few people did. Then, you had to change your
outlook to catch the recovery -- all within a relatively short
period of time. </p>
<p>Looking for Ideas </p>
<p>Jason Brady, a managing director at Santa Fe, New Mexico-
based Thornburg Investment Management, which oversees about $56
billion, says he doesn''t read analyst reports for picks on
individual stocks. </p>
<p>It''s unusual to see original thinking in these reports,
even though that''s what''s most valuable to me, he says. The
ones who are different aren''t always right, but they''re
frequently the most interesting and thoughtful. </p>
<p>Harris''s best call was the buy he put on retail broker TD
Ameritrade Holding Corp. on Dec. 9, 2008, according to Bloomberg
data. The shares sold at $12.80 at the time and rose 46 percent
in the following 12 months. After the Goldman Sachs analyst put
a hold on the stock in December 2009, it declined 16 percent
through the end of July. </p>
<p>Schwab Sell Call </p>
<p>While he called the rise of TD Ameritrade, Harris advised
investors to sell Charles Schwab Corp. in September 2009 before
going to a hold recommendation earlier this year; its stock
has since fallen 16 percent. </p>
<p>We liked Ameritrade better than Charles Schwab because we
thought their management was being more aggressive in what they
were trying to do to battle a very challenging environment,
Harris says. They were active managers of their capital. They
made the acquisition of Thinkorswim to boost their trading
activities. </p>
<p>TD Ameritrade acquired Thinkorswim Group Inc., a New York
options brokerage, in January 2009 for $748.6 million to tap
into fast-growing investor interest in the options market. </p>
<p>Volatile markets have been the least of New York-based
KBW''s tribulations. In 2001, the investment bank lost 67
employees, including 22 from its research department, in the
Sept. 11 terrorist strike that brought down the World Trade
Center. </p>
<p>A Wild Ride'' </p>
<p>It''s been a crazy time for us for the past nine years,
says John Howard, 56, co-director of research with Cannon. He
has been at KBW since 1982 and moved to research from sales in
2001 as part of the effort to rebuild that department. Combine
9/11 with everything that has happened over the past couple of
years in the market, and it''s been a wild ride for the firm, he
says. </p>
<p>Howard sits in KBW''s living room -- a lounge on the
fourth floor of the firm''s new midtown Manhattan offices -- next
to a memorial sculpture made from a steel girder salvaged from
the Trade Center. The sculpture complements a painting of an
American flag in the lobby with the names of the KBW dead
written on the stripes. </p>
<p>KBW is the seventh-largest U.S. investment bank, with a
market capitalization of $949.9 million and a total of 562
employees today. It provides advisory services mostly to other
financial firms. </p>
<p>Crash Economics </p>
<p>The market crash and subsequent rise made equity analysts''
jobs harder, because the events had little to do with individual
companies'' performance, says Anton Schutz, who uses KBW''s
research and trading services in his management of $250 million
in financial shares at Mendon Capital Advisors Corp. in
Rochester, New York. </p>
<p>Macro developments drove the stocks so that intelligent
stock picking was difficult, Schutz says. But you still had to
make sure you didn''t buy the losers such as Bear Stearns and
that you picked the survivors such as JPMorgan. KBW helped solve
that puzzle for us. </p>
<p>Cannon, 54, says his analysts do bottom-up research,
focusing on a financial company''s fundamentals more than on the
economic climate in which it''s operating. </p>
<p>We were able to see macro trends during the financial
crisis because we were looking so hard at the micro level, he
says. When we looked across the about 600 banks we cover, it
was staring us in the face. </p>
<p>A Hold on Discover </p>
<p>KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani, who''s one of the top two U.S.
credit-card analysts, according to Bloomberg data, reacted early
to deteriorating economic conditions by putting a hold on the
stock of card issuer Discover Financial Services in December
2007, as delinquent payments began to rise. </p>
<p>The stock fell 39 percent in the next 18 months. In the 13
months after Sakhrani, 35, switched to a buy rating in June
2009, the stock rose 44 percent. </p>
<p>Sakhrani in mid-August 2009 added American Express to his
buy list. He thinks American Express will benefit from a rise in
consumer credit quality, growth in spending and an increase in
fees. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Harris says that, unlike KBW, his team uses the
expertise of the firm''s economists to help pick stocks. Goldman
was one of the first banks to predict, in 2007, that interest
rates would remain low for a long period of time. At the end of
2009, it forecast there would be no rate hike until at least
2012. </p>
<p>I leveraged the knowledge and the forecasts that Goldman
had on interest rates and unemployment to help me determine what
the best stock selections were, Harris, 36, says. Our macro
research helped our micro research. </p>
<p>Burnell Picks Goldman </p>
<p>A timely buy rating on Goldman Sachs itself helped earn
Wells Fargo  Co. analyst Matt Burnell a spot among the best
analysts of diversified banks. His call came in April 2009, a
month after the market turned positive. By July 30 of this year,
when he still had a buy on the stock, it was up 33 percent. </p>
<p>Burnell, 48, says he saw Goldman stock rising because of
its strong market position and modest exposure to mortgages and
other loans. At the same time he rated Goldman a buy, he put a
hold on investment bank Morgan Stanley because 62 percent of
the bank''s common equity consisted of shaky commercial mortgages
and other real-estate investments. The stock has been flat since
then. </p>
<p>Before moving to Wells Fargo, Burnell worked in fixed
income for 12 years at Merrill Lynch  Co., now owned by Bank of
America Corp. </p>
<p>Balance Sheet Perspective'' </p>
<p>As a fixed-income analyst, you have more of a balance
sheet perspective as opposed to an earnings-per-share focus, he
says. Also, knowing how the debt market works can be very
helpful because bond price movements are often a leading
indicator of stock price movements. </p>
<p>When financial stocks began their recovery in mid-2009,
many U.S. regional banks outperformed their Wall Street
counterparts. Deutsche Bank AG''s Matt O''Connor made a series of
calls on U.S. regional banks that places him among the best
three analysts in that category. He''s also one of the best three
analysts of commercial banks. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank ranks No. 3 among firms with the largest
number of accurate calls. </p>
<p>The 35-year-old O''Connor''s best regional bank call was his
June 2009 buy recommendation on Minneapolis-based US Bancorp.
By the time he put a hold on the stock in May, it had climbed
45 percent. After his hold, it declined 7 percent through July
30. </p>
<p>Keeping Doors Open </p>
<p>We had noticed that a lot of banks were pulling back in
key business areas, but because US Bancorp was stronger it had
the ability to keep the doors open for business, he says. The
downgrade came after the weaker banks had gotten stronger, and
we wanted to take profit. </p>
<p>As the financial crisis rippled across the globe in late
2008, one hard-hit country was South Korea. The economy and
stock market fell so far so fast that President Lee Myung Bak
declared a national emergency. Gross domestic product contracted
5.1 percent in the last three months of 2008 alone. </p>
<p>Five months after the national alert, top Asian equity
analyst Hunpio Hong of KTB Securities Co. in Seoul went from a
hold to a buy rating on Korean banks, according to Bloomberg
data. His best call was his June 2009 buy recommendation on
Seoul-based Shinhan Financial Co. By the end of July this year,
the stock was up 54 percent. </p>
<p>Shinhan is South Korea''s largest financial company by
market value. </p>
<p>A Difficult Decision'' </p>
<p>It was such a difficult decision at the time, says Hong,
42, who has a Master of Business Administration from the
University of Washington. The stock performance had partly been
beyond my analysis because of the crisis, but in mid-2009 I saw
that the downward trend of Korean banks'' net interest margin was
coming to an end. </p>
<p>The net interest margin is the difference between what a
bank pays in interest to depositors and what it earns from
loans. </p>
<p>While most South Korean banks have come back from the
crisis, Europe''s have not. The region''s financial institutions
fell more than 50 percent from January 2008 through July,
according to the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index. Chintan Joshi of Nomura Holdings Inc. ranks as one of
Europe''s premier bank analysts for finding exceptions to the bad
news in the Scandinavian market, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>The world was in a very bearish place at the time, says
Joshi, who came to Nomura when it acquired Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.''s Asian and European operations. But the Nordic
macroeconomic situation was better, and the banks didn''t have
much exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>Nordic Lights </p>
<p>Joshi, 31, works from London for Tokyo-based Nomura, tied
at No. 14 in Bloomberg''s firm ranking. His best call was a March
6, 2009, buy recommendation on Oslo-based commercial and
investment bank DnB Nor ASA. The bank''s stock had soared 272
percent as of July 30. </p>
<p>Earlier, in November 2008, Joshi had given a buy
recommendation to Oslo-based Nordea Bank AB. Nordea''s stock
gained 44 percent before Joshi put a hold rating on it in
September 2009. It''s been flat since. </p>
<p>MIT''s Kothari says that what often distinguishes successful
analysts is their willingness to take a risk. </p>
<p>It''s essential to have the courage to be a little bit
different from the herd mentality that most analysts may
exhibit, he says. That courage is what makes some of these
analysts stand out. </p>
<p>The analysts themselves say picking stocks in some of the
most volatile markets in history has been an education. </p>
<p>The past few years have probably been the biggest learning
experience I could have had as an analyst, says Goldman Sachs''s
Harris. The environment was so volatile and so uncertain. That
shapes you. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank, and missile maker Raytheon Corp. led
corporate debt sales in the U.S. this week as the pace of
issuance slows. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s $4 billion offering included the first 30-year
bonds from a U.S. bank in 15 months, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon sold $2
billion in a three-part transaction as it sold securities for
the first time since November 2009, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Companies sold $22.7 billion of debt, compared with $22.6
billion last week, as issuance this month trails September''s
record pace and that of the similar period a year ago. Credit
quality may be near a peak for non-financial U.S. companies and
may decline if firms begin to use the cash raised for expansion,
according to Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>At these prices, there are embedded risks of a change in
market psychology, said William Larkin, who helps manage $500
million at Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts.
We''ve had such huge returns in the corporate bond market that
it''s led to a herd mentality. </p>
<p>Investment-grade corporate bonds have returned 10.9 percent
this year after gaining 19.8 percent in 2009, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch Index data. High-yield, high-risk
company debt''s 13.5 percent gain this year follows its 57.5
percent climb a year ago, the index data show. </p>
<p>Falling Sales </p>
<p>Sales this week compare with $28 billion during the five-
day period ended Oct. 16, 2009, Bloomberg data show. Companies
issued $48.4 billion of debt this month, compared with $76.5
billion in the corresponding portion of September and $47.2
billion in the first 15 days of October 2009. </p>
<p>Companies issued $161.1 billion of debt in September, the
most on record for that month, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own high-yield bonds
instead of Treasuries fell 2 basis points to 595 basis points on
Oct. 15 and was down from 612 basis points on Oct. 8, according
to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II
Index. Yields on the debt decreased to 7.77 percent from 7.85
percent last week. </p>
<p>High yield debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody''s and BBB- by
Standard  Poor''s. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Spreads on speculative-grade debt signaled a 20 percent
chance the U.S. economy would slip back into recession,
according to Martin Fridson, New York-based global credit
strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. </p>
<p>Treasury Yields </p>
<p>Yields on the 30-year Treasury bonds rose to the highest
since Aug. 10 as investors wagered the Federal Reserve may buy
shorter-term debt to stimulate the economy. Fed policy makers
were prepared to ease credit before long and focused on
purchases of Treasuries and boosting inflation expectations,
according to minutes of the central bank''s Sept. 21 session. </p>
<p>Economic indicators continued to issue mixed signals, but
investors increasingly have come to believe that quantitative
easing by the Fed will avert an economic collapse, Fridson
said. </p>
<p>Investment-grade spreads widened 1 basis point in the week
to 182 basis points, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index. Yields climbed 12 basis
points to 3.68 percent, the index data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, second in assets to Bank of America Corp. among
U.S. banks, sold $2.75 billion of 10-year notes and $1.25
billion of bonds due in October 2040, Bloomberg data show. It
was the first offering of 30-year debt by a U.S. bank since
Citigroup sold $2.5 billion in July 2009. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Profits </p>
<p>The sale came after New York-based JPMorgan said third-
quarter profit rose 23 percent, beating analyst estimates, as
provisions for bad loans declined. </p>
<p>Raytheon, JPMorgan and Reliance Industries Ltd., India''s
most valuable company, led $15.5 billion of investment-grade
bond issuance, compared with average weekly sales of $16.7
billion in 2010, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Sirius XM Radio Inc., the New York-based satellite radio
broadcaster, sold $700 million of eight-year notes and Manitowoc
Co., the world''s biggest manufacturer of overhead cranes, issued
$600 million of 10-year debt as junk-rated companies raised $7.3
billion, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Speculative-grade corporate bond sales have fallen for four
consecutive weeks since reaching $13.7 billion during the period
ended Sept. 17. </p>
<p>Corporate credit quality may decline as companies take
advantage of record-low yields on their debt to pay for share
repurchases and acquisitions, Mark Gray and Thomas Marshella,
Moody''s managing directors, wrote in an Oct. 12 report. </p>
<p>Appetite for MA'' </p>
<p>You''ve had a lot of companies extend maturities, reduce
their cost of borrowing by going into the public markets, said
Douglas Braunstein, JPMorgan''s chief financial officer, in a
conference call with investors on Oct. 13. You''re starting to
see a pickup in the appetite for MA, and I think part of that
is a function of people getting their balance sheets prepared
and ready to go and looking for growth. </p>
<p>Air Medical Group Holdings Inc., a provider of emergency
transportation services, and Texas Competitive Energy Holdings
Co., the Energy Future Holdings Corp. unit, are among companies
planning at least $3 billion in U.S. bond sales, Bloomberg data
show. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. is pushing ahead
with a plan to sell shares to the public next month and is
slated to start meetings with investors after the November
elections, said people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>GM shares would probably be priced on Nov. 17 or Nov. 18
and begin trading the next day, said two of the people, who
asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The
Detroit-based automaker and the U.S. Treasury, which owns 61
percent of the company, don''t want the offering to slip beyond
Nov. 19 into the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday week, they said. </p>
<p>GM executives and their bankers will begin a roadshow after
the Nov. 2 election to present the offering in Europe and the
U.S., the two said. The various teams would finish up in New
York, after refining their sales pitch in smaller cities, a few
days before the pricing, they said. </p>
<p>The schedule isn''t final and GM advisers have said the
offering may benefit from a post-election stock market rally,
they said. GM and the U.S. Treasury aim to hold an $8 billion to
$10 billion IPO, said two of the people. It won''t be smaller
than $6 billion, two people have said. The initial sale could be
as large as $13 billion, one person said this week. </p>
<p>One concern of GM''s advisers is that October new-vehicle
sales may come in lower than expected when they are reported the
day before the mid-term elections. </p>
<p>Rising Sales </p>
<p>U.S. auto sales may reach a 12.3 million annual rate in
October, the fastest pace this year, Don Esmond, Toyota Motor
Corp.''s North American sales chief, said yesterday at an event
in Detroit. </p>
<p>The good news is last month was about 11.8 million,
Esmond said. So far this month, knock on wood, it could go
over 12. </p>
<p>A $10 billion share sale by GM would be the biggest U.S.
IPO since Visa Inc.''s $19.7 billion raised in March 2008. It
would be the third-largest in the U.S., also trailing ATT
Wireless Group''s $10.6 billion offering in 2000. </p>
<p>A large GM offering at a lower share price would place more
pressure on the government to win higher prices in future
offerings, two people said. GM and its investment banks had
considered a deal worth $12 billion to $16 billion, people
familiar with the plans said in August. </p>
<p>For the U.S. to recoup its $50 billion investment in GM, it
needs to sell at an average price, before splits, of $131 a
share, said a person familiar with the matter. The stock will be
split to sell at an initial price of around $20 a share, said
that person and two others. </p>
<p>Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, put the breakeven figure at
$133.78, before splits. While the U.S. bailout was paid for with
TARP money, only a portion of the government''s stake will be
sold in the initial offering. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Italy''s
Mediobanca SpA are among banks that stand to receive as much as
63 million euros ($88 million) in fees for managing the initial

<p>The rand may strengthen to 6.20 per
dollar in a year as the U.S. currency weakens amid concern the
American economy is struggling to maintain its recovery,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The currency of Africa''s biggest economy may appreciate to
6.75 per dollar in the next three months and 6.30 in six months''
time, Colin Coleman, the managing director of the bank''s local
unit, said in a speech in Johannesburg today. </p>
<p>Goldman is much more bearish on the dollar''s outlook
than the market, Bell said. The bearish dollar outlook is of
course fundamental to how currencies trade and obviously that
has a positive bearing on gold and a strengthening bias on the
rand. </p>
<p>The euro will climb to $1.50 in six months and $1.55 in a
year, Coleman said. Gold, which together with platinum accounts
for about a fifth of South Africa''s export earnings, reached a
record $1,387.35 an ounce yesterday as the dollar weakened. The
euro is forecast to reach $1.33 by the end of the year, $1.32 at
the end of March and $1.33 at the end of 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The European common currency gained 0.7
percent to $1.4156 by 1:31 p.m. in London. </p>
<p>The dollar slid toward a 15-year low versus the yen after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said additional
monetary stimulus may be warranted because inflation is too low
and unemployment is too high. </p>
<p>Rand Gains </p>
<p>The rand strengthened as much as 0.6 percent to 6.7616 to
the dollar, the strongest since January 2008, and last traded
0.3 percent higher at 6.7835 per dollar at 2:33 p.m. in
Johannesburg. </p>
<p>The South African currency has gained 39 percent against
the dollar since the beginning of last year as near-zero
interest rates in the U.S., Japan and the euro-region countries
fuelled demand for higher-yielding assets in emerging markets.
South Africa has a benchmark rate of 6 percent. </p>
<p>Policy makers are concerned about the appreciation and
are considering ways to curb the currency, central bank Governor
Gill Marcus said yesterday. The strength of the rand has
prompted exporters and labor unions to lobby the central bank to
step up efforts to weaken it. </p>
<p>National Treasury Director-General Lesetja Kganyago said
today countries that are taking individual actions to curb their
currencies are embarking on a race to the bottom. This
strategy requires deep pockets, which South Africa doesn''t
have, Kganyago said in Johannesburg. </p>

<p>Returns from precious metals will be
almost twice as strong as predicted last month, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said, citing an increased chance of further Federal
Reserve actions to spur U.S. economic growth. </p>
<p>Precious metals will generate a 12-month return of 30
percent, more than September''s 17 percent estimate, according to
a Goldman Sachs report dated yesterday by analyst Jeffrey Currie. Industrial metals will return 25 percent, above the
prior 15 percent prediction, and the forecast for energy was
maintained at 27 percent, the report shows. </p>
<p>Fed officials were prepared in September to ease monetary
policy before long, minutes of their Sept. 21 session showed
this month. Policy makers will meet next on Nov. 2-3.
Speculation that the Fed will engage in a second round of so-
called quantitative easing has helped to lift gold to a record
and copper to the highest level in more than two years. </p>
<p>As the likelihood of QE2 has helped diminish market
concerns about sharp macro deterioration, relative commodity
performance has been increasingly tied to fundamentals, Currie
said in the report. In addition to gold and platinum, we are
most constructive on copper, zinc, corn and crude oil. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs this week raised three-month and one-year
estimates for gold prices to $1,400 an ounce and $1,650 an
ounce, respectively. Copper may climb to $11,000 a metric ton by
the end of 2011 as stockpiles shrink, the bank said last week.
Today Goldman Sachs increased its 12-month estimate for corn to
$6.25 a bushel from $5. </p>
<p>We expect the recent tightening of corn balances on
strong demand growth from ethanol, as well as sharply lower U.S.
yields, will lend further support to corn prices despite the
recent rally, Goldman said. Wheat prices will remain elevated
and volatile for now and will drop in the medium term, the
bank said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs forecast a 20 percent return from the SP
GSCI Enhanced Commodity Total Return Index over 12 months,
compared with the prior 19 percent. The gauge is up 2.3 percent
this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts
substantially higher prices for oil in the second half of
2011 and 2012 as the global inventory surplus is exhausted. </p>
<p>We believe that forward price levels offer good hedging
opportunities for calendar 2011/2012 for consumers despite the
recent rally, Goldman analysts led by Allison Nathan and
Jeffrey Currie said in a note to clients yesterday.  </p>
<p>We expect the supply-demand balance to continue to
tighten in the fourth quarter of 2010 as continued global
economic growth, albeit likely at a slower pace than in the
first half, continues to strengthen demand, the note said.
Moving into the second half of 2011 and 2012, we expect the
global inventory surplus to be exhausted and OPEC spare capacity
to be drawn on to balance the market, leading to
substantinally higher prices. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay Viacom
Inc.''s Paramount Pictures at least $115 million for distribution
rights to Iron Man 3 and the Avengers, gaining full
control of movies owned by its Marvel Entertainment unit. </p>
<p>Paramount, hired to distribute Marvel films before the
movie and comic book company was bought by Disney for about $4
billion in January, will release Thor and Captain
America next year, the companies said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The $115 million will serve as a minimum guarantee to
Paramount, the companies said. Disney, based in Burbank,
California, has made Marvel and Pixar Animation the focus of its
movie-making and agreed in July to sell its Miramax film
division to private-equity investors Colony Capital LLC. </p>
<p>Paramount probably made good at least on what they would
have earned on the Marvel releases, said Matt Harrigan, a
Denver-based analyst with Wunderlich Securities. I''d be
surprised if Paramount got just $115 million. That''s just a
floor. </p>
<p>The deal may be viewed as a sign of Paramount management''s
confidence it can generate profit from an internally produced
slate, JPMorgan analyst Imran Khan said in a note to investors. </p>
<p>Movie franchises produced by Paramount include Star
Trek and the Transformers, Mission: Impossible and
G.I. Joe films. </p>
<p>Paul Roeder, a Disney spokesman, declined to comment beyond
the statement. Steven Rubenstein, Paramount''s outside spokesman,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Disney fell 13 cents to $34.75 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 7.8 percent
this year. New York-based Viacom fell 23 cents to $37.64. The
class B shares are up 27 percent this year. </p>
<p>Thor is set for release on May 6, 2011. Captain
America is planned for July 22, 2011, according to the
Internet Movie Database. The Avengers will be released in
2012 and Iron Man 3 in 2013, Disney said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s largest computer-services provider, declined
as much as 4 percent in extended trading after posting its third
straight quarterly drop in new contracts. </p>
<p>Services signings fell 7 percent to $11 billion in the
third quarter, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today in a
statement. The company also reported earnings and sales for the
period that exceeded analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>While companies increased spending on IBM''s software and
hardware, such as storage computers, they are holding back on
signing large outsourcing projects in the aftermath of the
recession. Investors focus on the service business because it
accounts for almost 60 percent of IBM''s annual sales and more
than 40 percent of its profit. </p>
<p>Investors are likely to key in on IT-services signings
being a bit below expectations, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, who recommends buying the
shares. It''s a key measure of deal activity. </p>
<p>IBM fell as much as $5.78 to $137.05 in extended trading
after closing at $142.83 on the New York Stock Exchange. This
month, the shares topped their record high set in 1999, and have
extended gains since. </p>
<p>The company signed a $1.8 billion outsourcing deal with ABN
Amro Goup NV on Oct. 8. If that had occurred in the third
quarter, services signings would have been $12.7 billion, IBM
said. </p>
<p>Difficult to Predict </p>
<p>It''s very difficult to predict precisely when these deals
will close, and eight days is not going to make any difference
in the yield to this contract, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call today. The company has a
strong deal list for outsourcing signings this quarter, he
said. </p>
<p>IBM boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.40 a share, the third time it''s raised 2010 earnings
guidance this year. Analysts on average estimated $11.30. </p>
<p>Net income for the quarter rose 12 percent to $3.59
billion, or $2.82 a share, from $3.21 billion, or $2.40, a year
earlier. Analysts predicted $2.75, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sales climbed 3 percent to $24.3 billion, topping analysts''
average projection of $24.1 billion. It''s the third consecutive
period during which all business units -- hardware, software and
both services segments -- posted sales gains. </p>
<p>Operating Earnings </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is aiming to almost
double operating earnings to $20 a share in the next five years.
Software will make up about half of profit by then, the company
said in May. </p>
<p>IBM has invested in analytics software and services that
help predict trends, as well as cloud computing, which helps
customers save money by letting them store and access data via
the Internet, rather than from their own servers. Palmisano also
has been investing in his Smarter Planet initiative, based on
the concept that infrastructure, such as buildings or roads, can
be equipped with digital sensors, which in turn will make them
more efficient. </p>
<p>The three technologies, along with sales from emerging
markets, will add $20 billion in revenue by 2015, the company
said in May. </p>
<p>Palmisano said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions in the same period. He announced seven deals last
quarter, including the $1.7 billion purchase of Netezza Corp. </p>

<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index will
rise 7.6 percent to 1,275 in the next 12 months, as investors
become less risk-averse and look ahead to stronger economic
growth in 2012, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>The estimate for year-end 2010 remains 1,200, and stocks
will have flat returns in the first quarter of 2011 because
the economic recovery remains fragile, strategists led by David
Kostin wrote in a report dated Oct. 15. </p>
<p>The cost of equity should decline slightly as 2011
progresses and investors turn their attention to the economic
growth prospects for 2012, the report said. </p>
<p>The SP 500 is up 6.2 percent this year, as optimism about
corporate earnings and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve
will pump more money into the economy outweigh concerns about
ballooning sovereign debt in some European countries and the
strength of the recovery. The gauge rose 0.7 percent to 1,184.71
as of 4 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Goldman said the SP 500 will still be at 1,200 in six
months, as Fed stimulus measures will have a minimal impact
on earnings and firms will spend cash slowly given spare
capacity, desire to preserve margins and low chief executive
officer confidence. </p>
<p>The strategists expect no expansion in price-to-earnings
ratio on the benchmark index for U.S. stocks in the next 12
months. </p>
<p>The report said risks to the estimates include a jump in
management confidence, a rise in trade protectionism or a
slowdown in emerging markets, especially China. </p>

early 1980s. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. have also considered leasing at 85 Broad, one person said. </p>
<p>How can you not? said Robert Sammons, director of

that isn''t involved in the tower''s leasing. It''s got all the
bells and whistles that they would need. All that extra power
they would need is already there, and ready to rock and roll. </p>

<p>Outsized returns in corporate
bonds are a thing of the past because an increase in government
yields as the economy recovers will squeeze the debt''s
performance, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Company bonds will return 1.2 percent over the coming year
compared with 4.7 percent in the past three months, Goldman
strategists led by Charles Himmelberg and Alberto Gallo in New
York wrote in an Oct. 15 report. Money managers can still aim
for double-digit returns by investing in bonds of high-yield
issuers, banks and companies in Europe''s periphery, they wrote. </p>
<p>The outsized returns available in corporate credit are
firmly behind us, wrote Himmelberg and Gallo. Meaningful
spread compression is nearly impossible to envision without a
corresponding rise in the currently very low levels of
government bond yields. </p>
<p>Investment-grade corporate bonds have returned 9 percent
this year, following gains of 16 percent in all of 2009,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s Global Broad Market
Corporate Index. The debt is now more attractive relative to
government bonds for excess rather than for total returns,
Himmelberg and Gallo wrote. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and OAO Gazprom are among companies that
may bid in a licensing round today to develop three natural-gas
fields in Iraq. </p>
<p>Among the other companies registered to bid are Eni Spa,
Mitsubishi Corp. and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Abdul Hadi
al-Hassani, vice chairman of the oil and gas committee in Iraq''s
parliament said in an interview on Sept. 28. The bidding
ceremony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. in Baghdad. </p>
<p>Iraq, reliant on oil for most of its income, seeks foreign
investors after years of conflict and sanctions. The licensing
round is the third since the U.S-led invasion that toppled
President Saddam Hussein in 2003. It focuses specifically on the
Akkas, Mansouriya and Siba gas fields, which Iraq is eager to
develop for domestic power generation as well as export revenue. </p>
<p>The three undeveloped fields hold combined gas reserves of
more than 11 trillion cubic feet, Oil Minister Hussain al- Shahristani said in May. Separately, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration estimates the reserves at 7.6 trillion cubic
feet. </p>
<p>Akkas, discovered in the western Anbar province in 1998,
holds 5.6 trillion cubic feet of gas and has six wells, al
Shahristani said. Mansouriya, discovered in the eastern Diyala
district in 1979, potentially holds 4.5 trillion cubic feet of
gas and has four wells, while Siba, found in 1968 in Basra, has
1.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and three wells, al-Shahristani
said. </p>
<p>Service Contracts </p>
<p>Iraq has the third-largest oil reserves in the Middle East,
after Saudi Arabia and Iran, and wants to more than double its
current crude output of 2.3 million barrels a day. To raise oil
output, the government awarded a dozen service contracts to
international oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and OAO
Lukoil in two licensing rounds last year. </p>
<p>The 45 companies that bid last year were invited by the oil
ministry to bid for the third round this year for the three
natural gas fields, where Iraq wants to raise production four-
fold. </p>
<p>Iraq intends to export 50 percent of the gas produced in
the three gas fields, the amount in excess of its domestic
needs, Abdul Mahdy al-Ameedi, deputy director general at Iraq''s
Petroleum Contracts and Licensing Directorate, said on Aug. 2. </p>
<p>Companies winning the contracts will be paid on the basis
of barrels of oil equivalent and will not be involved in setting
the price for gas exports, he said at the time. </p>
<p>No Signature Bonus </p>
<p>Among new incentives for investors, Iraq decided to scrap
so-called signature bonuses, which amounted to costs of between
$100 million and $500 million for each of the winning bidders in
the previous two licensing rounds, he said. </p>
<p>Akkas and Mansouriya were among the fields offered in
bidding last year. No investors bid for Mansouriya then, and the
ministry rejected the sole offer for Akkas made by a group of
five companies led by Italy''s Edison SpA. The ministry initially
included Siba in the second round then withdrew it. </p>
<p>Iraq will present a draft agreement to the cabinet for a
gas joint venture with Shell by the end of the year, al-
Shahristani told reporters in Vienna on Oct. 14. Shell is
exploring possibilities for exporting liquefied natural gas from
Iraq in future years. </p>
<p>The country is also a possible source of gas for the planned
Nabucco pipeline project, which aims to reduce Europe''s
dependence on Russian fuel. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. properly warned an
Arkansas woman about the cancer risks of its Prempro menopause
drug, jurors found in rejecting her bid for at least
$3.5 million in damages. </p>
<p>Jurors in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas
deliberated less than an hour before siding with Pfizer, the
world''s largest drugmaker. Margaret Wilson, a 68-year-old former
bank teller, claimed that Prempro helped caused her breast
cancer and executives of Pfizer''s Wyeth unit hid the medicine''s
health risks from women and their doctors. </p>
<p>Wyeth now has won six of the 13 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. Wyeth got some verdicts
against it thrown out at the post-trial stage or had awards
reduced. Wyeth also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, the company said in a statement. </p>
<p>The jury''s decision affirms that Wyeth communicated the
risks and benefits of Prempro, Chris Loder, a Pfizer
spokesman, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Pharmacia  Upjohn unit, to relieve symptoms such as
hot flashes and mood swings. Wyeth combined the two hormones in
its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Deadly Drug? </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took the drugs before the Women''s
Health Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored
study, concluded in 2002 that they posed an increased risk of
cancer. Wyeth''s sales of the medicines topped $2 billion before
the study. New York-based Pfizer completed its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth last year. </p>
<p>A study released today in the Journal of the American
Medical Association shows that women who took Prempro as part of
the WHI study were almost twice as likely to die from breast
cancer as those who weren''t taking the medicine. </p>
<p>Those findings conflict with previous research showing that
breast cancers in women taking hormone therapy had a lower risk
of death, Pfizer''s Loder said in a statement. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Wilson, who took Prempro for almost six years
before being diagnosed with breast cancer, said they were
disappointed with the jury''s finding. </p>
<p>We''re sad that fine people like Mrs. Wilson and her
husband didn''t get justice for their injuries, Erik Walker,
one of the woman''s attorneys, said in an interview after the
verdict. The couple were seeking at least $3.5 million for pain,
suffering and emotional distress over her breast cancer. </p>
<p>Business Decision'' </p>
<p>During the three-week trial, Wilson''s lawyers told jurors
that Wyeth officials never studied whether Prempro contributed
to the development of breast cancer in some women, although
research suggesting a link stretched back more than 30 years. </p>
<p>Instead, executives urged Wyeth scientists to dismiss
studies tying its menopause drugs to the disease and to
distract the media from focusing on them, Rainey Booth, one
of the woman''s attorneys, said in closing arguments today. </p>
<p>This company made a business decision not to get an
answer about Prempro''s breast-cancer risk, he said. </p>
<p>Wyeth''s lawyers countered that the drugmaker provided
adequate warnings about Prempro''s cancer risks on the medicine''s
label, and that menopause drugs haven''t been found conclusively
to cause breast cancer. </p>
<p>Prempro doesn''t cause DNA mutations that lead to the
development of cancer, Lyn Pruitt, one of Wyeth''s lawyers, told
the jury. </p>
<p>Pfizer still faces at least 8,000 lawsuits seeking millions
of dollars in damages over Prempro and its other menopause
drugs. Most of the cases are consolidated in federal court in
Little Rock and state court in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>The company faces trials during the next several months in
the Philadelphia court and in federal court in northern
Virginia. </p>
<p>The case is Wilson v. Wyeth, MDL 03-cv-1507-WRW, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas (Little Rock). </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co., the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, boosted third-quarter profit by 8.4 percent
after winning more customers overseas and increasing North
American sales volume for the second quarter in a row. </p>
<p>Net income advanced to $2.06 billion, or 88 cents a share,
the Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
some items, profit was 92 cents, compared with the 89-cent
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company also
said it may repurchase $2 billion of its shares this year, up
from the $1.5 billion announced previously. </p>
<p>Volumes in the Eurasia and Africa group grew 12 percent,
making it the fastest-growing unit, as Coca-Cola launched new
drinks in India and Russia. Coca-Cola, led by Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent, also boosted North American sales volume 2
percent, the second such increase since 2007. North American
volume dropped 2 percent last year. </p>
<p>The stabilization in North America is a sign consumers
are willing to make impulse purchases of soft drinks again,
Philip Gorham, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago, said today in a telephone interview. It shows the
environment is beginning to thaw. Gorham rates the shares as
fairly valued. </p>
<p>The shares rose 34 cents to $60.34 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. That compared with a 1 percent
drop in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Consumer Staples Index. </p>
<p>China Growth </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s sales rose to $8.43 billion, beating the
average of analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Global
sales by drink volume grew 5 percent, driven by brand Coca-Cola.
That compared with a 4 percent drop in the same quarter last
year. China posted 12 percent volume growth while Japan grew 11
percent. </p>
<p>The 2 percent volume gain in North America matched that
unit''s gain in the second quarter as the unit reconfigures
package sizes, such as adding 99-cent bottles, and pricing
strategies amid high unemployment. Sales for the unit grew 2
percent while operating income increased 16 percent. </p>
<p>Even in the depths of the U.S. financial crisis in 2009,
Coca-Cola and its distributors invested $2.5 billion in
marketing and supply chain improvements, Kent said. They will
invest even more in 2010, he said. </p>
<p>We''re not going to waste this crisis, Kent, 57, said in
a telephone interview today. The brand metrics of Coca-Cola
brands have never been better in North America. </p>
<p>Last year''s third-quarter profit was $1.9 billion, or 81
cents a share. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rose to the
highest in almost six months in New York trading after the
company reported profit that beat analysts'' estimates and said
the cost of flawed mortgages and new capital rules won''t be
significant. </p>
<p>The shares gained $3.02, or 2 percent, to $156.72 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m., the highest
price since April 29. Third-quarter net income fell to $1.9
billion, or $2.98 a share, exceeding the $2.29 per share average
estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies and
commodities, known as FICC, surpassed results at JPMorgan Chase
 Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., even after
declining 14 percent from the second quarter. Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, who led the firm to record earnings
last year, is navigating through a business slowdown and trying
to burnish Goldman Sachs''s reputation after settling a fraud
lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission in July. </p>
<p>Goldman''s lining itself up for what should be a good
performance in a recovering environment, said Brad Hintz at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., who was named the top analyst
covering brokerage firms in a survey of fund managers by
Institutional Investor magazine this year. We''re probably at
the low point for Goldman. </p>
<p>The FICC business, Goldman Sachs''s biggest source of
revenue, fell 37 percent from a year earlier to $3.77 billion.
The business, known as FICC, beat Hintz''s $3.3 billion estimate. </p>
<p>Equities Trading </p>
<p>Equities-trading revenue of $1.86 billion climbed 53
percent from the previous quarter, which included losses on
derivatives. The figure exceeded Hintz''s $1.33 billion estimate. </p>
<p>The Street underestimated fixed income, but fixed income
wasn''t great, Hintz said. The story for the quarter was that
equity rebounded from a very dismal Q2, the bad derivatives
quarter. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told analysts on a
conference call that the firm has enough capital and liquidity
to exceed new international requirements imposed by the so-
called Basel III framework. </p>
<p>Under the new rules, which haven''t taken effect yet, the
bank would have had about $59 billion of Tier 1 common equity at
the end of June and about $750 billion of risk-weighted assets,
Viniar estimated, beating the requirement that banks hold Tier 1
common equity equal to 7 percent of risk-weighted assets. He
said that the ratio would rise to 11 percent by the end of 2012,
assuming earnings continue to add to capital and some
derivatives and securitization trades, which would require more
capital under the new rules, are wound down. </p>
<p>Dodd-Frank </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank financial-regulation legislation signed into
law by President Barack Obama in July limits banks'' ability to
trade their own capital, known as proprietary trading, and
requires portions of the derivatives market to be handled on
exchanges. One of Goldman Sachs''s proprietary-trading units,
known as principal strategies, has already been shut down,
Viniar said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s potential losses from faulty mortgages
aren''t large because the firm played a minor role in creating
such loans as well as in packaging them into securities, Viniar
told analysts today. </p>
<p>Home loans packaged into mortgage-backed securities in the
years leading up to the 2008 credit crisis are being challenged
by investors and government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, sometimes requiring banks to buy them back. </p>
<p>Fluid'' Situation </p>
<p>It is a very fluid and evolving situation, but we really
are pretty small, Viniar said. We just don''t view our
exposure as being large in the context of the market. </p>
<p>Concern that the costs of such mortgage put-backs will
increase after faulty foreclosure paperwork has led several U.S.
lenders to stop seizing homes and sparked an investigation by
all 50 state attorneys general. </p>
<p>On Oct. 8, Goldman Sachs''s Litton Loan Servicing LP unit
said that it suspended some home-loan foreclosures as it
completes a review of procedures. Litton has 23,000 mortgages in
the foreclosure process, Viniar said. </p>
<p>While certain process issues were identified as part of
the review to date, Litton believes the underlying foreclosure
decisions were warranted, Viniar said. </p>
<p>Bank of America, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported
a $7.3 billion loss earlier today that the company said was
caused by new federal rules limiting fees on consumer accounts
and credit cards. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company
said yesterday it would resume foreclosures after an Oct. 8 halt
to review its procedures. </p>
<p>Business Shift </p>
<p>Today''s results demonstrate a shift in how Goldman Sachs
makes money as the firm derived 69 percent of revenue from
fixed-income and equities trading in the first nine months of
the year compared with 77 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs cut the size of its average value-at-risk
during the quarter, a measure of how much the firm could lose
trading in a single day, to $121 million. That''s the lowest
level in almost four years and less than half the record set in
the second quarter of last year. </p>
<p>Revenue from investment banking, which includes fees for
advice on takeovers as well as underwriting stock and bond
offerings, surged to $1.12 billion in the quarter, up 22 percent
from the previous quarter and 24 percent from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is the No. 1 ranked adviser on mergers and
acquisitions this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The firm''s advisory revenue increased to $496 million in the
quarter from $472 million in the prior quarter and $325 million
in the year-earlier period. </p>
<p>Revenue from debt underwriting rose to $335 million from
$223 million in the prior quarter, while equity underwriting
revenue gained to $288 million from $222 million in the second
quarter. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s largest computer-services provider, declined
the most in five months in New York trading after a drop in new
contracts overshadowed an improved financial forecast. </p>
<p>Services signings fell 7 percent to $11 billion in the
third quarter, Armonk, New York-based IBM said yesterday in a
statement, the third straight quarterly drop in new contracts.
While companies increased spending on IBM''s software and
hardware, such as storage computers, they''re holding back on
large outsourcing projects in the aftermath of the recession. </p>
<p>IBM boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.40 a share, the third time it raised 2010 earnings guidance
this year. The company also reported earnings and sales for the
period that exceeded analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Investors focus on the service business because it accounts
for almost 60 percent of IBM''s annual sales and more than 40
percent of its profit. </p>
<p>Investors are likely to key in on IT-services signings
being a bit below expectations, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, who recommends buying the
shares. It''s a key measure of deal activity. </p>
<p>The company signed a $1.8 billion outsourcing deal with ABN
Amro Group NV on Oct. 8. If that had occurred in the third
quarter, services signings would have been $12.7 billion, IBM
said. </p>
<p>IBM fell $4.80, or 3.4 percent, to $138.03 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest drop since
May 20. Earlier this month, the shares topped their record
closing high of $137.88 set in 1999. </p>
<p>Difficult to Predict'' </p>
<p>It''s very difficult to predict precisely when these deals
will close, and eight days is not going to make any difference
in the yield to this contract, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said yesterday on a conference call. The company has
a strong deal list for outsourcing signings this quarter, he
said. </p>
<p>Net income for the quarter increased 12 percent to $3.59
billion, or $2.82 a share, from $3.21 billion, or $2.40, a year
earlier. Analysts predicted $2.75, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sales climbed 3 percent to $24.3 billion, topping analysts''
average projection of $24.1 billion. It''s the third consecutive
period during which all business units -- hardware, software and
both services segments -- posted sales gains. </p>
<p>The new full-year profit forecast also exceeded the $11.30
average of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Operating Earnings </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is aiming to almost
double operating earnings to $20 a share in the next five years.
Software will make up about half of profit by then, the company
said in May. </p>
<p>IBM has invested in analytics software and services that
help predict trends, as well as cloud computing, which helps
customers save money by letting them store and access data via
the Internet, rather than from their own servers. Palmisano also
has been investing in his Smarter Planet initiative, based on
the concept that infrastructure, such as buildings or roads, can
be equipped with digital sensors, which in turn will make them
more efficient. </p>
<p>The three technologies, along with sales from emerging
markets, will add $20 billion in revenue by 2015, the company
said in May. </p>
<p>Palmisano said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions in the same period. He announced seven deals last
quarter, including the $1.7 billion purchase of Netezza Corp. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s third-
quarter trading risks were the lowest in almost four years as
clients did less business and the firm conserved capital and
liquid assets in anticipation of new international requirements. </p>
<p>Value-at-risk, a measure of the average sum the company
expects it could lose from trading, dropped to $121 million in
the three months ending Sept. 30 as the firm took smaller risks
in stock, currency and commodity markets, Goldman Sachs reported
today. The third-quarter risk is less than half the record set
in last year''s second quarter, when it reached $245 million. </p>
<p>The world is still not a very safe place, David Viniar,
Goldman Sachs''s chief financial officer, told analysts on a
conference call when asked why the firm held an average $173
billion in cash and highly liquid instruments. The same reason
our risk is so low and our balance sheet really hasn''t grown --
there''s been no call on it because there''s been very, very
little activity from our clients. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s decline in risk-taking coincided with a
drop in revenue from trading stocks, bonds, currencies and
commodities, the New York-based firm''s biggest source of income.
Third-quarter trading revenue fell to $5.63 billion, down 35
percent from the same period last year, the bank said. Average
value at risk fell 42 percent from $208 million a year earlier. </p>
<p>Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said
he was surprised to see that the firm didn''t take bigger risks
in fixed-income given that prices for most bonds improved in the
quarter. The firm said value-at-risk, known as VaR, related to
interest rates was little changed at $88 million compared with
$87 million in the prior quarter and $159 million a year ago. </p>
<p>Why Would It Be?'' </p>
<p>Was there any secret that rates were dropping and that
credit spreads were coming in? No, Hintz said. So why would
it be that VaR was held down? </p>
<p>Viniar, 55, confirmed on today''s call that the firm shut
down a group of traders that made bets with Goldman Sachs''s own
capital, known as proprietary trading. The unit, called Goldman
Sachs Principal Strategies, was closed to comply with new U.S.
regulations that aim to curb risk-taking by banks. </p>
<p>It''s accurate that our GSPS business, which is the one
walled-off proprietary trading business, is essentially wound
down, Viniar said. Before making decisions on other units
we''re waiting to see how the rules unfold. </p>
<p>Viniar also said he thinks the firm has adequate capital
and liquidity, or easy-to-sell assets, to meet new requirements
that will be imposed by international regulators under the so-
called Basel III regime. He estimated that the firm''s Tier One
common equity would have equaled almost 8 percent of the
company''s risk-weighted assets at the end of the second quarter
under the new calculations, beating the 7 percent requirement. </p>
<p>I would suspect that as these rules get more and more
clarified over the next several years, we would be in a position
to give more capital back, Viniar said. It''s hard to pin
down an exact date though. </p>

contained in the securities. </p>
<p>We think most of the risk is as an originator, and even
as an underwriter we were not one of the biggest players, so we
don''t think our exposure''s that big, he said. </p>
<p>In July, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to settle
fraud allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, and acknowledged it made a mistake in providing
incomplete information in marketing materials for a 2007
mortgage-linked security. The settlement was the largest ever
paid to the SEC by a Wall Street firm. </p>

last week, said Richard Marton, a London-based spokesman for

Grafe''s mobile phone was switched off. </p>
<p>He will replace Rory MacFarquhar, who was Goldman''s head

by U.S. Milken Institute. </p>
<p>Goldman, the most profitable securities firm on Wall

$13.1 billion for compensation and benefits in the first nine

<p>The amount, equal to 43 percent of revenue, is enough to

Great Depression. The company cut its full-year ratio of
compensation to revenue to 35.8 percent, the lowest since the
company went public in 1999. </p>
<p>They recognize that the world has changed, said Brad Hintz at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., who was named the top
analyst covering brokerage firms in a survey of fund managers by
Institutional Investor magazine this year. The only way to
improve your return on assets is to control compensation. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year to pay employees, with most of the money
awarded in the form of year-end bonuses. Goldman Sachs reserved
$3.83 billion for compensation in the third quarter, or 43
percent of revenue, equal to the proportion in the first half. </p>
<p>Last week New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. reported that
it set aside 39 percent of its investment-bank''s revenue to pay
workers in the division for the first nine months of the year,
up from 38 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase </p>
<p>The expense at JPMorgan''s investment bank fell 10 percent
to $7.88 billion from $8.79 billion. That''s equal to $298,866
for each of the unit''s 26,373 workers at the end of September,
down from $353,834 on average for the division''s 24,828
employees a year earlier. </p>
<p>The following compares compensation at Goldman Sachs and
JPMorgan''s investment bank. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the largest
Coca-Cola bottler by volume, is outpacing parent Fomento
Economico Mexicano SAB by the widest margin in five years as
Bill Gates and other investors seek more exposure to developing
nations. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa had risen 15.5 percent this year in Mexican
trading, compared with 6.4 percent for Femsa, also owner of
convenience-store chain Oxxo. Femsa has fallen short since Chief
Executive Officer Jose Antonio Fernandez sold its Mexican
brewing unit to Heineken NV this year in exchange for a 20
percent stake in the Amsterdam-based beermaker. </p>
<p>In shedding the century-old family beer business, Fernandez
made Femsa less focused on developing countries, making the
bottler a better prospect for investors targeting faster-growing
economies, said Vontobel Asset Management analyst Donny Kranson.
Fernandez, who runs both companies, said the sale of the beer
business to Heineken will allow Femsa to focus on building out
Oxxo and the bottler operations. </p>
<p>Femsa beforehand was pretty much a pure-play, emerging-
market company, said Kranson, whose New York-based firm
manages about $10 billion and owns shares of Femsa and its
Mexican cola bottler. From an emerging-market perspective,
Femsa is now less attractive. </p>
<p>The Bill Gates Foundation and Cascade Investment LLC, which
manages money for billionaire Gates, bought the bottler''s U.S.
shares in May and June to boost combined holdings to 28 percent,
according to regulatory filings. Gates failed to add to his 13
percent stake in Femsa''s U.S. shares over that period. Michael Larson, who runs both firms from Kirkland, Washington, didn''t
respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Less Value </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa had a market value of about $14.7 billion.
Femsa''s was $19.2 billion, which includes a 54 percent stake of
Coca-Cola Femsa valued at $7.9 billion, a 20 percent stake in
Heineken valued at $6.1 billion and the Oxxo chain. </p>
<p>Juan Fonseca, chief of investor relations for Femsa, said
he recognizes the parent company is trading below the value of
the sum of its parts. </p>
<p>It is not our role to suggest what the right valuation
should be for our company, Fonseca said in an e-mailed
response to questions. That is up to investors to decide. </p>
<p>Lockstep Trading </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa and Femsa had traded in lockstep for the
past five years through the end of 2009, with a rate of return
that differed by only 4 percentage points as the stocks both
more than tripled. This year, Coca-Cola Femsa has risen 9
percentage points more than its parent. </p>
<p>Femsa rose 16 centavos to 66.66 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 4:01 p.m. New York time. Coca-Cola Femsa fell 1.66
pesos to 99.41 pesos. Deutsche Bank AG analyst Jose Yordan cut
his recommendation on Coca-Cola Femsa to sell from hold
in a report today on concern over increased costs for sugar and
corn sweetener. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa is outperforming its parent because the
company probably will grow through acquisitions and partnerships
with the Coca-Cola Co., said David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen
Advisers LLC in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, an investment firm
that manages about $1.8 billion. Coca-Cola Femsa became the
world''s largest franchise for the beverage after Coca-Cola Co.
bought its North American bottling operations this month. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, is likely to choose the
Mexican bottler as a partner to run the North American
operations, according to Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Carlos Laboy. The two formed a partnership to sell non-carbonated
drinks in Latin America with the purchase of Mexican juice
producer Jugos del Valle in 2007. They also may expand the
partnership by agreeing to buy Grupo Industrias Lacteas, a milk,
yogurt and juice maker in Panama, Coca-Cola Femsa said Oct. 14. </p>
<p>Keep Trailing </p>
<p>Femsa will keep trailing Coca-Cola Femsa since investors
tend to apply discounts to holding companies, said Luis Miranda,
an analyst with the Mexican unit of Banco Santander SA. Femsa
trades at 25 percent less than the value of its holdings, said
Miranda, who cut his recommendation on Femsa to hold from
buy in an Oct. 5 report. He raised his recommendation for
Coca-Cola Femsa to buy from hold. </p>
<p>The discount may present a buying opportunity as investors
begin to realize the growth potential of Oxxo, Winters said. In
the past five years, Oxxo''s operating income has risen almost
fivefold to 4.56 billion pesos ($360 million) in 2009, while the
beer unit''s profit rose 24 percent to 5.89 billion pesos. </p>
<p>The company is expanding the chain in Colombia and has said
it will increase stores in Mexico to 12,000 by 2014 from about
7,300 at the end of 2009. The moves may help investors see
beyond Femsa''s holding company status, Winters said. </p>
<p>Oxxo''s Accomplishments </p>
<p>People don''t quite appreciate what a great accomplishment
Oxxo is, Winters said. That business in the long term could
have legs beyond Mexico. </p>
<p>Femsa reported net income of 29.2 billion pesos in the
second quarter, an increase of more than tenfold, because of a
26.5 billion peso gain from the Heineken transaction. Coca-Cola
Femsa had net income of 2.48 billion, a 15 percent increase from
a year ago. The companies are both scheduled to report third-
quarter results this week. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, reported an unexpected third-quarter loss
after its worst trading quarter since 2008 and a $229 million
writedown on a New Jersey casino project. </p>
<p>The loss of 7 cents a share, or profit of $131 million
before preferred dividends, compared with earnings of $757
million, or 38 cents, in the third quarter of 2009, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. Earnings from
continuing operations were 5 cents a share, which included a 12-
cent tax gain and a 30-cent loss from charges related to changes
in the firm''s credit spreads. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley hired about 400 new employees for the sales
and trading unit since posting a per-share loss in last year''s
second quarter. Those efforts didn''t pay off for Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, 52, as trading revenue last quarter fell
to less than half that of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>What an ugly quarter, said Brad Hintz at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co., who was named the top analyst covering
brokerage firms in a survey of fund managers by Institutional
Investor magazine this year. Trading was abysmal. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 1 cent to $25.38 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, after dropping as much as 4.5
percent earlier today. The stock is down 14 percent this year. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs yesterday reported earnings that beat
analysts'' estimates as lower costs and higher investment-banking
revenue cushioned a decline in trading. Bank of America and
JPMorgan, the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, both reported at
least a 15 percent drop in trading revenue from the third
quarter of 2009. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s total revenue from equity and fixed-income
trading fell 45 percent to $1.77 billion, compared with $5.63
billion at Goldman Sachs and $4.5 billion at Bank of America.
The decline in revenue comes even as it had higher trading
value-at-risk, a measure of how much the firm could lose trading
in a single day, than Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>In the third quarter, Morgan Stanley''s revenue from fixed-
income sales and trading was $846 million, compared with $3.77
billion at Goldman Sachs and $3.53 billion at Bank of America
Corp. </p>
<p>Excluding gains or losses from its own credit spreads,
fixed-income revenue was $1.31 billion. That missed estimates
for $1.8 billion from Hintz at Sanford C. Bernstein and $1.64
billion from Roger Freeman at Barclays Capital. </p>
<p>True Potential'' </p>
<p>Fixed-income is really the area that underperformed and
our view is that the results don''t reflect the true potential of
our franchise, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an
interview. We didn''t lose a lot, we didn''t make a lot, there
just wasn''t much trading there. </p>
<p>In equities trading, Morgan Stanley posted third-quarter
revenue of $925 million, down 35 percent from the second
quarter, when it led U.S. banks in that category. The unit''s
revenue, which was $1.07 billion a year earlier, compares with
$1.86 billion at Goldman Sachs and $1.14 billion at JPMorgan.
Excluding debt-valuation adjustments, revenue was $1.12 billion. </p>
<p>Equity trading in particular is surprising given that
peers, for the most part, outperformed sequentially given much
more favorable market trends during the third quarter, Doug Sipkin, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, said in a note to
clients. </p>
<p>Gorman said on the conference call that most of the firm''s
new hires in sales and trading this year joined in the second
and third quarters and should be fully productive by the
first quarter of next year. </p>
<p>Credit Spreads </p>
<p>Revenue was lowered by $731 million of charges related to
the narrowing of the firm''s own credit spreads. The company
booked $5.1 billion of gains in fiscal 2008 as its bond spreads
widened, then reversed them in 2009 as markets improved and
spreads tightened. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said in April it would sell its stake in
Revel Entertainment LLC, the unfinished casino resort in
Atlantic City. The bank said at the time that the sale may
result in a substantial loss of its $1.2 billion investment.
The third-quarter Revel writedown follows a $932 million loss on
the investment taken in the first quarter. Porat said the stake
is now valued at $40 million. </p>
<p>Our results in aggregate clearly do not reflect the true
potential of Morgan Stanley''s global client franchise and I am
not satisfied with our overall performance, Gorman said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Analysts'' Estimate </p>
<p>The average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for earnings of 21 cents a share, though some analysts
included the credit-spread calculation in their figures and
others excluded it. </p>
<p>Revenue at Morgan Stanley fell to $6.78 billion from $8.47
billion a year earlier. Book value per share climbed to $31.25
from $29.65 at the end of June. The firm''s return on equity from
continuing operations, a measure of how well it reinvests
earnings, was 0.8 percent. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $1.01 billion in revenue from
investment banking. </p>
<p>Global wealth management posted pretax income of $281
million, up from $280 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Asset management reported a pretax gain of $279 million,
compared with a $124 million pretax loss in the previous year''s
period. </p>
<p>Cost Controls </p>
<p>Gorman is trying to control expenses after the firm posted
its first per-share loss as a public company in 2009 and paid
out 62 percent of revenue in compensation. Morgan Stanley halted
hiring at its investment-banking group for the rest of 2010, a
person briefed on the decision said in September. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits decreased 25 percent to $3.69
billion in the quarter, or 54 percent of the firm''s overall
revenue. The ratio was higher than in the first two quarters,
when the bank set aside 49 percent of revenue. Excluding debt-
valuation adjustments, the third-quarter ratio was 49 percent,
Porat said on a conference call. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s 5 cents in income per share from
continuing operations compared with Hintz''s estimate of 19
cents, he said. Most of the difference, 10 cents, came from the
firm''s decision to pay out a higher proportion of revenue as
compensation than the 50 percent he expected, Hintz said. </p>
<p>We can forget all about management''s talk about belt-
tightening and co-investing, he said. </p>
<p>Risk-Weighted Assets </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley expects to have $326 billion of risk-
weighted assets under the Basel I framework, Porat said on the
call. Under new rules proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, so-called Basel III, that would have increased by
about $240 billion, or $140 billion after $100 billion in
expected run-offs and mitigation efforts that could be completed
by the end of 2012, Porat said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on
a conference call yesterday that his bank would have had about
$750 billion of risk-weighted assets at the end of June under
Basel III, compared with the $451 billion it reported under
Basel I. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. reduced its
arbitration claim against state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela SA by at least $5 billion as it seeks compensation for
the nationalization of oil assets by President Hugo Chavez. </p>
<p>Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, cut the amount it
seeks through international arbitration to $7 billion from $12
billion plus interest, PDVSA, as the company based in Caracas is
known, said in a preliminary notice for an upcoming bond issue. </p>
<p>We may incur losses arising from our pending arbitrations
and litigation, PDVSA said in the notice that was obtained by
Bloomberg News. Venezuela recognizes the execution of foreign
judgments and arbitration awards, subject to certain conditions
provided for in Venezuelan laws. </p>
<p>Chavez forced foreign oil producers into joint ventures as
minority partners in 2007 and is in international arbitration
with the U.S.''s Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, which rejected
revised terms. He has nationalized parts of the oil, metals,
cement and utilities industries during his 11 years in power. </p>
<p>PDVSA and Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, are
preparing responses to be filed by Oct. 25 following an
international arbitration hearing that concluded Sept. 24, PDVSA
said in the notice. PDVSA expects a ruling in 2011. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, cut the investment bank''s bonus pool 8
percent this year, making it smaller than the money reserved to
pay brokers, who produced less revenue. </p>
<p>Pay at the firm''s institutional securities unit, which
includes traders and bankers, dropped to $5.3 billion in the
year''s first nine months as revenue there rose 32 percent to
$12.7 billion, according to its website. Compensation at the
brokerage unit, which expanded through a joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney last year, climbed 41 percent to
$5.8 billion, or 63 percent of its $9.3 billion revenue. </p>
<p>Brokers are on a much more fixed formula for compensation
typically, said Rose Marie Orens, senior partner at New
York-based Compensation Advisory Partners. The investment bank
has a lot more discretion over how much gets paid out. </p>
<p>James Gorman, who became Morgan Stanley''s chief executive
officer after overseeing the brokerage division, has promised to
reduce the portion of the company''s overall revenue awarded in
compensation after it surged to 62 percent last year. In the
first nine months, Morgan Stanley reserved 50 percent of firm-
wide revenue to pay employees, down from 64 percent a year ago. </p>
<p>The company set aside $12 billion for compensation and
benefits in the nine-month period, up 12 percent from a year
earlier, as revenue surged 43 percent, according to its website. </p>
<p>The firm-wide compensation is enough to pay each of its
62,864 employees $190,681 for nine month''s work, up from
$175,543 for each of the 60,800 employees at the end of the same
period in 2009. The New York-based bank doesn''t report
headcounts for its three divisions. </p>
<p>Preparing for Bonuses </p>
<p>Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees, awarding most of the money as
year-end bonuses. Morgan Stanley reserved $3.7 billion for
compensation in the third quarter, or 54 percent of revenue,
greater than the 49 percent set aside in the first half. </p>
<p>The brokerage division, which the company calls global
wealth management, generated 49 percent more revenue in the
first nine months of this year compared with last year. Part of
the reason is that Morgan Stanley had control of Smith Barney
for only about four months at this point last year. </p>
<p>Orens said guarantees paid to Smith Barney brokers and
other new hires will increase the unit''s compensation costs
temporarily. It''s a short term issue here because they made a
decision to diversify their business, she said. </p>
<p>Asset-management compensation climbed 6 percent to $842
million in the first nine months of the year as revenue more
than doubled to $1.87 billion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley''s larger rival,
said yesterday that it set aside $13.1 billion, or 43 percent of
revenue, for compensation and benefits in the first nine months
of the year. That''s down 21 percent from a year earlier, when it
reserved 47 percent in the same period before slashing
compensation costs in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Last week, New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. said it
allocated 39 percent of its investment bank''s revenue to pay
workers in the division for the first nine months of the year,
up from 38 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>The unit''s compensation expense fell 10 percent to $7.88
billion from $8.79 billion. That''s equal to $298,866 for each of
its 26,373 workers at the end of September, down from $353,834
on average for the division''s 24,828 employees a year earlier. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s pool is enough to pay each of the New York-
based firm''s 35,400 employees $370,706 for nine months'' work.
That''s down from an average $527,192 for the company''s 31,700
workers a year earlier. </p>
<p>Bigger Bonuses Expected </p>
<p>Average pay per worker doesn''t reflect the amount of money
employees actually receive. Top executives and revenue producers
sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards, while clerical
staff get much smaller salaries. </p>
<p>About 71 percent of 2,145 people who responded to an
eFinancialCareers.com e-mailed poll in the U.S. said they are
anticipating at least an equal bonus from last year, with 50
percent expecting a bigger payout. About 11 percent said their
bonus will jump by at least half, according to the survey
released earlier this month. </p>
<p>The following compares compensation at Morgan Stanley with
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan''s investment bank. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, agreed to give up control of its FrontPoint
Partners LLC hedge-fund unit, four years after it bought the
firm as part of a push into alternative assets. </p>
<p>FrontPoint''s managers, led by co-chief executive officers
Daniel Waters and Michael Kelly, are gaining a majority stake in
the asset manager and will replace Morgan Stanley affiliates as
the funds'' investment adviser and general partner, the New York-
based bank said today in a statement. Morgan Stanley will
maintain a minority stake. Terms of the agreement, which the
company expects to complete by year-end, weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>I am especially pleased that my fellow portfolio managers
support the restructuring of our relationship with Morgan
Stanley, and that the FrontPoint investment culture will not
change, FrontPoint Senior Portfolio Manager Steve Eisman said
in a separate statement. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in
July that the firm was looking at its investments in hedge
funds, including FrontPoint. While the so-called Volcker rule
limits banks'' investments in hedge funds, it would not have
affected the FrontPoint stake because Morgan Stanley had not
contributed much of its own capital into the actual funds. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley purchased FrontPoint in 2006. The firm paid
$400 million for the stake, people familiar with the terms said
at the time. Morgan Stanley still holds minority stakes in
Avenue Capital Group and Lansdowne Partners, which it also
bought in 2006. </p>
<p>FrontPoint had about $7 billion in assets as of Dec. 31,
according to a Barron''s survey, which ranked the firm''s
quantitative macro fund 57th in its Top 100 Hedge Funds. </p>
<p>Philip Duff, 53, co-founded FrontPoint with Gil Caffray,
57, and Paul Ghaffari in 2000. Duff and Caffray were previously
managing directors at Tiger Management LLC, the firm founded by
Julian Robertson that was once the world''s biggest hedge-fund
manager. </p>

<p>The statistics bureau will change the way it calculates the

increased in importance, such as music downloading fees,
electronic dictionaries and fried chicken, will be added to the

and express mail are among the 22 that will be removed because
of decreased significance. </p>
<p>The Bank of Japan, which said this month that price
declines will continue to narrow, is unlikely to adjust its
assessment of deflation because of the formula adjustment,
Chiwoong Lee, a Tokyo-based economist at Goldman Sachs, said in
a report today. Even so, continuing deflation and a
deteriorating economy is likely to prompt the central bank to
expand the 5 trillion yen asset-purchasing fund ($62 billion) to
20 trillion yen by the end of next year, Lee said. </p>
<p>Consumer prices excluding fresh food, the central bank''s
preferred gauge of inflation, slumped for an 18th month in

<p>Edith Cooper remembers the
questions, almost a decade ago, from a Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
client. He interrupted her and a female colleague, then co-heads
of Goldman''s commodities unit for Europe, as their meeting
began. </p>
<p>He said, You are two women running a business; how do you
get people to listen to you?'' Cooper recalls. Then he said,
You must manage men. Do they do what you say?'' </p>
<p>Now, all the men -- and women -- at Goldman Sachs have to
listen to Cooper, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its
November issue. As head of human capital management, she
oversees hiring and training and sits on the five-person panel
that will hand out the coveted titles ofmanaging director and

Goldman''s 30-member management committee. </p>
<p>The storm over Goldman Sachs''s role in the financial crisis
-- the firm paid $550 million in July to settle securities fraud
charges -- didn''t slow hiring. Head count has risen more than
50percent since 2005, and the firm has expanded offices in
SaoPaulo and Mumbai. </p>
<p>We learn from challenging periods just as we learn from
great periods, Cooper says in an interview in Goldman''s new
lower Manhattan headquarters on a scorching July Friday. It''s
not that we are perfect. We are people, she says. We have to
make sure we have our compass correct. </p>
<p>Piled Paycheck </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs says applications for full-time positions
rose 31 percent in 2010 from 2009. Only one in 45 people who
apply -- 2.2 percent -- gets a job. Goldman is the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history and divvies up billions a
year in profit among workers.  Goldman Sachs shares yesterday
rose to the highest in six months after the company reported
$1.9 billion in profit for the third quarter, exceeding
analysts'' expectations. Still, Cooper says, those out for the
money alone are making a mistake. </p>
<p>When you are on the fifth version of something and working
late, you are not going to have your paycheck piled up in front
of you, she says. What is going to keep you going is that you
are interested in the business. </p>
<p>Cooper, 49, grew up in Manhattan and worked after school in
her father''s dental practice. She attended Harvard University
and then worked at First Chicago Bank while earning a Master of
Business Administration at Northwestern University''s Kellogg
School of Management. After stints at Bankers Trust and Morgan
Stanley, she joined Goldman Sachs in 1996. </p>
<p>In 2000, she moved to London with her husband and three
children, then ages 5, 7 and 9. Leaving the U.S. was critical to
grasping a global business, she says. </p>
<p>Sex Not Issue </p>
<p>As an American, and as an African-American woman in this
business, I thought I was particularly aware and culturally
sensitive, she says. I quickly realized that I had some
learning to do. </p>
<p>She and the colleague were one of the few pairs of women to
co-head a Goldman Sachs unit. After the client''s queries that
day, they said they hadn''t found their sex to be an issue and
carried on, she says. </p>
<p>By the end of that meeting, he wasn''t wondering if we
could get anyone to listen to us, she says. He wanted to follow
up on their business suggestions. </p>
<p>Some women say they have a tough time being treated equally
at Goldman Sachs. On Sept. 15, three former employees, including
a managing director, sued the bank, saying they were paid less
than male colleagues and left out of team-building outings on
the golf course. </p>
<p>One former associate said her boss had her make photocopies
and answer his wife''s phone calls, duties her male peers never
had to perform. </p>
<p>Lawsuit </p>
<p>Men at Goldman Sachs are viewed more favorably, receive
more compensation and are more likely to be promoted, the
employees said in the complaint. Lucas van Praag, a bank
spokesman, says the charges are without merit. </p>
<p>Cooper says her colleagues inside Goldman Sachs have helped
her throughout her career transitions. When Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein telephoned in 2000 to say she''d been
named a partner, he told her not to be disappointed that her job
would feel the same. As a partner, her responsibility to the
firm had changed, he said. The role of partner changed at
Goldman after the company went public in 1999, and those with
the title no longer shared exclusive ownership. </p>
<p>Seven years later, after she joined the management
committee, Gary Cohn, the bank''s president, pulled her aside to
assess her performance at the group''s Monday morning meetings. </p>
<p>Some of it wasn''t warm and fuzzy, she says. </p>
<p>Recent college graduates asking Goldman Sachs recruiters
about the bank''s role in society have helped Cooper and her team
keep an eye on their compass. </p>
<p>We have to talk about our business in a way that is
transparent and clear, she says. Students are very honest and
frank. You can''t really get away with much. </p>

<p>ABC, CBS and NBC have blocked access
to Google TV as the networks negotiate with Google Inc. over
rights to rebroadcast their programs over the Internet. </p>
<p>ABC won''t allow Google TV to show its programs, the Walt
Disney Co.-owned network said today in an e-mailed statement.
CBS and NBC are also blocking content, according to people with
knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>Google executives have been negotiating with major TV
providers since summer to obtain programming. The service, which
began this month, carries shows from websites associated with
Time Warner Inc.''s HBO and TBS. The clash with Google comes as
the biggest broadcast networks have been seeking compensation
from pay-TV systems for signals that are free over the air. </p>
<p>We''re in the early phases of Google TV and already have
strong partnerships with Best Buy, Logitech and Sony, among
others, Mountain View, California-based Google said in a
statement. It is ultimately the content owner''s choice to
restrict users from accessing their content on the platform. </p>
<p>Google and New York-based CBS Corp. couldn''t agree on a
price for the shows, said an executive with knowledge of the
network''s deliberations. NBC channels online viewers to its
NBC.com website, said a person with knowledge of the network''s
stance who wasn''t cleared to speak publicly. </p>
<p>Google TV also carries programming from NBC Universal''s
CNBC and from Chow, an online cooking site owned by CBS. For
now, New York-based News Corp.''s Fox is allowing its programming
to be seen on the Google service. </p>
<p>The idea of blocking access to Google TV has been
explored, but a firm decision has yet to be reached, Fox said
in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Google rose $4.01 to $611.99 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. The shares have lost 1.3 percent this year. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the networks'' dispute with
Google earlier today. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, said it started clearing interest rate swaps
for customers this week through CME Group Inc. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is the third bank to announce it''s clearing
swaps transactions through Chicago-based CME on behalf of money
manager clients, as regulators write rules that will mandate
that much of the privately negotiated derivatives market be
backed by clearinghouses such as CME. The New York-based bank
said it also plans to begin clearing client trades through
London-based LCH.Clearnet''s SwapClear and credit-default swaps
through Intercontinental Exchange Inc.''s clearinghouse,
according to an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in July, mandates that most interest-rate, credit-default
and other swaps be processed by central counterparties and
traded on exchanges or similar systems, taking business from the
Wall Street banks that pioneered the transactions. All trades in
the over-the-counter market will be reported to regulators.
Dealers and their biggest clients will face higher capital
requirements to use the market. </p>
<p>We are focusing resources where we see client demand,
Stephen O''Connor, a managing director and head of Morgan
Stanley''s counterparty portfolio management group, said today in
a telephone interview. Central clearing is going to be the
law. People are now on a more accelerated timeline. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank, Citigroup </p>
<p>Clearinghouses, which are capitalized by their members,
increase stability in OTC derivatives markets because they
lessen the effect of a default by sharing the risk among the
members and use daily margining procedures to keep accounts
current. The central counterparties, or CCPs also allow
regulators to see market positions and prices. </p>
<p>We have to do our own due diligence, O''Connor said.
The CCPs are the new too-big-to-fail institutions. The risk
management of the CCPs is paramount. They are already the
biggest counterparties in the market and there''s going to be
massive concentration at three or four CCPs to begin with. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc. have also said they
started clearing interest-rate swaps with CME this week. </p>
<p>CME Group cleared $407.5 million in interest-rate swaps in
its first three days of operation, said Michael Shore, a
spokesman. </p>
<p>Bilateral Rate Swaps </p>
<p>Participants in the CME Group plan include Freddie Mac,
Fannie Mae, Pacific Investment Management Co., BlackRock Inc.
and Citadel LLC, the Chicago-based company said in an Oct. 18
statement. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have more than $1 trillion
of bilateral rate swaps between them. Morgan Stanley didn''t
disclose the names of the money managers for which it cleared
swaps nor the size of the trades. Deutsche Bank said it cleared
a swap with Citadel LLC. Citigroup didn''t name its counterparty. </p>
<p>CME Group will compete with International Derivatives
Clearing Group LLC, majority owned by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and
with LCH.Clearnet clearing trades in the $349 trillion interest-
rate swap market. Rate swaps make up the biggest class of over-
the-counter derivatives. </p>
<p>Banks already clear rate-swap trades among themselves
through LCH.Clearnet and credit swaps through Intercontinental''s
ICE Trust. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest mall owner in the U.S., won court approval of the
last stage of its restructuring, a year and a half after filing
the biggest real estate bankruptcy in U.S. history. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan signed off
today on a plan that will pump billions of dollars of new
capital into the company and split off a group of housing and
other properties into a new company named after Howard Hughes. </p>
<p>Gropper''s ruling comes 18 months after Chicago-based
General Growth filed for bankruptcy, weighed down by a $27
billion debt load it was unable to refinance because of the
financial crisis and the collapse of the commercial mortgage-
backed securities market. </p>
<p>As a result of the reorganization, General Growth is a
company with terrific assets in the hands of terrific
sponsors, Tom Nolan, the company''s president and chief
operating officer, said in an interview. </p>
<p>We''re very pleased. This has been a very, very
successful restructuring, he said. </p>
<p>General Growth hopes to exit bankruptcy by Nov. 8, Marcia Goldstein, a lawyer for General Growth, told the judge. </p>
<p>After filing for bankruptcy in April 2009, General Growth
first focused on restructuring about $15 billion in mortgage
debt tied to about 140 properties, an effort it completed
earlier this year. It then turned to its corporate-level debt
and became the subject of a takeover battle between rival Simon
Property Group Inc. and an investor group. </p>
<p>Investors Prevail </p>
<p>Those investors -- Brookfield Asset Management Inc.,
Fairholme Capital Management LLC and Pershing Square Capital
Management LP -- prevailed, committing more than $8 billion to
take the mall owner out of bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy plan provides $7 billion of new capital for
General Growth and results in a substantial deleveraging of
the company, Goldstein said. About $1.6 billion in so-called
Rouse bonds will be reinstated, Nolan said. </p>
<p>The plan provides a full recovery for creditors and a
recovery for shareholders, which is rare in a bankruptcy
reorganization. Shareholders are generally the last in line to
get paid when a company files for bankruptcy and are typically
wiped out. </p>
<p>Capital Markets </p>
<p>John Jerome, the lawyer for the bankruptcy committee
representing General Growth shareholders, told Gropper at the
hearing that the bankruptcy case gave the company time to
realize the value of its assets while the capital markets
recovered. </p>
<p>It''s only in Chapter 11 where this could have happened.
I''m very pleased your honor that we end this proceeding in
Chapter 11 on the note that this is the way Chapter 11 should
work, he said. </p>
<p>General Growth fell 43 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $16.93 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Its closing price was
59 cents on April 16, 2009, the day it filed for bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Shareholders will receive new General Growth stock and
stock in the spinoff company, Howard Hughes Corp., which will
own a group of money-losing assets, including master-planned
communities and mixed-used projects. With the spinoff, General
Growth will concentrate on its retail business, owning or
managing more than 180 shopping malls in 43 states, according to
court papers. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, approved a $7.5 billion plan to develop oil
and natural gas fields in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico, the
largest investment since the Obama administration ended its
drilling ban. </p>
<p>The two fields, known as Jack and St. Malo, are located
about 280 miles (450 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans and
are estimated to hold the equivalent of more than 500 million
barrels of oil, Chevron said in a statement today. The project
includes a floating platform to handle production, expected to
begin in 2014. </p>
<p>The announcement comes six months after an explosion aboard
a deep-water Gulf drilling rig triggered the biggest offshore
oil leak in U.S. history. The U.S. Interior Department last week
issued new safety regulations and ended a moratorium on new
deep-water drilling that was put in place after BP Plc''s Macondo
well leaked an estimated 4.9 million barrels. </p>
<p>The decision came as a surprise so soon after the safety
rules were announced, said Jason Gammel, a London-based analyst
for Macquarie Securities USA Inc. </p>
<p>The economics of this project are robust enough to
overcome any incremental cost of new regulation, said Gammel,
who rates Chevron shares outperform and owns none. That''s
what Chevron is telling us. </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, owns half of Jack
and 51 percent of St. Malo and will pay about $3.8 billion as
its share for initial development of the project. Its partners
in the Jack field are Statoil ASA and A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S,
each with 25 percent shares. </p>
<p>Deep-Water Wells </p>
<p>Statoil also owns 21.5 percent of St. Malo, alongside
Petroleo Brasileiro SA with 25 percent and Exxon Mobil Corp. and
Eni SpA, with 1.25 percent each. </p>
<p>BP''s Macondo well was under about 5,000 feet (1,524 meters)
of water, about 40 miles from New Orleans. The St. Malo and Jack
wells lie under 7,000 feet of water, Chevron said. </p>
<p>The project includes a central production plant with the
capacity to handle 170,000 barrels of oil and 42.5 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day, Chevron said. Current Chevron oil
production from the Gulf is 149,000 barrels a day, about 7.8
percent of its total worldwide crude production in the second
quarter. </p>
<p>Chevron has seven other deep-water discoveries in the Gulf
awaiting development, including the Caesar and Tonga fields
scheduled to begin production next year. Like the project today,
Caesar and Tonga will be a joint development. It''s expected to
cost $1.7 billion, the company said in a March presentation to
analysts. </p>
<p>Chevron rose 23 cents to $84.25 at 4 p.m. in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained
9.4 percent this year. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, can subpoena an American attorney working
for Ecuadorean villagers suing the company in a multibillion
dollar environmental pollution case, a federal judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan yesterday
denied a request by New York attorney Steven Donziger and
plaintiffs in the lawsuit in Ecuador to block a subpoena by
company lawyers seeking testimony and documents. </p>
<p>Kaplan said the evidence he reviewed, including outtakes
from the documentary film Crude, showed that Donziger''s
 principal functions in events in Ecuador have included
 lobbying, media and press relations, and politics. </p>
<p>Donziger''s role at least in major respects is that of a
political operative, not a lawyer, Kaplan said in his ruling. </p>
<p>Chevron is fighting a lawsuit in Ecuador over the effects
of wastewater discharges from Texaco Inc.''s oil operations that
occurred more than 20 years ago in the Amazon basin. The company
said it needs to gather evidence to prove lawyers for plaintiffs
improperly influenced the findings of a court-appointed expert
who estimated billions of dollars in damages owed by Chevron,
according to court filings. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the Ecuadoreans deny wrongdoing. Karen Hinton,
a spokeswoman for the Amazon Defense Front, which is involved in
representing Ecuadoreans in the lawsuit, said the group
disagrees with Kaplan''s decision. </p>
<p>Chevron now seeks to use its false allegations to pry
open all private communications between lawyers and their
clients for the entire 17-year duration of this litigation,
Hinton said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Fraud and Corruption'' </p>
<p>Chevron is confident that the evidence obtained in this
process will provide additional proof of the fraud and
corruption perpetrated by Mr. Donziger and his associates in the
trial against Chevron in Ecuador, Justin Higgs, a Chevron
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The lawsuit in Ecuador was brought by Amazon Basin
residents who claim the company is responsible for pollution and
illness caused by toxic waste from oil drilling in the jungle
from 1964 to 1990 or later. The pollution was allegedly left by
Texaco, according to the complaint. Chevron has denied
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>The case is in a court in Lago Agrio, a town 20 miles
(32 kilometers) south of the Colombia border and near the former
Texaco oil fields. Donziger has been counsel to the Amazon
residents since 1993. A ruling in the case is expected early
next year. </p>
<p>The subpoena case is In re Application of Chevron Corp.,
10-00002, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>The last objections to General

a lawyer for the company said in U.S. bankruptcy court in
Manhattan. The plan still requires a judge''s approval. </p>

18 months after Chicago-based General Growth filed the biggest

<p>General Mills Inc. showed where U.S.
food prices are headed by making some of its breakfast cereals
and baking products more expensive, according to Christopher Growe, a Stifel Nicolaus  Co. analyst. </p>
<p>As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, retail prices for food are
lower than they were in May though the cost of farm commodities
has soared. The food component of the U.S. consumer price index
and a gauge of agricultural-product prices, compiled by UBS AG
and Bloomberg, were used to make the comparison. </p>
<p>General Mills, the maker of Cheerios, Chex and Wheaties,
will raise cereal prices on Nov. 15. The increase will affect
about 25 percent of its cereal production and amount to a low
single-digit percentage, Kirstie Foster, a company
spokeswoman, wrote today in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Prices for some baking mixes are set for a mid single-
digit increase, effective Jan. 3, Foster wrote. The company''s
product lines include Betty Crocker, Bisquick and Pillsbury. </p>
<p>While General Mills may be the first of the large food
companies to really press higher on pricing, we believe many
others may follow, Growe wrote. It''s just a matter of time,
given what is coming down the pike in the way of inflation. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
considering repaying the $5 billion investment it received two
years ago from Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said a
person familiar with the company''s plans. </p>
<p>A repayment isn''t likely to happen imminently because the
bank requires approval from the Federal Reserve, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the deliberations
aren''t public. The person wouldn''t say whether Goldman Sachs is
already seeking the Fed''s consent. The Wall Street Journal
reported earlier today on the possible repayment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs turned to Buffett, the second-richest
American and a cult figure in the investing world, to shore up
the investment bank''s capital and restore market confidence
after its stock tumbled and borrowing costs spiked following the
Sept. 15, 2008, collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. News
of Berkshire''s investment also helped Goldman Sachs raise $5.75
billion from a stock offering a day later. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, repeatedly
invoked the deal with Buffett, announced on Sept. 23, 2008, as
evidence that Goldman Sachs wasn''t relying on government funds
received from the U.S. Treasury a few weeks later. And Buffett,
80, praised Blankfein''s leadership after Goldman Sachs was sued
for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission in April.
The case was settled in July for $550 million. </p>
<p>$500 Million Cost </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, would like to retire the preferred shares it
sold to Buffett at the height of the financial crisis and
replace them with a cheaper form of capital, the person said.
Refunding Berkshire would also free Goldman Sachs''s top
executives from a requirement that they retain 90 percent of the
stock they own in the New York-based company. </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. Carrie Kizer, a spokeswoman for Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire, didn''t immediately return messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>Berkshire''s stake gets a 10 percent dividend, costing
Goldman Sachs $500 million a year. By contrast, the $2.25
billion of five-year notes the firm issued in July yield 2.95
percent, according to data from Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>The firm held $173 billion in cash and other easy-to-sell
assets at the end of September and could use some of that money
to repay Buffett, the person said. The company is also
responding to new capital rules imposed by international
regulators under the Basel III regime, which wouldn''t count
Berkshire''s stake as Tier One capital, the person said. </p>
<p>Warrants </p>
<p>Buffett''s $5 billion investment in perpetual preferred
shares, announced on Sept. 23, 2008, can be called at any time
at a 10 percent premium. Berkshire also received warrants to buy
$5 billion of common stock with a strike price of $115 per
share, which can be exercised at any time within five years. </p>
<p>Under the terms of Berkshire''s investment, Blankfein, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar and Co-Presidents Gary Cohn and
Jon Winkelried were named in the material definitive
agreement that prevents them, their families and their estates
from selling more than 10 percent of the common stock they own
until Oct. 1, 2011, or until Berkshire redeems its $5 billion in
preferred stock, whichever comes soonest. Winkelried left
Goldman Sachs in March 2009. </p>
<p>The agreement pertained to stock owned by the executives as
of Sept. 28, 2008. </p>

<p>General Motors Corp.''s bankruptcy
estate seeks approval of a settlement that would set aside $773
million of U.S. money to resolve environmental claims by the
federal government and 14 states. </p>
<p>A mixture of cash and assets, put into trusts, would clean
up and administer 89 properties, 59 of which are known to be
contaminated, Gary Grindler, acting deputy attorney general,
said in a statement. A 30-day period to gather public comment
will precede a request for bankruptcy court approval. </p>
<p>More than half the money would go for sites in New York and Michigan, Grindler said. </p>
<p>The St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the states are part of the settlement. The
tribe has yet to accept the proposal. A public hearing was set
to take place last night. </p>
<p>The accord paves the way for the carmakers'' unwanted
business to wind down in bankruptcy on the eve of a hearing
scheduled for today at which the Old GM estate will seek court
approval of terms of its liquidation. </p>
<p>When GM filed for bankruptcy in June 2009, it sold
attractive assets to a newly formed company and left the 89
properties in the settlement being considered yesterday under
bankruptcy protection. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury and Canada''s export credit agency had
lent the bankrupt estate $1.175 billion to wind down the
bankrupt properties. The EPA later filed claims in the case for
environmental cleanup costs, as did the states. </p>
<p>Money for the settlement will come from past government
loans to the automaker, said Tim Yost, a spokesman for the
estate. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber in New York in May gave
the company a four-month extension of time in Chapter 11 to
resolve environmental and asbestos liabilities. </p>
<p>Two units of the carmaker formed to hold environmental
liabilities owed about $1.2 billion in cleanup costs, according
to court papers. The amount set aside by Old GM is the largest
of recent environmental settlements. </p>
<p>Chrysler Corp. and Lyondell Chemical Co. resolved billions
in environmental claims, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Old GM''s settlement includes $641 million in cash and non-
cash assets worth $120 million. It has paid $11.5 million to
clean properties during its bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The so-called Massena site in Saint Lawrence County will
receive $120.8 million. The U.S. alleged that GM''s aluminum die-
casting plant, operating there from 1959 to 2009, polluted the
property with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. </p>
<p>The St. Regis Mohawk Tribe has lands affected by
contamination from the Massena property. </p>
<p>The settlement doesn''t affect U.S. claims against Old GM
for past costs related to natural-resources damages at the
properties being placed in the trust, according to Grindler''s
statement. </p>
<p>The case is In re Motors Liquidation Co., 09-50026, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

Court in Mobile for $10.4 million against Cello Energy in a

<p>Antietam, Affiliate of SageCrest, Seeks Bankruptcy </p>
<p>Antietam Funding LLC, a Connecticut-based holder of life
insurance assets, sought bankruptcy protection yesterday,
listing as much as $500 million in debt. </p>
<p>Antietam, a subsidiary of hedge fund SageCrest II LLC that
filed for bankruptcy in 2008, seeks to have its Chapter 11
jointly administered with that of SageCrest. It listed as much
as $100 million in assets in its filing in Bridgeport, Connecticut. </p>
<p>Antietam''s primary asset is a portfolio of life insurance
investments, according to court documents. </p>
<p>Their sole business is to lend monies to finance payments
of insurance premiums and, in the event the borrowers fail to
repay the loans, to foreclose on and own the underlying
policies, lawyers for Antietam wrote. </p>
<p>SageCrest Finance LLC, SageCrest Holdings Ltd. and
SageCrest Dixon Inc. are also jointly administered with the
bankruptcy of  SageCrest II. The fund, managed by Windmill
Management LLC, filed for bankruptcy Aug. 17, 2008. </p>

<p>Ambac to Withdraw $6 Billion in Claims Against Lehman </p>
<p> Ambac Financial Group Inc. will withdraw more than $6
billion in claims against bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
over derivatives transactions. </p>
<p>The agreement was approved yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The claims, filed in September 2009, were based on Lehman''s
purported breach of obligations related to residential
mortgage-backed securities deals with Ambac, Lehman said in an
Oct. 5 filing. Under terms of the settlement, Lehman will
release the insurer from demands for unspecified payments and
from liabilities under derivatives transactions insured by
Ambac, New York-based Lehman said. </p>
<p>Ambac, the second-largest bond insurer before the onset of
the credit crisis, started rehabilitation proceedings in
March in a Wisconsin court that bar Lehman from suing the
company over the claims or insured derivatives deals, according
to the filing. </p>
<p>The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Lehman Can Halt Lawsuits Filed to Recover Payments </p>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the investment bank in
bankruptcy, can halt dozens of lawsuits it filed against banks
and investors to recover payments as part of its effort to
recover money for creditors. </p>
<p>Judge James Peck of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan
approved Lehman''s request to stay the lawsuits while it
negotiates with defendants, a group that includes Bank of
America Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG as trustees for investors. </p>
<p>Lehman filed about 50 lawsuits, known as avoidance actions,
to meet a statute of limitations for bringing the complaints and
preserve its claims, according to court papers. It has
agreements that could lead to lawsuits against additional
defendants. More than 1,000 parties are potentially involved, Harvey Miller, Lehman''s bankruptcy attorney told Peck at
yesterday''s hearing. </p>
<p>Lehman won approval to halt the lawsuits so it can avoid
the costs of litigation. The stay applies to cases that have
been filed and future cases, according to court papers. Several
of the defendants named in the lawsuits filed objections, and
Peck imposed a nine-month period for the stay. </p>
<p>The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Tronox Wins Court Approval of $425 Million Exit Loan </p>
<p> Tronox Inc., the bankrupt chemical maker, won court
approval of a $425 million loan to replace a prior loan for the
same amount, funding its exit from bankruptcy. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper approved the loan
agreement yesterday on an interim basis at a hearing in New
York. The new loan, syndicated by Goldman Sachs Lending Partners
LLC, will save Tronox about $1.45 million a month in interest
expense, the company said in court documents. </p>
<p>The loan replaces a $425 million loan approved in December
2009, which funded operations in bankruptcy. The need for more
funding prompted Tronox to refinance both tranches of the
Existing Facility (to allow the entire $425 million facility to
roll into exit financing) in addition to pursuing a revolving
credit facility, lawyers for the company wrote. </p>
<p>The loan will default if a final order approving it isn''t
entered by Nov. 17, the date on which Tronox plans to seek final
court approval of its Chapter 11 plan, according to court
papers. </p>
<p>Tronox will also seek court approval of a $125 million
revolving credit facility and has an agreement with Goldman
Sachs Lending Partners on an inter-creditor agreement that
governs the loan, according to court documents. </p>
<p>Oklahoma City-based Tronox filed an outline of a
reorganization plan on Sept. 1 that set aside $320 million to
cover what it estimates are $1.4 billion to $5 billion in
environmental claims. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy case is Tronox Inc., 09-10156, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>TerreStar Wins Interim Approval for EchoStar Loan </p>
<p>TerreStar Networks Inc., a satellite mobile-communications
company, won court approval to begin borrowing from EchoStar
Corp., the telecommunications company financing TerreStar''s
bankruptcy restructuring. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan yesterday
approved an order allowing TerreStar, a unit of TerreStar Corp.,
to borrow as much as $18 million of a $75 million loan from
EchoStar. TerreStar will return to court in November for
permission to borrow the remainder. </p>
<p>TerreStar, based in Reston, Virginia, was in court after
filing for bankruptcy Oct. 19 to reduce its $1.6 billion debt.
The company provides mobile satellite coverage throughout the
U.S. and Canada in areas where traditional mobile networks are
unavailable, according to court papers. </p>
<p>EchoStar, a television equipment and satellite services
company, and New York hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners are TerreStar Corp.''s largest shareholders, according to Bloomberg
data. </p>
<p>EchoStar, based in Englewood, Colorado, has agreed to
support a restructuring plan in which it and other secured
noteholders would swap their debt for equity, according to court
papers. EchoStar would also backstop $100 million of a $125
million rights offering under the plan. </p>
<p>The case is In re TerreStar Networks Inc., 10-15446, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>NYC OTB to Remain Open Under Debt-Forgiveness Plan </p>
<p>New York City Off-Track Betting Corp., the bankrupt
operator of 68 wagering locations across the city, will remain
open after reaching a debt-forgiveness agreement with unsecured
creditors. About $95 million owed by OTB, which in March was
ruled eligible for Chapter 9 reorganization, will be resolved,
according to a statement yesterday by New York Governor David Paterson. The agreement is the cornerstone of OTB''s plan to
emerge from bankruptcy that will be filed with the court,
according to the release. Creditors including Yonkers Racing
Corp. and New York Racing Association will forgive about $65
million in exchange for some of OTB''s wagering operations and
changes to state racing laws to help video-lottery terminal
operators generate revenue. </p>
<p>The case is In re New York City Off-Track Betting Corp.,
09-17121, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Tribune Board May Have Shelved Decision on Michaels, WSJ Says </p>
<p>Tribune Co.''s board of directors may have shelved a
decision on the future of Chief Executive Officer Randy Michaels, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
familiar with the situation. While the board was to have
discussed his position Oct. 19, an unidentified spokesman said
the directors were concentrating on the company''s reorganization
plan, to be filed on Oct. 22. Michaels told local reporters in Chicago he was still working, the newspaper said. </p>
<p>Separately, Tribune Co. unsecured investors are to ask a
judge to rule whether they have the right to sue real estate
billionaire Sam Zell, who led a buyout of the company a year
before it filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, the New York
Post reported, without saying where it obtained the information. </p>

<p>Downgrades/Other Ratings Actions </p>
<p>HR Block Placed on Credit Watch; Affiliate Downgraded </p>
<p> HR Block Inc.''s ratings, including its BBB/A-2
counterparty ratings, were placed on credit watch with
negative implications yesterday by Standard  Poor''s Ratings
Services, according to a statement by the ratings company. </p>
<p>The rating action also applies to the counterparty credit
ratings of HR Block Inc.''s unit Block Financial LLC, SP said
in the statement. </p>
<p>The negative CreditWatch reflects the heightened risk
that HR Block Inc. may not be able to offer refund anticipation
loans, or RALs, during its fiscal 2011 tax season. </p>
<p>Separately, HR Financial LLC''s long-term rating was
downgraded to Baa2 from Baa1 and the senior unsecured notes to
Baa2 from Baa1, by Moody''s Investors Service, according to a
statement yesterday by the ratings company. </p>
<p>The rating outlook is negative, Moody''s said in the
statement. </p>
<p>The downgrade reflects declining tax return volumes over
the last two years, the risk of further market share losses in
the bricks and mortar segment to digital products over the
medium term, as well as and regulatory and business risks,
Moody''s said in the statement. </p>
<p>For more about Moody''s ratings action, click here. </p>
<p>Eli Lilly''s A1 rating Placed on Review by Moody''s </p>
<p>Eli Lilly''s A1 long-term rating was placed on review for
possible downgrade by Moody''s Investors Service, according to a
statement by the ratings company yesterday, adding that the
outlook is negative. </p>
<p>Approximately $6.7 billion of rated debt is affected,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>Moody''s affirmed Eli Lilly''s prime-1 short-term rating,
reflecting its strong liquidity profile, Moody''s said in the
statement. </p>
<p>The rating actions follow the recent Federal Drug
Administration request for a new clinical trial for diabetes
drug Bydureon, according to the statement. The earliest date
of U.S. approval now appears to be mid-2012, according to
Moody''s statement. The Bydureon delay follows several other
setbacks for Eli Lilly related to pipeline progress and
patent challenges, stated Michael Levesque, Moody''s Senior
Vice President. </p>

<p>American National Insurance and Units Downgraded by SP </p>
<p> American National Insurance Co. yesterday saw its
counterparty credit and financial strength ratings and those of
certain operating units downgraded by Standard  Poor''s Ratings
Services to A+ from AA-, according to a statement by SP. </p>
<p>The units affected by the ratings action are American
National Insurance Co. of Texas, American National Property 
Casualty Co., and American National General Insurance, according
to the statement. </p>
<p>The downgrade primarily reflects the operating
performance of American National Insurance Co. group''s
property and casualty business, which has been volatile and
has weakened as a result of sustained operating losses over the
past few years, mainly because of significant catastrophe
losses, Standard  Poor''s credit analyst David Zuber said in
the statement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may repay a
$5 billion investment from Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. that boosted the bank during the 2008 financial crisis, the
Wall Street Journal said, citing unidentified people. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has the option of paying $5.5 billion to
redeem the shares, although that would trigger a charge of $1.6
billion and need approval from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the
newspaper said. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in
Hong Kong, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Berkshire''s investment in September 2008 reassured
investors and allowed Goldman Sachs to raise another $5 billion
the following day, according to the newspaper. Goldman Sachs is
considering using some of its $173 billion in excess
liquidity to repay Berkshire, the Journal reported. </p>
<p>Annual dividends of 10 percent on Berkshire''s preferred
Goldman Sachs shares have cost the investment bank about $1
billion, the equivalent of more than $1.3 million a day, the
newspaper reported. Funding from debt markets has become cheaper
since the crisis, and Goldman Sachs would be able to replace the
capital, the Journal said. </p>
<p>Repaying Berkshire''s investment would also lift
restrictions that prevent Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein and other executives from selling more than 10
percent of their shares in the firm, according to the report.
That curb was requested by Buffett at the time of the deal, the
newspaper said. </p>
<p>It''s not clear whether executives at the New York-based
bank have sought approval from the Federal Reserve for repaying
Berkshire, the Journal said. </p>

<p>Technology companies are running up
against a dearth of qualified developers to create applications
for mobile devices, according to a survey by online job board
Dice Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>Almost 57 percent of employers and outside recruiters that
hired for mobile-related jobs this year plan to boost such hires
in the next 12 months, the survey, conducted on behalf of
Bloomberg Businessweek.com, showed. More than half the
respondents described the supply of quality mobile-software
designers and engineers as scarce. </p>
<p>Companies need app developers as the market for mobile
software surges to $17.5 billion by 2012, from $4.1 billion last
year, according to a study by Chetan Sharma Consulting. The
demand for programmers who can write for mobile platforms, such
as Apple Inc.''s iPhone, Google Inc.''s Android and Research In
Motion Ltd.''s BlackBerry, has stoked competition among
recruiters, driven up salaries and led employers to consider
getting new talent through acquisitions. </p>
<p>We''re seeing a lot of companies that have mobile as a
component of their strategy, said Steve Fredrick, general
partner at private-equity firm Grotech Ventures in Vienna,
Virginia, and founder of job site StartUpHire. There just
aren''t that many people who have experience with mobile
software, and there''s a desire for people who know how to make
that work. </p>
<p>Small Rise </p>
<p>The software publishing industry employed 257,300 workers
in August, an increase of just 0.7 percent from a year earlier,
according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>
<p>The online survey, conducted Oct. 11-15, was based on 283
recruiters who use New York-based Dice''s site and said they had
hired mobile professionals this year. Dice sells services to
businesses who recruit employees through its site. </p>
<p>More than a fifth of respondents said they hired
substantially more mobile experts this year than last year, and
more than a third said they added slightly more. Some 36 percent
hired about the same number, while 6.6 percent said mobile
hiring fell this year. </p>
<p>In the next 12 months, a fifth of recruiters anticipate a
substantial increase in hiring, 37 percent see a slight
increase, and 34 percent plan to hire about the same number. </p>
<p>The most common salary range for mobile engineers and
designers was $75,001 to $100,000, according to 41 percent of
respondents. About 28 percent said average pay was $100,001 to
$125,000, while 21 percent said it was $50,001 to $75,000. </p>
<p>Higher Salaries </p>
<p>Almost a third of employers raised salary levels for the
average mobile worker higher than normal, citing the
increase in demand for talent. </p>
<p>Experience with Apple''s mobile platform carried the most
weight on resumes, with 72 percent of recruiters saying they are
hiring for development of iPhone applications, and 38 percent
saying iPhone expertise is the most attractive among platforms. </p>
<p>Anybody that has an application that has been working on
a notebook now wants that to work on an iPad, an iPhone and on
Google Android, said Todd Thibodeaux, chief executive officer
of the trade group Computing Technology Industry Association in
Oak Brook, Illinois. </p>
<p>He described the supply of qualified talent as scant.
There''s a whole bunch of specialties that have to develop and
emerge there, Thibodeaux said. </p>
<p>Android Software </p>
<p>About 60 percent are hiring for Android development, and 23
percent said new recruits with knowledge of Google''s platform is
most highly prized. Some 48 percent of employers are hiring for
BlackBerry, while just 16.1 percent said that''s the most
desirable type of mobile expertise. </p>
<p>This month, Dice''s site had 758 job listings requiring
skills or experience with the iPhone, up from 264 a year ago.
The site had 685 listings requiring Android skills, up from 158. </p>
<p>If you look at jobs that require either iPhone skills or
Android skills, the number of jobs is still pretty small, but if
you look at the growth rate, it''s huge, said Tom Silver,
senior vice president at Dice. </p>
<p>Mobile was described as one of the top three priorities in
technology hiring by 35 percent of employers. A year from now,
as more businesses incorporate mobile technology, Silver
predicts that number will be closer to 50 percent. </p>
<p>The vast majority of employers, or 95 percent, said mobile
hiring was either competitive or extremely competitive. </p>
<p>Overseas Demand </p>
<p>That competition has intensified partly because of
increased demand for talent in other countries, especially India
and China, said Russell Hancock, CEO of Joint Venture: Silicon
Valley Network, a San Jose, California-based group formed by
business leaders to focus on talent-pool concerns in the region. </p>
<p>While programmers and other skilled workers from India and
China have had a significant presence in technology companies
during the Internet boom, in the past decade, that has tailed
off significantly, Hancock said. </p>
<p>Some businesses are resorting to acquisitions. About half
of the respondents plan to add mobile-software expertise by
buying companies in the next 12 months. </p>
<p>Other companies have learned to be more flexible in their
hiring. Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and CEO of local-business
reviews site Yelp Inc., said he began recruiting engineers
talented enough to learn and adjust to new types of mobile
platforms. </p>
<p>If you''re doing searches for people with iPhone
experience, it isn''t going to be a deep pool of people,
Stoppelman said. We just look for good engineers. </p>

<p>Any oil price fall should be seen as
an opportunity to buy the contract as the next move in the
market is likely to be a rally, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. </p>
<p>The signal that the next leg higher is imminent will be
tighter Dubai forward spreads and a narrower Brent-Dubai
spread, Lawrence Eagles, head of commodity strategy in New
York, said today in a monthly oil market report. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said it expects the dollar to weaken by four to
five percent over the next six months, giving oil a boost. A
declining dollar increases the appeal of energy as an inflation
hedge. The strength in crude is also bolstered by rising demand
in several regions, the bank said. A narrowing spread, when
Dubai oil rises closer to North Sea Brent, typically shows
increasing Asian demand. </p>
<p>The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, or EFS, for December
narrowed 12 cents to $2.40 a barrel today, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates. The EFS is the price difference between
Brent futures and Dubai swaps contracts and signifies Brent''s
premium relative to the Middle East grade. The December-January
Dubai spread shrank to minus 36 cents from minus 80 cents on
Sept. 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The key risk is that we are being too cautious and that
the threat of $100 a barrel oil that is implicit in our fourth-
quarter 2011 oil forecast arrives much sooner than we expect,
driven by not only a weak dollar, but also by rampant Chinese
and emerging market demand, the rebuilding of French strategic
stocks, and an upward bias to food prices, Eagles said in the
report. </p>
<p>Should Be Bought'' </p>
<p>We continue to believe that any setback in the crude
price should be bought, he said. </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate oil for December gained as much as
81 cents, or 1 percent, to $81.37 a barrel in electronic trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $80.91 at 9:43
a.m. London time. Yesterday it declined $1.98 to $80.56 a
barrel. The contract is down 1 percent this week. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said it sees a growing supply deficit in oil
products in the fourth quarter. The resulting increase in
refinery runs will lead to a draw in global crude inventories
through February, it said. </p>
<p>The recent fall in crude stocks in Cushing should soon be
reversed, widening the WTI contango and sending WTI back to a
heavy discount to dated Brent, Eagles said in the report. </p>
<p>The nationwide strike in France, which has halted
refineries and led to fuel shortages, will lead to a six percent
drop in demand in October unless it drags far beyond the end
of this week, Eagles said. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. will introduce
its battery-powered Chevrolet Volt car in China during the
second half of 2011 as automakers add more fuel-efficient models
in the nation. </p>
<p>The volumes in China won''t be large, Kevin Wale,
president of the U.S. automaker''s China business, said in an
interview in Shanghai yesterday. Many Chinese consumers are
first time buyers and aren''t environmentally conscious yet, Wale
said. </p>
<p>GM and its partner SAIC Motor Corp. join carmakers Nissan
Motor Co. and Daimler AG in planning to sell cars powered by
batteries in the world''s biggest auto market. China, the world''s
largest oil importing nation, is offering buyers of such
vehicles subsidies as the country seeks to cut its dependence on
the fuel. </p>
<p>GM, the biggest overseas automaker in China, didn''t specify
sales target or price for the Volt in China, which will cost
$41,000 in the U.S. before subsidies when it''s introduced next
month. The Volt, which can travel about 40 miles using batteries,
will be sold as the Opel Ampera in Europe from next year. The
models also include a gasoline engine that extends the driving
range to as much as 360 miles. </p>
<p>Given the lack of charging infrastructure in the country
and the high price of electric cars, China will be a tough
market for such cars, said John Zeng, an analyst from J.D. Power
 Associates. </p>
<p>The Volt will serve more to enhance GM''s green image,
Shanghai-based Zeng said. </p>
<p>China </p>
<p>China has overtaken the U.S. as GM''s largest market by
sales volume, as government subsidies boosted buying. Even so,
GM earns more profit in the U.S. than in China. </p>
<p>GM''s North America operations had profits before interest
and taxes of $1.59 billion in the second quarter, while the
company''s international operations, including China, earned $672
million. </p>
<p>Nissan, whose electric car Leaf goes on sale in December
in the U.S., may introduce electric cars in China, Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn said in September. </p>
<p>The Japanese carmaker is in talks with China''s Dongfeng
Motor Group Co. about the best way to do it, said Ghosn. The
Leaf runs only on battery power and can travel about 100 miles
on a charge, according to Nissan. </p>
<p>China said in June it would offer as much as 50,000 yuan
($7,510) toward the purchase of plug-in hybrid models and up to
60,000 yuan for vehicles that run only on batteries in five
Chinese cities on a trial basis. The nation may subsidize
purchases of at least 4 million energy-efficient vehicles by
2012, the National Development and Reform Commission, China''s
top economic planner, said in June. </p>
<p>Daimler, the world''s second-largest manufacturer of luxury
cars, and BYD Co., the Chinese automaker backed by billionaire
Warren Buffett, set up a 50-50 joint venture in May to develop
electric cars in China. </p>

today in a statement. The software, Cognos 10, works on Research
In Motion Ltd.''s BlackBerry and Apple Inc.''s iPad and iPhone. </p>
<p>IBM is betting that analytics software, which identifies

customers look to be more efficient. IBM''s sales from analytics
should climb to $16 billion in the next five years, an increase
of almost 80 percent, the company said in May. </p>
<p>The number of mobile workers will top 1.19 billion by 2013,
IBM said, giving analytics a wider audience. Hertz Global

Inc. and IBM Corp., according to a statement. </p>
<p>Owens, who is currently Caterpillar''s chairman, will leave

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to introduce an exchange-
traded fund for copper, seeking to benefit from increased
investment demand for the metal used in pipes and wires. </p>
<p>Shares in the J.P. Morgan Physical Copper Trust will trade
on the New York Stock Exchange as soon as practicable, the
New York-based bank said in a filing to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, without giving a precise date. The Wall
Street Journal reported on the bank''s filing earlier today. </p>
<p>ETFs trade like stocks, enabling investors access to
commodities such as gold without taking physical delivery of
them. Commodity prices including metals and grains surged today
as investors sought alternatives to a weakening dollar. Copper
in London has gained 29 percent over the past year on declining
stockpiles, increased demand and the weaker U.S. currency. </p>
<p>There is a view that such an ETF would be bullish for
prices, Peter Richardson, chief metals economist at Morgan
Stanley, said today by phone from Melbourne. We might also see
prices that are so high that they trigger demand destruction. </p>
<p>Three-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange
gained as much as 2.6 percent to $8,549 a metric ton today,
taking gains this year to about 16 percent. The metal reached a
record $8,940 a ton in July 2008 before the global credit crisis
drove prices to a low of $2,817.25 in December that year. </p>
<p>Physical Copper </p>
<p>The shares are intended to provide institutional and
retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means, with
minimal credit risks, of gaining investment benefits similar to
those of holding physical copper, said the filing, which was
dated Oct. 22. Each share will be equivalent to one-hundredth of
a ton, backed by grade-A metal, not futures, the filing said. </p>
<p>ETF Securities Ltd. said on Oct. 11 that it''s preparing to
start exchange-traded commodity funds backed by six industrial
metals. Aluminum is the most likely base metal to be used to
back an exchange-traded product, according a Bloomberg News
survey of 16 analysts the same month. </p>
<p>Copper stockpiles monitored by exchanges in London, New
York and Shanghai totaled 543,932 tons as of Oct. 22, down 21
percent this year. That''s about 11 days of global consumption
based on the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc estimate for
demand this year of 18.2 million tons, down from almost 14 days
at the start of 2010. </p>
<p>Price Reaction'' </p>
<p>Of all the base metals, copper has the lowest level of
inventory both on a historical basis but also on a stock-
consumption basis, said Catherine Raw, a fund manager at
Blackrock Inc. who helps manage the company''s flagship $14.2
billion World Mining Fund. We would see a price reaction to
a copper ETF, Raw said today on a conference call in Australia. </p>
<p>Record holdings of gold-backed, exchange-traded products
together with the rally in LME prices and low interest rates in
developed economies were encouraging banks to introduce funds
backed by base metals, said Morgan Stanley''s Richardson. </p>
<p>Gold assets in exchange traded products declined 0.9 ton to
2,098 tons as of Oct. 22, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14, the same day that spot gold climbed to an all-
time high of $1,387.35 an ounce. </p>
<p>JPMorgan agreed in February to pay $1.7 billion for RBS
Sempra Commodities LLP''s global oil and metal activities and its
European power and gas assets. Through the acquisition, the bank
inherited Henry Bath  Son Ltd., which operates commodity
warehouses worldwide, its website shows. </p>
<p>Copper for the new product will be initially held at Henry
Bath''s storage in the U.S., the so-called cheapest-to-deliver
location, JPMorgan said in the filing. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. added $10 billion to a stock-buyback plan, signaling the
world''s biggest computer-services provider will keep using cash
to boost per-share earnings rather than on large acquisitions. </p>
<p>The move brings the amount authorized for repurchases by
the board to $12.3 billion, Armonk, New York-based IBM said in a
statement today. In April, it authorized $8 billion in buybacks. </p>
<p>Since taking over as chief executive officer in 2002, Sam Palmisano has spent more than $68 billion on buybacks, about 38
percent of IBM''s current market value. The company has said it
plans to spend about $50 billion on buybacks in the next five
years, compared with about $20 billion on acquisitions, as it
aims to almost double operating earnings per share. </p>
<p>It''s crucial to their long-term EPS objectives, said
Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher  Co. in San Francisco,
who rates the shares neutral and doesn''t own them. They
realize the fact that they are a big, mature tech company. </p>
<p>The company plans to increase operating earnings per share
to $20 by 2015, with about $2.80 coming from repurchases. The
company had $11.1 billion in cash at the end of September. </p>
<p>IBM climbed 83 cents to $140.67 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have added 7.5 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Smaller Acquisitions </p>
<p>Palmisano has spent over $20 billion on more than 100
acquisitions since 2002. His largest purchase was business-
management software maker Cognos Inc. at $5 billion. Last month,
the company agreed to buy Netezza Corp. for $1.7 billion, his
sixth deal that topped $1 billion. </p>
<p>The focus on buying smaller companies contrasts with
competitors such as Hewlett-Packard Co., which has spent about
$50 billion over the same span on about half as many deals. </p>
<p>Last month, Palmisano criticized the rival, saying HP has
to pay too much for acquisitions because it cut back on research
and development. IBM spent about $6 billion on research last
year, double HP''s expenditure. </p>
<p>IBM plans to ask for additional buyback authorization at an
April board meeting, according to the statement. </p>
<p>IBM''s per-share earnings have increased more than 10
percent every year since 2005, while sales growth hasn''t met
that metric since 2003. </p>
<p>Repurchases last quarter decreased the number of shares by
5 percent, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on the
company''s quarterly earnings call this month. The decline, along
with a sales increase, helped increase earnings per share by 18
percent to $2.82, he said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, plans to sell $1.5 billion of notes as U.S.
financial debt overcomes foreclosure investigations and slumping
trading revenue to outperform overall corporate securities. </p>
<p>The five-year debt, set to be sold as soon as today, may
yield 225 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
said a person familiar with the offering, who declined to be
identified because terms aren''t set. </p>
<p>U.S. bank bonds are beating overall corporate debt for a
second month even as states probe the industry''s foreclosure
practices. Morgan Stanley last week reported a third-quarter
loss on a per-share basis, in its worst trading quarter since
2008. Still, investors favor the premium over Treasuries on bank
debt versus that of industrials, said Mirko Mikelic, senior
portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management. </p>
<p>Just because they''re in a business that''s maybe slowing
down in the near term doesn''t mean they''re not going to get good
pricing, said Mikelic, who helps oversee $14 billion of fixed-
income assets, including Morgan Stanley debt, in Grand Rapids,
Michigan. We still like financials relative to industrials,
because industrial spreads have just come in so much. </p>
<p>The average 225 basis-point spread on U.S. bank debt
compares with a 155 basis-point yield over Treasuries on
industrial bonds, the lowest since May 3, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. </p>
<p>Bank Bonds </p>
<p>U.S. bank debt has returned 0.52 percent to investors this
month, exceeding the 0.31 percent gain on all corporate debt,
according to the index data. That follows a 1.18 percent gain in
September, which also beat the 0.59 percent return on overall
corporate bonds. </p>
<p>It''s tough to find value anywhere in corporate land
because everything''s just run in so tightly, spread-wise,
Mikelic said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley last issued five-year notes on July 21 as
part of a $3 billion offering, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The $1.25 billion of 4 percent debt priced at 99.655
cents on the dollar to pay a spread of 245 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The notes due in July 2015 traded yesterday at 103.323
cents on the dollar to yield 3.237 percent, or 210.4 basis
points more than benchmarks, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley trails Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase
 Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in size. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs reported earnings that beat analysts''
estimates as lower costs and higher investment-banking revenue
cushioned a decline in trading. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley will shut down its
852 million-euro ($1.19 billion) P2 Value fund, becoming the
third asset manager to liquidate a German mutual property fund
in a month after too many investors wanted their money back. </p>
<p>The P2 Value fund''s managers will sell all of its 34
properties, spread across Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and the U.S.,
within three years, according to a statement on the website of
Morgan Stanley''s German unit. The proceeds will be distributed
to the fund''s investors, mostly German, in half-yearly payments. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley follows Aberdeen Asset Management Plc and
Kanam Grund Kapitalanlagesellschaft mbH in announcing the
closure of a mutual fund. The companies failed to raise enough
from disposals to repay investors before a deadline forcing them
to open the funds for redemptions. All three halted redemptions
two years ago as investors scrambled to withdraw money as the
financial crisis escalated. </p>
<p>This is a crisis that''s been on the horizon for some
time, said Jan Hagen, who teaches students about banking and
other financial services at Berlin''s European School of
Management and Technology. The whole asset class is coming
under pressure because of the risks these funds present --
something that wasn''t visible in the past. </p>
<p>Lack of Liquidity </p>
<p>The crisis has exposed the lack of liquidity among property
funds: while it can take months to buy or sell a building,
investors may change the amount of money they have in a fund on
a daily basis. This can become a problem if money comes into the
funds more slowly or stops altogether. </p>
<p>The situation was aggravated by funds putting money into
these investment products alongside private individuals. Most
avoided the initial 5 percent fee designed to encourage
investors to keep their money in the fund for years, according
to Iryna Pylypchuk, a research director at CB Richard Ellis
Group Inc. </p>
<p>Allianz Global Investors AG suspended redemptions on Sept.
27 in its Premium Management Immobilien Anlagen P fund of funds
after investors redeemed 1 billion euros in the first nine
months of the year. The company tried to gain more time to
return money to investors and will sell some of the fund''s
remaining 1.2 billion euros of assets, which include a stake in
Morgan Stanley''s P2 Value fund. </p>
<p>The liquidations in the past month are the first for
Germany''s 88 billion-euro mutual property fund industry,
undermining confidence in an investment favored by German savers
for the regular income that it generates. </p>
<p>Frozen Funds </p>
<p>Aside from the three to be liquidated, seven other funds
are suspended for redemptions. That means 24.8 billion euros, or
28 percent of property mutual fund assets, are unavailable to
investors, figures compiled by Frankfurt-based BVI Bundesverband
Investment  Asset Management show. </p>
<p>The funds are most likely to sell assets in the Asia
Pacific region, France, Germany and the U.K. because demand from
buyers is strongest in those markets, CB Richard Ellis''s
Pylypchuk said. </p>
<p>The funds'' liquidity crisis led German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble to propose a cap on redemptions and penalize
new savers who hold their investments in funds for less more
four years. A draft bill will be presented to parliament in the
first half of next year and has welcomed by many asset managers. </p>
<p>This set of amendments is yet another attempt by the
German government to bring stronger protection for retail
investors, Pylypchuk said. </p>
<p>Limited Withdrawals </p>
<p>Under the draft rules, which may not take effect until the
end of 2011, new investors wouldn''t be allowed to withdraw more
than 5,000 euros each month. New investments would have to be
held for at least two years, with a 10 percent and 5 percent cut
on withdrawals in the third and fourth year respectively. </p>
<p>When redemptions are suspended, funds would have 2 1/2
years in which to restore liquidity before a depository bank
takes over. Property sales may not be done below a certain
percentage of appraisal valuations, which will also become more
frequent than the once a year practice now. </p>
<p>SEB Asset Management Chief Executive Officer Barbara Knoflach said the legislation will prompt some professional
money managers to move into more flexible  special funds or
closed-end funds. </p>
<p>The fund management industry will go back to pure retail
funds and pure institutional funds, she said in an interview
at the Expo Real trade fair in Munich earlier this month. SEB
closed its 6.3 billion-euro ImmoInvest fund in May. </p>
<p>Biggest Winners </p>
<p>Other asset managers said the rules may lead to more
consolidation in the industry, with the main winners being the
large, stable funds with regular inflows, particularly those
generated by banks with a network of branches. </p>
<p>Running open-ended funds won''t work without having a
branch network, said Matthias Danne, the DekaBank Deutsche
Girozentrale management board member who heads its property-fund
unit. </p>
<p>The three largest asset managers are owned by banks. Deka
Immobilien GmbH, the biggest, is owned by regional savings
banks, Union Investment Real Estate GmbH is controlled by
Germany''s cooperative banks and Commerz Real AG is part of

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the largest
soft-drink bottler in Latin America, plans to install as many as
35,000 coffee machines in corner stores in Mexico under the
brand name Blak. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa is competing with Switzerland''s Nestle SA
to sell coffee products such as cappuccino and latte, said
Javier Astaburuaga, chief financial officer of parent company
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, known as Femsa. The Mexico City-
based bottler is setting up the dispensers in cities where it
delivers Coca-Cola Co. products. </p>
<p>We believe that in Mexico, even though Nestle has a very
strong presence in this segment, there are opportunities for us
because of our direct service to corner stores, Astaburuaga
said in an interview in Monterrey late yesterday. </p>
<p>The incursion into the coffee market is part of Coca-Cola
Femsa''s push into non-carbonated drinks in cooperation with the
world''s biggest soft-drink maker. The Mexican company, which has
a 50-50 partnership with Coca-Cola, said on Oct. 14 it signed an
agreement for exclusive talks to purchase Grupo Industrias
Lacteas, a maker of dairy products in Panama. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa fell 1.5 percent to 95.19 pesos in Mexico
trading yesterday, paring its gain this year to 10.6 percent. </p>
<p>Jugos del Valle </p>
<p>In 2007, Coca-Cola Femsa purchased Mexico''s second-largest
juicemaker Jugos del Valle and has since increased sales to
Latin America in a partnership with the region''s bottlers. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa began a pilot program for coffee last year
and will have 5,000 dispensers in Mexico City by December,
Astaburuaga said. That number could jump by five to seven times
over the next two to four years in Coca-Cola Femsa''s territories
in Mexico, he said. The company will determine after the first
quarter how quickly it will roll out the machines, he said. </p>
<p>I anticipate it will be aggressive, Astaburuaga said,
referring to the speed of expansion. </p>
<p>If the Blak coffee brand follows the Jugos del Valle model
and other Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico join the partnership, the
number of dispensers may increase to 50,000 or 60,000, he said. </p>
<p>Astaburuaga declined to say how much sales the coffee
business may generate. </p>

<p>The HK$20 billion they''d offered to remove him as a

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. is researching a way to cut electronic devices'' power
consumption by 90 percent and reduce so-called vampire energy,
or power used while machines and gadgets are turned off. </p>
<p>IBM''s Zurich laboratory is developing a transistor that
would regulate energy usage more tightly than the current
models, preventing energy from being used when devices are left
plugged into an electrical outlet, the Armonk, New York-based
company said today in a statement. It''s working on the project
with European universities and companies. </p>
<p>Reducing power consumption in products with transistors,
which includes supercomputers, laptops and smartphones, would
help companies and home consumers reduce energy bills, said
Adrian Ionescu, a professor in the nanotechnology lab at Ecole
Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland, who is
working with IBM on the project. It also would stretch battery
life in mobile devices, he said. </p>
<p>Instead of having to recharge your battery after two
days, you might extend that to weeks, Ionescu said in a phone
interview yesterday. Imagine your laptop lasting 10 times
longer. </p>
<p>Power from machines in standby mode cost U.S. households a
total of $3 billion in 2005, according to the most recent
Department of Energy figures, IBM said. Energy used by
information technologies and consumer electronics will double by
2022 and triple by 2030 to 1,700 terawatt-hours, the company
said. </p>
<p>Mobile Devices </p>
<p>The project will last about three years, followed by
several years of development and trials, said Heike Riel, who
helps lead nanotechnology research at IBM''s Zurich lab.
Consumers would have products with the new transistors in 2015
at the earliest, Riel said. </p>
<p>Reducing power needed in mobile devices such as smartphones
may allow use of alternative energy sources such as solar,
Ionescu said. Mobile devices currently require more power than
such energy sources can provide, he said. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s largest computer-services provider, spends
about $6 billion, or about 6 percent of total revenue, on
research and development each year. </p>
<p>IBM rose 76 cents to $141.43 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 8 percent
this year. </p>

<p>Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said the country''s central bank followed conflict of
interest guidelines when it hired an adviser from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. </p>
<p>Bloc Quebecois lawmaker Daniel Paille and Thomas Mulcair of
the New Democratic Party both asked about the hiring of Timothy Hodgson for an 18-month term. Flaherty said in response that the
bank makes its own staffing decisions and that Hodgson has
severed his ties to the private sector. </p>
<p>Governor Mark Carney and Hodgson worked together at Goldman
Sachs in New York from 1998-2000, and Hodgson was hired by the
central bank this year to work on developing rules for trading
repurchase agreements and over-the-counter derivatives, and
regulations to ensure banks have enough capital. Carney told
opposition lawmakers during committee testimony yesterday
employees are bound by a code of conduct and a conflict of
interest policy. </p>
<p>It''s a question of the revolving door back to the private
sector, Mulcair said today while asking questions of Flaherty,
adding that Hodgson''s contract has no cooling-off period. </p>
<p>Any appearance of conflict of interest in our democratic
institutions undermines the public''s trust, Mulcair said. </p>
<p>Flaherty replied by saying the person in question has
severed his ties with the private sector and the Bank of
Canada makes its own hiring decisions. </p>
<p>Bank of Canada spokesman Jeremy Harrison said that Hodgson
has resigned from Goldman Sachs, severed all ties, divested
himself of all his holdings of Goldman Sachs stock and placed
his other investments in a blind trust. </p>
<p>The bank''s conflict-of-interest policy will appropriately
limit his activities upon his departure, Harrison said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to
acquire a majority stake in Brazil''s Gavea Investimentos Ltda.,
the fund manager founded by former Brazilian central banker
Arminio Fraga. </p>
<p>Gavea will sell 55 percent of its operations, including its
entire private banking unit, to the New York-based lender, Gavea
partner Amaury Bier said today in a telephone interview from Sao
Paulo. JPMorgan may acquire a further 22.5 percent within three
years, and another 22.5 percent in five, Bier said. </p>
<p>Gavea, which runs private-equity and hedge funds, manages
about $6 billion and has 119 employees, according to the firm''s
website. JPMorgan will initially pay $270 million, and the total
amount may reach $1 billion, Brazil''s Valor Economico newspaper
said today, without citing the source of the information. Those
prices are speculations, Bier said. </p>
<p>The value will depend on our performance and will go as
far as the eye can see, as long as it would be reasonable,
Bier said. The value of resources managed by Gavea will fall
by about $1 billion, which is from private banking, to about $5
billion. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Highbridge Capital Management struck the deal,
which is expected to be completed shortly, the companies
said in a statement today that didn''t disclose terms. The firm,
which will remain independent, will be called Highbridge Gavea. </p>
<p>Economists project Brazil''s economic growth will more than
double that of the U.S. this year, helping the country attract
so much capital the government imposed taxes on foreign
investors to stem a currency rally. </p>
<h2>Direct Exposure'' </h2>
<p>Gavea brings strategy and geographic diversification to
Highbridge, said Glenn Dubin, co-founder and chief executive
officer of Highbridge, in an interview. We had virtually no
exposure to Brazil, and now we have the most valuable local
partner imaginable there. Fraga also brings an expertise in
macro investing to Highbridge and will manage a portion of
Highbridge''s $6 billion multi-strategy hedge fund. Fraga will
also sit on Highbridge''s investment committee. </p>
<p>Gavea, founded by Fraga in 2003, has offices in his native
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. A former fund manager for
billionaire George Soros, he has been in talks with the bank
since at least February, a person with knowledge of the
negotiations said at the time. </p>
<p>U.S. banks are expanding internationally to tap faster-growing economies. Brazil''s gross domestic product is forecast
to jump 7.1 percent this year, according to the median estimate
of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That compares with 2.7
percent for the U.S., based on estimates from 65 economists. </p>
<h2>International Expansion </h2>
<p>International sales and service have been more profitable
for JPMorgan, which derived 24.5 percent of net revenue from
overseas markets last year and 61.6 percent of profits. In
February, it expanded its global commodities-trading unit by
agreeing to purchase parts of RBS Sempra Commodities LLP for
$1.7 billion. That same month, the bank said it plans to double
a 4 percent share of the Asian market over the next few years. </p>
<p>CEO Jamie Dimon, 54, has also made expanding in the
emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China a priority
by appointing Heidi Miller to the new position of head of
JPMorgan International in June. </p>
<p>The bank has a good presence internationally, Miller
said when she took the job. The question is, can we accelerate
growth plans in Asia, can we accelerate what''s going to be
growth in emerging Europe and Latin America? she said.
That''s our goal. </p>
<p>Fraga, 53, was central bank president from 1999 to 2003. He
named his fund after a Rio de Janeiro neighborhood that is
partially covered by tropical rain forest and is home to
Brazil''s only urban national park. He is a member of JPMorgan''s
International Council, which advises the bank on global
business. </p>

<p>Leave it to tiny Singapore to tell
us where the global economy is heading. </p>
<p>We used to look to the gargantuan U.S. economy for guidance
on financial trends. After Wall Street''s collapse, we turned to
the Group of 20 nations. More insight might be gleaned looking
at an island nation with 5 million people. </p>
<p>The idea that a place with no natural resources and a
state-capitalism model is a global bellwether will strike many
as absurd. Yet Singapore Exchange Ltd.''s attempted takeover of
Australia''s stock exchange shows how Asia''s money is changing
the face of finance and geopolitics as we know it. </p>
<p>Singapore Exchange''s A$8.1 billion ($7.9 billion) bid for
ASX Ltd. might not go through amid an outcry from Australian
lawmakers. It almost doesn''t matter. The point is that fast-
growing and cash-rich Asia is about to go shopping in ways that
might shock the biggest developed economies. </p>
<p>This transaction is full of chutzpah. Singapore''s stock
market is half the size of Australia''s and the deal looks
expensive. The real issue is ambition. Singapore is clearly
prepared to spend big to get economies of scale that don''t come
naturally. Expect more of this dynamic in Asia -- even from
smaller countries that get little attention globally. </p>
<p>How will the West respond when China, Japan and India go on
a mergers-and-acquisitions tear? And those are just Asia''s three
biggest economies. Executives from Seattle to London should also
expect more phone calls from acquisitive companies in South
Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and sovereign wealth fund
managers everywhere. </p>
<p>Next Wave </p>
<p>China has been scooping up energy assets around the globe,
and has $2.6 trillion of reserves to accelerate the campaign. It
seeks to leapfrog over the years needed to build domestic
corporate powerhouses. In today''s world, it''s easier to buy a
chunk of International Business Machines Corp. than create and
cultivate brands over time. As the yuan rises, tech leaders like
Nokia Oyj or Motorola Inc. become cheaper for mainland
executives. Why censor Google Inc. when you can just own it? </p>
<p>The next wave of globalization features developing nations
buying the crown jewels of developed ones, and it will be messy.
In 2005, the U.S. Congress freaked out when China''s CNOOC Ltd.
bid for oil company Unocal Corp. and scuttled the deal. Just
wait until China sets its sights on Boeing Co., Microsoft Corp.
or Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman Envy </p>
<p>This last name has long been coveted in Asia. Government
officials in Tokyo and Seoul crave having globally known, savvy
and profitable financial leaders. That tends to be code for
having their own Goldman. Now, Asia could just buy the real
thing. Well, try to at least. </p>
<p>It''s hard to believe developed-market lawmakers would let
many household names fall easily into Asian hands. Creative
attempts would be made to explain why Pacific Investment
Management Co. being acquired by foreigners poses a national-
security threat. Or why Apple Inc. or cable news network CNN
must remain American concerns. </p>
<p>Never mind how these arguments might run afoul of World
Trade Organization rules. The next few years will see a
disorienting flurry of takeover bids from Brasilia to Beijing,
putting politicians in unprecedented positions. Nationalistic
tendencies will collide with globalization as never before. </p>
<p>Singapore helped prove the point that Asia has money at a
time when others don''t. Its investment firms in recent years
took stakes in Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Barclays Plc and others,
shoring up some of capitalism''s biggest names. Bidding for
Australia''s ASX is the next logical step and a reminder that
Singapore''s long game is worth watching. </p>
<p>Bet on Gambling </p>
<p>Take casinos, which are suddenly the rage in conservative
Singapore. The government realized it had to let its hair down
to net more of the tourism dollars flowing elsewhere in Asia.
Welcoming casino-resorts run by Genting Singapore Plc and Las
Vegas Sands Corp. was a gamble that is clearly working. So was
revamping downtown to host Formula One races. Tourist arrivals
are exploding, and other Asian capitals are racing to emulate
Singapore''s success. </p>
<p>Singapore is working to reinvent itself as a biotechnology
hub with reasonably liberal immigration laws to feed its
development. Its transparent financial system has been a magnet
for hedge funds setting up shop in Asia. The ASX bid is
recognition that Singapore can''t grow much beyond its domestic
market and must look outward. </p>
<p>Opportunities Abound </p>
<p>Asia wants to avoid Japan''s arrogant and ill-considered
purchases during the bubble years. Buying Rockefeller Center and
the Pebble Beach golf course didn''t work out so well for
investors. Officials and executives in Singapore, Beijing, New
Delhi and Seoul must avoid the temptation for such vanity deals. </p>
<p>Opportunities abound, though. Several governments are
sitting on hundreds of billions of reserves and companies are
hoarding cash. Add the desire to grow economies and corporate
balance sheets and you have a clear recipe for expansion -- and
a huge one as Asia floods markets with more equity than ever
amid booming demand for initial public offerings. </p>
<p>This shopping spree will shake up the global power balance
like rarely before. Perhaps nowhere is this huge shift more
apparent than in tiny Singapore. </p>

<p>Five years after unveiling a plan to
shift into cloud computing, Microsoft Corp. may finally be
making headway. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s then-Chief Technology Officer Ray Ozzie penned
a memo in October 2005, saying the company was at risk if it
didn''t reinvent itself as a provider of software and computing
services over the Web. </p>
<p>Heeding the warning, Microsoft has signed up customers
including Toyota Motor Corp., 3M Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp.
for its cloud product. By March, 90 percent of the company''s
engineers will be working on cloud-related products, says Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. And the server unit may
generate $10 billion in annual revenue from cloud services in a
decade, says Microsoft President Bob Muglia. </p>
<p>We will see those numbers and more, Muglia said in an
interview. </p>
<p>Developers are learning more about the cloud strategy at a
conference today at the company''s headquarters in Redmond,
Washington, where Microsoft is highlighting tools that make it
easier to move applications to the cloud. In a report due after
the market closes today, Microsoft will say net income rose 34
percent last quarter to $4.8 billion, or 55 cents a share, as
sales gained 22 percent, according to analysts'' predictions. </p>
<p>Trailing Amazon </p>
<p>Further progress in cloud computing will hinge on whether
Microsoft can narrow Amazon.com Inc.''s lead. Microsoft in
November released its flagship cloud product, Azure, which
stores and runs customers'' programs in its own server farms. </p>
<p>That came three years after market leader Amazon introduced
a suite of cloud services that let companies rent, rather than
buy, servers -- the powerful machines that run networks and
handle complex computing tasks. </p>
<p>Still, Microsoft ranks high in surveys asking chief
information officers which cloud vendors they plan to use, said
Sarah Friar, a software analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>What Microsoft is doing well from a cloud perspective is
they are enterprise class and understand what it means to both
sell to large enterprise but also meet all their requirements,
said Friar, who is based in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The approach won over Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota. The
automaker is using Azure to track the 2,000 calls daily that
come into the Lexus roadside and crash assistance service. The
program took days to implement, compared with weeks for an
internal database, said Glen Matejka, a Toyota manager. </p>
<p>3M Cut Costs </p>
<p>3M, whose products range from Post-It notes to flu tests,
uses Azure to host a new program, called Visual Attention
Service, that lets website designers assess which parts of a
site catch the human eye. </p>
<p>3M, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, halved costs by
entrusting the program to Microsoft''s machines instead of its
own, said Jim Graham, technical lead for the program. </p>
<p>Cloud computing can make it affordable for companies to
tackle projects that previously would have required purchasing
and maintaining tens of thousands of servers. </p>
<p>Look at the so-called quants on Wall Street, said
Microsoft General Manager Bill Hilf. They say, I want to ask
a question, but it''s going to take me 20,000 servers to
answer. Each time that happens, banks don''t want to build a
new server farm. They want to just access those machines as
needed. </p>
<p>Hedging Our Bets'' </p>
<p>Getting customers on board wasn''t easy. During Microsoft''s
mid-year reviews, a series of meetings in hotel ballrooms near
Microsoft''s campus early this year, executives got a sobering
message from sales staff, Muglia said. Customers weren''t
convinced Microsoft took its cloud push seriously, Muglia said. </p>
<p>When we talked about choice, what they heard was we were
hedging our bets, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft sales chief Kevin Turner decided that the pitch
needed to change. Rather than discussing various options,
Microsoft''s sales force has altered its pitch to lead with the
cloud and now focuses customer meetings on cloud technologies,
Muglia said. </p>
<p>These are powerful new platforms that are creating a wave
of new opportunity, Ballmer said at Microsoft''s developer
conference today. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s biggest challenge in cloud computing may come
from Seattle-based Amazon. The online-commerce provider
generates about $500 million in sales from cloud services, more
than five times Microsoft''s cloud-related revenue, according to
Friar. </p>
<p>Amazon''s Goal </p>
<p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said Amazon Web Services, which
includes the company''s cloud services, will eventually be as
large as its electronic-commerce business, which makes up 97
percent of sales. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft discloses cloud-
related revenue. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 23 cents to $26.28 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. </p>
<p>Among small and medium-sized businesses, 77 percent 
surveyed by Goldman Sachs said they used Amazon, compared with
10 percent for Microsoft and 17 percent apiece for Google Inc.
and Salesforce.com Inc. Larger businesses reported 12 percent
use for Microsoft, compared with 18 percent for Salesforce and
11 percent for Google. Amazon wasn''t included in that survey. </p>
<p>Amazon isn''t encountering a lot of competition when it bids
for customers, said Adam Selipsky, an Amazon vice president. </p>
<p>We''re really not being told by customers or prospects
about material adoption of broad cloud offerings that are
currently out there from other vendors, he said. </p>
<p>IBM''s Role </p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp. started offering
cloud programs in March that let businesses develop and store
programs in IBM data centers. </p>
<p>VMware Inc., a software maker, has an edge over Microsoft
in so-called private clouds, which store programs in a company''s
own servers, Friar said. And Google and Salesforce have some
high-end features Azure lacks, according to David Smith, an
analyst at Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. </p>
<p>Selling software as a service may also squeeze Microsoft''s
profit margins because it entails additional costs of operating
data centers to run customer programs, Friar says. </p>
<p>Still, the company should be able to generate more revenue
from cloud products than for its regular software, Muglia said. </p>
<p>Cloud products, which are sold as a subscription, may help
Microsoft get more customers on multiyear agreements. Those make
revenue flow more predictably and lessen reliance on the
vagaries of product cycles and computer upgrades, Smith said. </p>
<p>Catching Up? </p>
<p>Microsoft may not lag behind rivals long, Goldman Sachs
research suggests. When the firm''s analysts asked companies
about the future, 29 percent listed Microsoft in their cloud
purchasing plans. IBM came in second, with 25 percent,
Salesforce racked up 24 percent and Google garnered 20 percent.
Amazon trailed, with 8 percent. </p>
<p>Muglia likens the advent of cloud computing to the shift
away from mainframes toward personal computers and servers. He
says he doesn''t want to see Microsoft consigned to a role as
leader in a has-been technology, citing IBM. </p>
<p>The threat is that we become like IBM is on the
mainframe, Muglia said. People still use mainframes an awful
lot, but it''s not where the future lies. I just have no interest
in running the Microsoft mainframe business. </p>

<p>Russia selected Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Merrill Lynch and eight more advisers for a planned $59
billion of asset sales in the next five years. </p>
<p> Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG are also on the list, along with Moscow-based Renaissance Capital, VTB Capital, VEB and Russian Auction House,
the government said in an order signed on Oct. 25 and posted
today on its website. UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and Barclays
Capital are among the foreign banks who lost out, along with
local brokerage Troika Dialog. </p>
<p>For those banks on the list, it can be a golden egg,
said Peter Westin, chief strategist at Aton Capital in Moscow. </p>
<p>Russia plans to sell as much as 15 percent of OAO Rosneft,
its biggest oil producer, as the government seeks to raise 1.8
trillion rubles ($59 billion) in asset sales over five years to
help balance the budget. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin''s
government approved the plan to sell stakes in about 900
companies, including lenders OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, First
Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on October 21. </p>
<p>Shuvalov said yesterday the list of banks should be
enlarged. We have 900 projects, Shuvalov told reporters in
Moscow. We need more banks. </p>
<p>Nicholas Jordan, country head of UBS, said the Swiss bank
still hoped to work with the Russian government on
privatizations. It''s my understanding there may be an
additional list and we would hope to be on it, said Jordan by
phone. </p>
<p>First Deficit </p>
<p>The government will use some of the revenue to narrow its
deficit to 1.8 trillion rubles, or 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product, in 2011 from an estimated 5.3 percent this year. Russia
had a shortfall of 5.9 percent last year, its first deficit in a
decade, after the economy posted its biggest contraction on
record. </p>
<p>The government plans to reduce its holding in Sberbank,
Russia''s biggest lender, to a controlling stake between 2011 and
2014, Shuvalov said. It will try to complete the sale of a
10 percent stake in VTB Group, the second-biggest bank, this
year and may sell an additional 10 percent in 2011 and 10
percent to 15 percent in 2012, according to Shuvalov. </p>
<p>Russia needs banks that understand the best time to put
assets on the market, Alexei Uvarov, head of the Economic
Ministry''s property department, said on March 25. We''re trying
to find new mechanisms of privatization that are less archaic
than before, with flexible market mechanisms. </p>
<p>Russia raised 1 billion rubles from asset sales last year,
when liquidity was tight and there was no demand from investors,
Uvarov said. The economy contracted a record 7.9 percent as
global demand plummeted, the biggest drop on record. </p>
<p>Russia''s last major asset sale was in 2007, when VTB Group,
the country''s second-largest bank, raised $8 billion in the
biggest initial public offering that year. Oil producer OAO
Rosneft''s IPO a year earlier raised $10.6 billion. </p>

rivals ever since Russell Investments labeled it a growth stock. </p>
<p>While Exxon, the world''s largest company by share value,
has gained 6.2 percent since June 11 when Russell said it would
put 92 percent of its market capitalization in the Russell 1000
Growth Index, Chevron Corp. jumped 14 percent and ConocoPhillips
rose 12 percent. Russell assigns 95 percent of Chevron to its
value gauge and 62 percent of ConocoPhillips. </p>
<p>In a year when Apple Inc. has soared 46 percent and Oracle
Corp. increased 17 percent, money managers have failed to
embrace Exxon''s new ranking, in part because Russell based its
decision on four analysts who lacked a consensus. Robb Parlanti,
who manages a fund at Turner Investment Partners that buys the
fastest-growing companies, avoided Exxon because he''s skeptical
profits will match his other holdings. David Kovacs, who
oversees a fund at Turner focused on the cheapest equities, cut
his stake after Exxon''s share of the Russell value index shrank. </p>
<p>What we couldn''t understand was, why does Russell seem to
think Exxon''s a growth stock and no one else does? said Doug Leggate, a Houston-based oil industry analyst at Bank of America
Corp. People are making huge swings in their investment
decisions, which is impacting the performance of the shares. </p>

<p>The San Francisco Giants, backed by
owners from Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and
Intel Corp., are bringing Silicon Valley knowhow to bear as they
take on the Texas Rangers in the World Series. </p>
<p>Under former Microsoft General Counsel Bill Neukom, who
took over as managing general partner in 2008, the team is
increasingly using technology to hone players'' skills and draw
more fans. The Giants also put a bigger emphasis on pitching
after years of relying on Barry Bonds''s home runs. </p>
<p>The Giants use motion-sensor suits to help evaluate
throwing and hitting mechanics and a specially outfitted
pitching machine that shoots different-colored balls at more
than 100 miles per hour (160 kph) to help batters overcome blind
spots. The team also is the first to use software that sets
ticket prices based on supply and demand, similar to airlines or
hotels. Such innovations, along with players'' raw talent and a
$357 million waterfront ballpark, have helped boost the club''s
value almost fivefold since the ownership group took over. </p>
<p>The point is to be restless about where technology can
help us on the baseball side and on the business side, Neukom,
also the Giants chief executive officer, said in an interview in
the team''s offices at ATT Park. The Giants got an early lead in
the series last night, beating the Rangers 11-7 in game one. </p>
<p>Franchise''s Value </p>
<p>The ownership group, called San Francisco Baseball
Associates LP, bought the Giants for $100 million in 1992,
saving them from moving to Florida. The team is now worth $483
million, making them the ninth-most-valuable franchise among the
30 clubs in Major League Baseball, according to Forbes magazine.
The Giants also own a third of Comcast Sports Net Bay Area, the
cable channel that carries their games. </p>
<p>The Giants'' backers, who get seats between home plate and
the dugout along the third-base line, include Arthur Rock, a
former Intel chairman and Apple Inc. director; Yahoo board
member Arthur Kern and the company''s former president, Jeff Mallett; Cisco executive Dan Scheinman; and venture capitalist
Paul Wythes. Hewlett-Packard Co. co-founder William Hewlett was
an owner before his 2001 death. </p>
<p>We''re talking about some of the premier guys in Silicon
Valley, said Larry Baer, the club''s president and chief
operating officer. In addition to the technology industry
veterans, the 31 owners include investor Charles Johnson,
chairman of Franklin Resources Inc., a mutual-fund company in
San Mateo, California. </p>
<p>Monetary Boost </p>
<p>Reaching the World Series is worth several millions of
dollars in additional revenue, Baer said, without elaborating.
About 4,000 new season ticket applications have been received by
the club since the beginning of September, when the team began
its push toward clinching the 21st National League title in its
127-year history. The Giants haven''t won a World Series since
moving to San Francisco from New York in 1958. </p>
<p>The real benefit is 2011, where you can drive season
tickets, where you can drive sponsorships, where we can drive
pricing, said Baer, 53. </p>
<p>Playing in the World Series will bolster the Giants''
season-ticket sales, merchandise orders, endorsement deals and
TV revenue, said Richard Walden, the head of sports business at
JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Private Bank unit. Still, consistently
winning year after year does more for a team''s value than a
single championship appearance, he said. JPMorgan helped the
Giants finance their ballpark, which opened in 2000. </p>
<p>Long Run </p>
<p>It will translate over time if they maintain the same
discipline with regard to the on-the-field and off-the-field
management of the club, Walden said. It doesn''t necessarily
make a huge difference unless you have a long history of
winning. </p>
<p>The team''s investors aren''t seeking a short-term
moneymaker, Neukom said. </p>
<p>The basic business model is to invite investors who are
passionate about baseball to make an investment and to
recognize, however, that it is not a near-term strategic
investment, Neukom said. If you want to have a fund for your
grandchildren to go to private schools in case the public
schools aren''t what you want them to be, then don''t put that
money here. </p>
<p>Neukom, who became an owner in 1995, orchestrated
Microsoft''s legal defense against antitrust allegations by the
U.S. government in the 1990s. He first started working with
Microsoft after Bill Gates''s father asked Neukom to help the
younger Gates build the software company, which had about a
dozen employees at the time. </p>
<p>Gates''s Pitch </p>
<p>Neukom, 68, also helped give Gates some pointers on
baseball. In the late-1980s, Gates was invited to throw out the
first pitch at a Seattle Mariners game. To practice the day
before, Neukom, Gates and Mariners catcher Dave Valle went into
the woods behind Microsoft''s headquarters for a few warm-up
throws. </p>
<p>He threw about six pitches, went back to work and the
next night in the Kingdome he threw a nice pitch, Neukom said. </p>
<p>Neukom took over as the team''s managing general partner
after former Safeway Inc. CEO Peter Magowan stepped down.
Magowan and Baer led the effort to purchase the Giants and build
the ballpark adjacent to San Francisco Bay. </p>
<p>When the Giants sought investors to help keep the team from
moving to Florida in the 1990s, technology executives were an
obvious option because of Silicon Valley''s proximity to San
Francisco, Baer said. The technology hotbed, home to Apple,
Intel and Hewlett-Packard, is about 40 miles from the city. </p>
<p>We were dialing for dollars, he said. </p>
<p>Dot-Com Boom </p>
<p>The Giants'' ballpark was the first privately financed major
league venue since Los Angeles''s Dodger Stadium in 1962. The
effort was aided by the dot-com boom, Baer said. It would have
been tougher to get funding to build the ballpark after the
bubble burst in 2000, he said. </p>
<p>The stadium was the first to offer Wi-Fi Internet service
to fans in 2004. Now the Giants are exploring ways to distribute
content on mobile devices and social networks, Neukom said. </p>
<p>When he took over, the team was five years into a six-year
playoff drought and rebuilding after Bonds''s departure. Bonds,
who set home run records as a Giant, saw his career marred by
steroids allegations. He is scheduled for trial in March on
charges of obstruction and lying to a federal grand jury in
2003, when he said he never knowingly took the drugs. </p>
<p>Neukom aimed to create a new vision and wrote a manifesto
called the Giants Way, outlining priorities, including
identifying and nurturing talent, teamwork and conditioning. </p>
<p>The Giants'' four starting pitchers in the World Series came
up through its minor league system. That includes two-time Cy
Young Award winner Tim Lincecum, who pitched 5 2/3 innings in
last night''s game. The bearded reliever, Brian Wilson, and
rookie catcher Buster Posey also were drafted by the team. </p>
<p>We''re very proud of that, said Neukom, who was showered
with champagne in the team clubhouse after the Giants defeated
the Philadelphia Phillies to win the National League pennant and
earn a spot in the World Series. If we''re playing good
baseball, lots of other good things will follow. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world''s
biggest company, posted its largest third-quarter profit
increase in six years as rising worldwide energy demand lifted
commodity prices. </p>
<p>Third-quarter net income rose 55 percent to $7.35 billion,
or $1.44 a share, from $4.73 billion, or 98 cents, a year
earlier, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today.
Per-share profit was 5 cents more than the average of 14
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Motorists, airlines and railroads are burning crude-based
fuels at a rate of one supertanker load every 33 minutes this
year, a 2.2 percent increase from 2009, according to Barclays
Capital. Exxon boosted production by more than one-fifth amid a
12 percent jump in U.S. oil futures. </p>
<p>Exxon already was producing more oil and gas than any of
the other public companies so for them to increase output and by
such a large margin is a good thing, said Douglas Ober, whose
$682 million under management at Petroleum  Resources Corp. in
Baltimore includes Exxon stock. This probably took a lot of
people by surprise. </p>
<p>The increase in net income was the largest for a third
quarter, excluding one-time gains, since 2004. Exxon rose 74
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $66.41 at 9:37 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares, which before today had
declined 3.7 percent this year, have nine buy ratings from
analysts, 12 holds and one sell. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. followed Intel Corp.
and Texas Instruments Inc. in reporting a tradeoff likely to
weigh on technology sales through year''s end: While corporate
customers are spending more, consumers are keeping wallets shut. </p>
<p>Microsoft yesterday posted first-quarter results that were
buoyed by corporate demand, even as households held off on
personal-computer purchases. Quarterly earnings by Texas
Instruments and Intel this month also reflected lackluster
buying by consumers. </p>
<p>Corporations that cut spending during the recession are now
upgrading aging systems and stepping up orders for computers and
software. By contrast, households concerned about joblessness
and home prices are capping companies'' sales growth. That poses
a challenge to an industry increasingly dependent on consumers,
who may represent 30 percent of total technology spending in the
next few years, up from about 20 percent now, according to
researchers at IDC in Framingham, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>The consumer is kind of damaged for a while, said Pat Becker Jr., principal at Becker Capital Management in Portland,
Oregon, which oversees about $2.3 billion in assets, including
1.5 million Microsoft shares. On the business side, the
corporate balance sheet is as good as we''ve ever seen there. But
you have two different balance sheets. </p>
<p>Strong'' Business Demand </p>
<p>Microsoft yesterday said net income rose 51 percent to $5.41
billion, or 62 cents a share, compared with the 55 cents
projected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The 25 percent
sales increase, to $16.2 billion, was fueled by demand for
Office 2010, corporate versions of Windows 7 and software for
running the server computers that anchor corporate networks. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, gained 39 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $26.67 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The stock has dropped 13 percent this year. </p>
<p>Consumer PC shipments grew less than 10 percent, while
computers for businesses rose in the mid-teens, General Manager
Bill Koefoed said on a conference call. Microsoft gets about 70
percent of revenue from businesses and the rest from consumers,
according to Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Business demand was very strong and that was a big driver
of Office and Server sales, said Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. Consumer PC growth was a little
less than people had predicted three months ago. </p>
<p>Intel, Texas Instruments </p>
<p>At Intel, the world''s largest maker of computer chips, and
Texas Instruments, which ranks No. 2 in the U.S., the split
between consumers and companies was more pronounced. </p>
<p>Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, lamented slumping
demand among consumers in the U.S. and Europe, even as corporate
buying helped the company predict fourth-quarter sales that may
exceed analysts'' estimates. Texas Instruments, based in Dallas,
forecast smaller fourth-quarter sales than some analysts had
estimated, citing a slowdown in consumer-electronics spending. </p>
<p>Texas Instruments Chief Executive Officer Rich Templeton
said consumer demand is cooling, hurting sales of computers and
televisions, while industrial demand remains especially
strong. </p>
<p>The round of growth fueled by the upgrading of dated
machinery could peter out in the first half of next year if
concerns over growth persist, said Stephen Minton, an analyst at
IDC. </p>
<p>Pretty Nervous'' </p>
<p>If the economy is still struggling three months from now,
companies will be pretty quick to put spending on hold, he
said. Companies are still pretty nervous. </p>
<p>Case in point: International Business Machines Corp., the
world''s largest computer-services provider, said services
signings fell 7 percent to $11 billion in the third quarter, the
third straight quarterly drop in new contracts. </p>
<p>The increasing importance of consumers to the computer
industry is being felt by chipmakers, whose rebound from the
recession last year was partly fueled by demand for laptops. </p>
<p>The industry is on course to grow 18 percent from last year
on an annual basis, according to Intel CEO Paul Otellini. Yet,
this year''s holiday shopping surge may fall short. Intel, whose
chips run more than 80 percent of the world''s PCs, usually gets
an 8 percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue from the
previous three months amid year-end holiday shopping. </p>
<p>Intel says sales will grow at most 6.3 percent this quarter
from the third. At the low end of Intel''s forecast, revenue will
decline. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Intel''s closest rival in
processors, predicted sales will be little changed this quarter. </p>
<p>Apple as Exception </p>
<p>U.S. consumers will spend about 2 percent less on gifts
this holiday season as shoppers remain concerned about a weak
economy, the Consumer Electronics Association said earlier this
month, citing an annual survey. </p>
<p>The average consumer will spend $750 on holiday gifts, the
industry trade group said Oct. 19. A third of the survey''s
respondents said they planned to reduce spending for reasons
related to unemployment, the association said. </p>
<p>Some technology companies are still benefiting from
consumer spending. Apple Inc. posted record earnings last
quarter after selling 14.1 million iPhones, more than analysts
predicted. Samsung Electronics Co., the biggest maker of
televisions and other consumer electronics, reported a 17
percent profit increase, also a record. </p>
<p>Many households are putting off PC purchases and opting
instead for tablets, such as Apple''s iPad. </p>
<p>Happy Holidays? </p>
<p>This holiday season is going to be absolutely fantastic
for Apple, said Michael Obuchowski, chief investment officer of
First Empire Asset Management, which holds Apple shares. They
were able to refresh their entire product line during the
recession. All of their devices are new designs. </p>
<p>Outside the technology world, retail spending on clothes
and other goods may be starting to recover. Analysts expect
shares of Macy''s Inc., Target Corp., Nordstrom Inc. and Kohl''s
Corp. to jump over the next year. Economists lifted estimates
for consumer purchases in the third quarter after retail sales
climbed more than forecast in September. </p>
<p>The consumer market is growing, but at a slower pace than
the business sector, Gregory Spierkel, chief executive officer
of Ingram Micro Inc., the biggest distributor of computer
equipment. That was not the story last year. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. posted an unexpected
drop in net income, bucking the trend of bigger profits among
the largest oil companies, after costs from exploration failures
erased gains from higher crude prices and record production. </p>
<p>Third-quarter profit fell 1.6 percent to $3.77 billion, or
$1.87 a share, from $3.83 billion, or $1.92, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said in a statement today.
That''s 28 cents less than the average of 15 analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exploration expenses soared 74 percent during the quarter
as the company took significant write-offs on wells in
Turkey and Canada, Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington
said today during an investor conference call. Higher costs
wiped out the benefit of a 12 percent climb in oil prices and
the most third-quarter crude and gas production in company
history. </p>
<p>They are coming up short in the upstream business at a
time when everyone else in the industry is reporting healthy
earnings with the improvement in the crude pricing
environment, said Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire
Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago-based risk-management
adviser to oil producers. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-biggest U.S. energy company, fell
$1.84, or 2.2 percent, to $82.60 a share at 4 p.m. in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has 19 buy and
six hold ratings from analysts and has risen 7.3 percent this
year. </p>
<p>Share Buyback </p>
<p>Sales rose 6.6 percent to $49.7 billion from $46.6 billion
in the third quarter of 2009, Chevron said. Profit from oil and
gas sales, which account for 95 percent of Chevron''s net income,
declined 4.6 percent. </p>
<p>Chevron plans to spend $750 million to buy its own stock
during the current quarter, Jeanette Ourada, general manager of
investor relations, said during the call. The company last made
buybacks in the final three months of 2008. </p>
<p>Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson last week
announced the company would move forward with a $7.5 billion
project in deep-water oil fields in the Gulf. It''s the largest
investment since the Obama administration ended the drilling ban
imposed after BP Plc''s Macondo well caused the biggest offshore
oil leak in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Watson, 53, disclosed plans in March to shrink the
company''s refining workforce and sell Chevron''s only remaining
European refinery because of thin profit margins. </p>
<p>Oil Exploration </p>
<p>Watson, who succeeded David O''Reilly as CEO on Jan. 1, is
focusing investment on oil exploration in the Gulf and West
Africa, and building liquefied natural gas facilities to handle
recent discoveries off the coast of Australia. </p>
<p>Yarrington said on the call that the company is engaged in
pure wildcatting in some exploration regions. Wildcatting is
oil-patch slang for drilling the riskiest prospects in virtually
unmapped geological formations. </p>
<p>Yarrington didn''t provide any details about the well
writedowns in Turkey and Canada. The company has a joint venture
with the Turkish state oil company, Turkiye Petrolleri AO, to
explore the Black Sea. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the biggest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday that its third-quarter net income rose 55 percent to
$7.35 billion, buoyed by a rise in oil prices. ConocoPhillips,
the third-biggest U.S. energy company, said on Oct. 27 its
third-quarter profit more than doubled. </p>
<p>Total SA reported today a 32 percent rise in profit for the
quarter. Royal Dutch Shell Plc yesterday beat analysts''
estimates and posted a 6.5 percent increase in net income. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of the
18 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve, said a
resumption of asset purchases by policy makers next week would
likely include 30-year Treasury bonds. </p>
<p>Traders have speculated that the Fed would focus on buying U.S. government debt maturing in 10 years and less as part of a
policy known as quantitative easing to sustain the economic
recovery by keeping borrowing costs low. Ten-year Treasury notes
serve as a benchmark for loans ranging from corporate debt to
mortgages. Policy makers conclude their two-day meeting Nov. 3. </p>
<p>The Fed purchased $30.3 billion of Treasuries in the 12- to
30-year maturity range as part of its $300 billion in total
Treasury purchases last year, according Fed data tracked by
Barclays Plc. The difference in yield on 10- and 30-year
securities reached a record 1.46 percentage points on Oct. 15 on
concern the flooding of cash into financial markets by the Fed
will spur inflation. </p>
<p>It''s the first time we''re hearing someone voice the
opinion publicly that the Fed''s going to have to do something
different in terms of QE, said Gary Pollack, who helps oversee
$12 billion as head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank
AG''s Private Wealth Management unit in New York. Goldman''s a
respected voice on the Street and is saying the Fed''s going to
have to go out to 30s to do something. </p>
<p>Preferred Inflation Measure </p>
<p>Yields on 30-year bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.03 percent at 9:39 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. </p>
<p>A report showing the Fed''s preferred inflation measure
added to expectations that policy makers will buy longer-term
assets. The price gauge, which is tied to consumer spending and
strips out food and energy costs, climbed at a 0.8 percent
annual pace in the third quarter, less than the 1 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and down from a 1 percent
increase the prior quarter, Commerce Department figures showed. </p>
<p>Buying 30-year bonds may cause the difference in yield
between the securities and 10-year debt to narrow,Francesco Garzarelli, a London-based analyst, wrote in an e-mailed note
today. The difference in yields was 1.40 percentage points
today, compared with a five-year average of 0.52 point,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Reinvestment Program </p>
<p>The Fed has purchased longer-term Treasuries, including
those with maturities of almost 30 years, in part of its current
program of reinvesting proceeds of maturing mortgage holdings
into Treasuries. Policy makers have bought $2.4 billion of bonds
in the 20- to 30-year maturity range in the reinvestment program
so far, according to Fed data tracked by Barclays. The Fed held
three operations since the program began in August for
Treasuries that fall in the maturity range of February 2021 to
August 2040. </p>
<p>Our view is that the Fed is likely to continue
concentrating its purchases in the belly of the curve,
said Michael Pond, co-head of U.S. rates strategy in New York at
primary dealer Barclays. But if the program is sizable enough,
it will be forced to make a decision between spreading purchases
more along the curve or harming liquidity in certain sectors. </p>
<p>The Fed may broaden its purchases this time as the likely
size of this new quantitative easing program may cause the
central bank to reach its internal guidelines of how much it can
hold of any given issue, Pond said. </p>
<p>The Fed limits itself to owning no more than 35 percent of
any specific security it holds in its System Open Market
Account, or SOMA. The Fed could increase this self-imposed limit
to approximately 50 percent, said Pond. </p>
<p>The central bank makes the securities in its portfolio
available to dealers through its daily securities lending
operation, making it unlikely that Fed purchases alone would
lead to an acute shortage of a given issue. </p>
<p>Estimates for the ultimate size of an asset-purchase
program range from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Global Research to $2 trillion at Goldman Sachs. Economists at
both firms agree the Fed will likely start by announcing $500

<p>Morgan Stanley analysts advised
investors to buy the pound against the yen, and the Swedish
krona versus the euro. </p>
<p>The recent gross domestic product data is potentially a
game-changer for the pound, Stephen Hull, head of global
currency strategy in London, wrote in a research report dated
yesterday. In a world where there isn''t much value to be found
in currencies, the krona is one of the least expensive. </p>
<p>Sterling rose 1.2 percent against the yen since Oct. 25,
the day before data showed the U.K. economy grew 0.8 percent in
the third quarter, twice as much as economists forecast. It
traded at 128.56 yen as of 7:04 a.m. in London. </p>

<p>The dollar may drop to the weakest
since December 2009 versus the euro as the Federal Reserve buys
more assets in so-called quantitative easing to stimulate
growth, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>The U.S. currency is likely to reach $1.46 per euro by
year-end and trade little changed at 81 yen, Morgan Stanley said
in a note to clients, adjusting previous estimates that the
greenback would be at $1.36 against the euro and 93 yen. The
dollar will rally in 2011, reaching $1.32 per euro and 93 yen by
year-end, the bank predicted. </p>
<p>The market has become very sensitive about talk of
further QE, and the punish the printer'' theme has started to be
a major theme in the foreign exchange market, Stephen Hull,
head of global currency strategy in London at Morgan Stanley,
wrote in a note dated yesterday. We have revised our currency
forecasts with a weaker profile for the U.S. dollar over the
forecast horizon. </p>
<p>The dollar was at $1.3891 versus the euro as of 12:30 p.m.
in Tokyo from $1.3930 in New York yesterday and fell 0.6 percent
to 80.57 yen. The currency last traded at $1.46 per euro on Dec.
15, 2009. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said it wasn''t forecasting further strength
in the yen and Australian dollar against the greenback given the
poor risk-reward profile for investors. The U.S. dollar may
decline further against the Asia-Pacific currencies in the near-
term, it said. </p>
<p>Undervalued'' Greenback </p>
<p>The Australian currency will buy 98 U.S. cents by year-end
and 85 cents by end 2011, the bank said, after trading at 97.68
cents today. </p>
<p>The greenback will enter the new year extremely
undervalued, wrote Hull, who predicts it will gain to $1.43
per euro in the second quarter and $1.32 by in the final three
months of 2011. Against the yen, the greenback will rise to 85
by June and 93 yen by year-end 2011, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>If the euro and yen strengthen significantly from here,
there may be a risk that their respective economies double-
dip, Hull wrote. </p>

<p>General Motors Co., preparing for an
initial public offering, is showing a different spirit than the
failed behemoth that preceded it: investing in small cars,
planning to hire workers and paying obligations early. </p>
<p>GM yesterday said it''s investing in a Michigan factory to
make a small Cadillac and hire 600 workers. Hours later, it said
it paid $2.8 billion to its union retiree health-care trust and
obtained $5 billion in credit that it may not need. After the
IPO, the Detroit-based automaker said it will buy back preferred
shares from the U.S. and put $6 billion in its pension plans. </p>
<p>The rapid-fire moves show how GM will operate under new
Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson after the nation''s largest
automaker purged much of its debt and lowered its fixed costs by
restructuring in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>What happened over the past 12 months was ordained by the
courts, said Maryann Keller, an auto industry consultant with
a self-named firm in Stamford, Connecticut. The measure of how
good a company GM is starts now. They have to show that they can
operate this business by cleaning the balance sheet and
investing in the business. </p>
<p>Setting up the credit line, planning to pay debt and
managing pension obligations all were either expected or prudent
financial management that will help the company as it goes
public, Keller said. </p>
<p>GM has filed its registration statement for the offering
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The U.S. shares
will begin trading by Nov. 19, people familiar with the matter
have said. </p>
<p>Repurchase Plan </p>
<p>GM will purchase the Treasury''s 83,898,305 Series A
preferred shares at $25.50 apiece on the first dividend payment
date scheduled to occur after the IPO, the department said. </p>
<p>With the repurchase, taxpayers will have received $9.5
billion in repayments, interest and dividends from GM since the
automaker emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009, the Treasury
said. The department said its total funds invested in GM include
$13.4 billion under the Bush administration and $36.1 billion
under the Obama administration. </p>
<p>The Treasury said the repurchase of the preferred shares
won''t change its stake in GM''s common stock. After the IPO, the
Treasury may hold with less than a 50 percent stake in GM''s
common equity. The company and the U.S. aim to hold an IPO of $8
billion to $10 billion, two people familiar with the plan said
this month. </p>
<p>Cash Confidence </p>
<p>GM''s commitment to reducing the obligations shows that its
cash flow must be improving, said Joe Phillippi, principal of
AutoTrends Inc., a consulting firm in Short Hills, New Jersey. </p>
<p>GM, which earned $2.6 billion in the first half, must
expect to remain profitable amid U.S. new-vehicle sales that are
running about 30 percent slower than the 16.8 million annual
average from 2000 to 2007, he said. </p>
<p>We''re still not out of the woods with this car market,
Phillippi said. If they weren''t showing strong cash flow, they
wouldn''t take the risk. </p>
<p>GM hasn''t said when it will report third-quarter results. </p>
<p>The automaker''s 8.375 percent bonds due July 2033, which
were issued by old General Motors Corp. and convert to shares in
the new GM, rose 1.375 cent on the dollar to 36.375 cents
yesterday in New York, according to Trace, the bond-pricing
service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That was
the highest end-of-day price since May 4. </p>
<p>New Models </p>
<p>The company will keep pushing out new models and investing
in factories as it works to improve its balance sheet. Since
bankruptcy, GM has put more than $3 billion into its plants,
Akerson said yesterday at a press event at a Cadillac plant in
Lansing, Michigan. The plant will build a small Cadillac
nicknamed the ATS to compete with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG''s
3-Series line. </p>
<p>GM also is introducing the small Chevrolet Cruze and the
Chevrolet Volt, which runs on gasoline and electricity. </p>
<p>Chairman Ed Whitacre, who will leave the board by the end
of the year, had added funds to the product plan and pushed the
company to develop a flagship sedan for Cadillac and to consider
new models such as small pickups and minivans. </p>
<p>GM is reviving its marketing efforts to sell the new
products. In the months leading up to bankruptcy, the automaker
ended its relationship with golfer Tiger Woods and pulled
advertising from events such as the Super Bowl and the Academy
Awards. Seoul-based Hyundai Motor Co. now is the exclusive
national sponsor of the Oscars, Joel Ewanick, GM''s vice
president of marketing and a former Hyundai executive, said at a
press event on Oct. 27. </p>
<p>Chevy Campaign </p>
<p>Ewanick started a campaign for Chevrolet with an ad that
ran during baseball''s World Series on Oct. 27 to show the
brand''s historic position in American culture. The campaign
features young women taking babies home from the hospital in
Chevy cars and people loading their dogs into Chevy trucks. </p>
<p>Ewanick said GM will spend slightly more on advertising
next year than the $2.5 billion the company spent in 2008. </p>
<p>Chevrolet will advertise during the Super Bowl, and
Cadillac is considering marketing during television events like
the Golden Globe awards. GM has also advertised during the MTV
Video Music Awards and Country Music Awards. </p>
<p>This is where America gathers to watch TV, Ewanick
said. It''s the best way to start a courtship with a brand that
some of them have forgotten. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is losing
its edge in fixed-income trading, the firm''s biggest business
and the one that led to record earnings last year. </p>
<p>The company''s share of fixed-income trading revenue at
eight of the largest U.S. and European banks slipped to 19
percent in the third quarter from a peak of 29 percent in the
last three months of 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gap between industry leader Goldman Sachs and its
nearest rival narrowed to $239 million in the quarter, the
smallest amount since confidence in credit markets collapsed. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, who once
ran the fixed-income unit, hasn''t made any public statement
indicating concern that Goldman Sachs''s dominance slipped as
client trading fell and the bank cut the risk it''s taking while
competitors ramped up their efforts. The company benefited
during and immediately after the financial crisis by being in a
stronger position than rivals, said Roger Freeman, an analyst at
Barclays Capital in New York. </p>
<p>They gained a ton of market share, Freeman said. As
firms that made it got back on their feet over the course of
last year, the competitive environment picked up and that took
some of that advantage away. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs generated $3.77 billion from trading bonds,
currencies, commodities, interest-rate products and credit
derivatives in the third quarter, the lowest amount since 2008.
That was $1.46 billion more than the average of the other seven
banks, the smallest lead since the second quarter of 2007. </p>
<p>Value-at-Risk </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading accounted for 52 percent of the New
York-based company''s $45.2 billion in net revenue last year.
This year, it has comprised 51 percent. That compares with 25
percent at Morgan Stanley, 23 percent at Zurich-based Credit
Suisse Group AG and 13 percent at Bank of America Corp., the
largest U.S. bank by assets. Goldman Sachs''s revenue for the
first nine months of the year was $30.5 billion, down 14 percent
from the same period in 2009. </p>
<p>The bank''s value-at-risk, or VaR, a measure of how much it
could lose in the markets on a single day, slid to $121 million
in the third quarter, the lowest since 2006, falling 42 percent
from a year earlier. It reached record levels in the first half
of 2009, hitting $245 million in the second quarter. </p>
<p>VaR at Credit Suisse, whose CEO said he expects client
trading to pick up in coming quarters, climbed 31 percent to 118
million Swiss francs ($119.3 million) over the last 12 months.
It increased 4 percent to $142 million at New York-based Morgan
Stanley, which has hired about 400 people in its sales and
trading unit over the past 15 months. </p>
