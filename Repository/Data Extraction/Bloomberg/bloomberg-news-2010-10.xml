&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. named Playdom Chief
Executive Officer John Pleasants and James Pitaro, head of
Yahoo! Inc.&#8217;s media unit, co-presidents of the interactive media
group, revamping digital operations to reverse losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair replace Steve Wadsworth, a 17-year Disney division
head who left in September, the company said today in a
statement. Pleasants and Pitaro, who start Oct. 18, will oversee
the unit focused on the digital-games market and selling online
sites based on Disney&#8217;s TV shows, movies and characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointments will allow Disney, world&#8217;s largest media
company, to build upon the digital assets acquired in the past
three years, Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said. The
interactive business lost $130 million through the first nine
months of the year, making it the only unprofitable division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this as a growth area and we need people
experienced in how to best operate them,&#8221; Iger, 59, said in an
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 24 cents to
$33.34 on Oct. 1. The shares have gained 22 percent during the
past year, compared with an 11 percent increase for the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Disney bought children&#8217;s social network Club
Penguin for $350 million, following that this July with social-
gaming site Playdom, paying $563 million. The company also has
bought Wideload Games and mobile-content site Tapulous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger said he intends to allow the two men &#8220;freedom&#8221; to
run the units, and Pleasants will keep working from Playdom&#8217;s
office in Palo Alto, California. Iger described the arrangement
as similar to Disney&#8217;s acquisition of Pixar, which operates
mostly independently of Disney&#8217;s film studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasants, a former CEO at Ticketmaster, will oversee
Playdom, Disney&#8217;s Club Penguin, the World of Cars virtual unit
and Tapulous. Pitaro will run Disney.com, Family.com, and its
social-media marketing agency DigiSynd. At Yahoo, Pitaro
expanded Yahoo! Sports and upgraded its news, finance,
entertainment and lifestyle coverage, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. named John Pleasants
and James Pitaro co-presidents of its Disney Interactive Media
Group, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two will run the media company&#8217;s digital games
businesses, including online, console and mobile versions, as
well as Disney&#8217;s branded and social media Web sites, the company
said in a Business Wire statement. &lt;/p&gt;

people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs waived its 1 million-pound ($1.6 million)

an exodus of senior personnel, the newspaper said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) --ExxonMobil Chemical Co.&#8217;s plant in
Beaumont, Texas released benzene, xylene, toluene, ethylene and
nitrogen oxide, according to a filing made to the U.S. National
Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total amount of material released was 3,110 pounds,
which was from a flare stack as part of planned maintenance,
after which the facility shut down, according to the report. The
incident took place at 09:50 a.m. local time on Oct. 1, the
report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the NRC if they release

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By David Voreacos and Sonny Rhodes" date="Oct 04, 2010  8:36 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-04/pfizer-s-wyeth-unit-hid-prempro-s-breast-cancer-risks-lawyer-tells-jurors.html"><headline>Pfizer Unit Hid Prempro&#8217;s Health Risks, Lawyer Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer Inc. unit failed to properly
warn doctors and consumers that its Prempro menopause drug could
cause breast cancer, a lawyer for an Arkansas woman who
developed the disease told jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth subsidiary knew women like
Margaret Wilson were at risk for the disease by taking the
hormone-replacement drug and kept quiet to pump up sales, Chris
Kirchmer, a lawyer for Wilson, told a federal court jury in
Little Rock, Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After studies showed the risks of Prempro, &#8220;they never
once changed their warnings,&#8221; Kirchmer said today in opening
statements in the trial of Wilson&#8217;s lawsuit over the drug. &#8220;The
evidence will show you that they did not act responsibly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative, a National Institutes of
Health-sponsored study, concluded they posed an increased risk
of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety Label &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth officials contend they provided adequate warnings
about Prempro&#8217;s cancer risks on the drug&#8217;s safety label.
Wilson&#8217;s lawyers won&#8217;t be able to show the pills caused her
cancer, said Lyn Pruitt, a lawyer for the company, in her
opening statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mrs. Wilson would have gotten breast cancer whether she
took Prempro or not,&#8221; said Pruitt of Mitchell Williams Selig
Gates  Woodyard in Little Rock. &#8220;Prempro didn&#8217;t cause it and
nobody knows what caused it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pruitt said Wilson had other possible risk factors for
cancer. They included her age, weight and menopause as well as
having a daughter who died of breast cancer, Pruitt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth has lost seven of the 12 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. The drugmaker got some of
those verdicts thrown out after trial or had the awards reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, according to court filings. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson, a 68-year-old bank teller from Trumann, Arkansas,
took the drug for six years before being diagnosed with breast
cancer in 2002, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Corporate Responsibility&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a case about the breast cancer that they caused,&#8221;
Kirchmer said. &#8220;It is a case about corporate responsibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first witness, Donald Austin, an epidemiologist from
the University of Oregon, testified that Prempro causes breast
cancer. He said that after the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative study, use of Prempro dropped &#8220;precipitously&#8221;
because of concerns over breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth attorney David Dukes asked Austin whether the &#8220;vast
majority&#8221; of women taking hormone replacement therapy drugs
don&#8217;t get breast cancer. Austin replied that they didn&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin also acknowledged there are other risk factors for
breast cancer, including age, obesity, breast density and having
a &#8220;first-degree relative,&#8221; such as a daughter, who had breast
cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8,000 Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Wilson, who is presiding over
the case, is overseeing more than 8,000 cases over the drugs
that have been consolidated in his court for pre-trial
information exchanges and some early trials. The plaintiff in
the current trial isn&#8217;t related to the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth officials have faced repeated criticism over the
marketing of their menopause drugs, including allegations that
the company paid for ghostwritten articles in medical journals
that overstated the effectiveness of the medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wilson v. Wyeth, MDL 03-cv-1507-WRW, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas (Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. reached
a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department that will let
merchants reward consumers for paying with lower-cost credit or
debit cards, while American Express Co. vowed to fight a
government antitrust lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s settlement means that about 4 million merchants
across the U.S. that accept just Visa and MasterCard are now
free to steer customers to different credit cards or forms of
payment by offering discounts, rebates or other special
treatment, the Justice Department said. Six million more
retailers who also accept cards from American Express are still
subject to restrictions until the lawsuit is resolved, the
Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to put money in consumers&#8217; pockets,&#8221; said
Attorney General Eric Holder at a press conference. &#8220;By
eliminating credit-card companies&#8217; anticompetitive rules, we
will accomplish that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restraints on retailers by the payment networks &#8220;impose a
competitive straightjacket on merchants, restricting decisions
by them to offer discounts, benefits and choices to customers
that many merchants would otherwise be free to offer,&#8221; the
Justice Department said in its lawsuit against the three credit-
card networks. It was filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freedom of merchants to offer incentives to customers
for alternative forms of payment, including no-frills cards that
are cheaper for merchants to accept, had been prohibited by the
card networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Monetary Obligation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, based in San Francisco, and Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard won&#8217;t be required to make any payments as part of the
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney, head of the
Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division, said the case won&#8217;t be
over as long as the lawsuit is pending against New York-based
AmEx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American Express&#8217;s rules are the most restrictive,&#8221; she
said, standing alongside Holder. They &#8220;restrain trade
unnecessarily.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no intention of settling the case,&#8221; American
Express Chief Executive Officer Kenneth I. Chenault said in a
statement. &#8220;We will defend the rights of our card members at
the point of sale and our own ability to negotiate freely with
merchants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggle for U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Boies, an attorney for American Express, said the
Justice Department will struggle to make a case that the
company, which processes less than 25 percent of U.S. credit-
card spending, has enough power to force retailers into
agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement with Visa and Mastercard will have the
ironic effect of making the market less competitive, he said.
Under the agreement, Visa and Mastercard &#8220;can pay merchants to
discriminate against American Express customers,&#8221; Boies said in
a Bloomberg TV interview. &#8220;That&#8217;s bad economics. That&#8217;s bad
antitrust law, and it&#8217;s bad for consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail and consumer groups including the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, the National Federation of Retailers
and the Retail Industry Leaders Association said the settlement
is a long-awaited victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Merchants, small and large, welcome today&#8217;s news,&#8221; said
John Emling, senior vice president of government affairs for the
Retail Industry Leaders Association, in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Credit and debit networks operate within a broken market where
a few dominant firms set fees and dictate terms with impunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Swipe&#8217; Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department probe also focused on interchange,
or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, charged to merchants on each transaction.
Visa and MasterCard set the fees, which exceed $40 billion a
year, and pass that money along to card-issuing banks to
compensate them for the risk of lending money, the cost of
processing the payments and to help fund rewards programs.
Richer rewards programs typically carry higher interchange
rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When merchants do agree to accept American Express, they
promise not to bait and switch by taking advantage of American
Express&#8217;s investments in attracting desirable card members and
then steering those customers to use cards from another
network,&#8221; AmEx Vice Chairman Edward P. Gilligan said in a
conference call with reporters and analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Bankers Association said it wants to see
whether the settlement with Visa and MasterCard will result in
lower costs for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing Authority &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to seeing whether their new-found pricing
authority will actually result in consumer benefit or merely be
used to pad their own bottom lines,&#8221; said Kenneth J. Clayton,
senior vice president and general counsel for card policy in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express, in vowing to fight the lawsuit, called it
&#8220;a significant retreat&#8221; from previous Justice Department
efforts to promote competition in the payments industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the Department of Justice will have a very tough
case,&#8221; said Janet McDavid, a partner with Hogan Lovells US LLP
in Washington, D.C., who represented American Express in a
separate case against Visa and MasterCard. &#8220;Amex doesn&#8217;t have
the market power of Visa and MasterCard; it&#8217;s not a &#8216;must-carry&#8217;
card. Balancing its justifications against the rules will be key
to the analysis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express fell $2.73, or 6.5 percent, the most since
Jan. 22, to $39.05 at 6:40 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading and was the day&#8217;s worst performer in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. MasterCard dropped $2.14, or 0.95
percent, to $222.64 after falling as much as 2.6 percent
earlier.  Visa slipped 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $73.24 after
declining as much as 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.
is starting an online video game that simulates business and
city problems and provides different technologies to solve them,
aiming to boost sales of services and software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users choose from four sectors -- banking, retail, water or
energy -- and solve related problems, such as monitoring a
city&#8217;s water quality or power supply. Users can download the
game, called CityOne, for free starting today, Nancy Pearson, a
vice president in IBM&#8217;s software business, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game, which lets users pick different technology
options and compare results, may increase awareness and sales of
new services at IBM, Pearson said. IBM has been investing in
technology for its Smarter Planet program, the idea that
anything from buildings to utility grids can be digitally
measured to be more efficient. Such technology will generate
about $10 billion in sales by 2015, Armonk, New York-based IBM
said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a way to engage people who may not have thought
of IBM before in this way,&#8221; Pearson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 7,000 people have signed up to download the game,
including members of universities, governments and businesses,
she said. Users will be able to chat via the Internet with IBM
representatives if they have questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banking and retail paths of the game will present more
business-related problems, such as boosting risk management,
Pearson said. The company plans to add more sectors and
scenarios to the game, Pearson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 39 cents to $135.25 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 3.3 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Ernst
 Young LLP are under investigation by Britain&#8217;s accounting
regulator over their reports on customers&#8217; compliance with U.K.
rules to protect client money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probes are focused on PwC&#8217;s work for JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s London unit and Ernst  Young&#8217;s reports for Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s U.K.-based European unit, the Financial
Reporting Council said in statements on its website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports in question covered Lehman&#8217;s and JPMorgan&#8217;s
observance of the Financial Services Authority&#8217;s client-asset
rules, known as CASS, which are intended to segregate customer
assets from those of the company to protect them during
liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe is &#8220;part of an industry wide consultation,&#8221;
Ernst  Young spokeswoman Sarah Jurado said in a statement. &#8220;We
will cooperate fully with the investigation.&#8221; PwC spokesman
Brian Bannister said in a statement his firm is also fully
cooperating with regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA in June fined JPMorgan&#8217;s London unit a record
33.3 million pounds ($52.8 million) for not properly separating
client money from the firm&#8217;s accounts. Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy,
which roiled financial markets worldwide in 2008, resulted in
more than $1 trillion in claims and efforts by regulators
worldwide to unravel how money moved through its global units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FRC today said the probes will cover Ernst  Young&#8217;s
Lehman reports for the year ended Nov. 30, 2007, and PwC&#8217;s
JPMorgan reports from 2001 to 2008. Independent tribunals will
hold hearings on the separate investigations, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping Money Separate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the JPMorgan case, an average of $8.6 billion wasn&#8217;t
properly segregated by JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in an error that
went undetected for seven years, the FSA said at the time. As
much as $23 billion of client money held by the bank&#8217;s futures
and options business wasn&#8217;t put in separate overnight customer
accounts between 2002 and 2009, the watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ernst  Young probe is separate from the FRC
investigation announced in June that covers the firm&#8217;s auditing
of Lehman transactions known as Repo 105s. Those deals helped
New York-based Lehman downplay its leverage in late 2007 and
2008, according to a 2,200-page report. The report filed in
March by bankruptcy examiner Anton Valukas said Ernst  Young
could be accused of &#8220;professional malpractice&#8221; for its role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008 after mounting losses on mortgage-backed
securities spooked investors and creditors. The Wall Street
investment bank&#8217;s failure helped trigger a freeze of global
credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. reached
a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department to resolve a two-
year antitrust investigation over restrictions on merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement was filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New
York, today as the Justice Department filed charges against
Visa, MasterCard and American Express Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express spokesman Michael O&#8217;Neill said his company
would fight the charges. &#8220;We do not intend to settle,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. probe focused on rules that bar merchants from
charging extra to customers who use credit cards and steering
them to competing cards, and that require retailers to accept
every type of card banks issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Eric Holder announced he will hold a news
conference today in Washington at 2 p.m. to announce
developments in what the Justice Department described as an

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department sued
Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and American Express Co. in a two-
year antitrust investigation over restrictions on merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Eric Holder announced he will hold a news
conference today in Washington at 2 p.m. to announce
developments in what the Justice Department described as an
antitrust case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express spokesman Michael O&#8217;Neill said his company
would fight the charges. &#8220;We do not intend to settle,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, people familiar with the matter said the Justice
Department was weighing a lawsuit with the expectation
that Purchase, New York-based MasterCard and Visa would settle
while AmEx fights it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa spokesman Will Valentine and MasterCard&#8217;s Jim Issokson
had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. probe focused on rules that bar merchants from
charging extra to customers who use credit cards and steering
them to competing cards, and require retailers to accept every
type of card banks issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock mutual funds are having their
worst year since 1998 in matching their benchmarks, as higher
correlation among shares makes it harder to pick stocks in a
&#8220;whipsawing&#8221; market, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 2,920 funds tracked by the brokerage, 27 percent
underperformed their benchmarks by more than 5 percentage points
this year, the most since the 35 percent recorded in 1998. Only
7 percent of the funds beat the market by the same margin, the
lowest level in 15 years, JPMorgan data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;2010 has been a &#8216;whipsaw&#8217; moving in a wide range and, as
a result, active managers are badly trailing their indices,&#8221;
JPMorgan Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Thomas J. Lee wrote in the
report last week. &#8220;Trending markets tend to be better for
active managers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings grew at the fastest rate since 1988 this year even
as the economy showed signs of faltering. Making it harder to
pick investments, stocks moved in lockstep more than in at least
two years. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rallied as much as
9.2 percent from its Dec. 31 close and dropped as much as 8.3
percent this year. The average correlation of SP 500 stocks
climbed to 81.09 on Aug. 24, the highest level since Bloomberg
began tracking the CBOE SP 500 Implied Correlation Index in
November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trailing funds are likely to increase holdings in
companies that move the most relative to the benchmark, known as
high-beta stocks, to boost performance, Lee said. Investors
therefore should buy companies tied to economic growth such as
industrials, he said. Included on his list of high-beta cyclical
stocks are Whirlpool Corp. (WHR), Deere  Co. (DE) and Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts cut
Microsoft Corp. shares to &#8220;neutral,&#8221; citing the world&#8217;s
largest software company&#8217;s struggles to gain market share in
mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was removed from the bank&#8217;s Americas Buy List,
with a price target of $28 rather than $32, Goldman Sachs
analysts including Sarah Friar wrote in a note to clients. The
company needs to win &#8220;a firmer foothold in the growing
migration to mobile devices&#8221; in order to improve investor
sentiment, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has struggled to match mobile offerings from
rivals including Apple Inc. and Google Inc., whose Android
software powers high-end phones and tablet computers. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft has yet to release a tablet computer
to compete with Apple&#8217;s iPad, 3 million of which were sold in
the first 80 days of its release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rebound by Microsoft is unlikely this year since
&#8220;Apple&#8217;s iPad and iPhone plus Google&#8217;s Android operating system
are well established,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may also be held back by corporate clients
replacing computers more slowly because of budget pressures, and
&#8220;cannibalization&#8221; of laptop computer sales in favor of
tablets, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 48 cents, or 2 percent, to $23.90 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading at 9:35 a.m. New York time. The stock had
lost 20 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets and deposits, delayed foreclosures after a
federal regulator called for a review because lenders may have
submitted defective documents when repossessing homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America will investigate all affidavits in cases
that have not yet gone to judgment in 23 states where courts
have jurisdiction over home seizures, Dan Frahm, a spokesman for
the bank, said Oct. 1. He estimated &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of
documents will be studied and the process will take from
&#8220;several days to a couple of weeks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court documents showed JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Ally
Financial Inc. employees may have submitted affidavits without
confirming their accuracy. Federal lawmakers and state officials
have said such practices could amount to fraud. JPMorgan said it
will ask judges to postpone foreclosure rulings, while Detroit-
based Ally said Sept. 21 its GMAC Mortgage unit would halt
evictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s freeze &#8220;hopefully will give peace of
mind to those monitoring the industry that we&#8217;ve used an
abundance of caution that those foreclosures in process are
handled correctly,&#8221; Frahm said in an interview. The Charlotte,
North Carolina-based bank isn&#8217;t acknowledging that its
associates made errors, Frahm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The extent of the problem is enormous,&#8221; said Max Gardner,
a Shelby, North Carolina, attorney representing borrowers
alleging improper servicing practices by banks. &#8220;We have a
problem in the housing market right now, given the inability to
sell properties and declining property values, but the economic
downside from this problem is even more monumental.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting Comptroller of the Currency John Walsh last week
asked the nation&#8217;s seven biggest lenders to review foreclosures
for defective documents, spokesman Bryan Hubbard said. Attorneys
general in at least six states are investigating claims that
home lenders and loan servicers took shortcuts to speed
foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home foreclosures in Connecticut should be frozen for 60
days because of &#8220;defective&#8221; documents, Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal said in a request to the state Judicial
Department. In California, Attorney General Jerry Brown said
JPMorgan should be asked to prove its home foreclosures are
legal, and must stop the practice if it can&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airgas Trial on Air Products Bid to Focus on Annual Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airgas Inc., trying to fend off a $5.5 billion hostile bid
from Air Products  Chemicals Inc., may face an uphill fight at
trial this week when it challenges a new bylaw that moves up the
date of its annual meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers of Airgas are asking Delaware Chancery Court Judge
William B. Chandler III in Georgetown to invalidate the bylaw,
which shareholders approved in a Sept. 15 vote that added three
Air Products nominees to the Airgas board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Products wants its nominees to take control of the 10-
member Airgas board at the next annual meeting, set for Jan. 18,
and accept the takeover offer of $65.50 a share. Airgas
officials have repeatedly rejected bids from Allentown,
Pennsylvania-based Air Products, the second-biggest U.S.
industrial-gases producer behind Praxair Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Airgas is in a tough position,&#8221; Paul Regan, a professor
at Widener University Law School in Wilmington, who teaches
courses on merger-and-acquisition law, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s well-established that shareholders can vote to
amend bylaws, and I don&#8217;t think Delaware law requires a 12-month
wait between annual meetings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the week-long trial set to start today in
Georgetown, lawyers for Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Airgas will
argue that the bylaw wasn&#8217;t approved by a two-thirds majority of
investors and forces the company to hold the equivalent of two
annual meetings within a four-month period, according to court
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Products sued Airgas on Feb. 4, saying it violated
legal duties to shareholders by rebuffing the buyout offers.
Airgas filed a separate suit challenging the meeting-date bylaw
after the Sept. 15 shareholder vote. Chandler has agreed to hear
all arguments in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Products offered the amendment and a slate of
candidates for Airgas&#8217;s board as part of its takeover effort.
Under Airgas&#8217;s staggered board system, only a limited number of
directors are up for election at any time, making proxy fights
for control more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bylaw to change the meeting date won 52 percent of
votes cast and 46 percent of shares eligible to vote, according
to Airgas. Shareholders also voted to oust three directors,
including Peter McCausland, the company&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Chandler finds the bylaw passes muster, it could have
implications for other companies that use the staggered-board
defense, Robert Daines, who teaches corporate law at Stanford
University Law School in California, said in a telephone
interview. About 40 percent of public companies have staggered
boards, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruling against Airgas &#8220;could signal an important shift
in merger tactics and change the balance of power between
management and shareholders,&#8221; said Daines, the director of
Stanford&#8217;s Rock Center for Corporate Governance. &#8220;This could
really curtail management&#8217;s powers to discourage bids.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Air Products  Chemicals Inc. v. Airgas Inc.,
5249, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington); and Airgas Inc. v.
Air Products  Chemicals Inc., 5817, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerviel Faces Less Jail Time Than Madoff If Convicted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jerome Kerviel is convicted this week of causing Societe
Generale SA&#8217;s 4.9 billion-euro ($6.5 billion) loss, he won&#8217;t
face the kind of sentences given to financial felons such as
Bernard Madoff -- or even Nick Leeson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French prosecutors are seeking a four-year sentence and, if
convicted, he is unlikely to serve more than two years in jail,
lawyers said. The sentencing rules in France contrast with those
in the U.S. and U.K. where authorities are increasingly trying
to make examples of white-collar criminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel, 33, &#8220;would face a substantial amount of jail
time&#8221; in the U.S., said Ira Sorkin, the lawyer who represented
Madoff last year when the con man was sentenced to 150 years in
prison for running a Ponzi scheme that cost investors $20
billion. &#8220;The amount of money involved would kick this up. Ten
to 20 years would not shock anyone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel&#8217;s unauthorized bets on futures, hidden with faked
hedges to minimize the apparent risk, reached 50 billion euros
before Societe Generale realized what the trader was doing and
began unwinding his positions. At his June trial, Kerviel
admitted to lying to his colleagues and exceeding his trading
limits, but argued that his superiors were aware of his actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Dominique Pauthe, who led the three-judge panel at
the trial in Paris, will announce the verdict and any sentence
on Oct. 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potash Suit to Stop Takeover Should Be Thrown Out, BHP Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.&#8217;s lawsuit seeking to
block a $40 billion hostile takeover by BHP Billiton Ltd. should
be thrown out, the Australian company told a U.S. judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit accusing BHP executives of making misleading
statements to drive down Potash&#8217;s stock is without merit and
should be dismissed, lawyers for Melbourne-based BHP said in a
filing Oct. 1 in a federal court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash &#8220;has failed to identify any misleading statement or
material omission by defendants, let alone meeting its burden of
pleading particularized facts&#8221; showing an intent to deceive,
BHP said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest maker of fertilizer, Saskatoon-based
Potash filed the suit on Sept. 22, one month after BHP announced
its intent to acquire the company for $130 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash said in its complaint that it filed the case in
Chicago because BHP Chief Executive Officer Marius Kloppers
conveyed the buyout offer to Potash CEO Bill Doyle within the
court&#8217;s jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash, in separately filed papers, asked U.S. District
Judge David H. Coar on Sept. 22 to issue an order blocking BHP
from moving forward on bid until it issues &#8220;corrective&#8221;
disclosures and gives Potash shareholders 60 days to review
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Moser, an outside spokeswoman for Potash, declined to
comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The target company has every right to dispute the
relevant (or not so relevant) facts with the bidder,&#8221; BHP&#8217;s
attorneys said in its filing. &#8220;But in the end, once both sides&#8217;
positions are in the public domain, it is up to the
shareholders, rather than the court, to resolve the dispute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. v. BHP
Billiton Ltd., 10-cv-06024, U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great-West Must Repay C$456 Million, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great-West Lifeco Inc. must repay London Life Insurance Co.
policyholders C$456 million ($447 million) for illegally using
money in their accounts to help pay for a 1997 takeover, an
Ontario judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimony during a three-month trial that ended in January
in London, Ontario, showed London Life used C$220 million of the
policyholders&#8217; funds to help Great-West make the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants have done indirectly what was prohibited
from being done directly,&#8221; by transferring money from the
account holders&#8217; accounts, Ontario Superior Court Judge Johanne
Morissette wrote in an 83-page ruling Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former London Life actuaries and a Great-West
policyholder sued on behalf of 1.8 million people, accusing the
companies of illegally using the money to help pay for the C$2.9
billion acquisition. They sought as much as C$1 billion in
damages, including repayment of their money with interest and
penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great-West said in a statement that it intended to appeal
the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Regardless of the ultimate outcome of this case, all of
the participating policy contract terms and conditions will
continue to be honored,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge rejected a claim that Great-West illegally
enriched itself with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great-West and its parent company, Power Financial Corp.,
were set on &#8220;maximizing profits at the expense of
policyholders,&#8221; Paul Bates, the policyholders&#8217; lawyer, said
during the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had argued the transaction was legal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Between James Jeffery and London Life
Insurance Co., SC46300, Ontario Superior Court of Justice
(London, Ontario). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vila Can Dissolve Company That Has Rights to His Name &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Vila, former host of the &#8220;This Old House&#8221; home-
improvement show, can dissolve a company that holds rights to
his name and image, a Delaware judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vila, who spent 28 years offering home-improvement tips
over the air before his syndicated series was canceled in 2008,
told Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine Jr. in Wilmington at a June
trial that he wanted to break up the holding company that
controls his likeness, BVwebties LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He disagreed with his partner&#8217;s business approach, he said.
Vila and George Hill co-managed the company for a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men&#8217;s agreement &#8220;contemplates that a member or manager
may seek judicial resolution,&#8221; Strine said Oct. 1 in a 34-page
ruling. &#8220;This is what Vila has done, and he has succeeded in
proving that dissolution is warranted,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company operates the BobVila.com website, which offers
a home-improvement blog and a real-estate search engine. Since
2007, Hill has stymied efforts to hire professional managers to
help the website grow, Vila said in his January 2009 lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strine said he will appoint Martin Mand as liquidating
trustee and have Mand retain as his counsel James Holzman of
Prickett Jones  Elliott PA, court papers show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge dismissed Hill&#8217;s counterclaims for breach of the
agreement and breach of his fiduciary duty to Vila. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Vila v. BVwebties LLC, 4308, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cogent Defends 3M Sale, Says NEC Offer Not Firm Enough &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cogent Inc., the fingerprint-identification systems maker,
defended its decision to sell out to 3M Co. and asked a judge to
reject calls from Cogent shareholders to put the deal on hold in
favor of a higher bid from NEC Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bid from NEC, Japan&#8217;s largest maker of personal
computers, was too late, was not firm enough and would pose
antitrust risks, Cogent&#8217;s attorney Donald J. Wolfe said Oct. 1
in a Chancery Court hearing in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors asked Chancery Court Judge Donald F. Parsons
to halt the 3M sale and require Cogent to eliminate the deal
protections they say are precluding a firm offer from NEC.
Parsons said he will rule before 3M&#8217;s offer expires at midnight,
Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cogent&#8217;s board rejected NEC&#8217;s offer of more than $1 billion
because it was not a binding bid, Wolfe said. Cogent told NEC
that &#8220;it was now or never&#8221; because 3M&#8217;s offer was definitive
and had a deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor attorney, Michael Hanrahan, accused Cogent&#8217;s
founder and chief executive officer, Ming Hsieh, of pushing the
board to accept 3M&#8217;s lower offer of $10.50 a share, or $943
million, partly because he wanted to collect a $153,000
retention bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That argument makes no sense because under an NEC sale,
Hsieh would collect $18 million more for the shares he owns,
Wolfe said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Cogent Inc. Shareholders Litigation,
Consolidated CA 5780-VCP, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure Errors May Cloud Ownership of U.S. Homes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. courts are clogged with a record number of
foreclosures. Next, they may be jammed with suits contesting
property rights as procedural mistakes in the foreclosure cases
cloud title establishing ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defective documentation has created millions of blighted
titles that will plague the nation for the next decade,&#8221; said
Richard Kessler, an attorney in Sarasota, Florida, who conducted
a study in Sarasota county that found errors in about three-
fourths of court filings related to home repossessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general in at least six states are investigating
borrowers&#8217; claims that some of the nation&#8217;s largest home lenders
and loan servicers are making misstatements in foreclosures.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. is asking judges to postpone foreclosure
rulings, while Ally Financial Inc. said Sept. 21 its GMAC
Mortgage unit would halt evictions. The companies said employees
may have completed affidavits without confirming their accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such mistakes may allow former owners to challenge the
repossession of homes long after the properties are resold,
according to Kessler. Ownership questions may not arise until a
home is under contract and the potential purchaser applies for
title insurance or even decades later as one deed researcher
catches errors overlooked by another. A so-called defective
title means the person who paid for and moved into a house may
not be the legal owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a nightmare scenario,&#8221; said John Vogel, a professor
at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in Hanover,
New Hampshire. &#8220;There are lots of land mines related to title
issues that may come to light long after we think we&#8217;ve solved
the housing problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost one-fourth of U.S. home sales in the second quarter
involved properties in some stage of mortgage distress,
according to RealtyTrac Inc. In August, lenders took possession
of record 95,364 homes and issued foreclosure filings to 338,836
homeowners, or one out of every 381 U.S. households, according
to the Irvine, California-based data seller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I were in the title industry, or a mortgage holder, or
someone who bought a foreclosed property, this is something I
would be very worried about,&#8221; said Michael Carliner, a Potomac,
Maryland-based economic consultant specializing in housing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title insurers use their records and public documents to
verify a seller is the home&#8217;s true owner and that the property
is free from liens. They collect a one-time premium and pay
costs that may arise if someone challenges a new owner&#8217;s right
to the property. To obtain a mortgage, buyers are required to
purchase a policy to protect the lender. Many people also get a
so-called owners policy to protect themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Title is everything,&#8221; said Susan Wachter, a real estate
professor at the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Wharton School in
Philadelphia. &#8220;There&#8217;s no collateral without possession, and
that is title.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tessera Claims Sony, Renesas Infringe on Chip-Package Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tessera Technologies Inc., a designer of packaging for
computer chips, said it sued Sony Corp.&#8217;s electronics unit and
Renesas Electronics Corp. in an effort to obtain more patent
royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit accuses Sony and Renesas of infringing a patent
related to a way of making the packaging that goes around
silicon wafers so they can be used reliably in smaller
electronics, Tessera said in a statement. The company said it
filed the complaint Oct. 1 in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tessera Chief Executive Officer Hank Nothhaft has called
the company&#8217;s patent litigation a &#8220;strategic&#8221; effort to reach
licensing agreements after negotiations fail. The San Jose,
California-based company got almost all of its $299.4 million in
revenue last year from royalty and licensing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony, based in Tokyo, makes Bravia TVs, the PlayStation 3
game console, Vaio notebook computers and Blu-ray disc players.
A Sony spokesperson didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking
comment. Renesas, also based in Tokyo, makes chips that control
products including DVD players and vehicle air bags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent, issued in 2005, is different than ones asserted
against companies including mobile-phone chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.
and memory-chip maker Nanya Technology Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tessera lost a case before the U.S. International Trade
Commission against memory-chip companies including Nanya, Acer
Inc., Elpida Memory Inc. and ProMos Technologies Inc. It won a
case against Qualcomm, Motorola Inc. and four other companies
over chips used in wireless devices. Motorola later took a
license to the Tessera patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the memory-chip and wireless-chip cases are on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Jackson&#8217;s Estate Sued by Bahrain Loan Adviser &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bahrain financial adviser that claims it helped Michael
Jackson obtain $320 million in loans in 2005 has sued the
singer&#8217;s estate for $1.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson hired AQ Consulting WLL to help refinance $300
million Jackson owed to Fortress Investment Group LLC, AQ
claimed in a complaint in federal court in New York on Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AQ said it secured a commitment from Citigroup Inc. to
refinance the debt. Fortress, which had a right of last offer
with Jackson, then agreed to refinance the loans itself. AQ got
Jackson an additional $20 million in loans, it claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to AQ, Jackson agreed to pay the firm 1 percent
of the total refinancing, or $3.2 million. He paid $2 million at
the time of closing and agreed to pay the rest from future
earnings, the financial adviser said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson died in 2009 at 50, leaving about $500 million in
debt. Since his death, the estate, the owner of interests in
songs by the Beatles and other artists, has generated more than
$250 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Branca, one of the executors of Jackson&#8217;s estate,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment
on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is AQ Consulting WLL v. Branca, 1:10-cv-7496, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Files Patent-Infringement Action Against Motorola &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said it filed patent-infringement claims
against Motorola Inc. over smartphones that run on Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it filed a complaint Oct. 1 with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington, which could result
in a ban of U.S. imports of Motorola phones. A companion lawsuit
was filed in federal court in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which makes the Windows Mobile operating system
for phones, in April signed a licensing agreement with HTC Corp.
and said that it was demanding royalties from other makers of
phones that run on the Android system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine patents in the complaints relate to &#8220;a range of
functionality embodied in Motorola&#8217;s Android smartphone devices
that are essential to the smartphone user experience,&#8221; Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said in a statement. They include
synchronizing e-mail, calendars and contacts, scheduling
meetings, and notifying applications of changes in signal
strength and battery power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonengeneral Sekiyu K.K., a unit of
Exxon Mobil Corp., fell to its lowest level in more than seven
years in Tokyo trading after Exxon said it may sell part of its
Japanese gasoline retailing operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares declined 6.3 percent to 711 yen, the lowest
since March 2003. The benchmark Topix index was down 0.9
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is considering selling some of its retailing
operations on the southwestern island of Kyushu, the company
said on Oct. 2 on its website. It issued the statement after
reports of it was considering selling some Japanese assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikkei English News on Oct. 2 reported Exxon Mobil, which
has 400 gasoline stations in Kyushu, may also sell other retail
operations in western Japan, where it has a total of about 1,600
stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is also considering closing some refineries to
reduce capacity by about 20 percent, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell bearish
VeriSign Inc. options because the share price of the biggest
operator of computers that direct Internet traffic is supported
by its stock buyback program, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Amyn Bharwani, Marko Kolanovic and Adam Rudd recommended selling VeriSign&#8217;s $30 put
options expiring in December. The stock rose 2.5 percent to
$32.57 at 4 p.m. in New York. Selling a put is a bet that the
stock will remain above the strike price, allowing the seller to
keep the premium paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty rates VeriSign
&#8220;overweight&#8221; and says the risk of a decline in the shares is
limited by the company&#8217;s share repurchase program, the New York-
based strategists wrote in a report yesterday. VeriSign has an
authorization to buy back $1.5 billion of its own stock after
repurchasing 8.1 million shares for $227 million in the second
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Share repurchase remains front and center,&#8221; Auty wrote
in a note to investors on Sept. 28. &#8220;We like the strategy as it
makes us feel like the downside is somewhat protected by a large
buyer (Verisign) while leaving the potential for a lot of upside
to our target as things continue to get better from a growth and
margin standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has about $3 billion in cash, according to
JPMorgan, after selling a dozen of its &#8220;non-core&#8221; businesses
since November 2007, including its website authentication-
services unit to Symantec Corp. for $1.28 billion in cash in
May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeriSign, based in Mountain View, California, has advanced
34 percent this year, compared with a 0.3 percent gain in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Information Technology Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., the biggest U.S.
home lender, said it opted against joining some other banks in
delaying foreclosures as it stands by statements made to courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our affidavit procedures and daily auditing demonstrate
that our foreclosure affidavits are accurate,&#8221; the San
Francisco-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s decision to proceed with foreclosures contrasts
with competitors including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., which said last week that they are delaying court
proceedings pending internal reviews. Ally Financial Inc. said
last month its GMAC Mortgage unit would halt evictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo conducts daily audits of its foreclosure
process, and when it finds an error, employees &#8220;take action,&#8221;
according to the statement. Through June, 92 percent of Wells
Fargo&#8217;s mortgages were current, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, gained the most in almost
two years in Mexico trading after agreeing to buy as much as 35
percent of Univision Communications Inc. to expand in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.2 billion investment will include a 5 percent stake
and debt that can be converted into a stake of up to 30 percent
of Univision, the companies said today in a statement. Televisa
also has an option to buy an additional 5 percent of the closely
held U.S. broadcaster after three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal may help Mexico City-based Televisa add viewers
for its Mexican-made programs, including prime-time soap operas
known as telenovelas, in a market where Hispanics make up about
16 percent of the country&#8217;s 307 million people, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s 2009 estimate. Televisa is investing in a
broadcaster whose liabilities exceeded its assets by $1.6
billion as of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement gives Univision the right to show Televisa&#8217;s
programs on digital pay-TV services and on the Internet,
providing both companies with new ways to earn revenue in the
U.S. The companies had battled over those rights in U.S. court,
with Univision winning a ruling in 2009 that barred Televisa
from distributing the content online in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Video on demand, mobile, all the platforms we did not
have will help in increasing sales,&#8221; Televisa Executive Vice
President Alfonso de Angoitia said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose 12 percent to 53.61 pesos at 4 p.m. New York
time in Mexico City trading, the most since October 2008. The
shares have lost 1.1 percent this year compared with a 6.7
percent advance for the benchmark Mexican IPC index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Royalties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is seeking acquisitions in production and
distribution, Chief Executive Officer Emilio Azcarraga said in
May, after profit in 2009 slumped to a five-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Univision agreement increases the royalty payments
Televisa receives for programs it licenses to the U.S.
broadcaster. The royalties will amount to 11.91 percent of
Univision&#8217;s audiovisual and interactive revenue until 2017, and
jump further to 16.22 percent after that. Univision currently
pays 9.36 percent of its TV revenue to Televisa. For 2011, the
agreement will add $50 million to the royalties Televisa expects
to receive, de Angoitia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreement giving Univision, owner of the most-watched
Spanish network in the U.S., access to Televisa programming will
be extended to 2020 from 2017, with the possibility of a five-year extension beyond 2020. Univision will also be able to air
more Mexican soccer games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s simply a marriage made in heaven where one plus one
equals not three, but four,&#8221; Univision Chairman Haim Saban said
in a phone interview. His Saban Capital Group is an investor in
the company. &#8220;We now have the No. 1 creator of Spanish language
content in the world supplying us with the best content we could
possibly find anywhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Woman of Steel&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Univision Network reaches 95 percent of U.S. Hispanic
households, according to a BusinessWire press release last
month. Its popular programs include &#8220;For Love or Money,&#8221; and
&#8220;Woman of Steel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had net assets of $10.6 billion compared with
liabilities of $12.2 billion as of June 30, according to its
website. Univision has a &#8220;highly leveraged capital structure&#8221;
including $8.6 billion in debt maturing in 2014, Standard 
Poor&#8217;s said in a July report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Univision must refinance $3.25 billion of debt as part of
the deal, Televisa&#8217;s de Angoitia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement shows that all major stakeholders -- private-equity owners, lenders and Televisa -- are &#8220;all aligned to see
Univision survive and succeed,&#8221; said Mike Simonton, a debt
analyst with Fitch Ratings in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stronger Balance Sheet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company still needs to execute a sizeable refinancing
of the 2014 term loan, but this transaction better positions
them to do so,&#8221; Simonton said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment by Televisa strengthens Univision&#8217;s balance
sheet and enhances its financial flexibility, the companies
said. Three Televisa representatives will join Univision&#8217;s
board, which will increase to 20 members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saban said that while the balance sheet is more solid, it&#8217;s
too early to discuss changes to Univision&#8217;s financial structure.
He said he&#8217;s not looking to exit his investment in Univision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa sold an 11 percent stake in Univision for $1.09
billion in 2007 as part of the sale to the U.S. broadcaster&#8217;s
current investors. Univision was taken private in a $12.3
billion buyout in 2007 by Madison Dearborn Partners LLC,
Providence Equity Partners Inc., Texas Pacific Group, Thomas H.
Lee Partners LP and billionaire Saban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa&#8217;s net income fell 23 percent last year to 6
billion pesos ($479 million), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the lowest since the year ended December 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Univision pact has no effect on Televisa&#8217;s February
agreement to buy a 30 percent stake in NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD)&#8217;s
Mexico unit for $1.44 billion, de Angoitia said. The companies
are reviewing the closing conditions for that agreement, which
would give Televisa entry into Mexico&#8217;s mobile-phone business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks climbed, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to the highest level since May,
after American service industries expanded more than forecast
and speculation grew that the Federal Reserve will join Japan&#8217;s
efforts to stoke economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co., Bank of America Corp. and DuPont Co. rose more
than 3 percent, leading gains in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average following the Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s report
and the Bank of Japan&#8217;s announcement that it will cut rates and
buy bonds. Banks rallied as JPMorgan Chase  Co. said they will
likely beat third-quarter profit estimates. Chevron Corp. rose
2.6 percent after the oil company said it will buy back stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rallied 2.1 percent, the most since Sept. 24,
to 1,160.75 at 4 p.m. in New York. The index must gain 0.4
percent to reach its level on May 5, the day before the 20-
minute crash that briefly erased $862 billion from the value of
U.S. shares. The Dow advanced 193.45 points, or 1.8 percent, to
10,944.72. Both measures reached the highest levels since May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are voting they&#8217;re a little more comfortable
with the business outlook,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, who helps
oversee $13.3 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. &#8220;Investors are trying to get out of currencies and
into anything else that will retain wealth while monetary
authorities try to bludgeon currencies down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Virtually Zero&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks extended gains and the Dollar Index fell after the
ISM gauge, which covers 90 percent of the world&#8217;s largest
economy, rose to 53.2 from 51.5. The median economist forecast
called for a reading of 52, according to Bloomberg data.
Equities surged worldwide after the Bank of Japan decided to cut
its interest rate to &#8220;virtually zero&#8221; and create a fund to buy
bonds and other assets to stoke the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing gained 3.4 percent to $68.60. Bank of America
climbed 3.1 percent to $13.56. DuPont rose 3 percent to $45.77. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks posted the biggest advance among 24 groups in the SP
500, rising 3.2 percent. JPMorgan said the industry will top
estimates because of strong sales of mortgage loans and higher
net interest income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall  Ilsley Corp. jumped 5.9 percent to $7.53. Zions
Bancorporation advanced 3.6 percent to $21.91. Citigroup Inc.
climbed 2.5 percent to $4.13. Bank of America Corp. increased
3.1 percent to $13.56. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron gained 2.6 percent to $83.39. The company said it
will buy $500 million to $1 billion of stock each quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson Inc. surged 9.1 percent to $32.09 for the
biggest gain in the SP 500. The biggest U.S. motorcycle maker
had its share-price estimate increased to $36 from $33 by RBC
Capital Markets, which said the company&#8217;s U.S. retail sales
increased in September after falling the previous four months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. climbed 3.7 percent to $288.94. Jefferies Group
Inc. gave the company a &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation in new coverage,
the 48th positive recommendation among 51 analyst calls tracked
by Bloomberg. The maker of Mac computers, iPhones and iPad table
devices is &#8220;vastly underestimated,&#8221; analyst Peter Misek wrote
in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misek gave the shares a price estimate of $365. The stock
has the most positive recommendations among 1,657 companies in
the MSCI World Index. There are no &#8220;sell&#8221; ratings on Apple,
Bloomberg data show, while three brokerages rate the shares as
&#8220;hold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. rose 3 percent to $538.23. The online search
company&#8217;s Android software has become the most popular operating
system in the U.S. among new smartphone buyers, topping Apple&#8217;s
iPhone and Research In Motion Ltd.&#8217;s BlackBerry, according to
Nielsen Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron Mountain Inc. fell the most in the SP 500, dropping
8.6 percent to $20.45. The information management company
forecast 2011 earnings excluding some items of $1.26 a share at
most, trailing the average analyst estimate of $1.31 in a
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. declined the most in the Dow, slipping
2 percent to $38.28 after slumping 6.5 percent yesterday
following its decision to fight a U.S. antitrust complaint.
Larger rivals Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. settled the case,
agreeing to no longer bar merchants from steering customers to
alternative forms of payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa rallied 2.4 percent to $74.99 today, while MasterCard
increased 1.5 percent to $225.90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convertible Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convertible securities are beating the U.S. corporate bond
market by the most in more than 10 years as investors wager
stocks will outperform company debt paying record-low yields.
Debentures that can be exchanged for shares returned 4.42
percentage points more than company bonds in September, the
biggest gap since August 2000, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are seeking to profit from the rally in equities
by buying convertible bonds, which are deemed safer than stocks
should the economy slip back into recession. Junk bond prices
are above par for the first time since 2007 and the SP 500
trades at 15 times the past 12 months&#8217; earnings, a 28 percent
discount based on its 20-year average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Univision Communications Inc. will
speak with lenders tomorrow after Grupo Televisa SA agreed to
invest $1.2 billion in the Spanish-language media company,
according to people familiar with the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG is holding the call, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. No
reason was given for the call, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loan used to finance Univision&#8217;s 2007 leveraged buyout
rose more than four cents today following the announcement that
Mexico City-based Televisa will buy as much as 35 percent of the
broadcaster to expand in the U.S. The term loan was trading at
about 93.25 cents on the dollar, the people said, up from 89.25
cents late yesterday in New York, the people said. The loan is
$7.45 billion, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Hobson said on a
May 6 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term loan backed the LBO of the company by Madison
Dearborn Partners LLC, Providence Equity Partners LLC, Saban
Capital Group Inc., Thomas H. Lee Partners and TPG Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps protecting against losses on New York-
based Univision&#8217;s debt plunged to the lowest since December
2007. The five-year contracts dropped 224 basis points to 627
basis points, according to London-based data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. The index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Pillersdorf, a spokeswoman for Univision,
declined to comment on the debt training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc, said that while the Federal Reserve
will &#8220;very likely&#8221; take more steps to ease monetary policy,
asset purchases will have a limited effect on the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re going to do quite a lot but it&#8217;s probably still
going to fall short,&#8221; Hatzius said today at a fiscal policy
conference in Washington. &#8220;There is going to be a natural bias
towards caution among monetary policy makers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius, who&#8217;s based in New York, said another $1 trillion
worth of asset purchases by the Fed would probably lower long-
term interest rates by about 0.25 percentage point, adding a
&#8220;few tenths of additional GDP growth.&#8221; The Fed bought $1.7
trillion worth of Treasury and mortgage debt in a program that
ended in March. The purchases helped push mortgage rates to
historic lows, stabilizing housing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Fed Bank President William Dudley on Oct. 1 said
the Fed would probably need to take action to spur the recovery
and avert deflation, one of the clearest signs policy makers
would start a second round of unconventional monetary easing as
soon as the central bankers&#8217; next meeting Nov. 2-3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dudley, who serves as vice chairman of the Fed&#8217;s policy
making Open Market Committee, said in last week&#8217;s speech that
$500 billion of asset purchases, for example, would add as much
stimulus as reducing the Fed&#8217;s benchmark rate 0.5 percentage
point to 0.75 percentage point, depending on how long investors
expect the Fed to hold the assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius, 41, said his two scenarios for the U.S. economy
were &#8220;pretty bad&#8221; and &#8220;very bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10% Unemployment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy will grow between 1 percent and 2 percent
through early next year, with unemployment drifting up &#8220;to
somewhere around 10 percent, maybe a little above 10 percent,&#8221;
he said. In August, the jobless rate was 9.6 percent, close to
the 26-year high of 10.1 percent reached in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take many years before you get back to
anything approaching full unemployment, and 2014 is very likely
too early,&#8221; said Hatzius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He placed the odds of a renewed recession at 25 percent to
30 percent, which he told reporters was up from 15 percent to 20
percent at the beginning of the year. The double-dip recession
scenario was based on a renewed decline in housing prices and
failure to extend most of former President George W. Bush&#8217;s tax
cuts when they expire at the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius was rated by Bloomberg Markets Magazine last year
as top forecaster of the U.S. economy for the period spanning
the second half of 2008 through the first six months of 2009. He
and his team were also No. 1 in forecasting GDP and No. 2 in
estimating unemployment and Federal Reserve changes to the fed
funds rate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s attempt to end the
currency&#8217;s 28 percent ascent since October 2008 is prompting
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Barclays Capital to predict the biggest
tumble in benchmark real-denominated bonds in 21 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark notes due in 2017 will sink, sending yields up as
much as 40 basis points, the most since January 2009, to 12.19
percent after Finance Minister Guido Mantega doubled the tax
yesterday on foreign purchases of fixed-income securities, said
Felipe Pianetti, an emerging-markets strategist at JPMorgan in
New York. Yields on bonds due in 2021 may jump 25 basis points
to 12.11 percent, said Roberto Melzi, a strategist at Barclays
in New York. Both securities fell today, with the yield on the
2017 bonds jumping eight basis points to 11.88 percent at 9:55
a.m. New York time, and the 2021 bond yielding 11.94 percent, a
seven basis-point rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deeper selloff &#8220;will depend on whether the market gets
nervous and believes that the central bank or the authorities in
general will continue doing this kind of thing,&#8221; Melzi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s move reflects concern across emerging markets as
central bank dollar purchases fail to stem gains in local
currencies prompted by inflows into the highest-yielding assets
from South Korea to South Africa and Colombia. Mantega, 61, is
aiming to shore up exports after the real&#8217;s rally helped drive
Brazil&#8217;s current-account deficit to a record $45.8 billion in
the 12 months ending August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Quite Attractive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s benchmark lending rate, at 10.75 percent, is the
second-highest among the Group of 20 countries after
Argentina&#8217;s. Bill Gross, co-chief investment officer at Pacific
Investment Management Co., manager of the world&#8217;s biggest bond
fund, said in an interview yesterday that Brazil offers &#8220;quite
attractive&#8221; rates. The country&#8217;s 2021 bond yield is 946 basis
points higher than similar-maturity debt in the U.S. and 570
higher than Mexico&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian local bonds returned 15 percent this year,
following a 52 percent gain in 2009 after accounting for the
real&#8217;s appreciation, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s GBI-EM Broad Index.
The advance compared with the 11.6 percent increase in 2010 for
the average emerging-market local currency bonds and 8.9 percent
return in U.S. Treasuries, according to JPMorgan and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally in Brazil sent yields on notes due in 2021 down
43 basis points, or 0.43 percentage point, since their issue in
February. Yields on securities maturing in 2017 declined 153
basis points this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Currency War&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantega, reiterating his concern about a global &#8220;currency
war,&#8221; increased a tax on foreigners&#8217; bond investments to 4
percent from 2 percent after the market closed yesterday. The
change takes effect today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eventually this is bad for the government as they have to
pay more for bond issues,&#8221; said JPmorgan&#8217;s Pianetti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Brazil&#8217;s interbank rate futures contract due in
January 2012, the most traded in Sao Paulo&#8217;s BMF Exchange, rose
one basis point to 11.43 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real gained 0.7 percent to 1.6867 per dollar, from
1.6979 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Brazilian dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points to 202,
according to JPMorgan indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Brazilian bonds against default for
five years held at 113 basis points, according to data provider
CMA. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tripled Holdings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantega is seeking to stem purchases from international
investors after they tripled local bond holdings in the past
three years to $89 billion, helping spark the real&#8217;s advance to
a two-year high of 1.6735 per dollar on Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax increase &#8220;is amazing,&#8221; said Pablo Cisilino, who
helps manage $14 billion in emerging-market debt at Stone Harbor
Investment in New York. &#8220;It takes liquidity out of the market.
This makes it more difficult and expensive to trade Brazilian
bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International investors held 61 percent of the government
bonds due in 2017 as of April, up from 50 percent at the end of
2008, according to the Treasury. They owned 49 percent of the
bonds due in 2021. Stone Harbor pared its Brazilian debt
holdings last week as it predicted the real&#8217;s rally has run its
course, Cisilino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Government &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantega, who is slated to leave office with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in January, said yesterday that the tax
increase seeks to discourage investors from moving money into
Brazil to tap into benchmark rates of more than 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many countries are taking currency measures and no one is
sleeping on the job,&#8221; Mantega told reporters in Brasilia. &#8220;The
tendency is toward weakening their currencies. It&#8217;s not only a
currency war. It tends to become a trade war and this is our
concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea tightened limits on banks&#8217; holdings of currency
forwards in June, while Japan intervened in exchange markets in
September for the first time since 2004 to stem the yen&#8217;s rally
to a 15-year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s central bank has bought dollars in the foreign-
exchange market every day since May 2009, swelling its reserves
to a record $276 billion, to help stem real gains. The central
bank tripled its dollar purchases to $9.4 billion in September
from August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, policy makers raised the benchmark
overnight rate 200 basis points this year to cool growth and
keep inflation near its 4.5 percent target. The central bank
expects the economy to grow more than 7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Surplus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s trade surplus narrowed to $16.8 billion in the 12
months through September, the smallest in more than seven years,
as the stronger real and fastest economic expansion in two
decades boosted imports and slowed exports. The real has surged
37.4 percent since the end of 2008, extending its advance since
Lula took office in 2003 to 108 percent, the most among all
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil offers &#8220;a real rate of interest of 8 percent to 9
percent and that&#8217;s quite attractive,&#8221; Pimco&#8217;s Gross said in an
interview yesterday on Bloomberg Television before Mantega
announced the tax increase. &#8220;So we&#8217;re looking to high-growth
economies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-denominated bonds due in 2017 were the biggest holding
in Pimco&#8217;s $5.3 billion Emerging-Market Local Bond Fund as of
June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazilian
assets were the third biggest in Pimco&#8217;s $252 billion Total
Return Fund, which is managed by Gross, after the U.S. and U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Porterfield, a spokesman at Pimco in Newport Beach,
California, didn&#8217;t return telephone calls and e-mail messages
seeking a comment on the tax increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields Climb &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government implemented the tax change a day after the
election to choose Lula&#8217;s successor failed to produce a winner,
sparking a run-off vote scheduled for Oct. 31. Dilma Rousseff,
Lula&#8217;s former cabinet chief, and Jose Serra, the former Sao
Paulo governor, will face-off in the second-round vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantega indicated last week he was considering such a tax,
sending yields on Brazil&#8217;s 2021 securities up 31 basis points
for the week, the most since May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Brazil implemented a 2 percent tax on Oct. 19, 2009,
on foreign investment in the stock and bond markets, yields on
notes due in 2017 jumped 32 basis points in a week to 13.23
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s tax kept the real weaker than 1.69 per dollar
until last month, when state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro
SA&#8217;s record $70 billion share sale attracted foreign investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax increase will work &#8220;in the short term&#8221; to stem
the real&#8217;s rally, said Alvise Marino, an emerging-market
currency strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. &#8220;It
won&#8217;t have a long-term effect because it remains a dollar story.
You have U.S. rates that are at historical lows and regardless
what happens with Brazilian rates, the rate differential still
remains very, very attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elizabeth Amon" date="Oct 05, 2010 10:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-05/visa-galleon-deutsche-bank-citigroup-airgas-in-court-news.html"><headline>Kerviel, Visa, Galleon, Citigroup in Court News</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Jerome Kerviel was sentenced to three
years in prison and ordered to repay Societe Generale SA&#8217;s 4.9
billion-euro ($6.8 billion) trading loss by a judge who said the
former trader&#8217;s actions threatened the bank&#8217;s existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By his deliberate actions, he put in peril the existence
of the bank that employed 140,000 people, of which he was a
part, and whose future was threatened,&#8221; Judge Dominique Pauthe
said today in finding Kerviel guilty of breach of trust, forging
documents and computer hacking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading loss, announced Jan. 24, 2008, was the biggest
ever and prompted then-chief executive officer Daniel Bouton to
describe Kerviel as a &#8220;terrorist.&#8221; The court placed the blame
for the loss on Kerviel alone, rejecting defense arguments
during a three-week trial in June that his superiors knew of his
actions and that the bank&#8217;s decision to unwind the bets over
three days of falling markets caused the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4.9 billion-euro award &#8220;is obviously symbolic,&#8221;
Christopher Mesnooh, a Paris-based lawyer with Field Fisher
Waterhouse LLP, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It goes a very
long way in exonerating the bank and putting responsibility for
the losses, including the winding down of the positions by
Societe Generale, entirely in Jerome&#8217;s court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one has any expectation that he&#8217;ll pay,&#8221; said
Mesnooh, who isn&#8217;t involved in the Kerviel case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olivier Metzner, Kerviel&#8217;s lawyer, said he would appeal the
ruling, and that Kerviel would &#8220;obviously not&#8221; be able to
repay the loss. Dressed in a dark suit, Kerviel, 33, sat in
court following the decision reading on his iPhone. He will
remain free during the appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former trader is &#8220;revolted that those that created him
put all responsibility on him,&#8221; Metzner said, noting Kerviel
wouldn&#8217;t comment directly. &#8220;Prison is unacceptable for a man
who didn&#8217;t make a penny.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pauthe said problems with Societe Generale&#8217;s computer
controls and management&#8217;s encouragement of traders to speculate
wasn&#8217;t enough to absolve Kerviel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lack of vigilance by the bank in monitoring the only
existing limits, acting as alert signs, hardly exempted Jerome
Kerviel from his duty to inform his hierarchy of the reality of
his excesses or to come back to the limits imposed,&#8221; Pauthe
said in reading excerpts of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean Veil, the lawyer representing Societe Generale, said
he was satisfied by the guilty verdict and award, which the
Paris-based bank had requested at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award &#8220;confirms what Societe Generale has always told
its shareholders and employees,&#8221; Veil said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, Visa Settle as Amex Fights U.S. Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. reached a settlement with the
U.S. Justice Department to resolve a two-year antitrust
investigation over restrictions on merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement was filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New
York, yesterday as the Justice Department filed charges against
Visa, MasterCard and American Express Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s settlement means that about 4 million merchants
across the U.S. that accept just Visa and MasterCard are now
free to steer customers to different credit cards or forms of
payment by offering discounts, rebates or other special
treatment, the Justice Department said. Six million more
retailers who also accept cards from American Express are still
subject to restrictions until the lawsuit is resolved, the
Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to put money in consumers&#8217; pockets,&#8221; said
Attorney General Eric Holder at a press conference. &#8220;By
eliminating credit-card companies&#8217; anticompetitive rules, we
will accomplish that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express spokesman Michael O&#8217;Neill said his company
would fight the charges. &#8220;We do not intend to settle,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. probe focused on rules that bar merchants from
charging extra to customers who use credit cards and steering
them to competing cards, and that require retailers to accept
every type of card banks issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merck Verdict Cut to $1.5 Million From $8 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge cut a jury award against Merck  Co. in a
lawsuit over its Fosamax osteoporosis drug to $1.5 million from
$8 million while upholding the verdict in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan in Manhattan yesterday
denied Merck&#8217;s request for a defense verdict or a new trial. The
case resulted in a verdict for Shirley Boles, a 72-year-old Fort
Walton Beach, Florida, woman who claimed she developed
osteonecrosis of the jaw, or so-called jaw death, from taking
Fosamax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keenan ruled that the $8 million verdict was unreasonably
high. He said Boles may choose between a reduced award of $1.5
million or a retrial to determine damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A significant damage award is warranted, but the $8
million deviates substantially from what would be reasonable
compensation,&#8221; Keenan wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck said it will appeal Keenan&#8217;s refusal to throw out the
verdict entirely or to order a new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both the finding and the amount of compensatory damages
are against the weight of the evidence,&#8221; Bruce N. Kuhlik,
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck&#8217;s general counsel,
said in a statement. &#8220;The evidence showed that Fosamax did not
cause the plaintiff&#8217;s injury and that it is a safe and effective
medication that was properly designed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Boles v. Merck  Co., 06-cv-09455, and the
lawsuits are combined in In Re Fosamax Products Liability
Litigation, MDL 1789, U.S. District Court, Southern District of

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Asks Court to Find U.S. Wiretaps Illegal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam is seeking to show
that U.S. agents illegally wiretapped his communications and
that the recordings can&#8217;t be used in his criminal insider-
trading trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing yesterday in federal court in Manhattan,
Rajaratnam tried to convince U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell
that the government misled a different judge into authorizing
the wiretaps in March 2008. As a result, the wiretaps, the
centerpiece of the biggest insider-trading prosecution in
history, must be thrown out, he claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They gamed the system,&#8221; John Dowd, a lawyer for
Rajaratnam, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, is accused of using tips from company
executives, hedge-fund employees and others in a multimillion-
dollar insider-trading scheme. He&#8217;s the central figure in an
investigation in which 21 were charged. Rajaratnam, who denies
wrongdoing, faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dowd argued that U.S. investigators hid from Gerard Lynch,
the federal judge who issued the wiretap warrant, the fact that
the Securities and Exchange Commission had already assembled the
elements of &#8220;a classic insider-trading case&#8221; against
Rajaratnam and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the government secretly recorded about
2,400 conversations between Rajaratnam and more than 130
friends, business associates and alleged accomplices. The
evidence against him will include testimony from some of the
people caught on the wiretaps, the government said. The U.S.
said it&#8217;s the first insider-trading prosecution to use wiretap
evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss Re Wins Dismissal of Credit Default Swaps Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss Reinsurance Co. the world&#8217;s second-biggest reinsurer,
won dismissal of an investor suit in which it was accused of
failing to disclose risk that led to a 1.2 billion franc ($1.1
billion) derivative loss over credit-default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in New York yesterday
dismissed the suit on grounds including a June ruling by the
U.S. Supreme Court that limits the reach of civil claims for
acts occurring outside the country. Koeltl said the plaintiffs
also failed to supply sufficient details of their fraud claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss Re &#8220;made false and misleading statements about the
company&#8217;s financial condition,&#8221; the shareholders claimed in the
2008 lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plaintiffs have failed to allege with particularity
that the defendants made any material misstatements or omissions
with respect to the CDSs it had insured or that the defendants
had any obligation to provide further disclosure with respect to
the CDSs it had issued,&#8221; Koeltl said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead plaintiff, Plumbers Union Local No. 12 Pension
Fund, sued on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of Swiss
Re&#8217;s common shares from March 1, 2007, to Nov. 19, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint described statements that the defendants made
about Swiss Re&#8217;s involvement with mortgage-related securities,
with the subprime mortgage market, Swiss Re&#8217;s management
practices and the value of its earnings and accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koeltl cited the Supreme Court ruling in Morrison v.
National Australia Bank issued in June that limits the reach of
civil claims for acts occurring outside the U.S. He said that
ruling disagreed with the plaintiffs&#8217; argument &#8220;that a purchase
occurs when and where an investor places a buy order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither a lawyer for the plaintiffs nor a spokeswoman for
Swiss Re could be reached yesterday for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Plumbers&#8217; Union Local No.12 v. Swiss
Reinsurance Co., 1:08-cv-1958, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The Supreme Court case is
Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd, 08-1191, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Wins Order for Singapore End to Indonesia Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG won a court order that a company
controlled by two of Indonesia&#8217;s richest men must end legal
attempts outside Singapore to regain pledged shares that
Germany&#8217;s biggest bank sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckkett Pte, controlled by Sukanto Tanoto and Hashim
Djojohadikusumo, can&#8217;t pursue duplicate proceedings after six
years in the Singapore courts, Singapore High Court Judge Judith
Prakash said in SGHC 284notShowClose=y] a ruling made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling was made on an appeal by Deutsche Bank, which
had asked Beckkett to withdraw a separate Indonesian lawsuit
from 2008, and challenged a February decision by Singapore&#8217;s
assistant registrar not to order the Indonesian proceedings to
be halted. Singapore&#8217;s Court of Appeal last year ruled that the
bank didn&#8217;t take proper steps to sell the shares in companies
including coal miner PT Adaro Indonesia at the best price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckkett, which had pledged the shares as collateral for a
1997 loan to its unit PT Asminco Baru Utama, was entitled to
have any losses determined. The Court of Appeal also allowed
Deutsche Bank to make a counterclaim for an outstanding loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Beckkett had no business starting the Indonesian action
in the first place,&#8221; Judge Prakash wrote. &#8220;There was no excuse
for it to attempt to bypass a possibly unfavorable decision of
the Singapore courts by taking action in Indonesia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurel Teo, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Beckkett,
declined to comment, as did Michael West, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman at Deutsche Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Beckkett Pte Ltd. v. Deutsche Bank AG and Anor,
S326/2004, Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyco Wins Bid to Exclude Some Evidence Against Walsh &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyco International Ltd. won a bid to exclude some evidence
in a lawsuit that centers on ex-director Frank E. Walsh Jr.&#8217;s
$20 million &#8220;finder&#8217;s fee&#8221; related to the purchase of CIT
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walsh had asked U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York
to bar Tyco from putting attorneys&#8217; fees into evidence at trial.
Tyco persuaded Cote that the fees were evidence of damages
sustained by the company and that Walsh&#8217;s conduct triggered an
internal investigation by the law firm of Boies, Schiller 
Flexner LLP, which was hired to investigate the payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tyco has shown that the evidence is properly admitted at
trial,&#8221; Cote said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate ruling, Cote denied a bid by Tyco to exclude
the testimony of an expert witness Walsh wants at a trial about
Bermuda law. Walsh said he relied upon the advice in connection
with his receipt of the $20 million from Tyco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walsh, who was &#8220;lead director&#8221; and a member of the
corporate governance committee, hid the payment from the board
and later refused to return it, Tyco alleges in a suit filed in
New York in 2002. Tyco alleges seven causes of action, including
that Walsh breached his fiduciary duty when he accepted the
payment. He denies allegations of any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Levine, a lawyer for Tyco, declined comment. Michele
Pahmer, a lawyer for Walsh, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail message
left at her office seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tyco International Ltd. v. Frank Walsh Jr. 02-
CV-46233, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Sued Over German Bank&#8217;s $37 Million Loss on CDO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which served as the placement
agent for a collateralized debt obligation named Davis Square
Funding VI, was sued by Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg over its
$37 million loss on the investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO held 95 percent residential mortgage-backed
securities, of which 33 percent were subprime and 46 percent
were &#8220;midprime,&#8221; the German bank said in a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. TCW Group Inc., the
investment adviser on the CDO, was also sued by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Goldman sold the investments to a Luxembourg affiliate
of LBBW in March 2006, they were represented as &#8220;safe, secure,
and nearly risk free,&#8221; according to the complaint. At the same
time, Goldman senior executives privately observed that &#8220;it was
game over&#8221; for subprime lenders and were reducing their
exposure to the mortgages, LBBW said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman knew at the highest levels of its organization
that its representations to LBBW Luxemburg that the notes
merited triple-A ratings and were high grade were blatantly
false,&#8221; the Stuttgart-based bank said. &#8220;Goldman committed
fraud and, or, was negligent in marketing and selling the notes
to LBBW Luxemburg.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;TCW has acted appropriately in managing Davis Square VI
and any allegation to the contrary is without merit,&#8221; the
company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said yesterday that the company had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg v. Goldman Sachs,
10-7549, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, Ally Accused of Racketeering With Mortgage Database &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and Ally Financial Inc. units were sued by
homeowners in Kentucky who allege they conspired with Mortgage
Electronic Registration Systems Inc. to falsely foreclose on
mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed as a civil racketeering class action on
behalf all Kentucky homeowners facing foreclosure, also names as
a defendant Reston, Virginia-based MERS, the company that
handles mortgage transfers among member banks. The suit claims
that through MERS the banks are foreclosing on homes even when
they don&#8217;t hold titles to the properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants have filed foreclosures throughout the State
of Kentucky and the United States of America knowing that they
were not the &#8216;owners&#8217; or beneficiaries of the loan they filed
foreclosure upon,&#8221; the home owners wrote in their complaint
filed Sept. 28 in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is one of multiple cases against MERS and banks
alleging that the process allows wrongful foreclosures. Several
of these cases, combined in a multidistrict litigation in
Phoenix were dismissed Sept. 30, with the judge allowing the
plaintiffs to re-file their complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegation is inflammatory and without merit and we
intend to defend our position fully in a court of law,&#8221; Gina
Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to
comment. Karmela Lejarde, a spokeswoman for MERS, didn&#8217;t have an
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Foster v. Mortgage Electronic Registration
Systems Inc., 10-cv-611, U.S. District Court, Western District
of Kentucky (Louisville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Products Executive Says Airgas Bid &#8216;Attractive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Products  Chemicals Inc.&#8217;s $5.5 billion bid for Airgas
Inc. is an &#8220;attractive offer,&#8221; an Air Products executive
testified as the producer of industrial gases presses its rival
to consider a sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At $65.50 a share, Air Products would be paying &#8220;full
price,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Paul Huck told a Delaware
Chancery Court judge yesterday. Air Products, based in
Allentown, Pennsylvania, sued Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Airgas
on Feb. 4 to force consideration of the bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A number of long-time Airgas holders found it to be a
very attractive offer,&#8221; Huck testified in Georgetown, Delaware.
The courtroom earlier was closed to the public during part of
Huck&#8217;s testimony about Airgas&#8217;s value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the case, Airgas is asking Chancery Court Judge
William B. Chandler III to invalidate a bylaw approved by
shareholders in a Sept. 15 vote that added three Air Products
nominees to the Airgas board. The bylaw would move Airgas&#8217;s
annual meeting to January from as early as April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airgas contends that moving up the annual meeting will
unfairly allow Air Products to try to knock more Airgas nominees
off the board and take control. Chandler has agreed to hear both
issues in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Air Products  Chemicals Inc. v. Airgas Inc.,
5249, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington); and Airgas Inc. v.
Air Products  Chemicals Inc., 5817, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halliburton Investors Draw Top U.S. Court Inquiry in Fraud Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court signaled interest in an appeal from
shareholders trying to sue Halliburton Co. for securities fraud,
seeking the Obama administration&#8217;s advice on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal potentially would make it easier for investors
to press class-action suits in some states. A federal appeals
court in New Orleans said the Halliburton shareholders couldn&#8217;t
sue as a group because they hadn&#8217;t established that they lost
money as a result of the alleged fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Halliburton shareholders&#8217; lawyer, David Boies, argued
in his appeal that the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had
established a &#8220;virtually unattainable standard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shareholders, led by the Erica P. John Fund, contend
that Halliburton from 1999 to 2001 falsified earnings reports,
played down estimated asbestos liability and overstated the
benefits of a merger. The company was led during part of that
period by Dick Cheney, later the U.S. vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court appeal concerns the standard that applies at
the so-called class certification stage, not at final judgment.
The Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that to recover damages
shareholders ultimately must show a direct connection between a
misrepresentation and a decline in stock prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boies&#8217;s appeal contends that shareholders shouldn&#8217;t have to
make that showing at the class certification stage, when they
haven&#8217;t yet had a chance to marshal their evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Erica P. John Fund v. Halliburton, 09-1403,
U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Lawsuits Against FTSE 100 Companies Rise 16%, Survey Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. lawsuits against the country&#8217;s 100 biggest companies
increased 16 percent in a year, suggesting an &#8220;inevitable
flood&#8221; of litigation from the financial crisis hasn&#8217;t peaked, a
legal publisher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases against FTSE 100-listed companies in the High Court
in London rose to 179 from 154 in the year ended June 30, the
publisher Sweet  Maxwell said Oct. 3 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined lawsuits against HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Barclays Plc
fell 6 percent, and comprised 43 percent of the FTSE 100 cases,
Sweet  Maxwell said. Financial services companies make up 18
percent of the FTSE 100, Sweet  Maxwell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks are likely to feature frequently in hard-fought
litigation by virtue of the huge volume of complex financial
transactions that they are involved with,&#8221; said Sweet 
Maxwell, a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits against FTSE 100 companies weren&#8217;t the only ones
to increase. Cases to shield corporate secrets more than
quadrupled in London last year and trademark cases rose 20
percent, the U.K. Ministry of Justice said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Ghraib Contractor Suit Draws U.S. Supreme Court Interest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court signaled it may consider whether two
military contractors can be sued for allegedly abusing inmates
at Iraq&#8217;s Abu Ghraib prison in a case that could make companies
more vulnerable to human rights suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday asked the Obama administration for
advice on an appeal from 26 Abu Ghraib inmates seeking to sue
CACI International Inc., which helped interrogate prisoners at
the facility, and Titan Corp., which provided translation
services. Titan has since been renamed and is now part of L-3
Communications Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal asks the court to decide whether companies and
other private parties can be sued under a federal law that
authorizes some suits against foreign governments for human
rights abuses. The inmates also want the justices to consider
whether contractors are immune from state-law suits stemming
from activities that take place on the battlefield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inmates, who were civilian detainees, say they were
subjected to abuses by CACI and Titan employees including
beatings, sexual humiliation, exposure to extreme temperatures
and rape. In court papers, the inmates say some prisoners were
tortured into unconsciousness and several were murdered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two groups of inmates are seeking to sue under the 1789
U.S. Alien Tort Statute and District of Columbia law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Saleh v. CACI International, 09-1313, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accused Tax Cheat Cohen Denies Owning New York Hotel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotel developer Leon Cohen Levy, accused by U.S.
prosecutors of hiding a $33 million hotel sale from the Internal
Revenue Service, testified that he never cheated on his taxes or
made more than $40,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen, 46, is charged with his father, Mauricio Cohen
Assor, 77, with conspiring to defraud the IRS and filing false
tax returns that hid income and more than $150 million in
assets. Prosecutors say the men, who built hotels in Europe
under the &#8220;Flatotel&#8221; brand, failed to declare their sale of a
New York hotel in 2000 that they owned in the names of friends,
relatives and employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leon Cohen said he never owned the Flatotel and never made
more than $40,000 a year working for its owners. He said that he
never paid taxes for his use of a Miami Beach house that
prosecutors say was once worth $26 million. Cohen said he used
the house for business and never paid taxes for the benefit of
its use or of luxury cars he drove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why would I pay taxes?&#8221; Cohen told jurors in federal
court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. &#8220;I was a professional person
working in a professional residence. That&#8217;s where I slept. I was
just doing my job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen, like his father, who testified Sept. 30, said he
believed an accountant had prepared his taxes properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I thought that all the returns and documents that had to
be filed had been filed, absolutely,&#8221; he said, testifying in
French through an interpreter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the Cohens put $33 million in proceeds
from the New York Flatotel sale in a Swiss account of HSBC
Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest bank by market value, and failed
to tell the IRS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Assor, 10-cr-60159, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan Full of Questions in Her First U.S. Supreme Court Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elena Kagan wasted no time joining the conversation in her
first hearing as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan, who will take part in only four of the 12 cases
during the court&#8217;s first two-week argument session, asked
questions of all three lawyers during the one-hour hearing in a
bankruptcy case that marked the opening of the court&#8217;s nine-
month term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan has recused herself from 24 of the court&#8217;s 51
scheduled cases because she played a role in the litigation
while serving as U.S. solicitor general, the government&#8217;s top
courtroom advocate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s hearing focused on whether people seeking
bankruptcy protection can limit the amount they must pay to
creditors by claiming an auto expense deduction for a car that
has already been paid off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What would happen if the debtor had a car that was
200,000 miles old and it was going to break down, you know,
within the next five years?&#8221; Kagan asked Deanne Maynard, the
attorney representing Bank of America Corp. in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Maynard and Nicole Saharsky, the federal government
lawyer in the case, worked under Kagan in the solicitor&#8217;s
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan sat at the far end of the bench, in the spot assigned
to the most-junior justice on the court. She made eye contact
with each speaker and at one point whispered to Justice Samuel
Alito, who was seated to her right. Several of her questions
built off comments and queries from the other justices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ransom v. FIA Card Services, 09-907,U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana may borrow $500 million from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to upgrade a railroad in southern
Ghana, an adviser to the country&#8217;s finance ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will have to go through parliament,&#8221; Newman Kusi said
in a phone interview from the capital, Accra, today. &#8220;Maybe
around November or December it will be completed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan will be repaid over seven years, Kusi said. He
declined to disclose the interest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Norwegian company, Africa Rail Ghana Ltd., will also
arrange financing for the project, which will link the port city
of Tema and Accra with the southern towns of Koforidua and
Nsawam, Kusi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nicholas Larkin" date="Oct 05, 2010  8:57 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-05/copper-will-trade-at-11-000-in-a-year-as-demand-increases-goldman-says.html"><headline>Copper Will Trade at $11,000 in a Year as Demand Increases, Goldman Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Copper will trade at $11,000 a metric
ton in a year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said as it raised price
estimates because of swelling demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast implies a 35 percent gain from the metal&#8217;s
current price. The bank had predicted on Sept. 17 that copper
would trade at $8,050 a ton in 12 months. Goldman today advised
investors to buy the December 2011 contract as increasing demand
leads to shortages of the metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for three-month delivery traded on the London Metal
Exchange jumped 23 percent in the third quarter, the most in a
year, helped by falling stockpiles and a weaker dollar. LME
inventories shrank by 17 percent in the period, and the U.S.
Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the greenback&#8217;s strength,
slid 8.5 percent, the most since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Supply-demand deficits look set to grow on emerging-
market strength and improving demand from developed economies,
which we expect to significantly outpace supply growth, drawing
down inventories and creating market shortages,&#8221; analysts
including London-based Jeffrey Currie said in the report. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t believe that the market is fully pricing these shortages
and the potential for demand rationing that lies ahead in
2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month copper traded at $8,156 a ton at 1:38 p.m. on
the LME. The December 2011 contract was at $8,025. Goldman Sachs
raised its three-month forecast for the metal to $8,500 and
increased its six-month estimate to $8,800. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper will average $9,300 a ton next year, the bank said,
compared with about $7,215 so far in 2010. Electrical equipment
and construction are the main sources of demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also raised its 12-month forecast for zinc to
$3,000 a ton. The metal, used to rust-proof steel, will likely
stay in surplus for now because of supply growth, though the
market will be more balanced in the year ahead and &#8220;possibly
swinging to times of deficit&#8221; next year, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc for three-month delivery was last at $2,288 a ton on
the LME, reducing this year&#8217;s decline to 11 percent. The metal
will average $2,575 in 2011, said Goldman Sachs, which on Sept.
17 predicted a 12-month price of $2,225. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aluminium Bahrain BSC, operator of an
850,000 metric-tons-a-year smelter, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Citigroup Inc. to manage the possible sale of as much as
11.5 percent of its shares on local and international exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co., the Persian Gulf nation&#8217;s
sovereign wealth fund, may sell as many as 163 million shares,
with ordinary stock listed on the Bahrain exchange and global
depository receipts on the London bourse, Alba, as the smelter
is known, said in an e-mailed statement today. The company has
about 1.42 billion shares outstanding, a spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alba appointed J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. as sole global
coordinator and bookrunner. The bank will manage the sale of
GDRs with Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. as co-manager. Gulf
International Bank BSC will be regional lead manager, Alba said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bahraini government holds 77 percent of Alba and Saudi
Arabia owns 20 percent through chemicals maker Saudi Basic
Industries Corp. The partners will proportionally split a 3
percent stake owned by Breton Investments Ltd., once Alba
completes the purchase of that company&#8217;s holding in the smelter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alba said in June it plans to convert itself into a public
joint stock company to add financial flexibility and allow its
aluminum smelter to compete in international markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company last month reported a first-half profit of $200
million, beating its own forecasts. Alba said it may exceed
internal profit targets this year, without disclosing projected
earnings or providing comparison data for the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial public offering could take place in November or
December, Chairman Mahmood Hashim al Kooheji said Sept. 21. The
company intends to expand annual smelter capacity by 400,000
tons, Chief Executive Officer Laurent Schmitt said the same day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan may intervene in
currency markets should the yen strengthen to more than 82 per
dollar, according to Jim O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs
Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think if the yen were to strengthen above 82 for
example, even if it were in the next couple of days, I think
they probably would intervene,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in an interview
with Deirdre Bolton and Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8216;InsideTrack&#8217; today. &#8220;The case for intervention to weaken the
yen is actually quite strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen fell against the majority of its most-traded
counterparts today after the Bank of Japan cut its benchmark
interest rate and increased purchases of bonds to combat
deflation and stimulate the economy. The currency&#8217;s rally to a
15-year high of 82.88 per dollar on Sept. 15 spurred Japan to
weaken the currency and help exporters for the first time since
2004. The yen was at 83.31 as of 12:36 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What they&#8217;ve done this morning is something that should
be happening -- they probably should&#8217;ve done it earlier -- and I
think they should do more to stop the yen&#8217;s strength,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure at some stage we will&#8221; see more
currency intervention by Japan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan&#8217;s decision to create a fund to buy bonds
and other assets comes as policy makers in the U.S. and the U.K.
consider similar steps to support their flagging economies. At
the same time, governments in emerging markets from Brazil to
South Korea are increasing currency controls as investment
inflows threaten export growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Meetings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see some interesting focus on that&#8221; at
the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank in Washington on Oct. 8-10, O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;Some
countries clearly have currencies that are too strong and some
kind of interventional activity to stop it is justified. I would
include, even though the circumstances are very different, both
Brazil, Japan and maybe even Switzerland in that category.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;excessively strong yen&#8221; is partly due to the U.S.
Federal Reserve &#8220;being so aggressive&#8221; in its monetary policy,
O&#8217;Neill said. The Fed has made it &#8220;pretty clear&#8221; that
officials will extend quantitative-easing measures at the next
Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 3, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the Fed sticks with the strategy it looks like its
adopting, the dollar is going to be under pressure further
against many currencies all over the world,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not a bad strategy seen from a U.S. perspective, but of
course it puts challenges on other countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill also said it was less likely that the central banks
in the U.K. and on mainland Europe would loosen monetary policy
&#8220;in the near term&#8221; because the economic need is not as strong
as in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. wants to double
client assets under management in Switzerland over the next five
years by targeting wealthy families, said Andrea Tardy, managing
director of the Geneva-based business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (Suisse) SA&#8217;s current clientele includes foreign
residents in Switzerland and family offices, said Tardy, 45, in
an interview at his office on Geneva&#8217;s main shopping street. The
global reach of JPMorgan, which caters to ultra-high-net-worth
clients willing to invest more than $25 million, may appeal to
Swiss families already with other private banks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;d like to be big,&#8221; said Tardy, declining to give a
figure for assets under management in Switzerland. &#8220;Ultra-high
net worth&#8217;s are global and need a global player.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geneva unit is JPMorgan&#8217;s second-biggest private
banking office after New York, and Tardy plans to add two or
three bankers over the next 12 to 15 months to the five
relationship managers working on the Swiss market. JPMorgan, the
world&#8217;s sixth-largest wealth manager at the end of 2009
according to London-based Scorpio Partnership, manages more than
$720 billion of private assets globally, said Tardy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a flight to a quality experience and people
are making different choices,&#8221; said Tardy, who became head of
JPMorgan&#8217;s Swiss business 12 months ago, after heading Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Geneva private bank between August 2007 and
February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tardy, an Italian national with a law degree from Turin,
worked as a relationship manager at Union Bancaire Priv&#233;e&#8217;s
London office for a year until May 2007, after working for
JPMorgan in London since 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Appointments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has more than 600 staff in Geneva, last
month appointed Romain Pasche from Vontobel Asset Management as
senior investment adviser and Audrey Childe-Freeman from Brown
Brothers Harriman as head of currency strategy. The bank also
named Rhian Horgan as international head of alternative
investments, based in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last week that over the next five years it
plans to triple private banking assets in Asia, its fastest-
growing market, after moving Douglas Wurth, chief executive
officer for international private banking, to the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael B. Marois" date="Oct 06, 2010  6:25 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-06/california-names-jpmorgan-to-manage-10-billion-note-sale-set-for-november.html"><headline>California Picks JPMorgan to Manage $10 Billion Sale</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;California named JPMorgan Chase  Co.
to manage the sale of about $10 billion of short-term notes that
the state plans to sell next month to fill its coffers with
enough cash for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De La Rosa  Co. and Wells Fargo Securities will help
manage the sale, according to state Treasurer Bill Lockyer. The
state typically issues revenue-anticipation notes in the second
or third quarter each year, when cash-on-hand is low, and repays
them from later tax collections. Lockyer said today the sale
could occur as soon as the first week of November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale has been pending amid a record-long 98-day
stalemate between Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers
over how to best erase a $19.1 billion deficit. Lockyer hasn&#8217;t
been able to borrow the money because the promise to repay the
notes must be included in the budget. Schwarzenegger and
legislative leaders reached a compromise on closing the deficit
Oct. 1 and have scheduled a vote on a spending plan tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockyer plans to use a portion of the proceeds from the
note sale to repay a bridge loan he&#8217;s estimated at around $5
billion that he&#8217;s lining up from Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and RBC Capital Markets to
tide the state over once a budget is passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., RBC Capital and Siebert Brandford Shank 
Co. have been picked to be joint senior managers on the sale of
general-obligation bonds that Lockyer has said he would like to
sell before the end of November, a posting on the treasurer&#8217;s
website shows. How much debt will be sold hasn&#8217;t been decided,
though Schwarzenegger&#8217;s Finance Department has identified about
$6 billion of bonding needs through the end of next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California sold $8.8 billion of one-year notes in September
2009. JPMorgan also managed that offering, assisted by 36 other
firms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks fell, a day after
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rallied to an almost five-month
high, after a report showing an unexpected decrease in private
payrolls undermined confidence in the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equinix Inc. plunged 33 percent after sales at the operator
of Internet data centers trailed estimates. MT Bank Corp.
dropped 5 percent as Allied Irish Banks Plc said it will start
selling its stake in the Buffalo, New York-based lender. General
Electric Co. rose 2.4 percent after buying oilfield-equipment
maker Dresser Inc. for $3 billion. Alcoa Inc. gained 1.9 percent
before reporting quarterly earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than four stocks declined for every three that rose on
U.S. exchanges. The SP 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,159.97 at 4
p.m. in New York, after surging 2.1 percent yesterday. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average rose 22.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to
10,967.65. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bias in the market is to the downside because
sentiment is very negative,&#8221; said Mark Freeman, a money manager
at Westwood Management Corp. in Dallas, which oversees $10
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed to the highest level since May
yesterday after U.S. service industries expanded more than
forecast and speculation grew that the Federal Reserve will join
Japan&#8217;s efforts to stoke economic growth. The index is down 0.5
percent from May 5, the day before the 20-minute crash that
briefly erased $862 billion from the value of U.S. shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strong Signal&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week, New York Federal Reserve President
William Dudley, the Boston Fed&#8217;s Eric Rosengren and Chicago&#8217;s
Charles Evans have advocated further Fed action to stimulate the
economy. Dudley&#8217;s Oct. 1 speech was a &#8220;strong signal&#8221; that
policymakers will vote to restart asset purchases at the next
Federal Open Market Committee meeting Nov. 2-3, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Edward McKelvey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity futures erased gains before the open of exchanges in
New York after companies in the U.S. unexpectedly cut 39,000
workers last month, figures from ADP Employer Services showed.
Economists had forecast 20,000 jobs would be added, according to
the median in a Bloomberg survey. The release comes two days
before the Labor Department&#8217;s monthly payrolls report, which is
forecast to show companies added 75,000 people in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s still a debate about the economy and whether
we&#8217;re going to slip back into a recession,&#8221; said Mark Bronzo, a
money manager in Irvington, New York, at Security Global
Investors, which oversees $21 billion. &#8220;It all hinges on jobs.
The ADP data causes us to be concerned about nonfarm payrolls on
Friday. Futures were up and the ADP number took the wind out of
our sails.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equinix plunged 33 percent to $70.34. The operator of
Internet data centers said third-quarter sales were no more than
$330 million, compared with the average analyst estimate of
$336.6 million. The plunge by Equinix was the biggest in a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. index of 50 stocks that appear most
frequently in the top 10 holdings of hedge funds that have 10 to
200 investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai Technologies Inc., the largest supplier of software
to make websites and digital media load faster, lost 7.6 percent
to $44.25. Citrix Systems Inc., the maker of networking
software, dropped 14 percent to $60.15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MT Bank slid 5 percent to $78.91. Allied Irish said it
will start selling its 22.4 percent stake in the lender, valued
at $2.2 billion, in a U.S. public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allied Irish &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disposal would unwind a seven-year union that began
when MT acquired Allied Irish&#8217;s U.S.-based Allfirst Financial
unit for stock and cash in 2003. Allied Irish has been weighing
options for the MT stake and other assets to raise money as its
finances deteriorated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE had the biggest gain in the Dow, rising 2.4 percent to
$16.90. GE agreed to buy Dresser for $3 billion, shoring up its
biggest industrial unit, as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt begins spending cash accumulated over the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauges of SP 500 companies that produce raw materials and
energy rose 0.8 percent as the SP GSCI Index of 24 commodities
rallied to the highest in almost two years on speculation
central banks around the world will join the Bank of Japan in
increasing purchases of government debt to boost the economic
recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa rose 1.9 percent to $12.37. The country&#8217;s biggest
aluminum producer, which tomorrow becomes the first Dow company
to post third-quarter results, may post earnings of 5 cents a
share excluding some items, according to the average analyst
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America
Corp. and Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY), defending allegations of
fraudulent home foreclosures from customers and Congress, may
face the most financial peril from investigations by state
attorneys general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities in at least seven states are probing whether
lenders used false documents and signatures to justify hundreds
of thousands of foreclosures, and the number of these inquiries
will grow, according to state officials and legal experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see a tremendous amount of activity with
all the AGs in the U.S.,&#8221; Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray
said in an interview. &#8220;We have a high degree of skepticism that
the corners that were cut are truly legal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cordray announced today that he filed a lawsuit against
Ally in state court, claiming its GMAC unit committed fraud and
violated state consumer law by filing false affidavits in
foreclosure proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Bank of America and Ally have curtailed
foreclosures or evictions in 23 states where courts have
jurisdiction over home seizures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While homeowners in those states and elsewhere must usually
show damages to win a lawsuit, &#8220;attorneys general can just sue
over deceptive sales practices and get penalties,&#8221; said
Christopher Peterson, a University of Utah law professor who
specializes in commercial and contract law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ohio Penalties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ohio, penalties include fines of up to $25,000 per
violation, with each false affidavit or document considered a
violation, according to state law enforcement officials. In
Iowa, fines rise to a maximum of $40,000 for each violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This penalty would apply to &#8220;every instance of an
affidavit that was filed improperly or every time facts were
attested to that weren&#8217;t true,&#8221; Cordray said. His counterpart
in Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, has called for a freeze on
foreclosures and said the submissions are a &#8220;possible fraud on
the court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials in Ohio and Connecticut, along with Florida,
Texas, North Carolina, Iowa and Illinois, said they are
investigating mortgage foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general in Colorado and California asked Ally&#8217;s
GMAC unit to halt foreclosures in their states. GMAC and
Colorado Attorney General John W. Suthers plan to meet to
discuss the matter, said Mike Saccone, spokesman for Suthers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Talking to Them&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re talking to them,&#8221; Jim Finefrock, spokesman for
California Attorney General Jerry Brown, said in a telephone
interview about Detroit-based Ally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley yesterday
asked GMAC, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo  Co. to
suspend foreclosures and evictions in that state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper said today he
was expanding his investigation into questionable foreclosure
tactics to include 14 more lenders. Cooper, who announced
earlier he was looking into allegations about GMAC, also asked
lenders to stop foreclosures in his state until they can confirm
they are complying with laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the investigation of Ally which began last
month, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott on Oct. 4 asked 30
loan servicers operating in his state -- including Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America and New York-based JPMorgan
-- to stop foreclosures pending a review of business practices.
Abbott also asked lenders and servicers to halt &#8220;all sales of
properties previously foreclosed upon&#8221; and stop all evictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Fronts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders took possession of a record 95,364 U.S. homes in
August and issued foreclosure filings to 338,836 homeowners, or
one of every 381 U.S. households, according to RealtyTrac Inc.,
an Irvine, California-based data seller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders, loan servicers and even title insurance companies
are facing litigation on multiple fronts, said Peter Henning, a
law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and a former
federal prosecutor who worked on cases involving bank fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to become a hydra,&#8221; he said in an
interview. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got so many potential avenues of liability.
You don&#8217;t even know the parameters of this yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews of affidavits and other loan documents that may
have been signed without personal examination by the signers
should be completed in a few weeks, JPMorgan and Bank of America
said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the accuracy of the factual loan information
contained in the affidavits was not affected by whether or not
the signer had personal knowledge of the precise details,&#8221;
JPMorgan said in its statement. &#8220;The affidavits were prepared
by appropriate personnel with knowledge of the relevant facts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Spokesman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to comment
further yesterday and a call to Dan Frahm, a spokesman for Bank
of America, wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe the procedural errors in these
affidavits led to inappropriate foreclosures,&#8221; Gina Proia, a
spokeswoman for Ally, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lenders have acknowledged that employees may have
completed court affidavits without confirming their accuracy. In
December, a GMAC employee said in a deposition in a foreclosure
case filed in West Palm Beach, Florida, that his team of 13
people signed about 10,000 documents a month without verifying
their accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My suspicion is that this will wind up being an
industrywide issue,&#8221; said Patrick Madigan, an Iowa assistant
attorney general. &#8220;Many companies were using robo-signers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iowa Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His boss, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, is
investigating GMAC, JPMorgan, Bank of America and OneWest Bank,
the successor to IndyMac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would intend to pursue any company that is engaged in
this behavior,&#8221; Madigan said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowners in multiple lawsuits claim lenders have been
using falsified documents to foreclose on homes, at times when
they don&#8217;t even hold titles to the properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of false affidavits will stall foreclosures for
months and will aid homeowners fighting to retain their
properties, University of Utah&#8217;s Peterson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re seeing right now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
making it harder to foreclose and recover costs for a bad
loan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for some homeowners blame Reston, Virginia-based
Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc., or MERS, which
handles mortgage transfers between member banks. Multiple
lawsuits claim that the system allows false foreclosures and
muddies ownership of titles. MERS has denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kentucky Homeowners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed on behalf of Kentucky homeowners last
week, plaintiffs claimed banks, MERS and loan servicers filed
mortgages with forged signatures, submitted foreclosure actions
months before they acquired any legal interest in the properties
and falsely claimed to own notes executed with mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karmela Lejarde, a spokeswoman for MERS, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banks have to be very concerned about class-action
lawsuits,&#8221; Peterson said. &#8220;I guarantee there are all sorts of
class-action lawyers brainstorming, trying to figure out ways to
file these lawsuits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers in the average foreclosure case haven&#8217;t made a
payment in more than a year, said Guy Cecala, publisher of
Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. More than 5
million homes are in the process of foreclosure, so millions of
people are living mortgage-free right now, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Screwed Up&#8217; Paperwork &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is what kind of deals the plaintiffs&#8217;
attorneys will reach with lenders,&#8221; Cecala said. &#8220;If someone
hasn&#8217;t made any mortgage payments in a year, are we really going
to give them a home just because someone screwed up the
paperwork?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title insurers will also face -- and file -- lawsuits,
Wayne State&#8217;s Henning said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you foreclose on a house and sell it,&#8221; the title
should be certain, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title insurers will be &#8220;on the hook if foreclosures are
reopened,&#8221; Henning said. &#8220;The title insurers will be going
after the banks or whoever assured them there was a clear
title.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fidelity National Financial Corp. (FNF), the largest U.S. title
insurer, and First American Financial Co. (FAF), the second-largest,
have declined more than 5 percent since Sept. 30 over concerns
that investigations into foreclosures would cause legal problems
affecting title companies. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 index of
large U.S. stocks has gained about 1.7 percent in that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adverse Impact &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Questionable foreclosures will ultimately have little
adverse impact&#8221; on new owners of properties or title insurance
claims, the American Land Title Association said in an Oct. 1
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a new homeowner&#8217;s title is challenged because of a
faulty foreclosure, the title insurer may have an obligation to
defend the challenge,&#8221; Kurt Pfotenhauer, chief executive
officer of the trade group, said in the release. &#8220;However, it
is unlikely that a court will take property from an innocent
current homeowner and return it to a previous homeowner who
failed to make payments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who signed false affidavits or falsely claimed
clear titles to properties can be subject to criminal
prosecution, including perjury charges, Peterson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations would probably face obstruction charges rather
than perjury, according to legal experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Did they know about gaps in the system and lie about
it,&#8221; Henning said, referring to companies. &#8220;This is certainly
a concern for MERS but it could be, too, for the banks. Any
action of any employee can be looked at, but what they&#8217;re
looking at is the volume of transactions and the involvement of
senior level management.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More civil litigation is a certainty, Henning said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sandstorm is coming,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can see it off
in the distance and know it&#8217;s about to hit, but no one knows how
long it&#8217;s going to last.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elizabeth Lopatto and Tom Randall" date="Oct 06, 2010  4:25 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-06/pfizer-to-review-strategic-alternatives-for-capsugel.html"><headline>Pfizer May Sell Capsugel Unit, Maker of Drug Capsules</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. may sell its Capsugel
business, which makes gelatin capsules for drugs and dietary
supplements, after a review that will be completed in the first
quarter of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capsugel, the smallest of Pfizer&#8217;s nine business units, had
revenue of $740 million last year. Pfizer is &#8220;reviewing
strategic alternatives,&#8221; which may include a sale, the New
York-based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, is looking to offset
some of the revenue it will start losing next year, when the
company faces competition from cheaper generic copies of its
cholesterol pill Lipitor, which had $11.4 billion in sales last
year. Pfizer gained Capsugel with its acquisition of Warner-
Lambert Co. for $116 billion in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer has the Lipitor patent coming up and they might
just want the extra cash to bolster themselves,&#8221; said Les Funtleyder, a health-care analyst with New York-based Miller
Tabak  Co., in a telephone interview. &#8220;Capsugel is an asset
that seems like it might be better off somewhere else. If you&#8217;re
Pfizer, do you really want what amounts to be an outsourcing and
manufacturing business?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funtleyder said Capsugel won&#8217;t demand a &#8220;massive premium
price,&#8221; because it is largely a manufacturing business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer hired Morgan Stanley to conduct a strategic review
for the unit, a process that will be completed by the end of the
first quarter of next year, according to today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 3 cents to $17.26 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has declined 5.1 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every health-care spinoff in the last 15 years has
increased shareholder value, wrote analyst Jami Rubin of Goldman
Sachs in a Sept. 21 note. Pfizer would have the most to gain of
all the big pharmaceutical companies from a spinoff, she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman rates Pfizer a &#8220;buy,&#8221; &#8220;but see further upside
potential if they took aggressive action to unlock value in non-
core assets,&#8221; wrote Rubin, who is based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidney J. Weinberg Jr., a senior
director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall Street firm once
led by his father and his younger brother, has died. He was 87. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinberg, known as Jim, died on Oct. 4 of prostate cancer,
according to a memo sent to Goldman Sachs employees by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn. He &#8220;maintained his office
at the firm and his influence upon our people until his death,&#8221;
the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Weinberg was affiliated with Goldman Sachs for 45
years, he played a less prominent role at the firm than his late
father, Sidney J. Weinberg, who was chief executive officer from
1939 to 1969, or his late brother, John L. Weinberg, who ran the
company from 1976 until 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinberg treasured privacy and argued successfully at a
1986 partners&#8217; meeting against taking the firm public, according
to the book &#8220;Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success&#8221; by Lisa Endlich (Knopf, 1999). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jimmy told the group that the proposal made no sense.
Goldman Sachs had a heritage, and he was on the side of
preserving it,&#8221; Endlich wrote. &#8220;He would feel uncomfortable
reading about partners in the newspapers, of having the details
of their financial situation made available for public
consumption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs went public in 1999, later than many of its
U.S. competitors, and 11 years after Weinberg retired from a
full-time role at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joins Goldman Sachs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidney James Weinberg Jr. was born in Scarsdale, New York,
on March 27, 1923. He served in the Philippines as a first
lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War II. Weinberg
received a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Princeton University and then
a master&#8217;s in business administration from Harvard University in
1949. He worked as a vice president of the textile division at
Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., now Owens Corning Inc., before
joining Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking department in 1965. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a decade beginning in 1978, Weinberg ran the firm&#8217;s
investment-banking services department, a unit created by former
Goldman Sachs Co-Chairman John C. Whitehead to help manage
client relationships and win business. Weinberg retired from the
general partnership in 1988 when he turned 65. He remained a
limited partner until the firm went public and then became a
senior director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture Carrier &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jim was one of the most important culture carriers&#8221; at
Goldman Sachs, Whitehead said in a telephone interview. &#8220;He was
an advocate of team play, no internal ugly competition, service
to customers, putting the customers&#8217; interests before the firm&#8217;s
interests and all of those good things that make a
partnership.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also the &#8220;model&#8221; banker for winning new business
from clients, said Whitehead. &#8220;We had a lot of good ones, but I
can&#8217;t say that anyone was his equal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He had
personality, judgment, knowledge of the products, and a good
sales ability. His clients were his friends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas S. Murphy, the former chairman and chief executive
officer of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., was a close friend of
Weinberg since they attended Harvard Business School together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His whole reputation in the business world was as a
person of honesty and integrity,&#8221; said Murphy. &#8220;We had to sell
a lot of things when we bought ABC, and he did a great job. You
could really count on Jim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unpretentious, Congenial&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book on the history of Goldman Sachs, &#8220;The
Partnership&#8221; (Penguin Press, 2008), author Charles D. Ellis
described Weinberg as his younger brother&#8217;s &#8220;closest and most
objective confidant and adviser on policy and strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jim Weinberg was consistently unpretentious, congenial,
and insightful,&#8221; Ellis wrote. &#8220;He took subways and once, at a
fabulous Los Angeles restaurant, asked the captain, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you
have anything less expensive?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Friedman, a Goldman Sachs board member and a former
chairman of the firm, remembered working with Weinberg when
Friedman was a junior mergers and acquisitions banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d watch Jim pace things, giving the client a chance to
think and adjust to what he was saying,&#8221; Friedman said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;He was quite good at the strategic
pause.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinberg&#8217;s success with clients was &#8220;no magic potion,&#8221;
Friedman said. &#8220;He just had a great demeanor, and people would
develop confidence in him because he wasn&#8217;t pandering to them,
he would tell them what he thought.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identified With Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert E. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs who
later became U.S. Treasury secretary and chairman of Citigroup
Inc., also singled out Weinberg&#8217;s skill with customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I watched Jim as he dealt with clients and I learned a
lot about how to deal with people more generally,&#8221; Rubin said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;He was very effective at relating to
what they cared about and what their issues were and then really
identifying with them and helping them solve their problems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last five years, Weinberg served on the board of
directors of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the company&#8217;s
philanthropic arm that was created in 1999. He was also a senior
trustee of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, a
life trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and a
trustee emeritus and former chairman of the board of trustees of
Scripps College in Claremont, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinberg was also the founding chairman of the board of the
Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences in Claremont,
California, and an honorary trustee and honorary member of the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod in
Massachusetts. In 2005, he was elected a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts  Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinberg, who died at his home in Marion, Massachusetts, is
survived by his wife of 59 years, Elizabeth &#8220;Betty&#8221; Houghton
Weinberg; six children, Jay, Alan, Laurie, Betsy, Sydney and
Peter, 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment banks in India face
pressure on fees as competition intensifies for state asset
sales in a record year for equity offerings, said the head of
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s local operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t start the low-fee game. But we now have to
pitch lower fees if we want to be on deals since everyone is
doing it,&#8221; Kalpana Morparia said in an interview in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among six banks that agreed to split a fee of
less than one paisa (0.02 cent) for underwriting the latest
state deal, a secondary sale of shares in Steel Authority of
India Ltd., according to two people with knowledge of the
matter. Banks must match the lowest fees to win work on state
deals, according to government guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm, ranked first globally in managing
equity sales, slipped to eighth in India this year for domestic
stock sales and rights offerings from sixth in 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup is No. 1 this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t look at our rankings on the basis of just
domestic deals,&#8221; Morparia, 61, said. &#8220;We weigh ourselves on
all the deals done for an Indian company, overseas or
domestically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan won assignments to work on two
other state deals in the past three months: A stake sale in
Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. and an initial public
offering of Manganese Ore (India) Ltd. It will earn near-zero
fees for those transactions as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A bank could lose anywhere between 20 million and 40
million rupees ($895,000) on deals that don&#8217;t pay any fees,&#8221;
said S. Venkatraghavan, head of equity capital markets at IDFC
Capital Ltd. in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Guidelines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses from share sales in government-owned companies won&#8217;t
affect JPMorgan&#8217;s profit &#8220;significantly&#8221; because there&#8217;s also
a &#8220;huge private sector pipeline&#8221; with higher commissions, said
Morparia. &#8220;India is making good money for the JP franchise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Sensex Index on the Bombay Stock Exchange has
gained 17.6 percent this year, making it the best performer
among the world&#8217;s 10 largest stock markets. Indian companies
raised 753 billion rupees in equity and rights offerings in
2010, 33 percent more than in the same period in 2007, the
record year for domestic equity issuance, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 95 companies have lodged draft offer documents
with the securities regulator seeking approval for initial share
sales, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, &#8220;small deals usually pay more for the banks than
being one of five or 10 banks on a large mandate,&#8221; Morparia
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#8217;t Blame System &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s selection process isn&#8217;t to blame for low
investment-banking fees, Disinvestment Secretary Sumit Bose said
in an interview on Sept. 30. The government tweaked the bidding
process this year to score a bank&#8217;s proposal 70 percent on its
technical presentation and 30 percent on its fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This system in no way asks for zero bids or near-zero
bids, it just asks for competitive bids and that&#8217;s the way we
would like to proceed,&#8221; Bose said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morparia said she agrees with that assessment. &#8220;The
government&#8217;s bidding system is not to blame for near-zero fee
bids. This is a function of intense competition,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s government plans to raise 400 billion rupees from
state share sales in the year through to March 31. It has met 5
percent of that target so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government aims to sell shares in eight companies in
the remaining six months of the fiscal year, starting with Coal
India Ltd. Its IPO is expected to raise more than $3 billion,
said people involved in the deal, making it India&#8217;s largest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty banks, including JPMorgan, bid to manage the share
sale, according to disinvestment department notices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India is one of the most competitive markets in the
region, and it&#8217;s not one of the most profitable,&#8221; Morparia
said. &#8220;Yet banks want to expand here because the country is
growing at a phenomenal pace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG hired Greg Kuppenheimer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a managing director
and co-head of equity structuring for North America, at least
the third senior-level hire from its U.S. rival in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppenheimer will be based in New York and report to Amit Bordia, head of the equity structuring group, according to Renee Calabro, a spokeswoman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank,
Germany&#8217;s largest lender. Kuppenheimer was co-head of equity
structured products and a managing director at New York-based
Goldman Sachs, Calabro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is expanding its equities business in the U.S.
as Anshu Jain, who took over as the firm&#8217;s sole head of the
corporate and investment bank in July, spends 1.6 billion euros
($2.2 billion) on hiring and technology over two years to gain
market share in U.S. equities and commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppenheimer will be responsible for helping to create
structured notes, over-the-counter derivatives and other
products, Calabro said. Structured notes are bonds that have
been bundled with derivatives, or contracts whose value is
derived from stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank has sold $1.5 billion of structured notes to
U.S. investors this year, the seventh-highest total among banks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn&#8217;t include
private placements, or sales to institutions that aren&#8217;t
reported to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppenheimer also will be head of structured equity sales
in North America in the company&#8217;s markets division, where he
will report to Derek Capanna, head of institutional equity sales
for North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank in August hired Ted Wasserman away from
Goldman Sachs to be head of equity derivatives flow sales for
North America and last month retained Marcelo Pizzimbono, also
from Goldman Sachs, as head of New York research sales. The firm
in July also appointed Dixit Joshi, formerly of Barclays Plc, as
head of equities for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
Francesco Garzarelli and Mike Vaknin lowered their year-end
forecast for the yield on the 10-year German bund to 2.40
percent from 2.70 percent, according to an e-mailed note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts cut their forecasts for Europe&#8217;s benchmark
government debt security through June, because action by the
U.S. Federal Reserve to boost the economy will crimp interest
rates, according to the note. They retained their estimate for
the end of next year at 3.30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bund yield fell 7 basis points to 2.22 percent as of
4:32 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised its
forecasts for the euro against the dollar on the expectation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will step up asset purchases at
its November interest-rates meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro will trade at $1.40 in three months, $1.50 in six
months and $1.55 in 12 months, Dominic Wilson, a senior global
economist at Goldman Sachs in New York wrote in a research
report today. The bank did not say what its previous forecasts
were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market has responded to the expectation of QE2 in a
way that is broadly consistent with our work on the first round
of QE, sending bond yields lower, equities higher and the USD
weaker,&#8221; Wilson wrote, referring to so-called quantitative
easing. &#8220;The move in the dollar has been particularly striking
and relevant for the broader global picture. While our last FX
monthly laid out our long-standing view of dollar weakness,
things have unfolded more rapidly than our original forecasts
anticipated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of technology company
executives led by IBM Corp. chairman Samuel J. Palmisano is
releasing a report saying the federal government could save $1
trillion by 2020 through more efficient use of computers and
information systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives, who include Michael Dell, chairman and
chief executive of Dell Inc., say in the report they plan to
present to government officials that better use of existing
technology would save money by consolidating data centers and
networks, cutting duplication and providing better tracking of
fraud and waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our report contains straightforward, proven ways to pare
back $1 trillion from the deficit while increasing productivity
and enabling sustainable competitiveness,&#8221; Dell said in a
statement issued by Technology CEO Council, a Washington-based
advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has fallen behind private industry in
adopting new systems for information processing, administration
officials said earlier this year. President Barack Obama in
April created an advisory board of business executives to
recommend ways to streamline government operations using
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then-budget director Peter Orszag said in June that closing
the &#8220;IT gap&#8221; will be a key step in finding the savings needed
to shrink the deficit, which is forecast by the administration
to hit a record $1.47 trillion in the 2010 fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Meetings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano will be talking with administration officials
today, joined by Steven R. Appleton, chairman and chief
executive of Micron Technology Inc., Greg Brown, president and
co-chief executive of Motorola Inc., Paul Otellini, president
and chief executive of Intel Corp., Michael Splinter, president
and chief executive of Applied Materials Inc. and Joseph Tucci,
chairman, president and chief executive of EMC Corp., according
to Tom Galvin, a spokesman for the council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report, titled &#8220;One Trillion Reasons,&#8221; says the
savings can be achieved while improving government services and
enhancing job growth. For example, it says as much as 30 percent
of the $76 billion spent to support and manage information
technology systems could be trimmed through consolidation of
systems and standardizing applications. Greater use of digital
records management would save $50 billion over 10 years,
according to the council&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the report was given to the 18-member panel
created by Obama to recommend ways of cutting the deficit,
Galvin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re serious about helping to provide solutions for the
mounting debt crisis,&#8221; Dell said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Wes Goodman" date="Oct 06, 2010 12:46 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-06/oldman-sachs-says-u-s-economy-to-be-fairly-bad-recession-is-possible.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Says U.S. Economy May Be `Fairly Bad''</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the U.S.
economy is likely to be &#8220;fairly bad&#8221; or &#8220;very bad&#8221; over the
next six to nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see two main scenarios,&#8221; analysts led by Jan Hatzius,
the New York-based chief U.S. economist at the company, wrote in
an e-mail to clients. &#8220;A fairly bad one in which the economy
grows at a 1 1/2 percent to 2 percent rate through the middle of
next year and the unemployment rate rises moderately to 10
percent, and a very bad one in which the economy returns to an
outright recession.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve will probably move to spur growth as
soon as its next meeting on Nov. 2-3, Hatzius said. Expectations
for central bank action have already led to lower interest rates,
higher stock prices and a weaker dollar, according to Goldman,
one of the 18 primary dealers that are required to bid at
government debt sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his fellow policy makers
are debating whether to increase Treasury purchases to spur the
U.S. economy by keeping borrowing costs low. U.S. five-year
yields dropped to a record 1.1755 percent today amid signs the
recovery is losing momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;fairly bad&#8221; outlook for slow growth and rising
unemployment without a recession will probably be the one that
occurs, the e-mail said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Shigeru Sato and Yuji Okada" date="Oct 07, 2010  9:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-07/barclays-hires-ex-goldman-sachs-energy-banker-in-japan-to-drive-hedging.html"><headline>Barclays Hires Ex-Goldman Sachs Energy Banker for Japan Hedging</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc hired former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. oil banker Yumi Hiramoto to meet demand from
Japanese refiners and trading houses for hedging commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiramoto, 27, joined Barclays Capital Japan Ltd.&#8217;s
commodities division yesterday, Tokyo-based spokeswoman
Marina Totsuka said. She takes charge of oil and natural gas
derivatives sales, said two people with direct knowledge of
the matter, declining to be identified because her job
specification hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest bank wants to capture demand
for crude and metals derivatives, tools used by refiners,
utilities, airlines and trading houses to mitigate the risk
of fluctuations in fuel costs and the value of their stakes
in overseas oil fields and mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Japanese trading houses and explorers may expand
investment in overseas oil and gas assets after the yen&#8217;s recent
strength helped lower their acquisition costs,&#8221; said Ken Hasegawa, commodities-derivatives sales manager at brokerage
Newedge in Tokyo. &#8220;Demand for commodities derivatives could
increase as these buyers of energy assets seek to reduce the
risks of a swing in the value of overseas holdings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiramoto has four years&#8217; experience in energy risk hedging,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas natural-resource takeover and investment deals
by Japanese companies reached 710 billion yen ($8.6 billion)
in the nine months ended Sept. 30 this year, according to an Oct.
5 report compiled by Recof Data Corp., a unit of Tokyo-based
mergers and acquisitions adviser Recof Corp. The figure breached
the record annual-high of 577 billion yen set in 2008, the
report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsui  Co.&#8217;s February $1.4 billion purchase of a stake in
the Marcellus Shale gas project led Japanese natural-resource
investments abroad this year. The country&#8217;s second-biggest
trading house said it will spend at least $3 billion to move
ahead with the $25 billion project operated by Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Corp., Japan&#8217;s largest trader, followed suit. It
clinched a C$250 million ($246 million) acquisition agreement in
August with Penn West Energy Trust for a stake in the Cordova
shale-gas project in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays hired Marubeni Corp. oil trader Hiroyuki Oda
last October to boost sales of derivatives as swings in crude
and refined product prices lowered profits at Japanese
refiners and utilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yen&#8217;s Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and metals swaps typically allow utilities and
manufacturers to pay a fixed price for a commodity while
another party, usually a bank, pays a floating price, based
on market benchmarks. If the benchmark goes up during the
term of the contract, the utility gets money from the bank,
and if it goes down, the utility pays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen today traded near the strongest level against the
dollar in more than 15 years as speculation increased that the
U.S. Federal Reserve will step up purchases of government debt
to support the recovery. The dollar stood at 82.38 yen at 8:44
a.m. in Tokyo from 82.41 yen in New York yesterday when it
touched 82.11, the lowest since May 1995. &lt;/p&gt;

Regan and Aaron Ricadela" date="Oct 07, 2010  8:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-07/adobe-shares-surge-on-report-of-microsoft-s-interest-in-merger.html"><headline>Adobe Shares Surge on Report of Microsoft''s Interest in Merger</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Adobe Systems Inc. shares surged as
much as 17 percent after the New York Times reported that
Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer recently
met with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives recently had a meeting at Adobe&#8217;s offices in
San Francisco, according to two people familiar with the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the New York Times reported that the discussion
centered on Apple Inc.&#8217;s control of the mobile-phone market and
how the two companies could work together to compete, the Times
said. A possible acquisition of Adobe by Microsoft was among the
options, according to the newspaper&#8217;s Bits blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Adobe and Microsoft share millions of customers around the
world and the CEOs of the two companies do meet from time to
time,&#8221; said Charles Sipkins, a spokesman for Adobe. He declined
to comment on the &#8220;timing or topics of their private meetings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe rose $2.96, or 12 percent, to $28.69 at 4 p.m. on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. Earlier in the session, the shares jumped
as high as $30, triggering the circuit breaker halt for five
minutes. The stock has declined 22 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe has clashed with Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who banned
Adobe&#8217;s flash video software from Apple&#8217;s mobile devices. Adobe
won a partial victory on Sept. 9, when Apple eased restrictions
on creating applications for its iPhone and iPad devices. Apple
had barred developers from using Adobe&#8217;s Flash video software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rival Standard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the change didn&#8217;t let Flash apps run inside the
browser on Apple devices, and that&#8217;s a larger concern, Jeff Gaggin, an analyst at Avian Securities Inc. in New York, said
last month. Apple, which dominates the market for mobile apps,
is promoting an Internet standard called HTML5 instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, which included a &#8220;small entourage of
deputies,&#8221; Ballmer and Adobe discussed how they might counter
Apple&#8217;s position in smartphones, the New York Times reported.
The companies had held informal discussions about a Microsoft
acquisition of Adobe several years ago, according to the report.
Adobe has a market value of $15.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman at Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe forecast sales last month that fell short of
analysts&#8217; estimates, sending the shares down the most in eight
years. Cash-strapped schools aren&#8217;t paying for as many copies of
the product, which includes Photoshop and Illustrator, the San
Jose, California-based company said. The sluggish economy in
Japan, typically Adobe&#8217;s biggest Asian market, also hampered
sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.
rose to the highest level since it went public in 1915 as
investors show support for Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano&#8217;s strategy of remaking the 99-year-old company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM gained 88 cents to $138.72 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, topping the previous record of
$137.88, adjusting for stock splits, reached in July 1999.
Palmisano has focused on services and software, making the
company once known for mainframe computers into the world&#8217;s
biggest computer-services provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Palmisano became CEO in March 2002, IBM shares have
risen a third as he divested hardware units, including the
personal-computer business sold to China&#8217;s Lenovo Group Ltd. in
2005. In May, he said he expects Armonk, New York-based IBM to
almost double operating earnings to $20 a share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more profitable software and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares are also benefiting as investors predict
corporate customers will invest in information technology, said
Lou Miscioscia, an analyst at Collins Stewart Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a big concern investors had about IT succumbing
to the macro slowing -- that was overblown,&#8221; said Boston-based
Miscioscia, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the shares and has the
highest price target of any analyst tracked by Bloomberg, at
$160. &#8220;Companies continue to want to invest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has also boosted shares by buying its own stock. Since
2002, the company has spent more than $68 billion on buybacks,
equal to almost 39 percent of its current market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help From HP &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 26 analysts who rate IBM, 18 recommend buying,
including nine who predict the stock will reach at least $150.
Eight analysts recommend holding the shares and none recommend
selling them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes IBM, lost
19.07 points today to 10,948.58. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares are also likely gaining as investors leave its
closest rival, Hewlett-Packard Co., amid uncertainty at the
company, Miscioscia said. HP&#8217;s CEO Mark Hurd retired Aug. 6
after an investigation found he violated business-conduct
standards. Last week, HP hired Leo Apotheker, former CEO of
software maker SAP AG, to replace him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given that the new CEO at HP has to prove himself, that
does create more of a cloud of uncertainty,&#8221; Miscioscia said.
HP shares have dropped 12 percent since the announcement of
Hurd&#8217;s departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that became IBM was incorporated on June 16,
1911, as Computer Tabulating Recording Co. Created by a merger
of three businesses, CTR sold items ranging from punched cards
to cheese slicers, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, Gerstner &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas J. Watson Sr., known as IBM&#8217;s founder, joined the
company in 1914. He became president less than a year later, and
began focusing on building large tabulating machines for
businesses. In 1924, after expanding the company outside the
U.S. and building other corporate machines, he changed the name
to International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1993, the company had posted three straight years of
losses, including $8.1 billion that year. The company faced a
possible breakup when IBM chose Lou Gerstner as its chief that
year -- the first time IBM went outside the company for a CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He helped increase the share price about ninefold by
cutting thousands of jobs, keeping the company&#8217;s units together
and marketing software and services along with hardware.
Gerstner wrote a book about his experience called &#8220;Who Says
Elephants Can&#8217;t Dance?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Investments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano continued the transition of what was once the
world&#8217;s largest computer maker. The focus on software and
services has helped expand IBM&#8217;s gross-profit margins more than
8.5 percentage points since he took over. He&#8217;s spent more than
$20 billion on over 100 purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Palmisano said he plans to spend another $20
billion in acquisitions through 2015. Last month, IBM announced
three acquisitions, including the $1.7 billion deal for storage-
analytics maker Netezza Corp. and a purchase of software maker
OpenPages Inc. for an undisclosed sum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is investing in markets such as analytics software,
which helps companies predict trends, and cloud computing, which
lets them store and access information on shared servers. The
company is also developing services to monitor highways,
electrical grids and other infrastructure systems to help them
run more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth in
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said. The software segment, the
company&#8217;s most profitable, will make up about half of total
profit by then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, agreed to buy the North American
natural-gas and power-trading book from a joint venture between
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Sempra Energy for about
$220 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale, which requires regulatory approval from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, completes the divestiture
of the last of the principle assets of the venture, San Diego-
based Sempra said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sempra, the owner of the largest U.S. natural-gas utility,
expects to take a third-quarter charge of $50 million to $150
million to reflect a reduction in its investment in the venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS is being forced to sell its commodities unit to comply
with European Union rules after getting 45.5 billion pounds
($70.9 billion) in the biggest bailout of a U.K. bank. The
lender bought a controlling stake in the venture in 2008 as
banks expanded commodity-trading operations, driven by rising
interest in gold, oil and other raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 1, Sempra and RBS, based in Edinburgh, completed a
$1.7 billion sale to JPMorgan of the venture&#8217;s metals, oil and
European power and gas business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS said in a separate e-mailed statement that its share of
today&#8217;s sale is $112 million. The financial effect of the sale
of the entire venture is expected to be breakeven, the bank
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sempra expects its share of the proceeds of the sale from
the entire venture and related cash distributions to total $1.8
billion to $1.9 billion. Sempra fell 20 cents to $53.89 at 4:04
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp.&#8217;s Kazakh oil venture is
expected to submit an expansion plan next year for the Central
Asian country&#8217;s largest producing oil field, Oil  Gas Minister
Sauat Mynbayev said today in Almaty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mynbayev didn&#8217;t answer questions about the budget or
planned output increases at the TengizChevroil LLP project.
Linsi Crain, an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for the venture wasn&#8217;t
immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, KazMunaiGaz National Co. Chief Executive
Officer Kairgeldy Kabyldin said TengizChevroil plans to invest
$15.2 billion to boost oil output at the country&#8217;s largest
producing field to 36.4 million metric tons a year after 2016.
The state-run energy company owns 20 percent of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s cost and production estimates exceed those
given by TengizChevroil in October 2009. The venture said then
it may spend $10 billion on boosting oil output at the onshore
field by about 12 million metric tons by the end of 2016. It
produced 22.53 million metric tons last year, an increase of 30
percent from the previous year. The venture&#8217;s oil output is
expected to total 640 million tons from 2016 to 2032, Kabyldin
said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron holds 50 percent of
TengizChevroil, Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent and OAO
Lukoil&#8217;s Lukarco has 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dollar may fall further as
trading patterns suggest it&#8217;s not yet &#8220;oversold,&#8221; according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any gain in the dollar should be taken as an opportunity to
add to a short position, or a bet that the asset will decline,
the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency dropped to a 15-year low against the yen today
amid growing expectations the Federal Reserve will expand credit
easing to sustain the U.S. recovery. The dollar fell 8.4 percent
against its major trading peers in the past three months, making
it the worst-performing currency during that period, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While our short-term momentum metrics are oversold, the
more important medium-term studies have yet to reach an oversold
extreme,&#8221; Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan in
New York, wrote in a research note received today. &#8220;There is
still little evidence of a sustained reversal at this point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar declined 0.5 percent against the yen to 82.49
yen as of 11:30 a.m. in London. One euro fetched $1.3977 from
$1.3930 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moving average convergence divergence charts, or MACD,
one of the tools O&#8217;Connor used for the analysis, is calculated
by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the
12-day average. A nine-day moving average of the MACD, called
the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a
trigger for buy or sell signals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should be &#8220;long&#8221;
commodities, including crude oil, copper, corn, sugar and
palladium, as holdings will return 17 percent over the next 12
months, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited supply in agricultural products and industrial
metals combined with stronger-than-predicted demand will boost
prices, said bank analysts Colin Fenton and Matthew Lehmann in
the report dated yesterday. The bank&#8217;s projection is based on
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GCSI Total Return Index, which declined
1.6 percent in the year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent positive manufacturing purchasing managers
index out of China and stronger-than-expected physical commodity
demand in crude oil and industrial metals lead us to move to a
net long position,&#8221; the analysts said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Total Return Index pared declines this year as
New York-traded oil jumped 11 percent last month and sugar
soared 19 percent. Severe weather from Asia to the Americas and
production cuts trimmed supplies of wheat, rubber and copper,
JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium will advance to $700 an ounce over the next six
to 12 months, said Fenton and Lehmann. &#8220;Supply disruptions
(strikes) could be very supportive, along with solid emerging
markets&#8217; physical demand for the auto sector,&#8221; they said in the
report. Cash metal has climbed almost 47 percent this year,
beating gold, silver and platinum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper is likely to test new highs as metal stockpiles
diminish at a time when demand from China, the world&#8217;s largest
consumer, picks up, the analysts said. Benchmark three-month
copper, trading close to a 27-month high, reached a record
$8,940 a metric ton in July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and global bond markets are
&#8220;some distance&#8221; from a bubble after this year&#8217;s rally, in the
face of a slowdown in growth and the prospect of the Federal
Reserve buying more securities, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Conditioned on the current, relatively weak,
macroeconomic background and assuming that short-term policy
rates are &#8216;appropriate,&#8217; our models suggest that the major bond
markets are some distance from being in a bubble,&#8221; London-based
analysts Aqib Aslam and Michael Vaknin said in a report dated
yesterday. While &#8220;Switzerland, Norway and Sweden stand out as
the most &#8216;expensive&#8217; bond markets,&#8221; they&#8217;ve also not reached
the threshold Goldman uses to define a bubble, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software company, said it will require employees to contribute
to their health-care benefits starting in 2013, citing the
rising cost of providing worker coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 95 percent of the company&#8217;s roughly 90,000 employees
have benefits covered completely, Lou Gellos, a spokesman for
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, said in an interview today.
He said he didn&#8217;t know what portion employees will be asked to
provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cost of health care has, over the years, increased
dramatically,&#8221; Gellos said in an interview today. &#8220;The
projections going forward have them going way up, and in order
to be sustainable, some sort of evolution of our health benefit
was necessary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the largest companies in the U.S. project a median
8.3 percent increase in health-care costs next year, according
to the National Business Group on Health, a Washington-based
nonprofit organization. Microsoft may be considering a &#8220;modest&#8221;
change in benefits, said Helen Darling, the group&#8217;s president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even with the evolution and changes they have in mind,
which I think are modest, it will still be way up there in terms
of comprehensiveness and relatively low cost to the employee,&#8221;
Darling said. Her group has nearly 300 members, including
Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average U.S. employee contribution to health-care plans
is 20 percent, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gained 4 cents to $24.57 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. The stock has declined 19 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks gained, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average above 11,000 for the first time since
before the May 6 crash, as worse-than-estimated jobs data raised
speculation the Federal Reserve will enact stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa Inc. rose 5.7 percent after beating profit estimates.
CF Industries Holdings Inc., Deere  Co. and Monsanto Co. surged
more than 4.1 percent as the U.S. government cut crop supply
forecasts. Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc. dropped at
least 6.7 percent on concern feed costs will rise. J.C. Penney
Co. and Fortune Brands Inc. rallied more than 2.6 percent after
Pershing Square Capital Management LP disclosed stakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to
1,165.15 at 4 p.m. in New York and earlier exceeded 1,165.90,
its closing level the day before the May 6 plunge. The Dow
gained 57.90 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,006.48. The dollar
slid below 82 yen for the first time since 1995 amid bets the
Fed will purchase Treasuries, a tactic know as quantitative
easing, to inject cash into the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The data are disappointing in terms of both overall
levels and the dynamics of job creation,&#8221; Mohamed A. El-Erian,
chief executive at Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs
the world&#8217;s biggest bond fund, wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg
News. &#8220;They increase the probability of the Fed implementing
additional QE.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekly Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 40 stocks in the SP 500 rose to 52-week highs
today. The index rose 1.7 percent this week, including the 2.1
percent advance on Oct. 5 amid speculation the Fed would join
the Bank of Japan in taking steps to safeguard the recovery. The
gauge is down 4.3 percent from this year&#8217;s high in April on
concern U.S. unemployment and widening budget deficits in Europe
will derail global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department report that the nation lost 95,000
jobs last month was the latest evidence that the recovery from
the recession may be faltering. The data signals the Fed may buy
$1.2 trillion of Treasuries as a way to inject more cash into
the economy and spur growth, Bill Gross, who runs the world&#8217;s
biggest bond fund at Pimco, said in a radio interview on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of jobs lost last month was 19 times the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. It was led by a
decline in government payrolls that shows the damage being done
by rising budget deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Streak &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private payrolls that exclude government agencies climbed
64,000, less than forecast, underscoring the concern expressed
by some Fed policy makers that the economic recovery may require
easier monetary policy. The unemployment rate held at 9.6
percent and has equaled or exceeded 9.5 percent for 14
consecutive months, the longest span of elevated joblessness
since monthly records began in 1948. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This data supports the prevailing idea that quantitative
easing is coming by the Fed,&#8221; said Linda Bakhshian, who manages
equity-income funds at Federated Investors Inc. in Pittsburgh.
&#8220;By doing quantitative easing, it effectively reduces interest
rates, which reduces the capital costs to businesses.&#8221;
Federated manages $337 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index for U.S. stock options fell to the
lowest level since May 3. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index is known, dropped 3.9 percent to
20.71. The gauge, which measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the SP 500, is down from this
year&#8217;s peak of 45.79 on May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa, CF &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa advanced 5.7 percent to $12.89. The largest U.S.
aluminum producer topped the average analyst earnings estimate
by 67 percent and said growth in Chinese demand will help boost
global use by 13 percent this year. A gauge of raw-materials
producers including Alcoa rose 2 percent, the biggest gain in
the SP 500 within 10 industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CF Industries, a fertilizer maker, surged 11 percent to
$109.90 for the biggest gain in the SP 500. Its rivals also
rallied. Agrium Inc. climbed 7.5 percent to $81.08, and Mosaic
Co. advanced 6.6 percent to $65.61. Deere, a maker of farming
equipment, jumped 4.8 percent to $75.35. Monsanto, the world&#8217;s
largest seed company, rose 4.2 percent to $50.87. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyson, the largest chicken processor, dropped 7.7 percent
to $15.01. Smithfield, the biggest pork producer, fell 6.7
percent to $14.97. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grain and oilseed prices rose the most allowed by the
Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S. government said domestic
and world supplies of corn, soybeans and wheat will be smaller
than forecast last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn, Soybeans, Wheat &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its domestic corn-
crop estimate for the second time in as many months, predicting
a 3.4 percent drop from last year. While farmers will collect
the most soybeans ever, the total will be 2.2 percent less than
forecast in September, the USDA said. Global wheat inventories
will be 1.8 percent less than projected last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney gained 2.7 percent to $32.49 after jumping 9.1
percent yesterday. Pershing Square, the New York hedge-fund firm
led by William Ackman, disclosed a 16.5 percent stake in the
company, making it the retailer&#8217;s largest investor. Pershing
plans to engage in talks with J.C. Penney&#8217;s board and managers
regarding the company&#8217;s performance, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortune Brands climbed 7.4 percent, the most since
September 2009, to $55.85. Pershing Square said it took an 11
percent stake in the maker of Moen faucets and Jim Beam bourbon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Leuthold, whose Leuthold Core Investment Fund has
beaten 85 percent of its competitors in the past five years,
said he boosted his stock holdings and may invest as much as 70
percent in equities because the market is poised to reach a new
2010 high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pretty Healthy&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market looks pretty healthy,&#8221; Leuthold, 72, said in
a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;It&#8217;s becoming clear that the
economy is in a recovery mode. We look at the valuations and the
technical side. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see the market move
to new highs maybe as soon as the end of November.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. gained 1.7 percent to $294.07. China Telecom
Corp., the nation&#8217;s third-largest mobile phone-company, may have
held &#8220;intensive talks&#8221; with the maker of iPhones to offer the
device early next year, according to Deutsche Bank AG analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micron Technology Inc. added 6.8 percent to $7.59. The
largest U.S. maker of computer-memory chips reported a 90
percent jump in fourth-quarter sales. The company reported its
first annual profit in four years yesterday after the markets
closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Times Co., Gannett Co. and News Corp. rallied
following a Wall Street Journal report that the media companies
plan to offer software applications designed for Samsung
Electronics Co.&#8217;s Galaxy tablet device. The newspaper cited
unidentified people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gannett, Adobe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Times gained 5 percent to $8.02. Gannett rallied 8
percent to $13.60. News Corp. rose 1.8 percent to $13.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe Systems Inc. lost 5.9 percent to $26.99, a day after
surging 12 percent following a New York Times report that the
design-software company may have held merger talks with
Microsoft Corp. Speculation about a takeover is &#8220;nonsense,&#8221;
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people at
both companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Inc. slumped 3.4 percent to $8.30. The mobile-
phone maker was cut to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. introduced the 12th U.S. stock
exchange today, with rules designed to attract larger orders
from mutual funds and other investors. The exchange, called
Nasdaq OMX PSX, will enable some investors to trade more shares
at once and others to receive executions they may not have
otherwise gotten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adobe Systems Inc. shares gave up
part of yesterday&#8217;s surge as speculation diminished that the
company may be bought by Microsoft Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer recently
met with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen to discuss closer
collaboration, the New York Times said yesterday. Two people
familiar with the matter confirmed that the meeting took place
at Adobe&#8217;s offices in San Francisco. They asked not to be
identified because the meeting was private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No comment,&#8221; Ballmer said today at a conference in
Madrid. He added jokingly that &#8220;if you are going to do
something, you say nothing. So I will be entirely consistent
with standard CEO operating procedure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While buying Adobe would furnish Microsoft with software-
development tools and mobile-phone features, the deal would be
expensive and may not pass muster with regulators, said Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High price and antitrust could be hurdles,&#8221; Thill said in
note to clients yesterday. He has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on
Adobe&#8217;s shares and a &#8220;buy&#8221; on Microsoft. Company executives
meet all the time, he said, downplaying the idea that a merger
is afoot. In addition, &#8220;Microsoft has a spotty MA track
record,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up and Down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe fell $1.70, or 5.9 percent, to $26.99 at 4 p.m. New
York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Yesterday, the shares rose
as high as 17 percent, triggering a circuit-breaker halt for
five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe&#8217;s software could augment Microsoft&#8217;s programming
language, .Net, which is the basis for programs that run on
Windows, said Katherine Egbert, an analyst at Jefferies  Co. in
San Francisco. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, also may
need help challenging Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android devices. Microsoft is preparing to release a new
operating system for smartphones, Windows Phone 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes a lot of sense that they would want to get
together,&#8221; said Egbert, who recommends buying Microsoft shares.
&#8220;You&#8217;re taking Microsoft&#8217;s millions of .Net developers and
marrying them to the millions of creative developers who use
Adobe&#8217;s tools.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion between Ballmer and Narayen centered on
Apple&#8217;s control of the mobile-phone market and how the two
companies could work together to compete, the Times said. A
possible acquisition of Adobe by Microsoft was among the
options, according to the newspaper&#8217;s Bits blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Periodic Meetings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Adobe and Microsoft share millions of customers around
the world and the CEOs of the two companies do meet from time to
time,&#8221; said Charles Sipkins, a spokesman for San Jose,
California-based Adobe. He declined to comment on the &#8220;timing
or topics of their private meetings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe has clashed with Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who banned
Adobe&#8217;s flash video software from Apple&#8217;s mobile devices. Adobe
won a partial victory on Sept. 9, when Apple eased restrictions
on creating applications for its iPhone and iPad devices. Apple
had barred developers from using Adobe&#8217;s Flash video software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the change didn&#8217;t let Flash apps run inside the
browser on Apple devices, and that&#8217;s a larger concern, Jeff Gaggin, an analyst at Avian Securities Inc. in New York, said
last month. Apple, which dominates the market for mobile apps,
is promoting an Internet standard called HTML5 instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting with Ballmer, which included a &#8220;small
entourage of deputies,&#8221; followed informal discussions about a
Microsoft acquisition of Adobe several years ago, according to
the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe forecast sales last month that fell short of
analysts&#8217; estimates, sending the shares down the most in eight
years. Cash-strapped schools aren&#8217;t paying for as many copies of
its Creative Suite, which includes Photoshop and Illustrator,
the company said. The sluggish economy in Japan, typically
Adobe&#8217;s biggest Asian market, also hampered sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cielo SA, Brazil&#8217;s biggest card-
payment processor by market value, was raised to &#8220;buy&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral&#8221; at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which cited the
company&#8217;s fourth-quarter sales outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Frances Yoon" date="Oct 08, 2010  1:42 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-08/jpmorgan-bnp-among-banks-facing-korea-audit-regulator-says.html"><headline>JPMorgan, BNP Among Banks Facing Audit in Korea</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., DBS Group
Holdings Ltd., Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas SA will be audited
by South Korean regulators on their foreign-exchange derivatives
holdings as policy makers seek to curb won gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audit will begin Oct. 19 and focus on trades in non-
deliverable forwards, said Doh Bo Eun, head of the foreign-
exchange coordination team at the Financial Supervisory Service.
The contracts, settled in dollars, enable investors to speculate
on exchange-rate fluctuations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won&#8217;s 5.6 percent gain against the dollar in the past
month makes South Korean exports more expensive at a time when
the economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe shows signs of
faltering. The regulator wants to ensure that the value of
outstanding currency derivatives, which the government estimates
are declining, falls to below mandated limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to check if the banks have been abiding by the
rules,&#8221; Doh said by telephone today. &#8220;The very high level of
derivatives held by overseas banks has fallen a lot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shinhan Financial Group Co. and Korea Exchange Bank will
also be audited, from Oct. 26, Doh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee You Chul, a spokesman for Shinhan, said the company
hadn&#8217;t been told by the regulators of the audit, while Korea
Exchange Bank spokesman Kim Sun Gyu declined to comment.
Officials at JPMorgan, BNP Paribas and DBS didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Inflows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local banks in June were ordered to reduce holdings of the
derivatives to 50 percent of equity capital within a two-year
period, starting Oct. 9. The limit for overseas banks was set at
250 percent of equity capital. All banks were banned from
raising their derivatives above the levels held on July 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments from South Korea to Brazil are stepping up
attempts to control their currencies as near-zero interest rates
in the U.S. and Japan spur demand for higher-yielding assets in
developing nations, whose economies are leading global growth.
Investors poured almost $90 billion into emerging-market stock
and bond funds in the first nine months of this year, an EPFR
Global data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading in non-deliverable forwards in South Korea rose
&#8220;considerably&#8221; in September, Doh said. The won advanced 5.1
percent during the same period, its biggest monthly advance in a
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of outstanding currency derivatives held by
domestic and overseas banks currently exceeds new limits by $2.7
billion, compared with 12.1 billion in July, Lawrence H. Lee,
director of the foreign-exchange policy division at the Ministry
of Strategy and Finance, said this week in Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;No Choice&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas banks operating in South Korea &#8220;have no choice&#8221;
but to cut their holdings of swaps and bonds in the country
because of new limits, Lee Sung Hee, managing director at
JPMorgan in Seoul, said Oct. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korean regulators announced their audit plans after Brazil
doubled a tax it charges foreigners on investments in fixed-
income securities to 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea is a small, open economy that is vulnerable to
surges in capital flows, Vice Finance Minister Yim Jong Yong
said on June 9. He said $65 billion was taken out of country in
the four to five months after the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve will increase
its Treasury purchases at a policy meeting next month, helping
the U.S. avoid the &#8220;very bad&#8221; economic outcome of a renewed
recession, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss of 95,000 jobs in September reported by the Labor
Department Oct. 8 will lead the Fed to act, New York-based Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, said in an e-
mailed note. Policy makers will announce roughly $500 billion of
Treasury purchases through about the middle of 2011 and indicate
they are ready to buy more, according to Goldman, one of the 18
primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. two-year yields extended declines to record lows today
as traders bet the Fed will buy more Treasuries as it tries to
keep borrowing costs down. The economy will expand less than
previously estimated, a survey showed, underscoring the need for
Fed action. It purchased $300 billion of Treasuries in 2009
under a policy known as quantitative easing, or QE. Traders
preparing for another round of buying have dubbed it QE2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;QE2 and its impact on financial conditions is one key
reason why we expect the economy over the next six-nine months
to be only &#8216;fairly bad&#8217; rather than &#8216;very bad,&#8217;&#8221; Hatzius wrote
in his note. &#8220;Friday&#8217;s jobs numbers put the seal on a
quantitative easing announcement at the Nov. 2-3 FOMC meeting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil producers led by Exxon Mobil
Corp., Chevron Corp. and Tullow Oil Plc tripled spending in sub-
Saharan Africa to $30 billion a year in a decade, finding twice
the U.S.&#8217;s remaining reserves. The flow of cash is now at risk
as nations from Uganda to Ghana tighten control of the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explorers face being stripped of licenses or awarded less
favorable contracts as governments seek to reassert authority
over their natural resources. There&#8217;s also the challenge of
operating in countries emerging from civil war such as the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Governments are under much more pressure to make demands
on oil and gas companies in terms of oil exploration and oil
revenue coming into the national coffers,&#8221; said Rolake Akinola,
a London-based Africa analyst at Eurasia Group. &#8220;That trend
will only continue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghana blocked Exxon&#8217;s $4 billion bid to buy a stake in the
country&#8217;s Jubilee field from Kosmos Energy LLC this year.
Tullow&#8217;s plans to start pumping from fields in Uganda with 1
billion barrels of oil have been held up by a tax dispute. Both
countries are set to become major oil exporters for the first
time as discoveries are put into production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Government interference in Uganda and Ghana is a major
concern,&#8221; said Dougie Youngson, an analyst at Arbuthnot
Securities Ltd. in London. &#8220;This is all part of the pattern of
operating in Africa.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks climbed, as trading
volume sank to the lowest level of the year, amid growing
speculation that the Federal Reserve will pump more cash into
the economy to protect the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and International Business
Machines Corp. rose more than 0.5 percent, leading gains in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. Gymboree Corp. surged 22 percent
after Bain Capital LLC agreed to buy the children&#8217;s clothing
retailer agreed for about $1.8 billion. Tyson Foods Inc. fell
for a second day amid concern its feed costs will rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, 268 companies rose and
224 fell at 4 p.m. New York time. The measure increased less
than 0.1 percent to 1,165.32. The Dow advanced 3.86 points, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 11,010.34. Trading volume on U.S.
exchanges amounted to 5.62 billion shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Reserve has made it very clear that they are
intent on supporting the markets and that has set a floor,&#8221;
said Oliver Pursche, co-manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund
and president of Suffern, New York-based Gary Goldberg Financial
Services, which manages $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rallied last week, sending the Dow average
above 11,000 for the first time since before the May 6 crash,
after a report showed the economy created fewer-than-estimated
private jobs in September, bolstering speculation the Fed will
buy more debt to boost the economy. The SP 500 rose 8.8 percent
last month, its best September since 1939, as the central bank
said it&#8217;s willing to ease monetary policy further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Prediction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job losses will lead the Fed to increase Treasury purchases
at its meeting next month, UBS AG said. The Federal Open Market
Committee will announce plans to buy $35 billion to $65 billion
of debt a month at the Nov. 2-3 session, Mansoor Mohi-uddin,
head of global currency strategy in Singapore, wrote to clients
today. The Fed will buy that amount over one quarter and then
review the policy, he predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing rose 1.1 percent to $69.99. JPMorgan climbed 1.1
percent to $39.73. IBM advanced 0.6 percent to $139.66. DuPont
Co. fell the most in the Dow, losing 1.2 percent to $46.09. 3M
Co. slumped 1 percent to $88.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gymboree surged 22 percent to $64.83. Bain, a buyout firm,
is gaining a business whose free cash flow tripled since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyson Foods slumped 1.1 percent to $14.84, adding to its
7.7 percent retreat on Oct. 8. Corn futures jumped to a two-year
high today and the price of the main feed ingredient is more
than 70 percent above the 10-year average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telephone companies in the SP 500 rose 0.3 percent, the
most among 10 industries. The search for higher yields is
driving the biggest rally in seven years for phone stocks, as
investors ignore some of the lowest profit forecasts in the MSCI
World Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc. and PCCW Ltd. are leading a 21
percent gain in MSCI&#8217;s gauge of 52 telecommunications companies
since the end of the second quarter even as analysts estimate
the group&#8217;s earnings will grow at less than half the pace of the
MSCI World measure of stocks in 24 developed nations, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. U.S. phone shares are the most
expensive industry in the SP 500 relative to forecast profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon gained 0.6 percent to $33.03 today, and ATT Inc.
climbed 0.4 percent to $28.32. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Ritchie
Capital Management LLC were sued by the U.S. bankruptcy trustee
for companies run by convicted Ponzi schemer Thomas Petters in
an effort to recover more than $261 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee, Douglas Kelley, filed the complaints yesterday
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Minneapolis, where he has brought
more than 200 lawsuits seeking to recover billions of dollars
for creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petters last year was sentenced to 50 years in prison after
being found guilty of running a $3.5 billion fraud. Petters
conned investors into giving him money to finance phony
consumer-goods purchase contracts. His Minnetonka, Minnesota-
based businesses also owned Sun Country Airlines Inc. and
Polaroid Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelley alleged that New York-based JPMorgan, a shareholder
in Polaroid before Petters acquired it, received more than $241
million of Petters&#8217;s ill-gotten gains. Kelley also seeks to
recover more than $12 million from former Polaroid Holding Co.
Chairman Jacques Nasser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said the bank was
unaware of the case and he couldn&#8217;t comment on it. A spokesman
for Nasser, the chairman of mining company BHP Billiton Ltd.,
couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate lawsuit, Kelley alleged that Wheaton,
Illinois-based Ritchie Capital and six affiliates, which were
among Petters&#8217;s investors, should pay back more than $21 million
in fraudulent transfers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Meise, a spokesman for Ritchie Capital, said he
couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are In re Petters Co., 08-45257; Kelley v.
JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-04443; and Kelley v. Ritchie Capital

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj rose 1.4 percent in
Helsinki trading today after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its

&lt;p&gt;Nokia climbed 10.5 cents to 7.855 euros, valuing the

better device portfolio and demand for smartphones based on its
Symbian 3 platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect strong smartphone demand, healthy sell-in of
Nokia&#8217;s new Symbian 3 products and an improved basic
portfolio,&#8221; the analysts wrote in the report. That will &#8220;boost
the company&#8217;s near-term earnings,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, who took charge last
month, is looking to turn around a slide in Nokia&#8217;s share of the
lucrative smartphone market with new phones and software that
can compete with devices such as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and phones
from Samsung Electronics Co. The N8 smartphone, which Nokia is
pitching as a competitor to its rivals&#8217; high-end devices, began
shipping on Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delays in the N8 have cost the company. It lowered its
earnings forecast three times before managing to fulfill its
promise of a third-quarter start for the N8, the first device in
a new premium line running the revamped Symbian 3 software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Share &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s share of the world smartphone market declined
to 37.4 percent in the second quarter compared with 45 percent
in the same period last year, according to Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While new products running Nokia&#8217;s Symbian 3 operating
system will see &#8220;healthy&#8221; sales, &#8220;Nokia has lost the high-end
consumer in the U.S. and Europe,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote.
&#8220;Nokia is fast losing its scale advantage&#8221; and faces
significant long-term risk, they added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s biggest oil
producer, will be the next &#8220;gold rush&#8221; on the continent as
investors take advantage of a booming economy, former South
African central bank Governor Tito Mboweni said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s gross domestic product will overtake South
Africa&#8217;s in the next three decades, Mboweni, who is now an
adviser for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in an interview in
Johannesburg on Oct. 8. Its economy of $169 billion compares
with South Africa&#8217;s $286 billion, according to World Bank data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nigeria is going to be Africa&#8217;s growth story for the next
15 to 20 years,&#8221; Mboweni said after returning from a visit to
Nigeria&#8217;s capital, Abuja, and the commercial hub, Lagos, as part
of a delegation from Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West African nation, the continent&#8217;s most populous with
140 million people, is targeting economic growth of 10 percent
in the coming years as it boosts spending on power plants and
attracts more investment, Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga, a
former Goldman Sachs executive, said Sept. 3. The government is
preparing to sell its first Eurobond of $500 million this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which doesn&#8217;t have an office in Nigeria, is
bidding to advise on the sale of state-owned power-generation
and distribution companies, the Bureau of Public Enterprises
said on Aug. 31. The government hasn&#8217;t said who will manage the
Eurobond sale yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mboweni is also chairman of Nampak Ltd., Africa&#8217;s biggest
packaging maker, which is benefiting from its business in
Nigeria, he said. Nampak manufactures bottles for Guinness beer
and cigarette packages in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria has previously failed to convert its oil wealth
into economic development. In its latest crisis, central bank
Governor Lamido Sanusi, who took office in June last year, fired
the chief executive officers of eight of the 24 commercial
lenders and pumped 620 billion naira ($4 billion) to bail out 10
of them as the industry risked collapse. Sanusi said on Sept. 21
that the economy will probably expand 7.8 percent this year, up
from 7 percent in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria has oil production capacity of more than 3 million
barrels a day, Oil Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said on Sept.
27, making it the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&#8217;
sixth-largest supplier. Oil accounts for more than 80 percent of
government revenue, according to the Finance Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of good, young technocrats in Nigeria&#8217;s
government who will help sort out the &#8220;chaos&#8221; in the country,
Mboweni said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Good Job&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former labor minister in President Nelson Mandela&#8217;s first
Cabinet in 1994, Mboweni, 51, left the South African Reserve
Bank in November after a decade at its helm, declining President
Jacob Zuma&#8217;s offer to serve a third term. He was named chairman
of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., Africa&#8217;s biggest gold producer, on
Feb. 24, three weeks after he was appointed to the same position
at Nampak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mboweni, who is a patron of the South African Ballet
Theater, is currently raising $130 million for a planned
specialist children&#8217;s hospital in Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of South Africa is doing a &#8220;good job,&#8221;
Mboweni said. Interest rate increases between June 2006 and June
2008 helped to curb price gains, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation has been inside the central bank&#8217;s 3 percent to 6
percent target range since February, easing to an annual 3.5
percent in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Criticism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mboweni was criticized by South African labor unions for
not cutting interest rates fast enough in 2009, which they said
prolonged the economy&#8217;s first recession in 17 years. He lowered
the benchmark rate six times to 7 percent between December 2008
and August 2009. His replacement, Gill Marcus, has cut the rate
by 1 percentage point since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new role at Goldman Sachs, Mboweni said he has met
with foreign investors, who raised concerns about calls from the
youth wing of the ruling African National Congress to
nationalize the country&#8217;s mines. His response to them is that
the &#8220;center will hold&#8221; in the ANC, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANC agreed at its National General Council meeting,
which ended on Sept. 24, to study nationalizing mines and other
key industries over the next two years. The ANC Youth League,
led by Julius Malema, argued at the meeting that South Africa
didn&#8217;t derive enough benefit from mining, which generates 30
percent of export revenue in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. unveiled nine new
phones with its Windows operating system after an overhaul aimed
at reversing share losses to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and Google
Inc.&#8217;s Android software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows phones will be sold in the U.S. by ATT Inc.,
the country&#8217;s largest phone company, and Deutsche Telekom AG&#8217;s
T-Mobile USA unit, the companies said at an event in New York to
show the handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows Phone software features a new design, the
ability to take and post photos faster and connections to
Facebook and Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live game service. With market
research firm Gartner Inc. predicting smartphone sales will
eclipse those of personal computers in the next two years,
Microsoft&#8217;s mobile business is in need of a quick turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Handsets are a critical market if Microsoft is going to
expand their business beyond PCs,&#8221; Ross Rubin, an NPD Group
Inc. analyst, said in an interview. &#8220;Windows Phone 7 will offer
an interface that will be familiar to some and offer a new
experience to others; it is a matter of taste.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phones are being made by HTC Corp., Dell Inc., Samsung
Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone software organizes activities into tiles that
update with new information. Users can scroll down and side to
side to navigate. The software also includes Microsoft&#8217;s Zune
music subscription service and mobile versions of the Office
applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTC Corp. will introduce five
handsets using Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s new Windows Phone 7 operating
system, signaling its support for a platform that&#8217;s lost ground
to Google Inc.&#8217;s Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC&#8217;s sales of Android phones overtook those using Windows
among its own shipments in the first quarter, Chief Executive
Officer Peter Chou said in an interview at the company&#8217;s
Taoyuan, Taiwan headquarters Oct. 8. HTC is the world&#8217;s largest
maker of phones using either platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone 7, released today, marks the
latest attempt by the world&#8217;s largest software maker to claw
back share of the mobile operating system market from Android.
Google-based models helped HTC post record sales in the past two
quarters, spurring a doubling in the Taiwan company&#8217;s share
price this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft can come back,&#8221; said Chou, whose company in
2002 became the first to release a smartphone using Microsoft&#8217;s
mobile platform, and was the first with an Android handset in
2008. &#8220;Microsoft has a lot of value, so the industry should
definitely not underestimate them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android had a 32 percent share of the U.S. market for
smartphones bought in the past six months, surpassing Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and Research In Motion Ltd.&#8217;s Blackberry
platforms, according to August data from Nielsen Co. released
Oct. 5. Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Mobile, the precursor to Windows
Phone 7, ranked outside the top three among sales of
smartphones, handsets that can connect to the Internet and play
music and videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s stock
research group won the top slot in Institutional Investor
magazine&#8217;s 39th annual ranking for the first time, breaking
Barclays Plc&#8217;s two-year winning streak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, had 46 analysts on the list,
two more than last year, the magazine said. Institutional
Investor said the rankings were dominated this year by analysts
who best understood global economic developments such as U.S.
health-care and financial reform, Europe&#8217;s government debt
crisis and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. (Click here for the
list of &#8220;2010 All-America Research Team First-Teamers.&#8221;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market was driven by macro events, and analysts needed
to understand and interpret those events to provide perspective
on which sectors and stocks would outperform,&#8221; Thomas Schmidt,
the New York-based head of Americas equity research at JPMorgan,
told Institutional Investor. JPMorgan also won first place in
the magazine&#8217;s ranking in September of fixed-income analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays of London was voted second, with 43 analysts on
the list compared with 46 last year. It won in 2008 and 2009,
and it owns the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., which was ranked highest during the five prior years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch Global Research held
its third-place position, while Credit Suisse Group AG came in
fourth and UBS AG took fifth. Bank of America is based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, while Credit Suisse and UBS have
their headquarters in Zurich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Increase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley had the biggest climb in the top 10, rising
from ninth place to seventh after increasing the number of
analysts on the list by eight to 24. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
slipped to tenth from eighth place with 10 analysts. Both
companies are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine surveyed 3,500 investors at 970 companies with
assets of $10.2 trillion to produce the stock-analyst ranking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners included Brad Hintz, a New York-based brokers and
asset-managers analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., and
Francois Trahan, a portfolio strategist who quit ISI Group to
help form Wolfe Trahan  Co. For the largest banks, Deutsche
Bank AG&#8217;s Matthew O&#8217;Connor was No. 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s antidepressant
reboxetine, sold for more than a decade in Europe, is no more
effective than a placebo at treating symptoms of depression,
according to an analysis that included unpublished studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After examining unpublished data on the drug, researchers
at the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health
Care found that published studies overestimated reboxetine&#8217;s
benefit by 115 percent when compared to a dummy pill and 23
percent compared with other antidepressants, according to a
report today in the British Medical Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variation between the results of the published and
unpublished studies shows that pharmaceutical companies need
stricter rules about disclosing the test results, the
researchers said. Drugmakers must reveal study findings for
products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and
European regulators are considering a similar policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s still a regulatory gap in Europe,&#8221; Dirk Eyding,
lead author of the analysis and the head of the clinical study
department at a unit of the German Cancer Society, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. Citing the unpublished
studies, the researchers called reboxetine &#8220;an ineffective and
potentially harmful antidepressant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said in an e-mailed statement
that it is reviewing the analysis in the British Medical Journal
and that reboxetine is &#8220;an effective treatment option to
clinicians for use in patients suffering from depressive
illness/major depression and for maintaining the clinical
improvement in patients initially responding to treatment." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis looked at 13 studies of reboxetine involving
4,098 patients. Data on almost three-quarters of those patients
had never been published, the study said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not Acceptable&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;It is not acceptable to be shown only positive data,&#8217;&#8217;
said Anthony Cleare, a psychiatrist and head of the Affective
Disorders Unit at the Maudsley Hospital and Institute of
Psychiatry at King&#8217;s College London, in a statement.
&#8216;&#8216;Clinicians treating patients with depression absolutely need
the full picture in order to help their patients make the right
choices about the various treatments that are available.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern that positive studies were more likely to get
published in medical journals than negative ones led Congress in
2007 to pass a law creating a registry for clinical trials. The
U.S. law doesn&#8217;t require disclosure of data from studies
completed before Sept. 27, 2007, or on drugs rejected by
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Panel Recommendation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer turned over the data after the German institute
issued a preliminary version of its report in June 2009 saying
reboxetine doesn&#8217;t benefit patients, citing the volume of
unpublished studies, the researchers said. The institute, a
nonprofit group that provides recommendations to the country&#8217;s
health insurance system, also funded today&#8217;s research. After
reviewing the report, a separate panel recommended the German
health system stop paying for the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Pfizer discloses the results of its clinical trials to
regulatory authorities all around the world,&#8221; Loder said in the
statement. &#8220;These regulatory authorities carefully balance the
risks and benefits of each medication, and reflect all important
safety and efficacy information in the approved product
labeling. &#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reboxetine has been sold since 1997 in Germany, the U.K.
and other European Union countries under the brand names
Edronax, Norebox, Davedax and Vestra, the researchers said. U.S.
regulators refused to approve the treatment in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug works differently than most antidepressants
because it only blocks the reabsorption of the chemical
norepinephrine, while other drugs target serotonin. Reboxetine
was developed by Pharmacia Corp., which Pfizer acquired in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Rosabeth Moss Kanter" date="Oct 12, 2010  6:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-12/adopt-a-cow-strategy-as-improvisational-theater.html"><headline>Adopt a Cow: Strategy as Improvisational Theater</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;For entrepreneurs and innovators, it''s absurd to equate strategy with a Plan, with a capital P, all wrapped up in one neat package to be studied and followed slavishly. Certainly they need a theme, a domain, and a target. And they must show investors that there''s a market. But because they are creating something new, how can they possibly follow a script?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Kao likened the work of innovators to the jamming of jazz musicians who improvise around a theme; Amar Bhide said hustle can be strategy. I think of this as the difference between traditional theater and improvisational theater, or between traditional television drama and reality TV.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional theater, everything is pre-programmed. The playwrights from the strategic planning department write the script and run rehearsals, i.e., training sessions, to prepare the actors to act out their parts flawlessly, as conceived by the planners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improv throws out the book. The actors count on their own imagination and teamwork. They start with a rough theme and to play off of it, coming up with variations to which they each adjust, changing in response to audience reactions. In fact audiences sometimes define the theme. The actors must think fast and adapt quickly. In the fast-paced technology world, this is called rapid prototyping &#8212; developing a series of possibilities in close communication with users and without knowing in advance exactly what will emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings me to the cow-based marketing programs created by Stonyfield. Stonyfield, an organic yogurt producer, began with more imagination than cash. But Stonyfield''s "CE-Yo" Gary Hirshberg had a big goal: commitment to becoming a SuperCorp (as I call it), combining innovation, profitable growth, and social good, improving health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using cows as their theme, Hirshberg''s team improvised their way around the obstacles to a small upstart in the huge food industry. With theatrical flair, Stonyfield uses the Web and live events to get close to consumers and garner free media, starring the cows. Fans can adopt a cow on the website and get regular emails from their cow. They can also tune into to You Tube videos of cows chewing their cuds. The videos proved popular in unexpected ways, finding a receptive audience among Wall Street bankers who found it relaxing to take a cow break. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stonyfield had to find ways to live up to its green commitment, using science more than theater. But science, too, can have an improvisational quality.That''s what experiments are all about: trying and testing, then learning and testing again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I first surfaced the idea of strategy as improvisational theater in my book Evolve!, I heard from numerous troupes of actors that had improvised their way to better-paid careers. They became corporate consultants, bringing the tools of improvisational acting to leadership development programs. It seems that even established companies want the entrepreneurial spirit of getting on with it, rather than waiting for the script. Like organic yogurt, it''s a healthy development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said third-quarter earnings were eroded by
a weakening U.S. dollar, costs associated with a deep-water
drilling ban and lower prices for crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings for the period that ended Sept. 30 declined from
the second quarter, the San Ramon, California-based company said
in a Business Wire statement. Oil and natural-gas production,
which accounted for more than 95 percent of Chevron&#8217;s 2009
profit, rose 1.1 percent during the first two months of the
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is scheduled to release full third-quarter results
on Oct. 29. The company has been reducing investment in lower-
profit businesses such as crude refining and retail fuel sales
to focus on discovering untapped oil and natural-gas fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said expenses in its U.S. exploration business
increased as a result of the federal government&#8217;s prohibition on
deep-water drilling, imposed after BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well erupted
in April, killing 11 workers and triggering the biggest oil
spill in U.S. history. The Interior Department, which oversees
offshore drilling, lifted the ban today after new safety
standards were devised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 44 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $83.40 at 5:20

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s $3.6 billion purchase
of King Pharmaceuticals Inc. adds abuse-resistant narcotics to
help the drugmaker expand its share of the $22 billion market
for painkillers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, will pay $14.25 a
share in cash, a 40 percent premium over King&#8217;s closing price
yesterday, for the morphine pill Embeda and two other tamper-
resistant painkillers turned away once by U.S. regulators. The
companies announced the deal today and expect it to close by the
first quarter of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is looking for new products before its top-selling
cholesterol pill Lipitor, with $11.4 billion in 2009 sales,
loses revenue to generic competition next year. The New York-
based drugmaker sold more than $5 billion in painkillers in 2009
led by Celebrex for arthritis and Lyrica for nerve pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer is looking to expand into pain to buffer the fall
from the Lipitor precipice,&#8221; said Corey Davis, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. in New York, in an e-mail today. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
have predicted this deal, but I can see where it makes sense
given the predicament Pfizer is in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition would be Pfizer&#8217;s biggest since its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. The company has done 30
deals in the past five years with an average size of $4.13
billion. The average premium paid for pharmaceutical
acquisitions over the past 12 months was 24 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Shares Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 10 cents to $17.48, while King surged
$3.99, or 39 percent, to $14.14 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Before today, King&#8217;s shares had
declined 17 percent since Jan. 1 as the Bristol, Tennessee-based
company faced competition from generic copies of the muscle
relaxant Skelaxin, its top-seller last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King has been focused on making new painkillers since its
top-selling blood-pressure pill Altace went generic in 2007. The
company acquired Alpharma Inc. the following year for about $1.3
billion to gain rights to Embeda, which was approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration in August 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamper-Resistant &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King is also developing Remoxy, a long-acting oxycodone
capsule with tamper-resistant features, with Pain Therapeutics
Inc., of San Mateo, California. The drug is designed to be a
safer alternative to OxyContin, made by Stamford, Connecticut-
based Purdue Pharma LP. King has said it plans to re-file Remoxy
to the FDA before the end of the year. The drug was delayed in
December 2008 when the agency asked for more data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer felt that they wanted to get in before Remoxy was
re-filed,&#8221; a catalyst that may spark King shares &#8220;to move up
pretty aggressively,&#8221; said Ian Sanderson, an analyst at Cowen 
Co. in Boston, in a telephone interview today. &#8220;They are taking
advantage of price, although from a discounted cash flow
perspective, they&#8217;re paying fair value, maybe a little bit
below.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement includes a $110 million breakup fee King
would pay Pfizer if the deal is terminated under certain
circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics rose $1.16, or 19 percent, to $7.41 in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading as investors felt Pfizer
would be able to better promote Remoxy with doctors if it&#8217;s
approved. Remoxy may bring in peak annual sales of $500 million
and Embeda may have peak sales of $350 million, Sanderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global market for narcotic and non-narcotic pain
treatments was $22.4 billion in 2009, according to health
research firm IMS Health Inc. King is also developing a short-
acting oxycodone pill called Acurox with Palatine, Illinois-
based Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc. The drug failed to win an FDA
panel&#8217;s backing in April and plans to re-file it next year may
be tabled if Pfizer isn&#8217;t convinced the drug has value in a
market dominated by lower-cost generics, Sanderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Product Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, with $1.78 billion in revenue last year, also makes
the non-narcotic Flector pain patch, Thrombin-JMI to control
bleeding during surgery and Levoxyl for thyroid disorders. It
also has an animal health business with $359 million in sales
last year that Pfizer said will complement its own animal
division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it plans to eliminate $200 million in costs
from King within three years, an estimate that most analysts
said was conservative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view King as a solid asset at a somewhat elevated
price for Pfizer,&#8221; said Joel Levington, managing director with
Brookfield Investment Management Inc., said in an email. &#8220;The
transaction should modestly help Pfizer&#8217;s growth profile in 2012
through 2013, and we do not see the deal having an impact on the
company&#8217;s strong creditworthiness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bolt-On&#8217; Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to continue looking for &#8220;bolt on&#8221;
acquisitions in emerging markets, generic drugs and in targeted
disease areas, Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said on a
conference call with analysts. The company had $1.88 billion in
cash as of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to be opportunistic regarding additional
business development opportunities going forward,&#8221; D&#8217;Amelio
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s financial adviser was J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
and its legal adviser was Cadwalader, Wickersham  Taft LLP.
Credit Suisse was King&#8217;s financial adviser and Covington 
Burling LLP was its legal adviser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vaulted
past Morgan Stanley to become the top arranger of stock sales in
Asia outside Japan for the first time since 2005 after divesting
a $2.25 billion stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China
Ltd. two days before the end of the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICBC sale was one of four deals Goldman Sachs completed
in the last two days of September to overtake Morgan Stanley
with 14.9 percent of the market, its biggest share since 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs pushed into the top slot as equity offerings
in the region surged to $81 billion, marking the best first nine
months since 2007, Bloomberg data show. Helping drive the climb
from third a year earlier were stake sales in ICBC and China
Mobile Ltd., the phone carrier Goldman Sachs took public in 1997
that&#8217;s now the world&#8217;s sixth-largest company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asia ex-Japan has been a hot spot for equity capital
markets and it can easily bear more deals given the recent
stock-market rally there,&#8221; said Christopher Palmer, who
oversees about $6 billion as the London-based head of global
emerging markets at Gartmore Investment Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Index rallied 12 percent in
September, its best monthly performance since July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four offerings Goldman Sachs completed on Sept. 29 and
Sept. 30 raised a combined $3.15 billion, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Morgan Stanley finished three deals from Sept.
28 to Sept. 30 worth a total of $925 million, taking its nine-
month market share to 12 percent. Before Sept. 28, the two firms
were almost in a tie for the No. 1 spot, the data show. Both
banks are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Right Investments&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expanded its investment-banking workforce in
China by 40 percent this year as part of a push to help more
local companies sell shares, Thomas Deng, the firm&#8217;s head of
China equity capital markets, said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deng, formerly Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief China strategist in
Hong Kong, was appointed to his current role in March. The same
month, the bank said it hired William Smiley from HSBC Holdings
Plc as equity syndicate co-head in Hong Kong. Steven Barg, the
former UBS AG capital-markets chief for Asia, joined two months
later as regional co-head of equity capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve made the right investments in people and clients
ahead of what&#8217;s become an extraordinary level of market
activity,&#8221; Dan Dees, head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Asia financing
group, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nineteen of the 33 stock offers Goldman Sachs arranged in
the nine-month period were by Chinese companies, according to
Bloomberg data. Those deals raised a combined $25.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future Business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley was first in stock underwriting in Asia
outside Japan in the year-earlier period, Bloomberg data show.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been among the five top-
ranked equity sale arrangers in the region since 2006. Morgan
Stanley worked on 43 deals in this year&#8217;s first nine months, 10
more than Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In initial public offerings, Goldman Sachs ranked third in
the nine-month period behind JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche
Bank AG, according to Bloomberg data. That was still its best
showing since 2007. Morgan Stanley was fourth in IPOs in the
region through Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being one of the top players consistently can certainly
help capture future business, especially for IPOs,&#8221; said Kester Ng, co-head of equity capital and derivatives markets for Asia-
Pacific at JPMorgan. &#8220;Clients seeking initial public offerings
will look for banks with credibility and track record.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, India &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia has led a recovery in global share sales this year,
powered by China and India. Chinese companies raised $37.5
billion from overseas stock sales through Sept. 30, a 29 percent
jump from a year earlier, Bloomberg data show. China&#8217;s domestic
equity underwriting market is only open to overseas investment
banks that have ventures with local partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s government aims to raise 400 billion rupees ($8.9
billion) in the year through March 2011 selling shares in state
companies. Those deals typically generate near-zero fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect significant new issue volume for the remainder
of the year, with a healthy balance of large and mid-size IPOs,
follow-ons and convertible bonds,&#8221; Gokul Laroia, Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s co-head of Asia investment banking, said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s relationship with ICBC stretches back to
2006, when the firm and affiliated funds paid $2.59 billion for
a 4.9 percent stake in the Chinese lender, now the world&#8217;s
largest bank by market value. The value of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
holding has swelled to $7.7 billion, even after it raised $4.25
billion in two sales of ICBC stock over the past 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Mobile IPO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone Group Plc turned to Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley
and UBS AG last month to help the U.K. carrier sell a stake in
China Mobile for $6.5 billion. Vodafone bought its holding in
the Beijing-based company in two transactions between 2000 and
2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs helped arrange the IPO of China Mobile, then
called China Telecom (H.K.) Ltd., in October 1997 in what was at
the time the biggest-ever stock sale in Asia outside Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also worked on this year&#8217;s
IPOs of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and AIA Group Ltd. At
$22.1 billion, Agricultural Bank&#8217;s offering was the world&#8217;s
largest-ever first-time sale. American International Group Inc.
is raising as much as $14.9 billion by taking its AIA unit
public in what would be Asia&#8217;s third-biggest IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks all want to achieve that number one status in the
league table as it generally shows the companies that they have
a good track record, a global reach, distribution and research
capabilities and most importantly, a competitive fee,&#8221; said
Palmer of Gartmore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an
appeal from Pfizer Inc. and other makers of hormone replacement
treatments, leaving intact a ruling that lets 123 women who
developed breast cancer sue in Minnesota state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal sought to reinstate a federal trial court ruling
that dismissed 116 of the plaintiffs because their claims
duplicated previously filed suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue in the Supreme Court appeal turned on the complex
rules governing efforts by corporate defendants to move suits
out of plaintiff-friendly state courts and into federal
tribunals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Pfizer case, a federal appeals court said the trial
judge shouldn&#8217;t have dismissed the 116 plaintiffs and instead
should have immediately sent the entire matter back to Minnesota
state court, where the suits were filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took menopause drugs made by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit to treat symptoms including hot flashes and
mood swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to
cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other companies being sued include units of Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Mead Johnson Nutrition Co.,
Novartis AG, Abbott Laboratories and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wyeth v. Kirkland, 10-222. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Mandelblatt expects to have
raised at least $500 million when his Soroban Capital Partners
LLC begins trading stocks next month, according to two people
with direct knowledge of the New York-based hedge-fund firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two other managers, Mark Carhart and Pierre-Henri Flamand, are slated to open in coming months with half a billion
dollars or more each, said the people, who asked not to be named
because the firms are private. Helping all three traders pull in
at least 10 times more than most hedge-fund startups this year
may be one line on their resumes: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an incredibly difficult environment,&#8221; said Emma Sugarman, head of the U.S. capital introductions group at BNP
Paribas SA in New York, which helps hedge funds meet investors.
&#8220;There does, however, seem to be an appetite for people who
have a certain pedigree.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.6 trillion hedge-fund industry attracted a net $23.3
billion in the first half, a pace that would make 2010 the
third-worst year for deposits into the private investment pools
since 2001, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.
Most new funds are raising $30 million to $50 million, according
to bankers who work with startups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three former Goldman Sachs managers have what many
investors in new funds are looking for, including a strong track
record and a team who they&#8217;ve worked with in the past, said
Larry Chiarello, a partner at SkyView Investment Advisors LLC in
Shrewsbury, New Jersey. Investors are also gravitating toward
startups with full trading and administrative staffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary Traders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carhart&#8217;s New York-based Kepos Capital LP has 27 employees,
while Flamand&#8217;s Edoma Capital Services Ltd. in London has a
payroll of 24, according to the people briefed on their plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives at the three firms all declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundraising success of traders with a Goldman Sachs
pedigree may bode well for others who leave as the New York-
based bank disbands its principal-strategies business to comply
with new U.S. regulations aimed at curbing risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of that group, Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze, may
start a hedge fund focused on Asia, two people with knowledge of
the matter said last month. A U.S. team of proprietary traders
from Goldman Sachs has been talking to fund manager Avenue
Capital Group, buyout firm KKR  Co. and investment bank Perella
Weinberg Partners LP about joining one of those firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandelblatt, 34, started as an energy analyst at Goldman
Sachs in 1998. In 2002, he joined the principal strategies
group, which traded the bank&#8217;s own money, becoming chief
operating officer of the unit&#8217;s U.S. business two years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he left Goldman in 2005, Mandelblatt went to TPG-Axon
Capital Management LP, where he was co-chief executive officer.
He is starting Soroban with Gaurav Kapadia and Scott Friedman,
who were both at New York-based TPG-Axon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Alpha Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carhart, 44, will begin trading client money at Kepos in
January. He was co-head of Goldman&#8217;s quantitative investment-
management group and its Global Alpha hedge fund. From 1998
through early 2009, when Carhart left the bank, Global Alpha
averaged returns of 12 percent a year. The fund, which bought
and sold securities based on computer models, lost 40 percent in
2007 and climbed 2 percent in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kepos will also use computers to trade debt, equities and
currencies in developed and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flamand, 40, will open Edoma in November to trade the
stocks and bonds of companies going through corporate events
such as mergers and bankruptcies. He worked at Goldman Sachs for
15 years and ran its principal strategies group from London from
2007 until he left in March. He is joined at Edoma by former
colleagues Ali Hedayat and Emmanuel Niogret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs traders who founded their own hedge
funds include Eric Mindich, who started New York-based Eton Park
Capital Management LP with $3 billion in 2004, and Dinakar Singh, who left the investment bank in 2004 to co-found TPG-
Axon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICAP Plc&#8217;s former Asia head Kim
Rosenkilde and his deputy Don McClumpha created an
&#8220;unbearable&#8221; work culture, brokers who were sued by the
company to stop them from quitting said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two executives favored Caucasians over Asians, the 10
brokers said in Oct. 8 filings to the Singapore High Court. The
court last month ordered Lausanne, Switzerland-based Compagnie
Financiere Tradition SA to stop recruiting ICAP brokers until
the dispute is resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While local brokers took a voluntary pay cut of as much as
20 percent in late 2008 on the basis there would be no firings,
the senior ranks were being staffed with &#8220;high-cost friends and
previous colleagues from overseas,&#8221; said Steven Ng, a deputy
manager, and Gary Sim, a vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based ICAP, the world&#8217;s largest broker of trades
between banks, has almost 5,000 employees in 32 countries and
values and respects &#8220;everyone who contributes to our
business,&#8221; Mike Sheard, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenkilde is needed in a new role reporting to Chief
Executive Officer Michael Spencer and was succeeded by Sydney-
based Hugh Gallagher as head of ICAP&#8217;s Asia operations at the
end of September, Sheard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McClumpha will return to London in a few months to work on
ICAP&#8217;s e-swaps platform, Sheard said, adding that the changes
aren&#8217;t related to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Daniel from Advocatus Law LLP and Suresh Nair
from Straits Law Practice LLC are representing the brokers. Andy
Leck from Baker  McKenzie.Wong  Leow is acting for ICAP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petters Trustee Sues JPMorgan Chase, Ritchie Capital &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Ritchie Capital Management LLC
were sued by the U.S. bankruptcy trustee for companies run by
convicted Ponzi schemer Thomas Petters in an effort to recover
more than $261 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee, Douglas Kelley, filed the complaints Oct. 10
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Minneapolis, where he has brought
more than 200 lawsuits seeking to recover billions of dollars
for creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petters last year was sentenced to 50 years in prison after
being found guilty of running a $3.5 billion fraud. Petters
conned investors into giving him money to finance phony
consumer-goods purchase contracts. His Minnetonka, Minnesota-
based businesses also owned Sun Country Airlines Inc. and
Polaroid Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelley alleged that New York-based JPMorgan, a shareholder
in Polaroid before Petters acquired it, received more than $241
million of Petters&#8217;s ill-gotten gains. Kelley also seeks to
recover more than $12 million from former Polaroid Holding Co.
Chairman Jacques Nasser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said the bank was
unaware of the case and he couldn&#8217;t comment on it. A spokesman
for Nasser, the chairman of mining company BHP Billiton Ltd.,
couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Meise, a spokesman for Ritchie Capital, said he
couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are In re Petters Co., 08-45257; Kelley v.

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WestLB Seeks $22.3 Million From Nomura in Trial Over Notes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WestLB AG, the German lender bailed out during the
financial crisis, told a London court yesterday that a Nomura
Holdings Inc. unit should pay $22.3 million for securities it
wrongly said were worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nomura unit last year used an inappropriate bidding
procedure to determine the price of 195,000 shares in an
investment fund after missing a deadline to physically deliver
the notes instead of paying their cash value, WestLB argued on
the first day of a trial at the High Court in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura had a right to choose the valuation method and the
notes were worthless because several banks expressed no interest
in them, said Nomura&#8217;s lawyer, Richard Handyside. &#8220;The
valuation should be held to be final and binding,&#8221; he said in
an Oct. 7 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WestLB claims Nomura should have used the $22.3 million
cash value of the notes established by the fund&#8217;s manager,
Mauritian International Trust Co., or Mitco. Tokyo-based Nomura
claims Mitco didn&#8217;t provide enough information about the fund&#8217;s
underlying assets, or its methodology for determining the value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial comes as state-owned WestLB is shedding risky
businesses and preparing to sell itself by the end of 2011 under
conditions imposed by the European Commission after the bank was
bailed out. Germany&#8217;s Soffin bank-rescue fund agreed last year

&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale Calls Claim Bank Lied to Court &#8216;Defamatory&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA provided &#8220;full transparency&#8221; about a
1.7 billion-euro deferred tax credit it received because of the
4.9 billion-euro 2008 trading loss from Jerome Kerviel, the
bank&#8217;s lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is defamatory to claim that Societe Generale had lied
to the court about its loss,&#8221; Jean Veil, a lawyer for the bank,
told Europe1 radio yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale confirmed his statement and released
details on the tax credit, reported as early as August 2008, to
refute comments by Kerviel&#8217;s lawyer Olivier Metzner to France
Info radio on Oct. 9. Metzner said the bank &#8220;voluntarily,
fraudulently tricked the court&#8221; by not figuring the credit into
its calculation of the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute over the size of Societe Generale&#8217;s loss comes
less than a week after a Paris criminal court ordered Kerviel,
33, to repay the full 4.9 billion euros. A Societe Generale
spokeswoman said the next day the bank was willing to negotiate
a reduction in the award, which is being appealed together with
Kerviel&#8217;s three-year jail sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They should have asked for an amount that took into
account&#8221; the tax credit, Metzner said in a phone interview
yesterday. &#8220;Therefore they misled the court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any revision to the damages award will be up to the appeal
court, Metzner said. He hasn&#8217;t been contacted by the bank or its
lawyers about the proposed negotiation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel amassed 50 billion euros in unauthorized positions,
concealed with faked hedges. The Paris-based bank discovered the
trades in January 2008 and decided to unwind the bets over three
days, resulting in the loss. The court rejected his defense that
the bank knew about and encouraged what he was doing, holding
Kerviel solely responsible. He was convicted of breach of trust,
forgery and computer hacking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airgas to Appeal Court Ruling on Meeting Date in Takeover Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airgas Inc., fighting a $5.5 billion takeover bid by Air
Products  Chemicals Inc., plans to appeal a court ruling that
would allow the industrial-gas supplier&#8217;s next annual meeting to
be held in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge William B. Chandler III ruled
Oct. 8 that a bylaw approved by Airgas shareholders last month
doesn&#8217;t improperly shorten the terms of directors on the
company&#8217;s staggered board. Air Products may use the ruling to
take control of Airgas at the January meeting. Airgas rose 3.2
percent in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Airgas continues to believe that the proposed amendment
to its bylaws,&#8221; which moves up the meeting date from as early
as April, &#8220;is invalid under both Delaware law and Airgas&#8217;s
Certificate of Incorporation,&#8221; the Radnor, Pennsylvania-based
company said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Air Products  Chemicals Inc. v. Airgas Inc.,
5249, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington); and Airgas Inc. v.
Air Products  Chemicals Inc., 5817, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman U.K. Unit Seeks Ruling on $1 Billion in Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s U.K. unit asked a London
judge to determine the ownership of more than $1 billion worth
of securities left in the bank&#8217;s accounts when it collapsed two
years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers International Europe lawyer Iain Milligan
told Justice Michael Briggs that former Lehman units are
contesting the ownership of the securities that they had bought
and sold to each other in a series of internal transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed for the U.S.&#8217;s biggest bankruptcy in September
2008, disrupting financial markets and contributing to the worst
economic crisis since the Great Depression. The U.K. unit has
been involved in suits with the parent company in the U.S. and
affiliates throughout Europe over billions in accounts frozen
when the bank collapsed. Last week, it lost a German ruling over
$1.1 billion held by Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately you are being asked to make sense of what is
in some regards, a mess,&#8221; Milligan told the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milligan said that the case is complicated because the
bank&#8217;s internal transactions hadn&#8217;t been as well documented as
transactions with &#8220;the outside world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers International Europe was buying and selling
securities both on its own and on behalf of other affiliates,
Milligan said, leaving a constantly changing balance in its
accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG in Talks to Settle Duke Stripper-Lacrosse Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. is in talks with Duke
University to settle a lawsuit over expenses tied to the
school&#8217;s court dispute with lacrosse team members falsely
accused of sexually assaulting a stripper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke and a unit of New York-based AIG set a mediation date
in the almost 2-year-old case, according to a motion filed last
week. The school was seeking reimbursement of costs from
confidential settlements with three members of the team who were
exonerated after they were accused of rape by a stripper invited
to a 2006 party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties are hopeful that they will be able to resolve
this dispute at the November 4 mediation and have agreed that it
is preferable to avoid incurring significant expenses,&#8221;
according to the motion from AIG and Duke in federal court in
Durham, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A settlement may reduce distractions as AIG seeks to repay
taxpayer loans within its $182.3 billion government bailout.
Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche has settled disputes
with investors and former CEO Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke and AIG have held settlement talks and agreed to
reconvene, according to the Oct. 8 filing. Mark Herr, a
spokesman for AIG, and Michael Schoenfeld of Durham-based Duke
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke had demanded reimbursement for costs tied to lawsuits
by players and another by the team&#8217;s former coach over the
school&#8217;s role in investigating the accusation, according to the
November 2008 complaint. The athletes said Duke remained silent
during the probe even though the university had evidence they
were innocent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Duke University and Duke University Health
System Inc. v. National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh
Pa., 08-cv-0854, U.S. District Court, Middle District of North
Carolina (Durham). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SKS Microfinance CEO Needs Board Approval for Major Decisions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SKS Microfinance Ltd., the Indian lender backed by George
Soros, said a court ruled that newly appointed Chief Executive
Officer M.R. Rao can&#8217;t make major decisions without the approval
of the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SKS Microfinance shares have declined 3.6 percent since
Oct. 4, when the lender replaced Suresh Gurumani with Rao, four
years before the end of Gurumani&#8217;s term. The stock rose 0.4
percent at the 3:30 p.m. close on the Bombay Stock Exchange
yesterday, bringing gains since its Aug. 10 initial public
offering to 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Andhra Pradesh High Court&#8217;s ruling, which came in
response to an application from S. Lekha to stop SKS&#8217;s board
from terminating Gurumani&#8217;s term as CEO, will be effective
pending further orders, the company said in a statement to the
Bombay Stock Exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurumani continues to serve on the board of SKS, India&#8217;s
largest microfinance lender, the Hyderabad-based company said in
a response to the court. He &#8220;can take every possible action to
protect the interests of every person concerned as a member of
the board,&#8221; the court said in its ruling dated Oct. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has withdrawn &#8220;all powers and authorities
granted&#8221; to Gurumani, it said in a statement to the Bombay
Stock Exchange on Oct. 4. The company&#8217;s management, including
founder Vikram Akula, hasn&#8217;t said why Gurumani was fired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Whistleblower Ang Seng Thor Fined Rather Than Jailed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ang Seng Thor, the former head of AEM-Evertech Holdings
Ltd., was fined rather than jailed for corruption by a Singapore
judge after disclosing bribes to companies including Seagate
Technology Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His whistle-blowing led to the full discovery of
wrongdoings that were difficult to find and prosecute, Singapore
District Judge John Ng said in his ruling yesterday. Ang, who
pleaded guilty, &#8220;played a passive role&#8221; in the bribery, Ng
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ang told the board of Singapore-based AEM in 2005 that its
executives including himself and former Chairman Tok Kian You
bribed employees at Seagate and Infineon Technologies AG,
according to court papers. The former CEO also informed the
board of STMicroelectronics NV that bribes were given to its
executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ang was fined a total of S$200,000 ($153,000) for two
corruption charges and barred five years from being a company
director, Ng said. He could have been jailed for as long as five
years for each charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendell Wong, Ang&#8217;s lawyer, had asked for a fine instead of
a jail term, saying the prospect of imprisonment would deter
whistleblowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore&#8217;s courts must accord a significant recognition to
whistleblowers, who deserve a discount on their sentence, Ng
said. &#8220;At the same time, we need not elevate whistle-blowing to
an exalted level,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AEM-Evertech was renamed AEM Holdings Ltd. in May 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Public Prosecutor v Ang Seng Thor DACs 20430-
5/2010 in the Singapore Subordinate Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settles Brand Dispute With Founder Stelios &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EasyJet Plc resolved a brand-license dispute with founder
Stelios&#160;Haji-Ioannou, giving Europe&#8217;s second-largest discount
airline greater freedom to boost revenue through marketing deals
with other travel companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airline will retain the right to the EasyJet name for
as long as 50 years, with a minimum commitment of 10 years, by
paying an annual royalty of 0.25 percent of total revenue, fixed
at 3.9 million pounds ($6.2 million) and 4.95 million pounds in
the first and second years, EasyJet said yesterday in a
statement. The Luton, England-based company reported sales of
2.67 billion pounds in the last fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stelios, who prefers to be known by his first name, alleged
that EasyJet had infringed on an agreement it signed with his
EasyGroup holding company in November 2000, shortly before the
airline&#8217;s initial offering of shares to investors. The dispute
centered on whether the carrier was violating terms of the
contract specifying that at least 75 percent of sales must come
from airline operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this as a new chapter in working with EasyGroup
going forward,&#8221; EasyJet Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall
said yesterday on a conference call with reporters. &#8220;It gives
us more freedom to use the brand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EasyJet&#8217;s other investors, who must approve the agreement,
are &#8220;very supportive,&#8221; McCall said. The executive, who became
CEO in July, said the dispute with Stelios, the carrier&#8217;s
biggest shareholder, had cost the company about 4 million pounds
in legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG had its share-price
estimate cut 9.5 percent to 52 euros ($71.80) at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., which lowered profit forecasts following the bank&#8217;s
share sale and the planned purchase of Deutsche Postbank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage reduced its estimates for per-share profit at
the Frankfurt-based bank for this year and 2011 by 13 percent
and 22 percent, respectively, according to a report to clients
today. Goldman Sachs now foresees earnings per share of 5.43
euros this year and 5.54 euros in 2011, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Josef Ackermann, is offering 25 euros a share in cash to Postbank
investors to increase its 29.95 percent stake in the Bonn-based
lender. Deutsche Bank last week completed a record 10.2 billion-
euro share sale to fund the acquisition and increase reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs estimated that Deutsche Bank will have a 2012
core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, of
7.9 percent following the takeover of Postbank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank fell 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 40.19 euros
by 11:10 a.m. in Frankfurt trading, bringing the decline this
year to 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. resumed coverage of Deutsche Bank&#8217;s
stock with a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating and a share estimate of 49
euros. The brokerage cut its estimates for Deutsche Bank&#8217;s 2011
and 2012 per-share earnings by 29 percent and 28 percent,
respectively, citing the share sale and the Postbank takeover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Pension Service, South
Korea&#8217;s biggest state fund, has bought Chevron Corp.&#8217;s stake in
Colonial Pipeline Co. in partnership with Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts  Co. to diversify its investment portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Korean fund has purchased a 23.44 percent stake
in the operator of the largest pipeline linking U.S. Gulf Coast
refiners and East Coast markets, National Pension said in an e-
mailed statement today, without disclosing the transaction value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investment is part of our efforts to diversify
globally to ensure stable long-term returns, and it would be an
important opportunity to expand investments in energy-related
assets,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Pension was picked as a preferred bidder to
acquire the stake for about 1 trillion won ($890 million), the
Korea Economic Daily said on Aug. 23, citing an unidentified
official at the fund. Kim Ha Young, a spokesman at National
Pension, declined today to comment on the value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund supplied most of the capital for the purchase,
said two people familiar with the deal, who asked not to be
identified because the terms are confidential. KKR will manage
the asset on behalf of the South Korean fund, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese policy makers may be
divided over the pace of credit growth with inflation picking
up even as there are &#8220;downside&#8221; risks to economic growth,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s central bank has raised the reserve requirements
for six banks for a two-month period, three people with
knowledge of the matter said. Such a &#8220;partial&#8221; increase
doesn&#8217;t require the approval of the State Council, China&#8217;s
cabinet, according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The step comes as policy makers attempt to rein in the
property market to avert a bubble and keep housing affordable.
While the government has tightened mortgage-lending rules,
broader credit growth so far this year is on pace to exceed
officials&#8217; 2010 target. Both the China Banking Regulatory
Commission and People&#8217;s Bank of China guide lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The required reserve ratio hike is used as a clear
signal to commercial banks that the central bank is willing
to take actions to control lending as necessary even &#8216;if&#8217; the
CBRC is taking a back seat in credit controls,&#8221; Goldman
analysts Yu Song and Helen Qiao in Hong Kong wrote in today&#8217;s
report. The fact that the increase doesn&#8217;t apply to all banks
and wasn&#8217;t announced publicly &#8220;may also reflect the
significant uncertainties facing the economy and
disagreements among the views of policy makers,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratio Increase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratio will increase 50 basis points for Bank of
China Ltd., Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp., Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.,
China Minsheng Banking Corp. and China Merchants Bank Co.,
the people said, declining to be identified because no public
announcement has been made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current reserve ratio level is 17 percent for the
biggest banks and 15 percent for smaller ones. The People&#8217;s
Bank of China and the six banks declined to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese banks may have extended 500 billion yuan ($75
billion) in new local-currency loans last month, a Bloomberg
News survey of 18 economists shows. That would compare with
545 billion yuan in August. M2, the broadest measure of money
supply, may have climbed 18.9 percent in September from a
year earlier, according to economists&#8217; median estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan Guidance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s central bank has refrained from following
counterparts across Asia in raising interest rates this year
as the global economy pulled out of a recession and trade
recovered. Policy makers have instead relied on raising the
reserve ratio and using loan guidance to banks to tamp down
credit growth after a record 9.59 trillion yuan tally in 2009.
Regulators targeted 7.5 trillion yuan for new loans this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is in no &#8220;hurry&#8221; to reduce consumer-price
inflation and will focus on pushing down housing prices to
strengthen the economic recovery, PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in Washington on Oct. 10. It may take two
years for the inflation rate to fall below 3 percent, from a
22-month high of 3.5 percent in August, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since the fiscal and monetary expansion has already
got into effect, we cannot be very hurry to get inflation
under control,&#8221; said Zhou, speaking in English. &#8220;We have a
medium-term plan. I hope this medium-term plan is credible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money Inflows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts are split on the extent to which the central
bank&#8217;s move signals a tighter monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac Meng, a Beijing-based economist at BNP Paribas,
said that the central bank may have acted in anticipation of
extra money flowing into China because of quantitative easing
in the U.S. and investors betting on gains by the yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He described it as a &#8220;moderate move towards
tightening&#8221; and said that benchmark interest rates may stay
on hold until the first quarter of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. said yesterday that rates may rise
as early as this quarter, with reserve ratios increasing
three more times next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank&#8217;s move is a &#8220;response to strong
capital inflows&#8221; triggered by the nation&#8217;s growth, prospects
for gains by the yuan and quantitative easing by major
central banks, Nomura economists said in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., economist Shen Jianguang
said the temporary nature of the reserve-ratio increase
signals that the People&#8217;s Bank of China hasn&#8217;t shifted stance.
A comment by HSBC Holdings Plc was headed &#8220;No policy U-
turn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold may rally more than 20 percent
from this month&#8217;s record to a high of $1,650 an ounce in 12
months as the Federal Reserve takes action to stimulate the U.S.
economy, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion may gain to $1,400 an ounce in three months and
$1,525 an ounce in six months, analysts David Greely and Damien Courvalin wrote in a note dated yesterday. Gold for immediate
delivery reached an all-time high of $1,364.77 on Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is considering whether to add to its purchases of
Treasury bonds to spur the economic recovery, an action known as
quantitative easing. The central bank may next month announce
purchases of about $500 billion, Goldman Sachs said in a
separate e-mailed note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With U.S. real interest rates pushing lower off the
slowdown in the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and the
growing prospect of another round of quantitative easing, we
expect gold prices to continue to climb,&#8221; New York-based Greely
and Courvalin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot bullion fell 0.3 percent to $1,349.90 an ounce at 2:50
p.m. Melbourne time, declining for the first time in three days.
Gold for December delivery on the Comex in New York dropped 0.3
percent to $1,350.80. The bank in August forecast that gold may
rally to $1,300 an ounce in six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts recommended buying Comex December 2011 gold
futures. They also recommended investors buy Nymex January 2011
platinum, saying that &#8220;recovering global automobile demand will
likely continue to put upward pressure on auto-catalyst demand
and therefore on platinum and palladium prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, gold prices will come under downward
pressure once the U.S. economy strengthens and the Federal
Reserve begins to tighten monetary policy, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rising risk of declining gold prices once the U.S.
Federal Reserve begins tightening monetary policy suggests this
is a good time for gold producers to begin scaled up hedging of
forward production, particularly for calendar 2012 and beyond,&#8221;
the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. principal-
strategies traders in Asia, which make bets with the bank&#8217;s own
money, hired former prime broker Roger Denby-Jones as chief
operating officer of a hedge fund firm they&#8217;re leaving the bank
to start, four people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denby-Jones, 46, will become COO of the new Hong Kong-based
hedge-fund firm to be led by Morgan Sze, global head of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s principal strategies business, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. He will
help set up the company, though he won&#8217;t be a Goldman Sachs
employee, they said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are
complying with the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul act in the U.S.
that prohibits them from risking capital by betting for their
own accounts. Goldman Sachs, which makes about 10 percent of its
revenue from proprietary trading, decided to disband the
principal-strategies group, two people with knowledge of the
decision said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of Denby-Jones is likely to help the new
firm raise capital by easing investor concerns that proprietary
traders are not experienced at managing risks, businesses or
even calculating fund performances like hedge funds do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hedge-fund teams out of proprietary desks are used to
having all operational tasks and risk management taken care of
by the bank,&#8221; said Francois Hora, Hong Kong-based Asia head 
of fund of hedge funds firm Signet Capital Management Ltd. which
oversees $1.5 billion. &#8220;There is therefore a risk that they 
don&#8217;t give enough importance to the operational side of the 
business when setting up the hedge fund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prop-Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs principal-strategies traders in Asia,
still employed by the bank at the moment, are expected to leave
after the end of this year, said the people. Their fund may
start after the first quarter, two of them added. Edward Naylor,
a Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denby-Jones joined Boyer Allan Investment Management LLP,
an Asia-focused fund manager that oversees more than $775
million, in 2005 after 14 years at Goldman Sachs, where one of
his roles was head of prime brokerage sales for Europe. He left
as chief executive officer of Boyer Allan to &#8220;pursue a new
business opportunity,&#8221; the firm said in a Sept. 30 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s principal-strategies team members in New
York, led by Bob Howard, are in talks to join another asset-
management firm, people familiar with the matter said last month.
Some other traders and support staff of the group are likely to
get roles within the New York-based firm, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sze is leading the Asia team to raise money for a new Asia-
focused hedge fund, the people said last month. The group has
more than 10 people in Asia, two of the people said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman to Hedge Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From Eric Mindich and Dinakar Singh to Hyder Ahmad and
Shafiq Karmali, there is a good track record of Goldman Sachs
principal strategies alumni building successful hedge funds,&#8221;
said Dan McNicholas, head of Asia financing sales at Bank of
America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch  Co. unit. He declined to comment
on Denby-Jones&#8217;s appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindich started New York-based Eton Park Capital Management
LP with $3 billion in 2004 with former principal-strategies
department co-head Erland Karlsson. Singh, a former head of the
principal strategies group, co-founded TPG-Axon the same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad raised about $1 billion for his Singapore-based hedge
fund Broad Peak in 2007, Wall Street Journal reported then.
Karmali last year founded Hong Kong-based hedge fund Cypress
Lane Capital LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turiya Advisors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davide Erro, who led the Asia arm of a Goldman Sachs desk
that later folded into principal strategies, managed as much as
$3.8 billion as chief investment officer of Gandhara Capital.
Turiya Advisors Asia, the Hong Kong-based hedge fund firm he set
up after Gandhara&#8217;s closure, raised $320 million for its fund
by last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre-Henri Flamand, Sze&#8217;s predecessor as global head of
the group, left earlier this year to set up London-based hedge
fund called Edoma Capital Partners LLP, two people with direct
knowledge told Bloomberg this week. He is expected to raise half
a billion dollars in the coming months, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key question for a proprietary desk spinoff to answer
is not one about their talent, but one about their business-
management ability as their careers have been cocooned with an
investment bank,&#8221; said Paul Smith, a Hong Kong-based managing
director of asset manager and hedge-fund distributor Triple A
Partners Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong COO who is also a partner and gets the necessary
resources would help free up the fund manager&#8217;s time to focus on
investments, Hora said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jesse Westbrook" date="Oct 13, 2010 10:07 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-13/sec-investigation-finds-no-evidence-goldman-suit-was-timed-to-help-obama.html"><headline>SEC Investigation Finds No Evidence Politics Drove Goldman Suit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s internal watchdog said he found no evidence a
lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was driven by politics
or that agency officials timed the case to help President Barack Obama win support for financial-regulation legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s April 16 announcement of the suit against New
York-based Goldman Sachs was driven by concern it would be
leaked to the public, efforts to maintain a relationship with
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and &#8220;maximizing and
shaping positive press coverage,&#8221; Inspector General H. David Kotz wrote in an 82-page report released by the agency yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs, accusing the Wall Street firm
of selling a mortgage security without disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped design the asset and was betting it
would fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotz agreed to examine the case after U.S. Representative
Darrell Issa, a California Republican, questioned whether the
SEC timed the case to help Obama secure enough votes to pass the
financial rules overhaul being debated in Congress. SEC Chairman
Mary Schapiro denied any communication with the White House or
lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This report reaffirms that the case was brought on the
merits and only on the merits,&#8221; SEC spokesman John Nester said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotz, who reviewed more than 3.4 million e-mails written by
64 current and former SEC officials, said he didn&#8217;t find any
evidence that agency officials coordinated the Goldman Sachs
lawsuit with White House employees, members of Congress,
congressional employees or Democratic electoral groups. Sworn
testimony was taken from 32 witnesses, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$300 Million Fine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed in July to pay a $300 million fine and
$250 million as restitution to investors who lost money on the
deal. The company didn&#8217;t admit or deny the SEC&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs executive
director accused of misleading investors who invested in the
Abacus collateralized debt obligation. Tourre is fighting the
agency&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC first scheduled a vote by commissioners on the
Goldman Sachs case for December 2009, the report said. The
agency delayed the vote so its enforcement staff could take
testimony from an additional witness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC then felt pressure in January 2010 to move the case
forward, because agency staff learned that the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations was considering holding a hearing
on Goldman Sachs. SEC officials grew concerned that aspects of
the probe might be made public by the panel, which is chaired by
Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioner&#8217;s Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC scheduled a second commissioner vote for Jan. 28.
The vote was delayed again due to concerns expressed by a
commissioner, discussions about whether to accuse an
&#8220;additional individual&#8221; of wrongdoing and a decision by
enforcement attorneys to pursue more evidence, Kotz wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once SEC commissioners approved the case in a 3-2 vote on
April 14, the agency encountered obstacles in deciding when to
publicly announce the action, Kotz found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York&#8217;s Cuomo planned to announce a $7 million fine
against Quadrangle Group LLC on April 15 over allegations that
the money-management firm paid kickbacks to win an investment
from a state retirement fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, which was ready to file its own case against New
York-based Quadrangle, didn&#8217;t want to alienate Cuomo by
distracting from his case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was a little worried that the attorney general would be
very upset if we announced multiple cases the same day,&#8221;
Schapiro testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confuse Media &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC staff was also concerned that announcing the agency&#8217;s
own Quadrangle case and the Goldman Sachs matter on the same day
would &#8220;confuse the media&#8217;s focus&#8221; and dilute press coverage,
according to the report. As a result, the SEC moved the Goldman
Sachs announcement to April 16, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure of the Goldman Sachs case coincided with the
release of a separate Kotz report into SEC investigations of R.
Allen Stanford, who&#8217;s facing trial in Texas for spearheading a
$7 billion fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotz&#8217;s earlier probe found the SEC failed to conduct a
meaningful probe of Stanford&#8217;s firm until 2005 even though
agency examiners suspected he was engaging in wrongdoing eight
years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC ultimately sued Stanford in February 2009, claiming
he used an Antigua-based bank to sell billions of dollars in
bogus certificates of deposit. He&#8217;s denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotz said he failed to find any &#8220;concrete&#8221; evidence that
the SEC delayed announcement of the Goldman Sachs case to
detract attention from his Stanford report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewed Complaints &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC watchdog also reviewed complaints by Goldman Sachs
executives that the agency didn&#8217;t warn the firm before filing
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone records of a Goldman Sachs attorney found the first
call from the SEC came at 10:39 a.m. New York time, ten minutes
after the agency filed the case and seven minutes after it
issued a press release, according to Kotz&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One unidentified SEC official testified that the agency was
concerned Goldman Sachs would try to manipulate media coverage
if given too much advance notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is a pretty sophisticated player,&#8221; the SEC
official said, according to the report. &#8220;If you know that
something is coming from the SEC, you can maybe take certain
actions to precondition the reporters about the case. Maybe the
coverage would not be as favorable, from the SEC&#8217;s
perspective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to Settle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami testified that
Goldman Sach&#8217;s attorney contacted him after the lawsuit&#8217;s
announcement to complain the firm didn&#8217;t get a chance to settle
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khuzami told the lawyer that Goldman Sachs had &#8220;many
opportunities to settle.&#8221; Khuzami also said he didn&#8217;t think it
was a &#8220;good idea&#8221; for the SEC to always notify a target before
filing a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s office of public affairs maintains a press policy
that says &#8220;every effort should be made to avoid the possibility
that defendants in an SEC enforcement action first learn of the
action when they read about it in the newspapers or when they
are called by a reporter for comment,&#8221; Kotz&#8217;s report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC watchdog said the agency didn&#8217;t fully comply with
the policy in the Goldman Sachs matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sach&#8217;s shares tumbled as much as 16 percent after
the case was announced, and financial stocks fell broadly that
day. Lorin Reisner, Khuzami&#8217;s deputy, testified that additional
consultation with SEC officials who oversee stock trading before
filing the case &#8220;couldn&#8217;t have been a bad thing,&#8221; according to
the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alarmed by Coverage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotz found SEC officials, including Schapiro, were alarmed
by the amount of press coverage the case received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many SEC witnesses in this investigation, including
Chairman Schapiro, testified that they were surprised or shocked
at the extent of the media attention given to the Goldman
action,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This belief held by the SEC staff, which is corroborated
by e-mails, that the Goldman action might not have significant
public impact, much less the impact that it ultimately had, is
another factor that argues against the idea that the SEC or its
staff were attempting to influence financial regulatory reform
legislation,&#8221; Kotz&#8217;s report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cadre of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
traders in Asia preparing to start their own hedge fund hired
Roger Denby-Jones, a former prime broker at the investment bank,
as their firm&#8217;s chief operating officer, four people with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denby-Jones, 46, will become COO of the new Hong Kong-based
hedge-fund firm to be led by Morgan Sze, global head of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s principal strategies business, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. He will
help to set up the company, though he won&#8217;t be a Goldman Sachs
employee, they added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are
complying with the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul act in the U.S.
that prohibits them from risking capital by betting for their
own accounts. Goldman Sachs, which makes about 10 percent of its
revenue from proprietary trading, decided to disband the
principal-strategies business, two people with knowledge of the
decision said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRC Gets IPO Orders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petropavlovsk Plc&#8217;s IRC Ltd. received orders for all the
shares in its Hong Kong initial public offering after delaying
the sale and reducing the price, according to two people
familiar with the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iron-ore unit of Russia&#8217;s third-largest gold producer
cut the offer price to HK$1.80 a share from a range of HK$2.20
to HK$3 and now has the entire book of 1.04 billion shares
covered at the reduced price, said one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bookrunners for the IPO, Bank of America Corp., UBS AG
and Bank of China International Holdings Ltd., will stop taking
orders at 5 p.m. in Hong Kong on Oct. 15, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communist Party Plenum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Communist Party elite gather in Beijing tomorrow in
the wake of a public challenge from retired officials who accuse
some leaders of censoring calls by Premier Wen Jiabao for
greater political openness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 200-odd Central Committee members are set to discuss
personnel changes and a new five-year economic plan that starts
in 2011. Vice President Xi Jinping may take a position on the
party&#8217;s military commission, paving the way for him to replace
General Secretary and President Hu Jintao, who steps down in
late 2012, political analysts say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the plenum, Wen has called for a
relaxation of state control of social and political affairs. At
last year&#8217;s session, Hu advocated more &#8220;intra-party
democracy,&#8221; to give lower-level officials a greater hand in
appointments and policymaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARKETS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark indexes to five-month
highs, as better-than-estimated results at CSX Corp. and China&#8217;s
record currency reserves boosted optimism in the economic
recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX, the second-largest publicly traded U.S. railroad,
rallied 4.7 percent after also saying it&#8217;s seeing improvements
across almost all markets. Alcoa Inc. added 1.6 percent and
Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. advanced 4.5 percent,
leading a measure of raw- materials producers to the biggest
gain among 10 industries in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index,
amid speculation that Chinese demand will improve after the
world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy announced $2.65 trillion
in currency reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 1 percent to 1,181.41 at 2:58 p.m. in New
York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 112.47 points,
or 1 percent, to 11,132.87. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. expanded its
partnership with Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Bing search engine, letting
people automatically see what their Facebook friends think about
the topics they&#8217;re seeking information on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing&#8217;s new search screen also will let users become a
person&#8217;s friend on Facebook or send a message to the social-
networking service, Microsoft and Facebook said today at a media
event in Mountain View, California. Searches for restaurants or
movies will spotlight the ones that a user&#8217;s friends like. Terms
of the partnership weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a new era,&#8221; Qi Lu, president of online services
at Microsoft, said at the event. &#8220;Can the search experience be
better if all the people you trust are part of that experience?
You will find that the experience will be much better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is counting on traffic from Facebook, the world&#8217;s
most popular social network, as it steps up competition with
Google Inc. Microsoft is merging its search operations with
Yahoo! Inc. this year in a bid to challenge Google&#8217;s dominance
in the market. The new features &#8220;offer a lot of promise,&#8221; said
Danny Sullivan, who runs the search-analysis website Search
Engine Land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This opens the idea that your friends can somewhat mind-
meld with your search engine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s still
more to be done. The early implementation shows a lot of gaps so
far to me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

accused the Securities and Exchange Commission of withholding an
internal review that evaluates whether politics drove the
agency&#8217;s April lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issa, in a letter sent to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro today,
said he directed his staff to work with the agency to obtain an
unedited copy of the report &#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221; The SEC
rejected the request, wrote Issa, the top Republican on the
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Your refusal to fully cooperate with the committee&#8217;s
investigation of the commission&#8217;s actions is simply
unacceptable,&#8221; Issa wrote. The California lawmaker demanded
that the agency give him an un-redacted copy of the report by
the end of the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz agreed to examine the
Goldman Sachs case after Issa questioned whether the agency
timed its announcement to help President Barack Obama and
congressional Democrats win approval for financial-regulation
legislation. Schapiro has denied any communication with the
White House or lawmakers, and said politics play no role in SEC
enforcement actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester said he had no immediate comment
on Issa&#8217;s letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotz gave Schapiro&#8217;s office a copy of his report on Sept.
30, Issa wrote. SEC policies bar Kotz from sharing the document
with Issa or discussing it with the lawmaker, according to Issa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs April 16, accusing the Wall
Street firm of selling a mortgage security without disclosing
that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped design the asset and was
betting it would fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a settlement announced in July, New York-based Goldman
Sachs agreed to pay a $300 million fine and $250 million as
restitution to investors who lost money on the deal. Goldman
Sachs didn&#8217;t admit or deny the SEC&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian mining companies, banks,
homebuilders and transportation companies will likely eclipse
gains for retailers, which have led this year&#8217;s advance in Latin
America&#8217;s largest market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilder PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos  Participacoes,
payment processor Cielo SA and private equity firm GP
Investments Ltd. were added to the Goldman Sachs focus list of
Latin American stocks, analysts at the New York-based bank said
in a note today. Consumer-goods company Hypermarcas SA was
removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With great disparities in performance among Brazilian
stocks and sectors so far in 2010, we believe it is time to
rotate sectorally out of consumer and retail stocks that have
been the top performers into other parts of the market,
strategist Stephen Graham wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman also said it expects the Bovespa stock index to
rise 10 percent to 78,000 by yearend from the Oct. 11 close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer goods companies led gains the MSCI Brazil index&#8217;s
6.2 percent rise this year, while energy producers were the
biggest laggards. As the Bovespa rose 4.5 percent this year,
retailer Lojas Renner SA and tobacco maker Souza Cruz SA surged
more than 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrasts a 27 percent drop for pulp producer Fibria
Celulose SA and a 30 percent decline for Petroleo Brasileiro SA,
Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil company. Goldman has &#8220;buy&#8221;
ratings on Fibria and Petroleo Brasileiros, along with iron ore
miner Vale SA and pulp producer Suzano Papel e Celulose SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builders Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders, banks and transportation stocks led gains
today on the Bovespa. Builder MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA
surged 6.5 percent, leading a rally that pushed the BMFBovespa
Real Estate index up 3.7 percent. Airlines Gol Linhas Aereas
Inteligentes SA and Tam SA, jumped, rising 4.9 percent and 6
percent, respectively. The MSCI Brazil Financial index rose 2.6
percent, led by federally controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vale gained 0.5 percent to 47.64 reais. Fibria fell 2.1
percent to 28.62 reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodity stocks we think will especially shine, as
developed-market central banks provide a continued flow of
liquidity,&#8221; wrote Graham, who is &#8220;bearish&#8221; on Brazilian
steelmakers. &#8220;Defensive utilities and telcos may not perform in
the strong market we expect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities have gained since U.S. Federal Reserve policy
makers said at their most recent meeting on Sept. 21 that too-
low inflation would warrant looser monetary policy. The Fed will
keep its benchmark interest rate on overnight loans between
banks near zero through 2011, according to the survey median,
longer than previously estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian steelmakers won&#8217;t benefit as much from higher
commodity prices because profit margins will be &#8220;squeezed&#8221; by
rising iron ore and coal costs and steel imports will
&#8220;pressure&#8221; prices domestically, wrote Graham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in Brazil will post earnings growth of 39 percent in
2010 and 31 percent in 2011, more than &#8220;higher-flying&#8221;
retailers that have surged this year, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Financials of course face a different set of risks from
retailers, and generally we do not expect their multiples to be
as high, but the gap at the moment seems excessive,&#8221; Graham
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange
Commission told a federal judge that its lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Fabrice Tourre should proceed because the
complaint &#8220;alleges that an unlawful securities transaction took
place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world&#8217;s biggest payment networks, climbed in New York trading
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. reported a 6.6 percent increase in
credit-card spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa advanced 3.6 percent to $76.94, the highest since
July, at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, rose 3.9 percent to
$230.89, the highest since May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on the bank&#8217;s credit cards increased to $79.6
billion during the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with
$74.7 billion in the same period a year earlier and $78.1
billion in the second quarter, the company said in a financial
supplement accompanying its earnings release today. Total
transactions climbed 16 percent to 5.2 billion at Chase
Paymentech, JPMorgan&#8217;s merchant-acquiring business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
credit-card issuer, &#8220;reinforce the view that the upcoming
earnings releases for Visa and MasterCard should continue to be
solid, representing another positive catalyst for the stocks,&#8221;
Adam Frisch, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to
clients. Visa is based in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co., the third-biggest payments network
and the biggest credit-card issuer by purchases, climbed 1.9
percent to $39.26. No. 4 network Discover Financial Services,
whose stock has outperformed the three larger competitors this
year, rose 3.5 percent to $17.68, the highest since May 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Oct 13, 2010  4:18 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-13/jpmorgan-third-quarter-net-rises-23-on-lower-credit-costs-beats-estimate.html"><headline>JPMorgan Net Beats Estimates on Lower Credit Costs</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said profit
rose 23 percent, exceeding analysts&#8217; estimates, as provisions
for bad loans shrank. Revenue slumped 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income climbed to $4.42 billion, or $1.01
a share, from $3.59 billion, or 82 cents, in the same period a
year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Twenty-two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated
adjusted earnings of 88 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit margins at JPMorgan, the first of the largest U.S.
banks to report earnings, narrowed as revenue from investment
banking and card services tumbled from a year earlier and non-
interest expenses rose 7 percent. Provisions for losses on
mortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans fell $5.8
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Revenues continue to be lower than I expected,&#8221; Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said in an
interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt on Bloomberg Radio.
&#8220;You continue to see an improvement in credit quality,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Albeit in the third quarter at a slowing pace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the country&#8217;s second-biggest bank by assets, said
revenue fell to $23.8 billion from $26.6 billion a year earlier.
Managed revenue, which includes the effect of some tax-exempt
securities, was $24.3 billion, compared with $28.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark
indexes to five-month highs, as better-than-estimated results at
CSX Corp. and China&#8217;s record currency reserves boosted optimism
in the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX, the second-largest publicly traded U.S. railroad,
rallied 4.2 percent after also saying it&#8217;s seeing improvements
across almost all markets. Alcoa Inc. added 1.3 percent and
Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. advanced 3.8 percent,
leading a measure of raw-materials producers to the biggest gain
among 10 industries in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, amid
speculation that Chinese demand will improve after the world&#8217;s
fastest-growing major economy announced $2.65 trillion in
currency reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,178.10 at 4 p.m. in New
York, the highest level since May 3. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average increased 75.68 points, or 0.7 percent, to 11,096.08. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market&#8217;s got a lot of tailwinds operating right
now,&#8221; said John Kattar, chief investment officer at Eastern
Investment Advisors in Boston, which manages $1.6 billion.
&#8220;Earnings should be good, and that should be a catalyst for the
market, and everyone&#8217;s looking ahead to&#8221; bond purchases by the
Federal Reserve to spur growth. &#8220;All risk assets have responded
dramatically just to expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose for a third day yesterday after Fed policy
makers indicated a readiness to pump more cash into the economy
to protect the recovery by buying additional Treasury securities,
a tactic known as quantitative easing. The gauge has rallied 15
percent from this year&#8217;s low on July 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Streak &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into this earnings season, more than 70 percent of
SP 500 companies have topped the average analyst earnings
estimate for five straight quarters, the longest streak in
Bloomberg data going back to 1993. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of Fed purchases has boosted the prices of
Treasury notes and bonds, driving two-year yields to record lows
and 10-year yields to the lowest since January 2009. While
discouraging investment in government debt, as benchmarks the
low yields keep borrowing costs down for companies and consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of mortgage applications in the U.S. climbed for
the first time in six weeks as record-low interest rates led to
a surge in refinancing. The Mortgage Bankers Association&#8217;s index
increased 15 percent in the week ended Oct. 8, the Washington-
based group said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euphoria &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Quantitative easing euphoria, coupled with the lack of
bad surprises from quarterly results, and some switch from bonds
toward equities in view of year-end portfolio rebalancing is
driving the market,&#8221; said Ricciardo Ricciardelli, managing
director at Unifortune Investment Management SGR SpA in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX jumped 4.2 percent to $59.66, the biggest gain since
June 10, after third-quarter profit topped analyst estimates.
The advance led industrial stocks to the second-biggest increase
among 10 industries in the SP 500. Earnings from continuing
operations climbed to $414 million, or $1.08 a share, exceeding
the $1.04 average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen companies in the SP 500 are scheduled to release
third-quarter results this week. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
predict 23 percent profit growth from a year earlier for
companies in the index, the fourth straight quarterly increase
after a record nine-quarter slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa, the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, advanced 1.3
percent to $13.37. Freeport-McMoRan, the world&#8217;s largest
publicly traded copper producer, gained 3.8 percent to $99.08. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper rose to a 27-month high in New York and London on
prospects for increased consumption of the metal. Crude oil rose
for the first time in three days after China, the world&#8217;s
largest consumer, reported record imports in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Reserves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s foreign-exchange reserves increased by a record to
$2.65 trillion at the end of September while a 25 percent jump
in exports lifted its trade surplus to $16.9 billion,
reinforcing optimism the country will continue to lead the
global recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks also rose after Japanese machinery orders
unexpectedly jumped 10.1 percent in August, the most since
December, and Australian consumer confidence rebounded in
October as the central bank extended a pause on interest-rate
increases and employment surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Intel Corp. declined even after
reporting third-quarter profit that topped the average analyst
estimates. JPMorgan, the first of the largest U.S. banks to
report earnings, fell 1.4 percent to $39.84 as revenue missed
some analysts&#8217; forecasts. Intel, the biggest maker of
semiconductors, dropped 2.7 percent after gaining for six days
in a row. Intel&#8217;s fourth-quarter sales forecast also beat the
average analyst estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings &#8216;A Positive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The initial signs from the bellwethers are that this
third-quarter earnings season is going to be a positive and help
lift the overall stock market,&#8221; said Robert Pavlik, chief
market strategist at Palm Beach Gardens, Florida-based Banyan
Partners LLC, which manages about $1 billion. &#8220;The slow growth
we&#8217;re seeing so far hasn&#8217;t done a tremendous negative impact to
these firms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams Cos. surged 9.8 percent to $21.53 for the biggest
advance in the SP 500. Citigroup Inc. maintained its &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating and $28.50 price estimate for the U.S. natural-gas
pipeline operator. The company is Citigroup&#8217;s top pick in the
integrated natural gas space, equity analyst Faisel Khan wrote
in a note to clients. Williams also announced that its Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Steve Malcolm will retire at the end
of the year. He&#8217;ll be succeeded as CEO by Alan Armstrong,
president of the company&#8217;s midstream business since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. advanced as much as 1.2 percent to a record
$301.96, before closing 0.5 percent higher at $300.14. The
company is making a version of its iPhone model that Verizon
Communications Inc. will sell, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearwire, MGM &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearwire Corp. jumped 6.8 percent to $7.21. The high-speed
wireless carrier is seeking to raise $2.5 billion to $5 billion
in a wireless spectrum auction that has attracted telephone and
cable companies, said people with direct knowledge of the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGM Resorts International tumbled 11 percent to $12.10. The
biggest casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip plans to raise
more than $500 million by selling stock, and said its founder
and biggest shareholder will reduce his stake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, named Douglas Petno chief operating
officer for commercial banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petno was previously head of investment banking for natural
resources companies, JPMorgan said in an internal memorandum on
Sept. 30. Its contents were confirmed by spokeswoman Tasha Pelio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A veteran investment banker, Petno advised Exxon Mobil
Corp. on its $31 billion purchase of XTO Energy Inc., and has
been part of the JPMorgan team counseling BHP Billiton Ltd. this
year on its $40 billion hostile pursuit of Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petno is being replaced by Eric Stein, previously head of
investment banking in North America for clients in &#8220;diversified
industries&#8221; such as General Electric Co., JPMorgan said in the
memo. Kelly Coffey, the former head of corporate derivatives
marketing for North America, takes Stein&#8217;s role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Oct 13, 2010  9:28 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-13/investment-banking-bonus-pool-slashed-31-by-jpmorgan-as-revenue-declines.html"><headline>Investment-Banking Bonus Pool Is Reduced by JPMorgan as Revenue Declines</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. slashed third-
quarter compensation for its investment-bank employees by 31
percent from the prior quarter as the company&#8217;s revenue
declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm set aside $2.03 billion for the period to pay
workers of its most profitable unit, 38 percent of the group&#8217;s
revenue, according to an earnings statement released today by
the New York-based bank. For the first nine months of the year,
the expense fell 10 percent to $7.88 billion from $8.79 billion
a year ago. That&#8217;s equal to $298,866 for each of the unit&#8217;s
26,373 workers at the end of September, down from $353,834 on
average for the division&#8217;s 24,828 employees a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, and other
Wall Street firms that hired workers in the last year had a drop
in fixed-income trading and investment-banking revenue. Expenses
at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank have risen 20 percent this year,
adding pressure to lower compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economy has not come back as forecasted and so they
slowed hiring if not stopped hiring but they don&#8217;t want to fire
employees because business is coming back,&#8221; said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Executive Search Ltd., a
New York-based recruitment firm. &#8220;Instead, what they&#8217;re trying
to do is cut costs and do it through payment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank has added 1,719 employees so far
this year, including 94 in the latest three month period,
according to today&#8217;s report. The company employed 236,810 people
at the end of the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Bank Income &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s third-quarter revenue fell 11 percent to $23.8
billion. The investment bank contributed $1.29 billion of the
firm&#8217;s $4.42 billion in net income in the third quarter, down
about 7 percent from the prior quarter and down 33 percent from
the same period a year earlier. The unit produces the largest
profit in the company, 42 percent higher than the second-biggest
division, retail financial services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks set aside revenue throughout the year to
pay employees and typically decide bonuses at the end of the
year. For the first nine months, JPMorgan set aside 39 percent
of the investment-bank&#8217;s revenue to pay employees, compared with
38 percent a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These people will be compensated and compensated well but
it&#8217;s not going to be the amounts it would be if they generated
more revenue,&#8221; Branthover said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home to more foreclosures than 47
U.S. states, Florida sought to clear out its backlog with a
system of special court hearings that dispensed with cases
quickly, sometimes in less than a minute, Bloomberg News&#8217; David
McLaughlin reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowners like Nicole West now threaten to slow that
system, Florida&#8217;s so-called rocket docket, to a crawl. West, who
has been fighting to save her Jensen Beach house from
foreclosure, has leveled a new allegation in her three-year
battle: the entire process is based on fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West said her case is rife with the kind of flawed mortgage
documents that have caused lenders including Bank of America
Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. to stop the process of
foreclosures and evictions across the country. The banks said
they are investigating homeowner charges like West&#8217;s that
signatures were forged and documents were backdated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not right,&#8221; said West, 40, who lives about an
hour&#8217;s drive north of West Palm Beach. &#8220;It&#8217;s like lying to the
judge. It&#8217;s like lying about what&#8217;s really going on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank moratoriums are already thwarting the initiative
by Florida officials to clear jammed court dockets. Now, efforts
by homeowners such as West to bring claims of fraud to the
attention of judges are further prolonging evictions, and in
turn slowing purchases of foreclosed properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, meanwhile, is
investigating four law firms in the state that specialize in
foreclosure cases on behalf of lenders, according to Ryan
Wiggins, his spokeswoman. Yesterday, McCollum said he requested
meetings with firms including Bank of America, JPMorgan and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unit Litton Loan Servicing to &#8220;discuss
ways to promptly and effectively redeem the integrity of the
foreclosure process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCollum accused law firms of &#8220;unfair and deceptive
actions&#8221; and said thousands of foreclosures that had been
approved by judges may have been the result of improper actions
by law firms. He said the firms appear to be &#8220;fabricating
and/or presenting false and misleading documents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 9 million U.S. mortgages that have been or are
being foreclosed may face challenges over the validity of legal
documents, according to a report yesterday by Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v. West, 07-
00311, Florida Circuit Court of the 13th Judicial District in
and for Martin County (Stuart). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Stops Using Law Firm in Foreclosure Inquiry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. said it stopped steering foreclosure work to
a Florida law firm whose court filings to support home seizures
are under investigation by the state&#8217;s attorney general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which is proceeding with seizures as some rivals
stop to recheck documents, had used the Law Offices of David J.
Stern PA. Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum said Aug. 10 it
is examining whether Stern and two other firms filed &#8220;improper
documentation&#8221; with the state&#8217;s courts to speed proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pending the outcome of the AG&#8217;s investigation, Citi is
not referring new matters to this firm,&#8221; the New York-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement. Citigroup services loans for
government-sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac. Stern &#8220;was approved by the GSEs during the time in which
it was retained by Citi,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers, attorneys general and consumer groups have
pressed mortgage firms to follow Bank of America Corp., the
biggest U.S. lender, which last week suspended all foreclosures
to check whether faulty documents were used to confiscate homes.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Ally Financial Inc.&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage
unit froze seizures or evictions in Florida and 22 other states.
Citigroup said last week it doesn&#8217;t plan to join them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCollum&#8217;s office &#8220;hasn&#8217;t made any charges or allegations
of fault,&#8221; said Jeffrey Tew, an outside attorney for
Plantation, Florida-based Stern, who declined to discuss its
work for Citigroup. &#8220;I believe they&#8217;re a client. I can&#8217;t go
into any details.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, said in
an e-mailed statement Oct. 8 that it provides &#8220;strong
training&#8221; for its employees and periodically reviews document-
handling procedures within the company&#8217;s foreclosure group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At this point, we have no reason to believe our employees
haven&#8217;t been following our procedures, so we do not believe a
suspension is necessary,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manatt Law Firm Banned 5 Years From N.Y. Pension Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law firm Manatt Phelps  Phillips LLP agreed to be banned
for five years from appearing before any New York public pension
fund and will pay $550,000 to the state, Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord stems from Manatt&#8217;s representation of financial
firms seeking investments from public pension funds without a
securities license, Cuomo said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manatt, based in Los Angeles, secured meetings on behalf of
firms seeking investments from pension funds in states such as
New York and California. From 2004 to 2006, Manatt and a
California-based lobbyist partner, Platinum Advisors, each
received $187,500 in fees for helping place a $25 million
investment by the California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System
in Levine Leichtman Capital Partners Fund, Cuomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unlicensed agents are untrained, unsupervised and
typically traffic in political and personal connections to get
access to public money,&#8221; Cuomo said in the statement. &#8220;We have
seen all varieties of this risky behavior and now it includes a
prominent national law firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manatt also made or tried to make introductions to pension
funds for New York state and city employees and to the state
teachers retirement system, though no investments resulted from
those efforts and the firm received no compensation, Cuomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is quoted in Cuomo&#8217;s statement saying it is
&#8220;pleased to put this matter behind us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We commend Attorney General Cuomo for investigating the
placement process for pension fund investments and we embrace
his new Reform Code of Conduct,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Sued by Minnesota Bank on Debit Caps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF Financial Corp., a Minnesota bank, sued the Federal
Reserve to block a U.S. law that limits the fees charged to
retailers on debit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the Durbin
Amendment puts the biggest U.S. banks at a competitive
disadvantage as it forces them to provide debit-card services
below cost and exempts smaller banks, the Wayzata-based company
said in a lawsuit filed yesterday in Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law is akin to Congress telling Burger King &#8220;you can
only charge for the hamburger and the bun,&#8221; TCF Chief Executive
Officer William A. Cooper said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;Ignore all the costs of the overhead and the cooks and the
advertising and the interest expense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank claims that the law unconstitutionally takes away
its property in the form of legitimate fees and violates its
constitutional right to equal protection by favoring smaller
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
electronic payment networks, set interchange fees and pass the
money to card-issuing banks. Interchange is the largest
component of the fees U.S. merchants pay when they accept Visa
and MasterCard debit cards. The fees last year totaled $19.7
billion and averaged 1.6 percent of each sale, according to the
Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF &#8220;fundamentally misunderstands&#8221; the law, Durbin, a
Democrat and the senior senator from Illinois, said in a
statement responding to the lawsuit. The law doesn&#8217;t set
interchange rates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our language simply ensures that debit interchange fees
charged to retailers by the card networks -- not the banks --are
&#8216;reasonable and proportional&#8217; to the cost of processing
transactions,&#8221; Durbin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke, 10-cv-04149,
U.S. District Court for South Dakota (Sioux Falls). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genzyme Sued by Investors Over Sanofi Buyout Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genzyme Corp., which spurned Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s $18.5
billion takeover bid, was sued by investors who contend the
biotechnology company is wrongfully depriving shareholders of
the chance to profit from the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Genzyme shareholders sued the company&#8217;s board in
federal court in Boston seeking to have a judge order the
largest maker of medicines for rare genetic diseases to consider
Sanofi&#8217;s $69-a-share bid. Genzyme officials have repeatedly
rejected Sanofi&#8217;s overtures and urged shareholders to reject the
French drugmaker&#8217;s tender offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By failing to pursue the offers, Genzyme directors are
denying investors the right &#8220;to receive maximum value for their
shares,&#8221; lawyers for Genzyme shareholder Bernard Malina said in
a lawsuit filed last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Genzyme contend
executives of Paris-based Sanofi have indicated they would pay
as much as $80 a share for the biotech company, according to a
U.S. regulatory filing Oct. 11. Jean-Marc Podvin, a Sanofi
spokesman, disputed that assertion, saying the drugmaker hadn&#8217;t
offered a price range for its bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genzyme spokesman Bo Piela declined to comment on the suits
in a telephone interview yesterday. Company officials have urged
investors not to act on Sanofi&#8217;s offer until after it reviews
the proposal with financial and legal advisers. Genzyme said in
an Oct. 4 statement it would make its recommendation within 10
business days in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Field v. Termeer, 10-CV-11565, and Malina v.
Genzyme Corp., 10-CV-11532, both U.S. District Court for the
District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BankAtlantic Ignored Guidelines, Misled Investors, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BankAtlantic Bancorp Inc. officials ignored lending
guidelines in approving land-development loans and then misled
investors about the strength of those loans, a lawyer for
shareholders said at the start of a trial of their securities-
fraud lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s executives hid losses on the loans to inflate
the bank&#8217;s stock price, misleading investors in conference calls
and in press releases, the attorney, Mark Arisohn, told jurors
yesterday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The picture they painted was that the bank&#8217;s lending
business was less risky than it really was,&#8221; Arisohn said in
his opening statement. BankAtlantic investors &#8220;paid too much
because they didn&#8217;t know the truth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BankAtlantic, based in Fort Lauderdale, contends that it
properly disclosed problems with the loans. Company officials
&#8220;gave plenty of warning&#8221; that Florida real-estate loans had
grown risky by 2007, Eugene Stearns, the bank&#8217;s attorney, said
in his opening statement. The investors sued that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Alan Levan told investors the
bank&#8217;s loan portfolio was solid, while at the same time worrying
in an internal e-mail about &#8220;a parade of land loans coming in
for extensions,&#8221; Arisohn told jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re BankAtlantic Bancorp Inc. Securities
Litigation, 07-cv-61542, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBS Wins Lawsuit Against Liverpool Owners Over Board &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc won an order from a London
court reversing changes to Liverpool soccer club&#8217;s board,
possibly clearing the way for a planned sale to a group that
controls the Boston Red Sox baseball team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett had sought to halt the
sale of Britain&#8217;s most successful team, saying the 300 million-
pound ($476 million) bid from New England Sports Ventures LLC is
too low. RBS says the Americans breached their contract with the
bank when they tried to replace board members who are in favor
of the sale and asked the court to step in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liverpool said it was consulting with attorneys, and
planned a board meeting for later today. Gillett and Hicks tried
to force through board changes to block the sale to the group
led by Red Sox owner John W. Henry. Justice Christopher Floyd
today ruled for RBS, dismissed the owners&#8217; countersuit and
denied them an appeal, although they can go to a higher court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v. Hicks,
HC10C03206, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP, Investors Get First Deadline in Spill Share Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for BP Plc and investors suing over billions of
dollars in market losses tied to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill
must submit lawsuit leadership proposals by Oct. 27, a judge
overseeing the suits said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We should start with ideas about how to select the lead
plaintiff and class counsel,&#8221; said U.S. District Judge Keith P.
Ellison yesterday, at the first hearing over investor suits
combined in his court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits by investors in U.S. shares of BP allege the
company misrepresented the risks of its offshore drilling
programs, artificially inflating the value of its American
depositary receipts. The suits, brought by shareholders against
BP for their own losses or derivatively on behalf of the
company, claim BP&#8217;s directors and senior managers are
responsible for as much as $50 billion in lost stock value after
the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP&#8217;s procedures for minimizing its financial losses from
drilling rig problems were no more than fantasies,&#8221; Stanley M.
Chesley, an attorney for one of the investor cases consolidated
in Houston federal court, said in a court filing. &#8220;BP was
simply not the enterprise that its public communications
pictured.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor lawsuits were combined before Ellison in
August in a multidistrict litigation, or MDL, for evidence-
gathering and pretrial decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP is facing more than 400 lawsuits over the largest
offshore oil spill in U.S. history, set off by the April 20
explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re BP Plc Securities Litigation, MDL 2185,
U.S. District Courts, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drill Ban Over, U.S. Tells Judge Weighing Challenge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has lifted its moratorium on deep-water offshore
oil drilling, Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar told the New
Orleans judge weighing a challenge to the ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators imposed the moratorium on drilling in
waters deeper than 500 feet on July 12, to replace an earlier
ban struck down by U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New
Orleans. Feldman reversed the earlier ban, imposed after the BP
Plc oil spill, as too broad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore-service companies challenged the second moratorium
as well, in a lawsuit pending before Feldman. The U.S. earlier
asked Feldman to reject this lawsuit, calling the ban a matter
of public policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is ending &#8220;the suspension on all deep-water
drilling effective immediately,&#8221; Salazar said in a filing
yesterday in Feldman&#8217;s court. &#8220;This new decision memorandum may
be relevant to the court&#8217;s consideration&#8221; of the U.S. request
to dismiss the lawsuit, lawyers for Salazar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-1941,
Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICAP Stifling Rivals by Blocking Broker Moves, Tradition Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICAP Plc is trying to &#8220;stifle healthy competition&#8221; by
seeking to prevent the Singapore unit of Compagnie Financiere
Tradition SA from recruiting 38 of its brokers, the Swiss
company said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no trade secrets in inter-dealer broking where
prices change constantly and clients are shared by all, Stephen
Miles, the managing director of Tradition&#8217;s Singapore
operations, said in a filing yesterday asking the Singapore High
Court to lift its temporary order preventing the hiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICAP, the world&#8217;s largest broker of trades between banks,
last month won the order stopping the Singapore-based employees
from joining Tradition until the dispute is resolved, arguing
that the workers had access to confidential data including
client lists, trading strategies and brokers&#8217; pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, didn&#8217;t induce
the employees to breach their contracts with ICAP, Miles said in
his filing. Their departure was predicated on &#8220;push&#8221; factors,
he said, including a move into electronic trading that would
have resulted in job cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The individuals have a right to work and should not be
deprived of this fundamental right,&#8221; Miles said of the brokers
who have been prevented from joining Tradition, the world&#8217;s
third-largest inter-dealer broker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles noted that ICAP said in its Sept. 30 trading
statement that it didn&#8217;t view the impact of the potential
Singapore defections as being material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This lawsuit is simply about protecting our commercial
interests through enforcing the terms of employment contracts
that both we and our employees have agreed,&#8221; Mike Sheard, a
London-based ICAP spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is ICAP AP (Singapore) Pte. vs. M. Divakaran  Ors
S724/2010 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Rejected by U.S. Supreme Court on Menopause Drug Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Pfizer Inc.
and other makers of hormone-replacement treatments, leaving
intact a ruling that lets 123 women who developed breast cancer
sue in Minnesota state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal sought to reinstate a federal trial court ruling
that dismissed 116 of the plaintiffs because their claims
duplicated previously filed suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue in the Supreme Court appeal turned on the complex
rules governing efforts by corporate defendants to move suits
out of plaintiff-friendly state courts and into federal
tribunals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Pfizer case, a federal appeals court said the trial
judge shouldn&#8217;t have dismissed the 116 plaintiffs and instead
should have immediately sent the entire matter back to Minnesota
state court, where the suits were filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took menopause drugs made by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit to treat symptoms including hot flashes and
mood swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to
cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other companies being sued include units of Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Mead Johnson Nutrition Co.,
Novartis AG, Abbott Laboratories and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wyeth v. Kirkland, 10-222, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT Must Lower Access Fees Charged to Competitors, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT Group Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest phone company, must lower
the fees it charges competitors to access the company&#8217;s phone
and broadband lines because of errors by a regulator, an appeals
court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price caps put in place in May 2009 by telecommunications
regulator Ofcom were too high due to the watchdog&#8217;s errors in
calculating inflation and efficiency, the Competition Appeal
Tribunal ruled Oct. 11 in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ofcom should adopt new price controls &#8220;as soon as
possible,&#8221; a three-judge panel of the tribunal said in the
ruling. &#8220;Once the price controls are adopted, BT will be bound
to comply with their terms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling follows a finding by Britain&#8217;s antitrust
regulator, the Competition Commission, in support of some claims
in the appeal by TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc and British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc. BT said last year that the price cap was
already too low to allow the company to recover costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ofcom spokeswoman Elizabeth de Winton said the Competition
Commission had &#8220;overwhelmingly endorsed&#8221; its approach to price
controls, and that the changes will result in an adjustment of
about 4 million pounds ($6.32 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT spokeswoman Gemma Thomas said Ofcom&#8217;s errors were
&#8220;relatively small&#8221; compared with what TalkTalk argued in
court. The prices apply to BT&#8217;s Openreach unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Only minor price changes should be made,&#8221; Thomas said
yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change policy is likely to
be driven by regional responses before an international
agreement is put in place, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Instead of the top-down Kyoto coming down, we&#8217;re going to
see it come up,&#8221; Odin Knudsen, the managing director of
environmental markets at the New York-based bank and a former
head of the World Bank Carbon Fund, said at a conference in
Melbourne today. &#8220;We&#8217;ll break down to regional, and at some
point later on, we may see an international, legally binding
agreement. In the interim, we&#8217;ll have something like the
Copenhagen accord, which will be the political commitment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Copenhagen climate conference in December, delegates
were planning to finish a two-year effort to replace the 1997
Kyoto Protocol, which limits emissions through 2012. Instead,
they clashed over aid to developing countries, pollution-
reduction goals and how to verify individual pledges. No binding
treaty was adopted. The next round of international talks is
scheduled to start at the end of November in Cancun, Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia in April shelved climate change laws until after
2012 amid lawmaker opposition and a lack of action by other
countries. Prime Minister Julia Gillard has established a
multiparty committee to study options for introducing a price on
carbon. New Zealand started an emissions trading system in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We really want to see Australia come into the game
because we think there&#8217;s some interesting regional dynamics that
can take place,&#8221; Nigel Brunel, head of futures and equities at
Auckland-based OMFinancial Ltd., said at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domino Affect &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A climate change accord with three to four countries should
be the focus, rather than trying to get 140 countries to agree
on a binding treaty, Aldersgate Group Chairman Peter Young said
in an address yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based company is a coalition of businesses,
organizations and individuals including United Utilities Group
Plc and the Renewable Energy Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are only four countries, or regions that matter in
the developed world,&#8221; Guy Turner, director of carbon markets
for Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London, said today.
&#8220;Europe, U.S., Australia and Japan. If Australia follows after
Europe, I guarantee that Japan will take it a lot more seriously
and then you only have one domino left, and that&#8217;s the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s multiparty climate change committee has all
options on the table about pricing carbon, Gillard told the
Queensland Media Club in Brisbane yesterday. The committee will
meet until the end of 2011, and will then consider how much
progress has been made before making policy proposals, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s Greens party want a carbon price imposed
quickly and won&#8217;t automatically back policy proposed by the
Prime Minister, lawmaker Adam Bandt said at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gillard needs to retain the support of Bandt and three
independent lawmakers after wooing them to form a government
after the country&#8217;s deadlocked August election. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc., which spurned an
acquisition bid from Microsoft Corp. in 2008, is working with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help defend against possible
takeover approaches, said three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Sunnyvale, California-based company hasn&#8217;t
received an offer, Yahoo has been working with advisers for
about two weeks to field any approach, said the people, who
asked not to be named because the talks are private. AOL Inc.
has talked with private-equity funds including Silver Lake about
a possible bid, two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo climbed 4.5 percent today after paring earlier gains
of as much as 9.9 percent. The company had lost half its value
since Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, withdrew an
almost $50 billion bid in 2008, and sales haven&#8217;t grown under
Chief Executive Officer Carol Bartz, leaving Yahoo vulnerable to
fresh overtures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The shareholders own this company and the shareholders
have lost a lot of value because of the actions of the directors
and the management of this company,&#8221; said Lawrence Haverty, a
portfolio manager at Gamco Investors Inc., which holds Yahoo
shares. &#8220;Something&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions between AOL and private-equity firms are
preliminary and have recently focused on a possible purchase of
parts of Yahoo, two people said. The private-equity funds have
weighed raising $10 billion to $12 billion, these people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-

debt as the lender bypasses concern over home foreclosure
practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company issued $2.75 billion of 4.25 percent, 10-year
notes that yield 180 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, and $1.25 billion of 5.5 percent, 30-year bonds at a
spread of 165 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold the debt after attorneys general from all 50
states said yesterday they have opened an investigation into
whether lenders and mortgage companies falsified documents in
foreclosure proceedings. JPMorgan said it was adding $1 billion
to reserves set aside for repurchasing mortgages and also
expanded a review of foreclosures to about 115,000 files in 41
states from at least 56,000 loans in 23 states on Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was at least an estimate for the liability that
people could chew on and deal with when they announced the
reserves they took for the problem,&#8221; said Lon Erickson, who
helps oversee $9 billion of fixed-income assets, including
JPMorgan bonds, at Thornburg Investment Management. &#8220;It makes
the market feel better when there&#8217;s a black-and-white number to
start with as a base and they can adjust up or down from
there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors &#8216;Comforted&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimates &#8220;comforted&#8221; investors, said Erickson, a
managing director at the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the review will
cost more money, though expenses will probably be
&#8220;incremental.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spreads on JPMorgan&#8217;s debt compare with 222 basis
points on the average bank bond, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Corporates, Banks index. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s last benchmark sale in dollars was Sept. 27,
when it issued $1.15 billion of three-year fixed- and floating-
rate debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service assigns JPMorgan a grade of Aa3 and Standard 
Poor&#8217;s ranks it A+, one step lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. is the largest U.S. bank by assets,
according to data compiled by the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NII (NIHD) Holdings Inc. dropped the most
in 18 months on the Nasdaq after a newspaper columnist said
broadcaster Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) is backing out of an agreement to
buy a stake in the wireless company&#8217;s Mexican unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is choosing to focus on its television business
and will announce its decision soon, Alberto Aguilar said today
in El Universal, without citing sources. A Televisa official who
asked to not be named because of company policy declined to
comment to Bloomberg News. Claudia Restrepo, a spokeswoman for
NII, didn&#8217;t return phone messages left by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster,
agreed in February to buy a 30 percent stake in NII&#8217;s Mexican
division for $1.44 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backing out from the deal would leave Televisa&#8217;s three
cable-TV companies without a mobile-phone partner as it seeks to
compete with billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s wireless and fixed-line
companies for Mexican phone and Internet users. NII, Mexico&#8217;s
smallest wireless carrier, would lose a source of funding for
expansion plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII, based in Reston, Virginia, fell $5.27, or 12 percent,
to $37.76 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading, the biggest decline since April 2009. Televisa gained
33 centavos to 55.44 pesos in Mexico City trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s Telefonos de Mexico SAB is Mexico&#8217;s largest landline
phone and Internet provider, and his America Movil SAB (AMXL) is the
nation&#8217;s biggest mobile-phone carrier. Televisa&#8217;s cable carriers
offer packages of TV, phone and Internet, and the company had
sought to add wireless plans to that mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nextel Brand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Televisa, NII, which operates under the Nextel
brand in Latin America, still would retain the licenses to the
airwaves it won in an auction that ended in July. The company
aims to use so-called third-generation services to lure Mexican
users from larger rivals America Movil, Telefonica SA (TEF) and Grupo
Iusacell SA, which already have such high-speed data networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The immediate horizon that was mapped out for the
nation&#8217;s telephone industry will be changed, since Nextel&#8217;s
entry, without its ally, will become more complicated,&#8221; Aguilar
wrote. The columnist was the first to report in February that
Televisa was seeking to buy the NII unit stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII still has $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents and
would have the borrowing capacity to fund the 3G network without
Televisa, said Gray Powell, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co. in
New York. He advises buying the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Mexican press has not been a reliable source of
information on this process throughout the last few months,&#8221;
Powell said today in a note to clients. &#8220;We do not see a firm
reason for the deal to not go through.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell, based in Mexico City, has filed suits in about 70
Mexican courts challenging the auction results, claiming that
the government sold NII its airwaves at an unfair price. The
government&#8217;s Communications and Transportation Ministry said
this month that it set rules to encourage competition, resulting
in NII getting airwaves at a lower price than its larger rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elizabeth Stanton and Tara Lachapelle" date="Oct 14, 2010  4:28 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-14/u-s-stock-index-futures-advance-yahoo-chevron-climb-as-apollo-tumbles.html"><headline>U.S. Stocks Retreat as Banks Tumble on Foreclosure Concerns</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks declined, dragging
benchmark indexes down from five-month highs, as financial
companies slumped amid concern over growing legal scrutiny of
home foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo  Co.
slid more than 4 percent to lead financial stocks in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to a 1.8 percent drop, the biggest
among 10 industry groups. Apollo Group Inc. sparked a plunge in
education stocks after withdrawing its forecast for fiscal 2011.
Yahoo! Inc. gained 4.5 percent and EMC Corp. rose 4.5 percent on
reports they may be takeover targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.4 percent to 1,173.81 at 4 p.m. in New
York, paring its rebound from this year&#8217;s low on July 2 to 15
percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.51 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 11,094.57. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are afraid of how much mortgage debt could
actually come back onto banks&#8217; balance sheets,&#8221; said Anton Schutz, who manages $250 million of financial stocks at Mendon
Capital Advisors Corp. in Rochester. &#8220;People are really
questioning the way these banks underwrote mortgages, their
entire process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks extended losses and the SP&#8217;s 500 Financials Index
fell the most in two months as home seizures reached a record in
September. Lenders took over 102,134 properties last month,
RealtyTrac Inc. said in a report today, the highest since the
company began tracking the data in 2005. Foreclosure filings,
including default and auction notices, rose 3 percent from the
prior month. One out of every 371 households received a notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Attorneys General said
yesterday it will conduct a coordinated inquiry among all 50
states into whether banks and loan servicers used false
documents and signatures to justify hundreds of thousands of
foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender, fell 5.2 percent
to $12.60 for the biggest drop in the Dow average. Wells Fargo,
the top U.S. home lender, retreated 4.2 percent to $24.72.
Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank, declined 4.5
percent to $4.06. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose for a fourth day yesterday, buoyed by
indications the Federal Reserve may announce plans to resume
buying Treasury securities next month to bolster the recovery
and better-than-estimated third-quarter earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Apollo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, fell 2.8 percent to $38.72. The bank set aside $1.3
billion of additional litigation reserves during the third
quarter, including expenses for mortgage-related matters, and
may have to pay penalties in the foreclosure investigation, its
chief executive officer said yesterday. JPMorgan&#8217;s reserves
&#8220;set off a &#8216;how much do other banks have to set aside?&#8217;
scramble,&#8221; Schutz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond insurers MBIA Inc. and Ambac Financial Group Inc., and
mortgage-insurance companies including Radian Group Inc., PMI
Group Inc. and MTG Investment Corp. all advanced. The
Association of Financial Guaranty Insurers said in a letter last
month to Bank of America that it should repurchase as much as
$20 billion in home loans that were based on wrong or missing
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any questions about fraud at the originators could lead
to a higher level of claim denials&#8221; by the mortgage insurers,
Douglas Harter, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York,
said in an e-mailed response to a question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block Inc. slid 10 percent to $12.31, the third-biggest
drop in the SP 500. The biggest U.S. tax preparer originated
mortgages through January 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo Group, the biggest education company by enrollment,
plunged 23 percent to $38 for the biggest drop in the SP 500.
The operator of the University of Phoenix withdrew its 2011
forecast citing regulatory scrutiny and a possible 40 percent
decline in new students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education companies were the six-biggest decliners in the
Russell l000 Index. Education Management Corp., DeVry Inc.,
Career Education Corp., ITT Educational Services Inc. and
Strayer Education Inc. each fell at least 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of storage computers, added
4.5 percent to $21.21 for the biggest gain in the SP 500. The
London-based Evening Standard reported that Oracle Corp., which
has said it&#8217;s in the market for semiconductor companies and
makers of industry-specific software, might pay $40 a share for
EMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! rose 4.5 percent to $15.93. The owner of the second-
most popular U.S. Internet search engine is working with Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to help defend against possible takeover
approaches, according to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cheap Valuations&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You continue to see technology MA activity,&#8221; said Wayne Wilbanks, chief investment officer of Wilbanks Smith  Thomas in
Norfolk, Virginia. &#8220;Cheap valuations combined with easy money
from the Fed and private equity gives you incredibly strong
underpinnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc. led telecommunications
companies to the only gain among the SP 500&#8217;s 10 industry
groups. Verizon Wireless, co-owned by Verizon Communications and
Vodafone Group Plc, will begin competing with ATT Inc. in
selling Web access for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad tablet computer on Oct.
28. Verizon rose 0.7 percent to $32.44. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unexpected increase in the Labor Department&#8217;s weekly
tally of new claims for jobless benefits reinforced expectations
that unemployment above 9 percent will draw a monetary policy
response from the Fed. Initial unemployment claims rose by
13,000 to 462,000 in the week ended Oct. 9, helping spark a drop
in the dollar, which fell to a 15-year low against the yen and
reached its weakest versus the euro since January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is more infatuated with these weekly and
monthly numbers than ever before,&#8221; said Larry Peruzzi, senior
equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets Inc. in Boston. &#8220;The
bulk of the move is coming from these numbers and what you&#8217;re
able to infer from that about whether there&#8217;s going to be
continued easing from the Fed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top legal officers of all 50 states
opened a joint investigation into home foreclosures, saying they
will probe practices at banks and mortgage companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states will conduct a coordinated inquiry into whether
banks and loan servicers used false documents and signatures to
justify hundreds of thousands of foreclosures, Minnesota
Attorney General Lori Swanson said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our multistate group has begun inquiring whether or not
individual mortgage servicers have improperly submitted
affidavits or other documents in support of foreclosures,&#8221; the
attorneys said in a statement. &#8220;The facts uncovered in our
review will dictate the scope of our inquiry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Attorneys General announced
yesterday that 49 states would be participating with Alabama the
holdout. Alabama will now join the probe, even though &#8220;no
violations of Alabama law have been alleged at this time,&#8221;
Attorney General Troy King said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials in at least 10 states including Florida and Ohio
previously announced separate probes into questionable
foreclosure tactics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to cooperating with the attorneys
general,&#8221; Tom Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan
Chase, said yesterday in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will meet with the attorneys general to discuss the
concerns they have expressed,&#8221; Rick Simon, a spokesman for
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, said. &#8220;On
Friday Bank of America announced we will stop foreclosure sales
across all 50 states while we complete our review. We believe
this demonstrates appropriate concern and a responsible
approach.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally, said &#8220;GMAC Mortgage is
committed to restoring confidence in the foreclosure process and
has been working expeditiously on the review and remediation
activities for the affected cases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where we have received official inquiries from individual
states, we are responding accordingly,&#8221; Proia said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon Calls Foreclosure Costs &#8216;Incremental,&#8217; Mistakes Unlikely &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. probably will pay an &#8220;incremental&#8221;
sum to settle foreclosure investigations and there is almost
&#8220;no chance&#8221; the bank made mistakes in seizing homes, Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will cost us some money to go back and make sure it&#8217;s
done right; it will delay some foreclosures,&#8221; Dimon told
reporters on a conference call yesterday after posting quarterly
results. &#8220;But the whole mortgage issue costs us so much money
now, to me it will be incremental.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender is in talks with state attorneys general and
will correct any errors tied to foreclosures, Dimon said. About
115,000 files are under review, according to the bank&#8217;s website.
It&#8217;s unlikely the New York-based firm made mistakes as it seized
homes from borrowers who couldn&#8217;t pay, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State law enforcement officials, consumer groups and
lawmakers have pressed mortgage firms to follow Bank of America
Corp., the biggest U.S. lender, which last week curtailed
foreclosures nationwide to check whether faulty documents were
used to confiscate homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Inc.&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage unit is also curbing
evictions in all 50 states so the lender can review procedures
and court affidavits. Litton Loan Servicing LP, a mortgage-
servicing business owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said Oct.
8 it&#8217;s halting some foreclosures to review how they&#8217;re handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve delayed the foreclosure process in almost all of
the states to make sure that we&#8217;ve got all of these affidavits
done right, and it&#8217;s going to take a lot of manpower and a
couple of weeks to do it,&#8221; said Dimon, 54. &#8220;At the end of the
day, the underlying substance was accurate. There&#8217;s almost no
chance that we&#8217;ve made a mistake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Sued for Bias by Women Over Pay, Promotions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by deposits,
was sued for gender discrimination by current and former
employees who claim women are paid less than men and are more
likely to lose their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan,
was brought by five former directors and analysts of the New
York-based bank and by one current employee. It seeks class-
action, or group, status on behalf of women at job levels from
analyst to managing director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accuse Citigroup of being an &#8220;outdated boys
club&#8221; and allege &#8220;systematic and pervasive discrimination and
retaliation&#8221; in decisions involving compensation, promotion and
termination. They seek unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said yesterday in an e-mailed statement that the
five former employees were among 70 men and women in the public
finance department who lost their jobs as part of a workforce
reduction in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were selected based on legitimate business reasons,
not based on their gender, and were selected in the very late
rounds of the reduction in force,&#8221; Citigroup said. &#8220;Many of
their allegations are either totally inaccurate or selectively
incomplete.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bartoletti v. Citigroup, 10-cv-7720, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale Sued in Singapore for Currency Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Societe Generale SA Singapore private bankers, making
wrong bets on currency values, almost wiped out a client&#8217;s $10
million account and for years attempted to hide the losses, the
investor claims in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan Leong Cheng, a resident of Perth, Western Australia,
yesterday sued Societe Generale&#8217;s Singapore private bank and the
two executives in Singapore&#8217;s High Court in a bid to recover $8
million of the losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants&#8217; management of the assets in the account
created massive losses,&#8221; Chan said in court papers. The bankers
&#8220;made fraudulent representations to the plaintiff for a long
period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale, France&#8217;s second-biggest bank, suspended
Jenny Liew Marn Leng, an executive director, and her direct
supervisor Lilian Ang, after the losses were discovered, Chan
said in the court papers. Both bankers had assured Chan for
several years the balance in the account was about $8 million
and provided statements reflecting that, even though the account
had been almost depleted, Chan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa Lee, a Singapore-based spokeswoman at Societe
Generale, couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ang intends to defend the claim &#8220;vigorously&#8221; and will
make a counterclaim against Chan, her lawyer Manjit Singh said
yesterday. Liew wasn&#8217;t immediately available to respond, Singh,
whose firm is also representing her, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chan Leong Cheng vs. Societe Generale Bank 
Trust Singapore Branch, Liew Marn Leng Jenny and Lilian Ang,
S780/2010 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Tells U.S. Judge Tourre Lawsuit Should Proceed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told a judge
that its lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Fabrice
Tourre should proceed because the complaint claims that an
unlawful transaction took place in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre last month asked a federal judge in Manhattan to
dismiss the lawsuit over a Goldman Sachs deal involving
collateralized debt obligations because the transaction wasn&#8217;t
in the U.S. He said the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that
U.S. securities laws don&#8217;t apply to claims of foreign buyers of
non-U.S. securities on foreign exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency argues in a court filing yesterday that Tourre,
an executive director in the bank&#8217;s London office, worked in New
York, did business on the deal from New York, and took other
steps that give the U.S. court jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in New York, Goldman Sachs and Tourre &#8220;attempted to
dispose of, offered to dispose of, and solicited offers to buy
securities and enter securities-based swap agreements,&#8221; the
agency wrote in its 20-page legal brief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs executive sued individually,
remains a defendant in the case after the firm agreed to a $550
million settlement in July. In its complaint, the SEC alleged
that Goldman Sachs and Tourre misled investors in CDOs linked to
subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Claimant Asks Judge to Send Case Back to State Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The western New York man who claims a 2003 contract with
Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg entitles him to 84 percent
of the company asked a federal judge to send the case back to
state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Paul Ceglia argued yesterday that the lawsuit
against Facebook and Zuckerberg, 26, the company&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer, should be returned to the court in
Belmont, New York, where Ceglia filed it in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal court lacks jurisdiction to hear the suit,
James Grable Jr. argued, because Zuckerberg&#8217;s legal domicile is
his parents&#8217; Dobbs Ferry, New York, home, not in Palo Alto,
California, as he claims. U.S. law permits federal courts to
hear cases between citizens of different states in which more
than $75,000 is at issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s got one foot in New York and one foot in
California,&#8221; Grable told U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara at
a hearing in Buffalo, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg claims he started Facebook, the world&#8217;s biggest
social-networking site, in 2004 as a Harvard University
sophomore. He couldn&#8217;t have signed away rights to a site he
hadn&#8217;t yet conceived of, defense lawyers said. They said in
court papers that Ceglia&#8217;s claim is &#8220;preposterous on its
face.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg and Facebook said Ceglia&#8217;s request for more
information about Zuckerberg&#8217;s domicile &#8220;is intended solely to
burden and harass&#8221; them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg submitted documents to the court that he claims
prove he is now a permanent resident of California. These
include copies of his California driver&#8217;s license, car
registration, state tax returns, bills and voter registration.
He said his domicile is a rented home in Palo Alto, 10 minutes&#8217;
walk from Facebook&#8217;s headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford Loses Bid for Lloyd&#8217;s Insurance Proceeds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicted financier R. Allen Stanford can&#8217;t use $100 million
in Lloyd&#8217;s of London directors and officers insurance coverage
to pay lawyers to defend him against criminal charges he ran a
$7 billion investment-fraud scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Nancy Atlas in Houston ruled that
Lloyd&#8217;s lawyers, during a four-day August trial, proved it was
more likely than not that Stanford &#8220;knowingly committed acts of
money laundering,&#8221; involving the use of corporate funds that
should have been disclosed to investors and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court does not reach the issue of whether the
evidence supports a finding that Stanford personally engaged in
criminal conduct,&#8221; Atlas said yesterday in her 45-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford and three former top executives at Houston-based
Stanford Financial Group were indicted in June 2009 for
allegedly swindling investors who bought certificates of deposit
issued by Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives, who deny any wrongdoing, have claimed that
without the Lloyd&#8217;s proceeds, they can&#8217;t afford to pay defense
attorneys because their assets were frozen earlier by court
order when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued them
in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd&#8217;s underwriters, after initially agreeing to honor the
policies, denied coverage after former Stanford Group Chief
Financial Officer James M. Davis pleaded guilty last year to
mail fraud, obstructing the SEC proceeding and conspiracy to
commit securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s criminal trial is scheduled to start on Jan. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurance case is Laura Pendergest-Holt v. Certain
Underwriters at Lloyd&#8217;s of London, 4:09-cv-03712, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-00298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual Investors Win Class-Action Status &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors suing Washington Mutual Inc., the former owner of
the biggest U.S. bank to fail, won certification as a class-
action, or group, case of their suit alleging shoddy lending
practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders who lost money on stock purchased from October
2005 to July 2008 can proceed with claims under a single
lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman in Seattle ruled
yesterday, according to court documents. The judge appointed the
New York-based law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann
LLP to lead the plaintiffs&#8217; case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit consolidates more than 20 cases filed against
Washington Mutual that claim the bank secretly lowered lending
standards, artificially inflated home-price appraisals and
failed to disclose its deteriorating financial condition when
the loans began to fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Wolfe, an attorney representing Washington Mutual
defendants, didn&#8217;t immediately return a voicemail message
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The named plaintiffs in the case include Ontario Teachers&#8217;
Pension Plan Board, the largest single-profession pension plan
in Canada, and four other pension groups, according to court
documents. They seek to represent tens of thousands of
shareholders who lost money on three types of preferred stock
purchased between October 2005 and July 2008 and certain
securities offered by the bank in 2006 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Washington Mutual Inc. Securities,
Derivative  ERISA Litigation, 2:08-md-01919, U.S. District
Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Says Drill Ban Suit Irrelevant, Seeks Dismissal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar&#8217;s lawyers asked a
federal judge in New Orleans to throw out most of an oil
industry lawsuit challenging the legality of a deep-water
drilling moratorium that the government has lifted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators imposed the moratorium on drilling in
waters deeper than 500 feet on July 12, to replace an earlier
ban struck down by U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New
Orleans. Feldman threw out the first ban, imposed after the BP
Plc oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, as too broad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore service companies challenged the second moratorium
as well, in a lawsuit pending before Feldman, claiming Salazar
had broken federal statutes in imposing a ban that was harming
the Gulf Coast&#8217;s economy. The U.S. earlier asked Feldman to
reject this lawsuit, calling the ban a matter of public policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salazar terminated the deep-water moratorium Oct. 12, six
weeks before it was set to expire, saying the industry was
meeting milestones for improvements in drilling safety. He said
vital oil-spill response capabilities had also become available
since BP&#8217;s blown-out well was permanently sealed in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-01941,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer Contaminated U.S. Farmers&#8217; Rice Crops, Jury Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bayer AG unit carelessly contaminated U.S. long-grain
rice fields with its genetically engineered seed four years ago,
causing Texas growers to lose access to European markets, a
lawyer told a St. Louis jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bayer brought its experimental rice to this country from
Belgium, even though it was not approved for human consumption
here,&#8221; attorney Don M. Downing said in his opening statements
in the trial. &#8220;Bayer was not careful. It escaped. And the
farmers were hurt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downing represents the owners of three Texas rice-growing
operations. The trial is the seventh against the German company
and its Bayer CropScience unit over crop contamination in the
southern U.S. Bayer lost the first six trials, for a total of
about $54 million in jury awards with one case accounting for 89
percent of the total. The company is challenging the verdicts in
appeals and post-trial motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers in five states claim Bayer negligently contaminated
the U.S. long-grain rice crop with its genetically modified
LibertyLink seed, leading to export restrictions, bans on two
kinds of high-yield seeds and a plunge in prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company faces claims in state and federal courts from
more than 6,000 farmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas farmers are seeking damages of about $400,000,
plus unspecified punitive damages . A jury of six men and three
women was chosen yesterday to hear the case before U.S. District
Judge Catherine Perry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer, based in Leverkusen, Germany, denies negligence and
disputes the damages claims, contending that rice sales
rebounded after an initial drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no question that it had some impact on the rice
market, prices did go down,&#8221; Mark Ferguson, the company&#8217;s trial
attorney, said in his opening statement. &#8220;But we will find that
the losses were minimal and short-lived.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Genetically Modified Rice Litigation, 06-
md-1811, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri (St.
Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAA Court Loss Will Force Sale of Stansted, One Other Airport &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAA Ltd., the owner of London&#8217;s Heathrow airport, was
ordered to sell two U.K. airports after an appeals court
rejected its claim of regulatory bias during a probe of the
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal reinstated the Competition Commission&#8217;s
March 2009 decision forcing BAA to sell Stansted near London and
either the Glasgow or Edinburgh airports. BAA, owned by Madrid-
based Ferrovial SA, already sold London Gatwick under pressure
from the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ruling should put an end to the back-and-forth over
the ownership of the key U.K. airports, bring certainty to the
market and inject some much needed competition into the
sector,&#8221; said Frances Murphy, a lawyer who leads the antitrust
practice at Jones Day LLP in London and isn&#8217;t involved in the
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAA, which was originally ordered to sell the airports by
spring 2011, had initial success in fighting the forced sales,
when an appeals tribunal in December 2009 accepted its argument
that an adviser for the regulator didn&#8217;t remove himself soon
enough in the investigation when a conflict of interest arose.
Yesterday&#8217;s judgment overturned that finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAA argued that the adviser, Peter Moizer, had caused
&#8220;unconscious bias&#8221; at an early stage in the probe because he
was linked to a group that considered buying some of BAA&#8217;s
assets. The court yesterday held that the potential for bias
arose much later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court &#8220;was wrong to find apparent bias&#8221; before
a critical stage of the antitrust review in December 2008, about
three months before the regulator&#8217;s investigation ended, Judge
Maurice Kay of the London-based court said in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAA said in a statement it will seek permission to appeal
the case to the Supreme Court because yesterday&#8217;s ruling
confirmed there was possible bias during part of the
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition Commission spokesman Rory Taylor said the
regulator was &#8220;pleased&#8221; with the court ruling and that the
agency had already taken steps to avoid future potential
conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Norwegian Day Traders Are Convicted of Market Manipulation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Norwegian day traders were ordered to pay as much as
243,000 kroner ($41,700) after being convicted of market
manipulation by an Oslo court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peder Veiby must pay as much as 243,000 kroner ($41,700),
while Svend Egil Larsen must pay a penalty that can&#8217;t exceed
156,442 kroner, according to court documents. Veiby participated
in 42 instances of market abuse and Larsen 30 between November
2007 and April 2008, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to appeal this,&#8221; Veiby&#8217;s lawyer, Anders
Brosveet, said in a phone interview. &#8220;We will appeal within the
14-day time limit, and then there will be an appeal procedure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larsen&#8217;s lawyer, Halldor Christen Tjoflaat, said his
client will also appeal. &#8220;It&#8217;s very hard for us to understand
the judgment,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both men also received suspended jail sentences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Charged With Murder of Malaysian Millionaire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysian authorities charged a lawyer and three other
people with the murders of missing cosmetics millionaire
Sosilawati Lawiya and three associates, according to a lawyer
for one of the defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyer N. Pathmanabhan, 41, and three others were charged
yesterday in a magistrate&#8217;s court in Banting, Selangor, with the
murders of 47-year-old Sosilawati and three others, Ravi Nekoo,
Pathmanabhan&#8217;s lawyer, said by telephone. The defendants didn&#8217;t
enter a plea as this was a preliminary stage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to wait for the prosecution to inform the
magistrate&#8217;s court whether all the documents are ready, and if
all the documents are ready the matter will then be transferred
to the High Court,&#8221; said Nekoo. The defendants would decide
their next course of action once the case is transferred to the
High Court, he said, adding a hearing is scheduled for Dec. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sosilawati, her attorney, her driver, and a bank officer
disappeared Aug. 30 after telling family and friends that they
were going to Banting to discuss a land deal, the New Straits
Times reported on Sept. 13. Their bodies were burnt and their
ashes thrown into a river near a poultry farm, the Times
reported without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists
reduced their forecast for the U.S. budget deficit to $1.25
trillion in the current fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economists previously anticipated a gap of $1.3
trillion before revising that after the Congressional Budget
Office calculated a shortfall of $1.29 trillion in the previous
fiscal year which ended last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the CBO is rarely off by more than a few billion
dollars in its monthly reckoning, we take this figure as given
in making a provisional adjustment to our forecast for full-year
2011 budget balance,&#8221; the economists said in a report to
clients late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new forecasts mean the U.S. government can issue less
debt in coming months, the economists said. Goldman Sachs&#8217; chief
U.S. economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a separate note this week
that he expects the U.S. economy to be &#8220;fairly bad&#8221; over the
next six to nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nikolaj Gammeltoft" date="Oct 14, 2010 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-14/goldman-gets-38-right-as-no-1-firm-rating-financial-companies-worldwide.html"><headline>Goldman No. 1 at Rating Financial Companies With 38% Right</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s been a rough three years for
banks, securities firms and insurers -- even rougher for the
analysts whose job it is to predict how the stocks of these
firms will perform, Bloomberg Markets reports in its November
issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in the second half of 2007, the financial system
unraveled. First, the market for securities backed by subprime
mortgages collapsed. By the second half of 2008, stock markets
around the world were in free fall. Then, starting in March
2009, stocks roared back in the most powerful rally since the
1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t even remember when things were normal,&#8221; says
Daniel Harris, a financial services analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. &#8220;Every analyst that has been around in financial
services during this time has a newfound respect for the depth
that stock prices can go to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A semblance of normalcy returned to the markets in the
summer of 2010, says Frederick Cannon, co-director of research
at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc. &#8220;We actually had
a stretch this August when most of Wall Street went off to the
Hamptons and you could finally take a little bit of a breather
for the first time in three years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and KBW did better than most at figuring out
where markets were headed. Goldman is No. 1 and KBW No. 2 in the
Bloomberg Markets ranking of the world&#8217;s best financial sector
research firms. Goldman&#8217;s Harris is one of the top three
analysts of financial service firms, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,500 Analysts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ranking is based on stock recommendations made by more
than 2,500 analysts worldwide at 77 research firms and
investment banks from January 2008 to July 2010. It looks at the
analysts&#8217; &#8220;buy,&#8221; &#8220;hold&#8221; and &#8220;sell&#8221; calls on shares of 90 of the
largest banks, diversified financial service companies and
insurers in the U.S., Europe and Asia with at least 20 analysts
covering them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the best of the firms and individual stock pickers
failed to accurately predict the fall and rise of most big
financial stocks. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s analysts won their No. 1 rank
by making 30 accurate calls on the 79 financial stocks they
follow, or 38 percent, while KBW&#8217;s No. 2 post was based on 27
prescient calls on 78 stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a very difficult climate to make stock
recommendations in,&#8221; says S.P. Kothari, a professor of
management and deputy dean at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge. &#8220;First,
you had to predict the downfall of the financial sector in 2008,
which only very few people did. Then, you had to change your
outlook to catch the recovery -- all within a relatively short
period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for Ideas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Brady, a managing director at Santa Fe, New Mexico-
based Thornburg Investment Management, which oversees about $56
billion, says he doesn&#8217;t read analyst reports for picks on
individual stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unusual to see original thinking in these reports,
even though that&#8217;s what&#8217;s most valuable to me,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The
ones who are different aren&#8217;t always right, but they&#8217;re
frequently the most interesting and thoughtful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris&#8217;s best call was the &#8220;buy&#8221; he put on retail broker TD
Ameritrade Holding Corp. on Dec. 9, 2008, according to Bloomberg
data. The shares sold at $12.80 at the time and rose 46 percent
in the following 12 months. After the Goldman Sachs analyst put
a &#8220;hold&#8221; on the stock in December 2009, it declined 16 percent
through the end of July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab Sell Call &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he called the rise of TD Ameritrade, Harris advised
investors to sell Charles Schwab Corp. in September 2009 before
going to a &#8220;hold&#8221; recommendation earlier this year; its stock
has since fallen 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We liked Ameritrade better than Charles Schwab because we
thought their management was being more aggressive in what they
were trying to do to battle a very challenging environment,&#8221;
Harris says. &#8220;They were active managers of their capital. They
made the acquisition of Thinkorswim to boost their trading
activities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TD Ameritrade acquired Thinkorswim Group Inc., a New York
options brokerage, in January 2009 for $748.6 million to tap
into fast-growing investor interest in the options market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatile markets have been the least of New York-based
KBW&#8217;s tribulations. In 2001, the investment bank lost 67
employees, including 22 from its research department, in the
Sept. 11 terrorist strike that brought down the World Trade
Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;A Wild Ride&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been a crazy time for us for the past nine years,&#8221;
says John Howard, 56, co-director of research with Cannon. He
has been at KBW since 1982 and moved to research from sales in
2001 as part of the effort to rebuild that department. &#8220;Combine
9/11 with everything that has happened over the past couple of
years in the market, and it&#8217;s been a wild ride for the firm,&#8221; he
says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard sits in KBW&#8217;s &#8220;living room&#8221; -- a lounge on the
fourth floor of the firm&#8217;s new midtown Manhattan offices -- next
to a memorial sculpture made from a steel girder salvaged from
the Trade Center. The sculpture complements a painting of an
American flag in the lobby with the names of the KBW dead
written on the stripes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBW is the seventh-largest U.S. investment bank, with a
market capitalization of $949.9 million and a total of 562
employees today. It provides advisory services mostly to other
financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crash Economics &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market crash and subsequent rise made equity analysts&#8217;
jobs harder, because the events had little to do with individual
companies&#8217; performance, says Anton Schutz, who uses KBW&#8217;s
research and trading services in his management of $250 million
in financial shares at Mendon Capital Advisors Corp. in
Rochester, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Macro developments drove the stocks so that intelligent
stock picking was difficult,&#8221; Schutz says. &#8220;But you still had to
make sure you didn&#8217;t buy the losers such as Bear Stearns and
that you picked the survivors such as JPMorgan. KBW helped solve
that puzzle for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon, 54, says his analysts do bottom-up research,
focusing on a financial company&#8217;s fundamentals more than on the
economic climate in which it&#8217;s operating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were able to see macro trends during the financial
crisis because we were looking so hard at the micro level,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;When we looked across the about 600 banks we cover, it
was staring us in the face.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hold on Discover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani, who&#8217;s one of the top two U.S.
credit-card analysts, according to Bloomberg data, reacted early
to deteriorating economic conditions by putting a &#8220;hold&#8221; on the
stock of card issuer Discover Financial Services in December
2007, as delinquent payments began to rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 39 percent in the next 18 months. In the 13
months after Sakhrani, 35, switched to a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating in June
2009, the stock rose 44 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sakhrani in mid-August 2009 added American Express to his
buy list. He thinks American Express will benefit from a rise in
consumer credit quality, growth in spending and an increase in
fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Harris says that, unlike KBW, his team uses the
expertise of the firm&#8217;s economists to help pick stocks. Goldman
was one of the first banks to predict, in 2007, that interest
rates would remain low for a long period of time. At the end of
2009, it forecast there would be no rate hike until at least
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I leveraged the knowledge and the forecasts that Goldman
had on interest rates and unemployment to help me determine what
the best stock selections were,&#8221; Harris, 36, says. &#8220;Our macro
research helped our micro research.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnell Picks Goldman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A timely &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Goldman Sachs itself helped earn
Wells Fargo  Co. analyst Matt Burnell a spot among the best
analysts of diversified banks. His call came in April 2009, a
month after the market turned positive. By July 30 of this year,
when he still had a &#8220;buy&#8221; on the stock, it was up 33 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnell, 48, says he saw Goldman stock rising because of
its strong market position and modest exposure to mortgages and
other loans. At the same time he rated Goldman a &#8220;buy,&#8221; he put a
&#8220;hold&#8221; on investment bank Morgan Stanley because 62 percent of
the bank&#8217;s common equity consisted of shaky commercial mortgages
and other real-estate investments. The stock has been flat since
then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving to Wells Fargo, Burnell worked in fixed
income for 12 years at Merrill Lynch  Co., now owned by Bank of
America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Balance Sheet Perspective&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a fixed-income analyst, you have more of a balance
sheet perspective as opposed to an earnings-per-share focus,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;Also, knowing how the debt market works can be very
helpful because bond price movements are often a leading
indicator of stock price movements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When financial stocks began their recovery in mid-2009,
many U.S. regional banks outperformed their Wall Street
counterparts. Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s Matt O&#8217;Connor made a series of
calls on U.S. regional banks that places him among the best
three analysts in that category. He&#8217;s also one of the best three
analysts of commercial banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank ranks No. 3 among firms with the largest
number of accurate calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 35-year-old O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s best regional bank call was his
June 2009 &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation on Minneapolis-based US Bancorp.
By the time he put a &#8220;hold&#8221; on the stock in May, it had climbed
45 percent. After his &#8220;hold,&#8221; it declined 7 percent through July
30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping Doors Open &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had noticed that a lot of banks were pulling back in
key business areas, but because US Bancorp was stronger it had
the ability to keep the doors open for business,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The
downgrade came after the weaker banks had gotten stronger, and
we wanted to take profit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the financial crisis rippled across the globe in late
2008, one hard-hit country was South Korea. The economy and
stock market fell so far so fast that President Lee Myung Bak
declared a national emergency. Gross domestic product contracted
5.1 percent in the last three months of 2008 alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five months after the national alert, top Asian equity
analyst Hunpio Hong of KTB Securities Co. in Seoul went from a
&#8220;hold&#8221; to a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Korean banks, according to Bloomberg
data. His best call was his June 2009 &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation on
Seoul-based Shinhan Financial Co. By the end of July this year,
the stock was up 54 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shinhan is South Korea&#8217;s largest financial company by
market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;A Difficult Decision&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was such a difficult decision at the time,&#8221; says Hong,
42, who has a Master of Business Administration from the
University of Washington. &#8220;The stock performance had partly been
beyond my analysis because of the crisis, but in mid-2009 I saw
that the downward trend of Korean banks&#8217; net interest margin was
coming to an end.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net interest margin is the difference between what a
bank pays in interest to depositors and what it earns from
loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most South Korean banks have come back from the
crisis, Europe&#8217;s have not. The region&#8217;s financial institutions
fell more than 50 percent from January 2008 through July,
according to the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index. Chintan Joshi of Nomura Holdings Inc. ranks as one of
Europe&#8217;s premier bank analysts for finding exceptions to the bad
news in the Scandinavian market, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The world was in a very bearish place at the time,&#8221; says
Joshi, who came to Nomura when it acquired Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Asian and European operations. &#8220;But the Nordic
macroeconomic situation was better, and the banks didn&#8217;t have
much exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordic Lights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshi, 31, works from London for Tokyo-based Nomura, tied
at No. 14 in Bloomberg&#8217;s firm ranking. His best call was a March
6, 2009, &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation on Oslo-based commercial and
investment bank DnB Nor ASA. The bank&#8217;s stock had soared 272
percent as of July 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, in November 2008, Joshi had given a &#8220;buy&#8221;
recommendation to Oslo-based Nordea Bank AB. Nordea&#8217;s stock
gained 44 percent before Joshi put a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on it in
September 2009. It&#8217;s been flat since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT&#8217;s Kothari says that what often distinguishes successful
analysts is their willingness to take a risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s essential to have the courage to be a little bit
different from the herd mentality that most analysts may
exhibit,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That courage is what makes some of these
analysts stand out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts themselves say picking stocks in some of the
most volatile markets in history has been an education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The past few years have probably been the biggest learning
experience I could have had as an analyst,&#8221; says Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Harris. &#8220;The environment was so volatile and so uncertain. That
shapes you.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank, and missile maker Raytheon Corp. led
corporate debt sales in the U.S. this week as the pace of
issuance slows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s $4 billion offering included the first 30-year
bonds from a U.S. bank in 15 months, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon sold $2
billion in a three-part transaction as it sold securities for
the first time since November 2009, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies sold $22.7 billion of debt, compared with $22.6
billion last week, as issuance this month trails September&#8217;s
record pace and that of the similar period a year ago. Credit
quality may be near a peak for non-financial U.S. companies and
may decline if firms begin to use the cash raised for expansion,
according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At these prices, there are embedded risks of a change in
market psychology,&#8221; said William Larkin, who helps manage $500
million at Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had such huge returns in the corporate bond market that
it&#8217;s led to a herd mentality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade corporate bonds have returned 10.9 percent
this year after gaining 19.8 percent in 2009, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch Index data. High-yield, high-risk
company debt&#8217;s 13.5 percent gain this year follows its 57.5
percent climb a year ago, the index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales this week compare with $28 billion during the five-
day period ended Oct. 16, 2009, Bloomberg data show. Companies
issued $48.4 billion of debt this month, compared with $76.5
billion in the corresponding portion of September and $47.2
billion in the first 15 days of October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies issued $161.1 billion of debt in September, the
most on record for that month, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own high-yield bonds
instead of Treasuries fell 2 basis points to 595 basis points on
Oct. 15 and was down from 612 basis points on Oct. 8, according
to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II
Index. Yields on the debt decreased to 7.77 percent from 7.85
percent last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High yield debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s and BBB- by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on speculative-grade debt signaled a 20 percent
chance the U.S. economy would slip back into recession,
according to Martin Fridson, New York-based global credit
strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on the 30-year Treasury bonds rose to the highest
since Aug. 10 as investors wagered the Federal Reserve may buy
shorter-term debt to stimulate the economy. Fed policy makers
were prepared to ease credit &#8220;before long&#8221; and focused on
purchases of Treasuries and boosting inflation expectations,
according to minutes of the central bank&#8217;s Sept. 21 session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Economic indicators continued to issue mixed signals, but
investors increasingly have come to believe that quantitative
easing by the Fed will avert an economic collapse,&#8221; Fridson
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade spreads widened 1 basis point in the week
to 182 basis points, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index. Yields climbed 12 basis
points to 3.68 percent, the index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, second in assets to Bank of America Corp. among
U.S. banks, sold $2.75 billion of 10-year notes and $1.25
billion of bonds due in October 2040, Bloomberg data show. It
was the first offering of 30-year debt by a U.S. bank since
Citigroup sold $2.5 billion in July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Profits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale came after New York-based JPMorgan said third-
quarter profit rose 23 percent, beating analyst estimates, as
provisions for bad loans declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raytheon, JPMorgan and Reliance Industries Ltd., India&#8217;s
most valuable company, led $15.5 billion of investment-grade
bond issuance, compared with average weekly sales of $16.7
billion in 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius XM Radio Inc., the New York-based satellite radio
broadcaster, sold $700 million of eight-year notes and Manitowoc
Co., the world&#8217;s biggest manufacturer of overhead cranes, issued
$600 million of 10-year debt as junk-rated companies raised $7.3
billion, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade corporate bond sales have fallen for four
consecutive weeks since reaching $13.7 billion during the period
ended Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate credit quality may decline as companies take
advantage of record-low yields on their debt to pay for share
repurchases and acquisitions, Mark Gray and Thomas Marshella,
Moody&#8217;s managing directors, wrote in an Oct. 12 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Appetite for MA&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a lot of companies extend maturities, reduce
their cost of borrowing by going into the public markets,&#8221; said
Douglas Braunstein, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief financial officer, in a
conference call with investors on Oct. 13. &#8220;You&#8217;re starting to
see a pickup in the appetite for MA, and I think part of that
is a function of people getting their balance sheets prepared
and ready to go and looking for growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Medical Group Holdings Inc., a provider of emergency
transportation services, and Texas Competitive Energy Holdings
Co., the Energy Future Holdings Corp. unit, are among companies
planning at least $3 billion in U.S. bond sales, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Italy&#8217;s
Mediobanca SpA are among banks that stand to receive as much as
63 million euros ($88 million) in fees for managing the initial
public offering of Enel SpA&#8217;s renewable-energy unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enel will pay a commission of as much as 1.85 percent on
the IPO of Enel Green Power SpA, the Rome-based company said in
a filing today. Italy&#8217;s largest utility is selling as much as
3.4 billion euros of EGP shares in what may be Europe&#8217;s biggest
IPO in three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities firms charged an average fee of 3.3 percent on
$106.5 billion of global IPOs completed this year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Fees for stock sales are on average higher in
Asia and the U.S. than in Europe, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Intesa Sanpaolo&#8217;s Banca IMI SpA,
Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley, UniCredit SpA and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA are managing the IPO with Goldman and Mediobanca. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. are &#8220;well positioned&#8221; to manage through mortgage-related
problems such as so-called put-backs from Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac and private investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total cost to the banking industry of having to buy
back faulty mortgages from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other
government-sponsored entities could be between $29 billion and
$44 billion, analysts led by Richard Ramsden in New York wrote
in a note to investors today. The cost from private-label
mortgage-backed securities put-backs could reach $34 billion,
the analysts estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. bank stocks fell for a second day on concern costs for
the put-backs will escalate and as a freeze on home foreclosures
because of faulty paperwork led to a nationwide investigation of
banks&#8217; practices. The Goldman Sachs analysts said the
foreclosure freeze represents a &#8220;temporary problem,&#8221; although
the size of potential penalties and costs &#8220;are difficult to
assess.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and JPMorgan, both based in New York, &#8220;appear
well positioned, given their total exposure and accumulated
reserves,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;While the increased time
certainly represents a cost to the banks, we do not ultimately
believe that the outcome will be materially different from the
current outlook, as the documentation appears to be complete and
appears to be more of a technical issue than a fundamental one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litton Loan Servicing LP, a mortgage-servicing business
owned by Goldman Sachs, said a week ago that it suspended
foreclosures in some cases to review its procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts have buy ratings on Bank of America
Corp., JPMorgan and Citigroup, the three biggest U.S. banks by
assets, and a neutral rating on Wells Fargo  Co., the fourth-
largest. Goldman Sachs is No. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America dropped 64 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $11.96
at 10:17 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after
dropping 5.2 percent yesterday. JPMorgan fell $1.79, or 4.6
percent, to $36.94, while Citigroup lost 11 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $3.96. Wells Fargo slid 97 cents, or 3.9 percent, to
$23.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Carli Lourens" date="Oct 15, 2010  8:54 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-15/goldman-sachs-says-the-rand-to-strengthen-to-6-20-per-dollar-in-12-months.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Says The Rand to Strengthen to 6.20 Per Dollar in 12 Months</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The rand may strengthen to 6.20 per
dollar in a year as the U.S. currency weakens amid concern the
American economy is struggling to maintain its recovery,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency of Africa&#8217;s biggest economy may appreciate to
6.75 per dollar in the next three months and 6.30 in six months&#8217;
time, Colin Coleman, the managing director of the bank&#8217;s local
unit, said in a speech in Johannesburg today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is &#8220;much more bearish&#8221; on the dollar&#8217;s outlook
than the market, Bell said. &#8220;The bearish dollar outlook is of
course fundamental to how currencies trade and obviously that
has a positive bearing on gold and a strengthening bias on the
rand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro will climb to $1.50 in six months and $1.55 in a
year, Coleman said. Gold, which together with platinum accounts
for about a fifth of South Africa&#8217;s export earnings, reached a
record $1,387.35 an ounce yesterday as the dollar weakened. The
euro is forecast to reach $1.33 by the end of the year, $1.32 at
the end of March and $1.33 at the end of 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The European common currency gained 0.7
percent to $1.4156 by 1:31 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar slid toward a 15-year low versus the yen after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said additional
monetary stimulus may be warranted because inflation is too low
and unemployment is too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rand Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rand strengthened as much as 0.6 percent to 6.7616 to
the dollar, the strongest since January 2008, and last traded
0.3 percent higher at 6.7835 per dollar at 2:33 p.m. in
Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South African currency has gained 39 percent against
the dollar since the beginning of last year as near-zero
interest rates in the U.S., Japan and the euro-region countries
fuelled demand for higher-yielding assets in emerging markets.
South Africa has a benchmark rate of 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers are &#8220;concerned&#8221; about the appreciation and
are considering ways to curb the currency, central bank Governor
Gill Marcus said yesterday. The strength of the rand has
prompted exporters and labor unions to lobby the central bank to
step up efforts to weaken it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Treasury Director-General Lesetja Kganyago said
today countries that are taking individual actions to curb their
currencies are embarking on a &#8220;race to the bottom.&#8221; This
strategy requires &#8220;deep pockets,&#8221; which South Africa doesn&#8217;t
have, Kganyago said in Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova" date="Oct 15, 2010  4:45 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-15/goldman-sachs-almost-doubles-its-forecast-for-returns-from-precious-metals.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Almost Doubles Its Forecast for Returns From Precious Metals</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Returns from precious metals will be
almost twice as strong as predicted last month, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said, citing an increased chance of further Federal
Reserve actions to spur U.S. economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precious metals will generate a 12-month return of 30
percent, more than September&#8217;s 17 percent estimate, according to
a Goldman Sachs report dated yesterday by analyst Jeffrey Currie. Industrial metals will return 25 percent, above the
prior 15 percent prediction, and the forecast for energy was
maintained at 27 percent, the report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials were prepared in September to ease monetary
policy &#8220;before long,&#8221; minutes of their Sept. 21 session showed
this month. Policy makers will meet next on Nov. 2-3.
Speculation that the Fed will engage in a second round of so-
called quantitative easing has helped to lift gold to a record
and copper to the highest level in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the likelihood of QE2 has helped diminish market
concerns about sharp macro deterioration, relative commodity
performance has been increasingly tied to fundamentals,&#8221; Currie
said in the report. &#8220;In addition to gold and platinum, we are
most constructive on copper, zinc, corn and crude oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs this week raised three-month and one-year
estimates for gold prices to $1,400 an ounce and $1,650 an
ounce, respectively. Copper may climb to $11,000 a metric ton by
the end of 2011 as stockpiles shrink, the bank said last week.
Today Goldman Sachs increased its 12-month estimate for corn to
$6.25 a bushel from $5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the recent tightening of corn balances on
strong demand growth from ethanol, as well as sharply lower U.S.
yields, will lend further support to corn prices despite the
recent rally,&#8221; Goldman said. Wheat prices will remain elevated
and volatile for now and will drop in the &#8220;medium term,&#8221; the
bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs forecast a 20 percent return from the SP
GSCI Enhanced Commodity Total Return Index over 12 months,
compared with the prior 19 percent. The gauge is up 2.3 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts
&#8220;substantially higher prices&#8221; for oil in the second half of
2011 and 2012 as the global inventory surplus is exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that forward price levels offer good hedging
opportunities for calendar 2011/2012 for consumers despite the
recent rally,&#8221; Goldman analysts led by Allison Nathan and
Jeffrey Currie said in a note to clients yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the supply-demand balance to continue to
tighten in the fourth quarter of 2010 as continued global
economic growth, albeit likely at a slower pace than in the
first half, continues to strengthen demand,&#8221; the note said.
&#8220;Moving into the second half of 2011 and 2012, we expect the
global inventory surplus to be exhausted and OPEC spare capacity
to be drawn on to balance the market, leading to
substantinally higher prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of companies
whose shares may rise or fall in Australia. This preview
includes news announced after markets closed on Oct. 15. All
prices are from that day&#8217;s close unless otherwise stated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP/ASX 200 Index futures contract due in December lost
0.3 percent to 4,686 as of 6:59 a.m. in Sydney. The Bank of New
York Australia ADR Index declined 0.5 percent. The SP/ASX 200
Index slipped 0.2 percent to 4,689. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining shares: A measure of primary metals traded in London
fell 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP AU), the world&#8217;s largest mining
company, was little changed at A$41.65 in Sydney. Its American
depositary receipts fell 0.4 percent in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto Group (RIO AU), the world&#8217;s third-biggest miner,
rose 1.4 percent to A$83.20 in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP may revive a takeover bid for Rio in 2013 should their
planned Australian iron-ore joint venture fail to get approval,
according to Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

to settle at $81.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL AU), Australia&#8217;s second-
biggest oil and gas producer, lost 0.1 percent to A$44.33. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank stocks: Australia&#8217;s largest lenders are revamping

capital pools in the region, the Australian Financial Review
reported, citing executives at the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB AU), the nation&#8217;s biggest
business lender, dropped 0.7 percent to A$25.49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMP Ltd. (AMP AU) and Axa Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd. (AXA
AU): Axa SA and AMP are making progress in continuing talks on
whether to make a bid for Axa Asia Pacific Holdings, the
Australian reported, without attribution. The two companies are
not poised to make a bid, the newspaper said. AMP shares gained
1.7 percent to A$5.36. AXA Asia Pacific was unchanged at A$5.16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centro Properties Group (CNP AU): Centro is working on a
A$2 billion ($2 billion) sale of assets to allow its lenders to
recoup equity, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, citing
analysts and unidentified people familiar with the situation.
The stock was unchanged at 16 Australian cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexus Property Group (DXS AU): Dexus Wholesale Property
Fund bought 13 Australian industrial properties with tenants
including Mercedes-Benz and Fairfax Media Ltd. for A$231 million
and signaled plans to sell as much as A$500 million in shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexus Wholesale is an unlisted trust managed by Dexus
Property Group, Australia&#8217;s largest owner and manager of office
properties, whose shares were unchanged at 83.5 Australian cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL AU) and Foster&#8217;s Group Ltd. (FMG
AU): Coca-Cola doesn&#8217;t see any value in a bid for Foster&#8217;s Group
Ltd. at current prices because it would make it difficult to
generate a return, the Australian newspaper reported, citing
Amatil Chief Executive Officer Terry Davis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares climbed 0.3 percent to A$12.24. Foster&#8217;s
sank 0.5 percent to A$6.04. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese stocks were raised to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;underweight&#8221; by JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Citigroup Inc. as the market remains a laggard even after
posting Asia&#8217;s best gains this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index&#8217;s 12 percent surge in October
has trimmed its losses for the year to 9.5 percent. The MSCI
China Index, tracking mainly Hong Kong-traded Chinese shares,
has jumped 6.5 percent this month, taking its gains this year to
8.3 percent. In contrast, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and
MSCI Asia excluding Japan Index have climbed more than 12
percent so far in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market equity funds have taken in more than $23
billion since the start of September, according to EPFR Global
data, amid indications that the U.S. Federal Reserve and the
Bank of Japan will add to stimulus measures to defend an
economic recovery. Speculation that China may delay further
measures aimed at damping the nation&#8217;s property market has also
helped to attract funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China is a laggard market with building momentum,&#8221;
JPMorgan strategists led by Adrian Mowat wrote in a report dated
Oct. 18. &#8220;These are powerful characteristics in today&#8217;s &#8216;bubble
on, bubble off&#8217; markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc last week said it had
turned more bullish on stocks in China and the rest of Asia as
central banks around the world reverse tightening policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both JPMorgan and Citigroup stopped short of raising China
to &#8220;overweight,&#8221; with JPMorgan&#8217;s Mowat saying that Chinese
policies to boost household income will come at the expense of
profits. Citigroup strategists led by Markus Rosgen said they
plan to upgrade the market once global leading economic
indicators  &#8220;turn up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world economy will expand 4.8 percent this year before
growth slows to 4.2 percent next year, the International
Monetary Fund said in a report released earlier this month.
China will post the fastest growth among major emerging markets,
expanding 10.5 percent in 2010 and 9.6 percent next year,
according to the Washington-based fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook for liquidity and growth suggests that
investors will drive valuations in Asia higher, helping stocks
to extend a two-year recovery, Citigroup also said. The
brokerage forecasts that the MSCI Asia excluding Japan will
climb to 695 by the end of 2011, after the gauge last week
reached its 2010 target of about 530, the strategists wrote in
an Oct. 18 report. The index rose 0.2 percent to 547.96 at 10:04
a.m. in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Year three is historically one during which multiples
expand,&#8221; the brokerage said. &#8220;The earnings have come through;
investors are convinced of the recovery and are willing to
extend their investment horizon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay Viacom
Inc.&#8217;s Paramount Pictures at least $115 million for distribution
rights to &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; and the &#8220;Avengers,&#8221; gaining full
control of movies owned by its Marvel Entertainment unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount, hired to distribute Marvel films before the
movie and comic book company was bought by Disney for about $4
billion in January, will release &#8220;Thor&#8221; and &#8220;Captain
America&#8221; next year, the companies said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $115 million will serve as a minimum guarantee to
Paramount, the companies said. Disney, based in Burbank,
California, has made Marvel and Pixar Animation the focus of its
movie-making and agreed in July to sell its Miramax film
division to private-equity investors Colony Capital LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount &#8220;probably made good at least on what they would
have earned on the Marvel releases,&#8221; said Matt Harrigan, a
Denver-based analyst with Wunderlich Securities. &#8220;I&#8217;d be
surprised if Paramount got just $115 million. That&#8217;s just a
floor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal may be viewed as a sign of Paramount management&#8217;s
confidence it can generate profit from an internally produced
slate, JPMorgan analyst Imran Khan said in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movie franchises produced by Paramount include &#8220;Star
Trek&#8221; and the &#8220;Transformers,&#8221; &#8220;Mission: Impossible&#8221; and
&#8220;G.I. Joe&#8221; films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Roeder, a Disney spokesman, declined to comment beyond
the statement. Steven Rubenstein, Paramount&#8217;s outside spokesman,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 13 cents to $34.75 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 7.8 percent
this year. New York-based Viacom fell 23 cents to $37.64. The
class B shares are up 27 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thor&#8221; is set for release on May 6, 2011. &#8220;Captain
America&#8221; is planned for July 22, 2011, according to the
Internet Movie Database. &#8220;The Avengers&#8221; will be released in
2012 and &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; in 2013, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, declined
as much as 4 percent in extended trading after posting its third
straight quarterly drop in new contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services signings fell 7 percent to $11 billion in the
third quarter, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today in a
statement. The company also reported earnings and sales for the
period that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While companies increased spending on IBM&#8217;s software and
hardware, such as storage computers, they are holding back on
signing large outsourcing projects in the aftermath of the
recession. Investors focus on the service business because it
accounts for almost 60 percent of IBM&#8217;s annual sales and more
than 40 percent of its profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are likely to key in on IT-services signings
being a bit below expectations,&#8221; said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, who recommends buying the
shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s a key measure of deal activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell as much as $5.78 to $137.05 in extended trading
after closing at $142.83 on the New York Stock Exchange. This
month, the shares topped their record high set in 1999, and have
extended gains since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company signed a $1.8 billion outsourcing deal with ABN
Amro Goup NV on Oct. 8. If that had occurred in the third
quarter, services signings would have been $12.7 billion, IBM
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficult to Predict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to predict precisely when these deals
will close, and eight days is not going to make any difference
in the yield to this contract,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call today. The company has a
&#8220;strong deal list&#8221; for outsourcing signings this quarter, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.40 a share, the third time it&#8217;s raised 2010 earnings
guidance this year. Analysts on average estimated $11.30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the quarter rose 12 percent to $3.59
billion, or $2.82 a share, from $3.21 billion, or $2.40, a year
earlier. Analysts predicted $2.75, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales climbed 3 percent to $24.3 billion, topping analysts&#8217;
average projection of $24.1 billion. It&#8217;s the third consecutive
period during which all business units -- hardware, software and
both services segments -- posted sales gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is aiming to almost
double operating earnings to $20 a share in the next five years.
Software will make up about half of profit by then, the company
said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has invested in analytics software and services that
help predict trends, as well as cloud computing, which helps
customers save money by letting them store and access data via
the Internet, rather than from their own servers. Palmisano also
has been investing in his Smarter Planet initiative, based on
the concept that infrastructure, such as buildings or roads, can
be equipped with digital sensors, which in turn will make them
more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three technologies, along with sales from emerging
markets, will add $20 billion in revenue by 2015, the company
said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions in the same period. He announced seven deals last
quarter, including the $1.7 billion purchase of Netezza Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will
rise 7.6 percent to 1,275 in the next 12 months, as investors
become less risk-averse and look ahead to stronger economic
growth in 2012, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate for year-end 2010 remains 1,200, and stocks
will have &#8220;flat&#8221; returns in the first quarter of 2011 because
the economic recovery remains fragile, strategists led by David
Kostin wrote in a report dated Oct. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cost of equity should decline slightly as 2011
progresses and investors turn their attention to the economic
growth prospects for 2012,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is up 6.2 percent this year, as optimism about
corporate earnings and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve
will pump more money into the economy outweigh concerns about
ballooning sovereign debt in some European countries and the
strength of the recovery. The gauge rose 0.7 percent to 1,184.71
as of 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the SP 500 will still be at 1,200 in six
months, as Fed stimulus measures will have a &#8220;minimal&#8221; impact
on earnings and &#8220;firms will spend cash slowly given spare
capacity, desire to preserve margins and low chief executive
officer confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists expect no expansion in price-to-earnings
ratio on the benchmark index for U.S. stocks in the next 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report said risks to the estimates include a jump in
management confidence, a rise in trade protectionism or a
slowdown in emerging markets, especially China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) may be the next
tenant at the former home of rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is searching for about 1 million square feet
(93,000 square meters) of offices in lower Manhattan and is
considering 1 New York Plaza, where it already rents, and
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s former headquarters at 85 Broad St., three
people with knowledge of the discussions said. The bank also is
looking at other properties as it seeks to consolidate some of
its downtown operations, said one of the people, who asked not
to be named because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, moved its headquarters to a new 43-story skyscraper at
200 West St. this year after almost three decades at 85 Broad
St., a 1.2 million square-foot tower it built for itself in the
early 1980s. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. have also considered leasing at 85 Broad, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How can you not?&#8221; said Robert Sammons, director of
research in the New York office of Cassidy Turley, a brokerage
that isn&#8217;t involved in the tower&#8217;s leasing. &#8220;It&#8217;s got all the
bells and whistles that they would need. All that extra power
they would need is already there, and ready to rock and roll.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to pay $200 million in upfront payments for
rights to four insulin products to expand its diabetes offerings
in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biocon can get additional milestone payments of as much as
$150 million and will receive payments linked to product sales
by New York-based Pfizer, the companies said in a statement
today. Biocon, based in Bangalore, India, will be responsible
for developing and manufacturing the diabetes treatments and for
securing new regulatory approvals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 80 percent of people with diabetes live in low and
middle-income countries, according to the World Health
Organization in Geneva. Pfizer has been expanding its business
in emerging markets such as India and focusing on the
therapeutic areas of diabetes, vaccines, cancer, pain,
inflammation and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a big surprise that Pfizer is paying so much up
front,&#8221; said Bino Pathiparampil, an analyst at India Infoline
Ltd. in Mumbai, in a telephone interview. Insulin revenue from
emerging markets will begin immediately, while new approvals and
sales from the deal will take at least 3 to 4 years to
accumulate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 5 cents to $17.80 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has declined 2.1 percent
this year. Biocon rose 3.1 rupees, or 0.8 percent, to 403.1
rupees in Mumbai trading before the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biocon Products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Biocon products include recombinant human insulin and
generic versions of Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s insulin Lantus, Novo
Nordisk AS&#8217;s NovoLog and Eli Lilly  Co.&#8217;s HumaLog. Biocon&#8217;s
recombinant human insulin formulations are approved in 27
countries in developing markets and is being sold in 23.
Glargine, the competitor to Lantus, has been introduced in its
first market, India, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biocon plans to spend $300 million in the next three years
to expand capacity, Chief Financial Officer Murali Krishnan said
in Bangalore today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 171 million people were living with diabetes
worldwide in 2000, according to the World Health Organization.
That figure will more than double by 2030, the agency estimates
on its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose to a five-month
high, led by financial shares, after Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s earnings
topped estimates and an unexpected drop in industrial production
added to signs the Federal Reserve will help fuel the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the bank 12 percent-owned by U.S. taxpayers,
rallied 5.4 percent to lead a measure of financial shares to the
biggest gain among 10 groups. Hasbro Inc., the second-largest
toymaker, advanced 3.8 percent after reporting higher-than-
estimated earnings as sales of preschool products gained.
Halliburton Co., the second-biggest oilfield-services provider,
slumped 4.8 percent as profit missed some analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed 0.7 percent to 1,184.71 at 4 p.m. in
New York, the highest level since May 3. The gauge gained 1
percent last week after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
economy may need further stimulus and earnings boosted investor
confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80.91 points,
or 0.7 percent, to 11,143.69. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain positive on the market based on decent earnings
and the Fed&#8217;s expected actions,&#8221; said Stewart Beach, who
oversees $1.1 billion as chief investment strategist at Old
Second National Bank in Aurora, Illinois. &#8220;Even Citigroup beat
earnings, which is kind of amazing considering the problems
we&#8217;re seeing on the foreclosure front.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied 13 percent since Bernanke said at
the Fed&#8217;s August conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that he
has the tools to prevent another recession.  The Fed chief said
on Oct. 15 that there&#8217;s a case for &#8220;further action&#8221;  by the
central bank in the form of additional monetary stimulus because
inflation is too low and unemployment is too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for more stimulus was highlighted today by a Fed
report showing production in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped in
September for the first time in more than a year, showing the
industry that led the economy out of the recession is cooling.
Output at factories, mines and utilities fell 0.2 percent, the
first decline since the recession ended in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup jumped 5.4 percent to $4.17 after third-quarter
earnings amounted to 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of 27
cents a share in the same period a year earlier, as the lender
reduced loan-loss reserves by $1.99 billion and Chief Executive
Officer Vikram Pandit said the bank may return capital to
shareholders in 2012. Ten analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated per-share earnings of 5 cents a share at the bank, the
third-biggest in the U.S. by assets. Bank of America Corp.,
Wells Fargo  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are also
scheduled to post results this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Companies Rebound &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America advanced the most in the Dow, gaining 3
percent to $12.34. Wells Fargo increased 5.5 percent to $24.87,
the first gain in four days as evidence of flawed foreclosure
documents triggered a selloff of U.S. bank stocks last week. The
SP 500 Financials Index climbed 1.9 percent, the most among 10
industries in the benchmark measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasbro increased 3.8 percent to $46.81. Third-quarter
earnings excluding some items were $1.09 a share, beating the
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey by 5 percent as
sales from games such as Monopoly and preschool toys such as the
Mr. Potato Head brand, featured in &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block Inc. declined the most in the SP 500, tumbling
11 percent to $10.94 and helping lead a measure of consumer
discretionary shares to the only decline among 10 industry
groups. The largest U.S. tax-preparation firm said it may not be
able to provide customers refund anticipation loans next year
because of a dispute with HSBC Holdings Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has said it will no
longer help banks including HSBC and Republic Bancorp Inc.
underwrite tax refund loans that lawmakers and consumer groups
say carry unfairly high interest rates. HR Block has a contract
with London-based HSBC to provide the loans through 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton Sinks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton fell 4.8 percent to $34.09 after gaining 7.5
percent in the previous two weeks. The world&#8217;s second-largest
oilfield-services provider said third-quarter earnings excluding
some items were 58 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst
estimate by 3.4 percent. The beat was the smallest since the
third quarter of 2008, according to Bloomberg data. Some
analysts had estimated earnings as much as 62 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 24 companies in the SP 500 that reported results
since Oct. 7, 18 have beaten analysts&#8217; per-share earnings
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg predict 24 percent growth in third-quarter
profit from a year earlier for SP 500 companies, the fourth
straight quarterly increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks held gains as confidence among home-construction
companies rose in October to the highest level in four months, a
sign residential building is stabilizing at depressed levels.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo confidence
index increased to 16, exceeding the most optimistic forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey, from 13 the prior month. The gauge was
projected to rise to 14, according to the median estimate in the
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGA Medical Jumps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGA Medical Holdings Inc. soared 41 percent to $20.70. St.
Jude Medical Inc. agreed to buy the maker of medical devices for
$20.80 a share in a cash and stock transaction valued at $1.3
billion, including assumed debt, to expand its range of heart
devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluor Corp. retreated 5.1 percent to $49.23. The largest
publicly traded construction and engineering company in the U.S.
lowered its full-year earnings forecast to no more than $2.50 a
share, down from its previous forecast of $2.90 a share to $3.20
a share. The company took a third-quarter charge because of
delays on a wind-farm project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMoRan Exploration Co. slid 13 percent to $16.02. The
company, which has been a partner in some of the largest U.S.
offshore oil discoveries of the past decade, reported a third-
quarter net loss of 26 cents a share, worse than the 22-cent
loss forecast by analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quicksilver Resources Inc. surged 16 percent to $14.65. The
natural-gas explorer said controlling shareholders Quicksilver
Energy LP and the Darden family are considering taking the
company private. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA, the largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, ended an agreement to buy a stake
in wireless carrier NII Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Mexico unit, giving up
on a plan to enter the mobile-phone business with a partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII and Televisa mutually decided to end the agreement from
February, according to a statement filed to Mexico&#8217;s stock
exchange. The companies disagreed over regulations and risks
related to the investment, NII said in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa had agreed to buy 30 percent of the Mexican
division, called Nextel Mexico, for $1.44 billion. Without the
deal, Televisa, whose cable companies offer packages of TV,
phone and Internet, must compete for customers without a mobile-
phone product. NII, Mexico&#8217;s smallest wireless carrier, will
lose a source of funding for expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Televisa had a change of heart with regard to their
strategic direction,&#8221; said Christopher King, an analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus  Co. in Baltimore, who recommends buying NII
shares. "You do have to count this is a disappointment for NII." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII fell 58 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.45 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading at 1:47 p.m. New York time. Televisa gained
75 centavos to 55.42 pesos in Mexico City trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies had won airwaves in a mobile-phone auction
whose legality has been challenged by rival Grupo Iusacell SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII will continue its deployment of a third-generation
mobile-phone network in Mexico, according to a separate
statement from the Reston, Virginia-based company. NII said it
will start selling service on the new network, which offers
faster download speeds for mobile Internet access, in the next
12 to 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII should be able to fund the construction of its network,
which will cost about $800 million, King said. NII closed the
second quarter with about $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents.
The company also plans to buy airwaves in Brazil and start
building a 3G network there, which would cost about $900
million, King said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may seek funding from network-equipment makers
or by selling its mobile-network towers and then leasing them,
Tim Perrott, the company&#8217;s vice president of investor relations,
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is still discussing an agreement with NII to
market services together, the companies said. Televisa controls
three cable carriers that could use a mobile-phone plan to
combine with Internet, TV and home-phone services to compete
with billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s companies. A Televisa spokesman
didn&#8217;t return a phone message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s Telefonos de Mexico SAB is Mexico&#8217;s largest landline
phone and Internet provider, and America Movil SAB is the
biggest wireless provider. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forced repurchases of soured U.S.
mortgages may be the &#8220;biggest issue facing banks&#8221; even as
errors in the foreclosure process draw attention to other
industry risks, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future losses from repurchases of home loans whose quality
failed to meet sellers&#8217; promises will likely total $55 billion
to $120 billion, or potentially $10 billion to $25 billion for
the next five years, the New York-based mortgage-bond analysts
led by John Sim and Ed Reardon wrote in a Oct. 15 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a &#8220;firestorm of news&#8221; sparked by some loan
servicers&#8217; decisions to halt action on defaulted loans is
drawing renewed attention to banks&#8217; mortgage-repurchase risks,
the foreclosure issues themselves are mostly &#8220;process-oriented
problems that can be fixed,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Putback risk may be the biggest issue facing banks,&#8221; the
analysts wrote, referring to items such as faulty appraisals
that can be used to force lenders to repurchase mortgages under
sales contracts. The analysts declined to comment beyond the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation over mortgage issues helped drive down bank
stocks last week after attorneys general from all 50 states said
they had jointly opened an investigation into whether lenders
and mortgage companies falsified documents in foreclosure
proceedings. Home-loan servicers including Ally Financial Inc.,
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan, which manage outstanding
mortgages, had earlier suspended some foreclosures or evictions
while they review paperwork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forced Repurchases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts said mortgage repurchase costs stem from
$2 trillion of loans that have defaulted or are likely to go
bad, among the $6 trillion of U.S. mortgages and home-equity
debt originated from 2005 through 2007. The defaults will create
about $1.1 trillion of losses for banks, government-supported
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, bond investors and insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses from forced repurchases may total $23 billion to $35
billion for loans sold to or insured by government-backed
companies; $40 billion to $80 billion for so-called non-agency
mortgages that aren&#8217;t backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or other
government agencies, and $20 billion to $31 billion for home-
equity loans, they said. Banks have already realized or reserved
for a portion of the losses, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in non-agency debt may only recoup 5 percent of
losses in part because of difficulties convincing bond trustees
to ask banks to repurchase bad loans and the necessity of
proving misstatements under the securities contracts are
material, they said. For agency mortgages, the figure will be 10
percent, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo, Ramsden Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compass Point Research and Trading LLC&#8217;s Chris Gamaitoni
estimated in August that lenders may suffer as much as $179.2
billion in losses tied to soured mortgages they will be forced
to repurchase from mortgage-bond insurers and investors. Earlier
this year he predicted $28 billion for agency loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Mike Mayo, an analyst at Credit Agricole
Securities USA in New York, estimated a cost of $20 billion for
repurchases when including government-supported Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Richard Ramsden said a
worst-case scenario would be $84 billion, while Paul Miller, an
analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia, said it
could cost the banks as much as $91 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With foreclosure documents, some items are easy to resolve
or don&#8217;t need fixing, the JPMorgan analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage bonds qualify as so-called real-estate mortgage
investment trusts for tax purposes even when the debt is
transferred to the securities with its endorsements left blank,
they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servicers are able to work around legal challenges related
to the Mortgage Electronic Registration System by taking loans
out of the system and putting it into their name or that of the
debt&#8217;s owner before pursuing a foreclosure, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure delays created by the issues will damage
senior-ranked non-agency mortgage securities, costing as much as
4 cents on the dollar for certain bonds if postponements take
six months, according to the analysts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,

&lt;p&gt;The CIBC Advantage Card will be available to clients
starting today, the Toronto-based lender said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card allows customers to make debit-card purchases

Interac Association network, a group of banks, credit unions and

&lt;p&gt;In April, Canada&#8217;s finance ministry approved a voluntary
code of conduct for the country&#8217;s debit and credit card network
that was adopted by Visa, Interac and other payment networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said strikes
that have halted refineries acrosss France will cut oil demand
until next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Beyond any surge in demand as consumers seek to stock up
where possible, the prolonged nature of this strike will result
in lost demand as was evident the last time French strikers
disrupted deliveries,&#8221; analysts at JPMorgan led by Lawrence
Eagles in New York said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said the strike is more likely to support demand
in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although the arbitrage is currently closed, prices
clearly reflect the possibility that it will reopen,&#8221; the bank

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Outsized&#8221; returns in corporate
bonds are a thing of the past because an increase in government
yields as the economy recovers will squeeze the debt&#8217;s
performance, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company bonds will return 1.2 percent over the coming year
compared with 4.7 percent in the past three months, Goldman
strategists led by Charles Himmelberg and Alberto Gallo in New
York wrote in an Oct. 15 report. Money managers can still aim
for double-digit returns by investing in bonds of high-yield
issuers, banks and companies in Europe&#8217;s periphery, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outsized returns available in corporate credit are
firmly behind us,&#8221; wrote Himmelberg and Gallo. &#8220;Meaningful
spread compression is nearly impossible to envision without a
corresponding rise in the currently very low levels of
government bond yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade corporate bonds have returned 9 percent
this year, following gains of 16 percent in all of 2009,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market
Corporate Index. The debt is now more attractive relative to
government bonds for excess rather than for total returns,
Himmelberg and Gallo wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and OAO Gazprom are among companies that
may bid in a licensing round today to develop three natural-gas
fields in Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the other companies registered to bid are Eni Spa,
Mitsubishi Corp. and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Abdul Hadi
al-Hassani, vice chairman of the oil and gas committee in Iraq&#8217;s
parliament said in an interview on Sept. 28. The bidding
ceremony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq, reliant on oil for most of its income, seeks foreign
investors after years of conflict and sanctions. The licensing
round is the third since the U.S-led invasion that toppled
President Saddam Hussein in 2003. It focuses specifically on the
Akkas, Mansouriya and Siba gas fields, which Iraq is eager to
develop for domestic power generation as well as export revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three undeveloped fields hold combined gas reserves of
more than 11 trillion cubic feet, Oil Minister Hussain al- Shahristani said in May. Separately, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration estimates the reserves at 7.6 trillion cubic
feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akkas, discovered in the western Anbar province in 1998,
holds 5.6 trillion cubic feet of gas and has six wells, al
Shahristani said. Mansouriya, discovered in the eastern Diyala
district in 1979, potentially holds 4.5 trillion cubic feet of
gas and has four wells, while Siba, found in 1968 in Basra, has
1.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and three wells, al-Shahristani
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service Contracts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq has the third-largest oil reserves in the Middle East,
after Saudi Arabia and Iran, and wants to more than double its
current crude output of 2.3 million barrels a day. To raise oil
output, the government awarded a dozen service contracts to
international oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and OAO
Lukoil in two licensing rounds last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 45 companies that bid last year were invited by the oil
ministry to bid for the third round this year for the three
natural gas fields, where Iraq wants to raise production four-
fold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq intends to export 50 percent of the gas produced in
the three gas fields, the amount in excess of its domestic
needs, Abdul Mahdy al-Ameedi, deputy director general at Iraq&#8217;s
Petroleum Contracts and Licensing Directorate, said on Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies winning the contracts will be paid on the basis
of barrels of oil equivalent and will not be involved in setting
the price for gas exports, he said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Signature Bonus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among new incentives for investors, Iraq decided to scrap
so-called signature bonuses, which amounted to costs of between
$100 million and $500 million for each of the winning bidders in
the previous two licensing rounds, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akkas and Mansouriya were among the fields offered in
bidding last year. No investors bid for Mansouriya then, and the
ministry rejected the sole offer for Akkas made by a group of
five companies led by Italy&#8217;s Edison SpA. The ministry initially
included Siba in the second round then withdrew it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq will present a draft agreement to the cabinet for a
gas joint venture with Shell by the end of the year, al-
Shahristani told reporters in Vienna on Oct. 14. Shell is
exploring possibilities for exporting liquefied natural gas from
Iraq in future years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country is also a possible source of gas for the planned
Nabucco pipeline project, which aims to reduce Europe&#8217;s
dependence on Russian fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jef Feeley" date="Oct 19, 2010  4:56 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-19/pfizer-wins-arkansas-lawsuit-claiming-prempro-caused-woman-s-breast-cancer.html"><headline>Pfizer Wins Arkansas Lawsuit Claiming Prempro Caused Woman''s Breast Cancer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. properly warned an
Arkansas woman about the cancer risks of its Prempro menopause
drug, jurors found in rejecting her bid for at least
$3.5 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas
deliberated less than an hour before siding with Pfizer, the
world&#8217;s largest drugmaker. Margaret Wilson, a 68-year-old former
bank teller, claimed that Prempro helped caused her breast
cancer and executives of Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit hid the medicine&#8217;s
health risks from women and their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth now has won six of the 13 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. Wyeth got some verdicts
against it thrown out at the post-trial stage or had awards
reduced. Wyeth also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury&#8217;s decision &#8220;affirms that Wyeth communicated the
risks and benefits of Prempro,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer
spokesman, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Pharmacia  Upjohn unit, to relieve symptoms such as
hot flashes and mood swings. Wyeth combined the two hormones in
its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadly Drug? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took the drugs before the Women&#8217;s
Health Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored
study, concluded in 2002 that they posed an increased risk of
cancer. Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines topped $2 billion before
the study. New York-based Pfizer completed its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study released today in the Journal of the American
Medical Association shows that women who took Prempro as part of
the WHI study were almost twice as likely to die from breast
cancer as those who weren&#8217;t taking the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those findings conflict with previous research showing that
breast cancers in women taking hormone therapy had a lower risk
of death, Pfizer&#8217;s Loder said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Wilson, who took Prempro for almost six years
before being diagnosed with breast cancer, said they were
disappointed with the jury&#8217;s finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re sad that fine people like Mrs. Wilson and her
husband didn&#8217;t get justice for their injuries,&#8221; Erik Walker,
one of the woman&#8217;s attorneys, said in an interview after the
verdict. The couple were seeking at least $3.5 million for pain,
suffering and emotional distress over her breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Business Decision&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the three-week trial, Wilson&#8217;s lawyers told jurors
that Wyeth officials never studied whether Prempro contributed
to the development of breast cancer in some women, although
research suggesting a link stretched back more than 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, executives urged Wyeth scientists to dismiss
studies tying its menopause drugs to the disease and to
&#8220;distract&#8221; the media from focusing on them, Rainey Booth, one
of the woman&#8217;s attorneys, said in closing arguments today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This company made a business decision not to get an
answer&#8221; about Prempro&#8217;s breast-cancer risk, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth&#8217;s lawyers countered that the drugmaker provided
adequate warnings about Prempro&#8217;s cancer risks on the medicine&#8217;s
label, and that menopause drugs haven&#8217;t been found conclusively
to cause breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prempro doesn&#8217;t cause DNA mutations&#8221; that lead to the
development of cancer, Lyn Pruitt, one of Wyeth&#8217;s lawyers, told
the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer still faces at least 8,000 lawsuits seeking millions
of dollars in damages over Prempro and its other menopause
drugs. Most of the cases are consolidated in federal court in
Little Rock and state court in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company faces trials during the next several months in
the Philadelphia court and in federal court in northern
Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wilson v. Wyeth, MDL 03-cv-1507-WRW, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas (Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. hasn&#8217;t
proved JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chairman James Dimon promised to
return $5 billion in collateral taken from Lehman when it
teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in September 2008, the bank
said in a court filing seeking to dismiss a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-biggest U.S. bank asked a bankruptcy judge today
for the second time to toss a lawsuit by bankrupt Lehman, which
is claiming $8.6 billion in collateral and tens of billions in
damages from JPMorgan for allegedly helping cause its collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman said last month that Dimon promised former Lehman
Chairman Richard Fuld the money would be returned on Sept. 12,
2008, a day before Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, and didn&#8217;t do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman hasn&#8217;t created &#8220;a plausible inference that this
supposed promise was ever actually made,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan was Lehman&#8217;s main clearing bank in
the 2008 financial crisis, lending Lehman&#8217;s struggling brokerage
more than $100 billion a day to settle trades and repurchase
agreements, according to the filing. The bank says so-called
&#8220;safe harbor&#8221; laws allow clearing banks to take security from
dealers and derivatives traders without getting sued if the
firms fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman said its grounds for suing JPMorgan were spelled out
in a report by court-appointed bankruptcy examiner Anton Valukas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the brink of LBHI&#8217;s bankruptcy, JPMorgan leveraged its
life and death power as the brokerage firm&#8217;s primary clearing
bank to force LBHI into a series of one-sided agreements and to
siphon billions of dollars in critically needed assets,&#8221; Lehman
said in its initial and amended complaints against JPMorgan
filed in May and September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman spokeswoman Kimberly Macleod said she couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment on JPMorgan&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The adversary proceeding is Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks tumbled, dragging
benchmark indexes to their biggest drop since August, amid
concern banks will be forced to buy back soured mortgages and
after Apple Inc. forecast profit that missed analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. slid 4.5 percent after people
familiar with the matter said Pacific Investment Management Co.,
BlackRock Inc. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York seek to
make it repurchase loans packaged into $47 billion of bonds.
Apple retreated 2.7 percent. International Business Machines
Corp. lost 3.4 percent following a decline in new contracts.
Exxon Mobil Corp. led energy companies lower as oil slipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Index lost 1.6 percent to 1,165.90 at 4 p.m. in
New York, the biggest slide since Aug. 19. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 165.07 points, or 1.5 percent, to
10,978.62, while the Nasdaq-100 Index, of which Apple makes up
21 percent, dropped 1.6 percent to 2,069.73. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wall Street is measuring in real time lenders&#8217; loan
losses from the mortgage crisis,&#8221; said Chad Morganlander, a
Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus,
which oversees $90 billion. &#8220;This additional overhang from the
housing debacle is going to keep the financial stocks at bay for
a long period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures extended losses after China&#8217;s central bank
lifted one-year lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points.
The increases come as the fastest-growing major economy seeks to
prevent real-estate bubbles after record price gains this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-Month High &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose yesterday, pushing the SP 500 to a five-
month high, after Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s earnings topped estimates and
an unexpected drop in industrial production added to signs the
Federal Reserve will boost government debt purchases to help
fuel the recovery. Of the 47 companies in the SP 500 that have
posted results since Oct. 7, 39 have beaten analysts&#8217; per-share
earnings estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America slid 4.4 percent to $11.80, erasing an
earlier gain of 0.9 percent. A bondholder group wrote to Bank of
America and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the debt&#8217;s trustee,
citing alleged failures by the bank&#8217;s Countrywide Financial
Corp. unit to service the loans properly, their lawyer had said
yesterday in a statement that didn&#8217;t name the firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple dropped 2.7 percent to $309.49, breaking 10 straight
days of gains, after the company said profit will be about $4.80
a share in the current period including the year-end holiday
shopping season. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted
profit of $5.03. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Stocks Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of energy stocks fell the most among 10
industries in the SP 500, losing 2.4 percent after crude oil
tumbled the most in seven weeks. China&#8217;s rate increase may crimp
demand in the world&#8217;s biggest consumer of energy. Exxon Mobil,
the largest U.S. oil company, retreated 1.8 percent to $65.12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An index of financial stocks in the SP 500 slipped 1.4
percent. The gauge had increased 0.6 percent earlier as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. led a rally in bank stocks after reporting
third-quarter profit that beat estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs gained 2 percent to $156.72. The U.S. bank
that makes more money from trading than any of its competitors
beat analysts&#8217; estimates for third-quarter profit amid lower
costs and higher investment-banking revenue. Net income in the
three months ended Sept. 30 was $2.98 per share, compared with
an average estimate of $2.29, according to a Bloomberg survey of
20 analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM lost 3.4 percent to $138.03 as the biggest computer-
services provider reported a 7 percent decline in services
signings to $11 billion in the third quarter. IBM&#8217;s service
business accounts for almost 60 percent of annual sales and more
than 40 percent of profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares retreated even as IBM boosted its full-year
profit forecast to at least $11.40 a share and reported earnings
and sales for the period that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinera&#8217;s Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinera Corp. plunged 36 percent to $7.95. The maker of
high-speed computer networking equipment forecast adjusted per-
share earnings in the fourth quarter of 5 cents at most, falling
short of estimates for 9 cents. The company also said Jagdeep Singh, its executive chairman, is resigning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stifel Nicolaus  Co. equity analyst Sanjiv Wadhwani cut
Infinera to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other makers of fiber-optic equipment fell, with JDS
Uniphase Corp. retreating 6 percent to $11.40 and Oclaro Inc.
tumbling 16 percent to $14.09. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software company,
slipped 2.8 percent to $25.10 after the company said Chief
Software Architect Ray Ozzie, an executive once considered an
heir to co-founder Bill Gates, will step down. The announcement
marks the third resignation of a senior executive in less than
five months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware Tumbles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware Inc. tumbled 6.7 percent to $73.12. The biggest
maker of programs that let computers run multiple operating
systems reported third-quarter total deferred revenue of $1.51
billion, falling short of some estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system upgrade at NYSE Euronext&#8217;s electronic Arca stock
market triggered what appeared to be a 9.6 percent plunge
yesterday in an exchange-traded fund that tracks the SP 500, a
drop that would have erased $7.9 billion from one of the most
popular securities in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data published by the electronic venue at 4:15 p.m. New
York time showed the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust at $106.46, compared
with its opening level of $117.74. The prices were later voided
and the closing price updated to $118.54, up 0.7 percent,
exchange officials said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading of put options on U.S.
technology stocks surged to 7.4 times the four-week average,
with almost half of the volume coming from a single wager the
shares will pare their 19 percent rally since August in the next
two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 180,000 puts to sell the Technology Select Sector
SPDR exchange-traded fund changed hands as of 4 p.m. in New
York, 82 times the number of calls to buy. The ETF that tracks
companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. lost 1.8
percent to $23.82. The biggest trade was in a &#8220;butterfly&#8221;
strategy involving 80,000 December contracts that pay off the
most if the fund falls to $22 before expiration on Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a sign of pessimism in the technology
sector,&#8221; said Caitlin Duffy, an equity options analyst at
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group Inc., in
an interview. &#8220;The butterfly spread is a large volume position
and it may or may not be a hedge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors bought protection today after the profit estimate
from Apple, the world&#8217;s largest technology company by market
value, missed estimates and International Business Machines
Corp., the biggest computer-services provider, posted a drop in
new contracts. Technology companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index rose 19 percent through yesterday after falling to an
eight-week low on Aug. 31, propelled by gains of 30 percent from
8 of 76 companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s butterfly spread trade involved an investor selling
40,000 of the ETF&#8217;s December $22 puts while buying 20,000 each
of the December $21 and $23 puts, according to Duffy. The
strategy breaks even around $22.93, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg, and pays the most if the stock falls to $22 by
expiration. &lt;/p&gt;

Stanford" date="Oct 19, 2010  4:23 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-19/coca-cola-earnings-increase-8-4-beating-analysts-estimates.html"><headline>Coca-Cola Earnings Increase 8.4%, Beating Analysts'' Estimates</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, boosted third-quarter profit by 8.4 percent
after winning more customers overseas and increasing North
American sales volume for the second quarter in a row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income advanced to $2.06 billion, or 88 cents a share,
the Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
some items, profit was 92 cents, compared with the 89-cent
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company also
said it may repurchase $2 billion of its shares this year, up
from the $1.5 billion announced previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes in the Eurasia and Africa group grew 12 percent,
making it the fastest-growing unit, as Coca-Cola launched new
drinks in India and Russia. Coca-Cola, led by Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent, also boosted North American sales volume 2
percent, the second such increase since 2007. North American
volume dropped 2 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stabilization in North America is a sign consumers
are willing to make impulse purchases of soft drinks again,&#8221;
Philip Gorham, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago, said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;It shows the
environment is beginning to thaw.&#8221; Gorham rates the shares as
&#8220;fairly valued.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 34 cents to $60.34 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. That compared with a 1 percent
drop in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Consumer Staples Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s sales rose to $8.43 billion, beating the
average of analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Global
sales by drink volume grew 5 percent, driven by brand Coca-Cola.
That compared with a 4 percent drop in the same quarter last
year. China posted 12 percent volume growth while Japan grew 11
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2 percent volume gain in North America matched that
unit&#8217;s gain in the second quarter as the unit reconfigures
package sizes, such as adding 99-cent bottles, and pricing
strategies amid high unemployment. Sales for the unit grew 2
percent while operating income increased 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the depths of the U.S. financial crisis in 2009,
Coca-Cola and its distributors invested $2.5 billion in
marketing and supply chain improvements, Kent said. They will
invest even more in 2010, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to waste this crisis,&#8221; Kent, 57, said in
a telephone interview today. &#8220;The brand metrics of Coca-Cola
brands have never been better in North America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s third-quarter profit was $1.9 billion, or 81
cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rose to the
highest in almost six months in New York trading after the
company reported profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates and said
the cost of flawed mortgages and new capital rules won&#8217;t be
significant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares gained $3.02, or 2 percent, to $156.72 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m., the highest
price since April 29. Third-quarter net income fell to $1.9
billion, or $2.98 a share, exceeding the $2.29 per share average
estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies and
commodities, known as FICC, surpassed results at JPMorgan Chase
 Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., even after
declining 14 percent from the second quarter. Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, who led the firm to record earnings
last year, is navigating through a business slowdown and trying
to burnish Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation after settling a fraud
lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s lining itself up for what should be a good
performance in a recovering environment,&#8221; said Brad Hintz at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., who was named the top analyst
covering brokerage firms in a survey of fund managers by
Institutional Investor magazine this year. &#8220;We&#8217;re probably at
the low point for Goldman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FICC business, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest source of
revenue, fell 37 percent from a year earlier to $3.77 billion.
The business, known as FICC, beat Hintz&#8217;s $3.3 billion estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities-trading revenue of $1.86 billion climbed 53
percent from the previous quarter, which included losses on
derivatives. The figure exceeded Hintz&#8217;s $1.33 billion estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Street underestimated fixed income, but fixed income
wasn&#8217;t great,&#8221; Hintz said. &#8220;The story for the quarter was that
equity rebounded from a very dismal Q2, the bad derivatives
quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told analysts on a
conference call that the firm has enough capital and liquidity
to exceed new international requirements imposed by the so-
called Basel III framework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new rules, which haven&#8217;t taken effect yet, the
bank would have had about $59 billion of Tier 1 common equity at
the end of June and about $750 billion of risk-weighted assets,
Viniar estimated, beating the requirement that banks hold Tier 1
common equity equal to 7 percent of risk-weighted assets. He
said that the ratio would rise to 11 percent by the end of 2012,
assuming earnings continue to add to capital and some
derivatives and securitization trades, which would require more
capital under the new rules, are wound down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank financial-regulation legislation signed into
law by President Barack Obama in July limits banks&#8217; ability to
trade their own capital, known as proprietary trading, and
requires portions of the derivatives market to be handled on
exchanges. One of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s proprietary-trading units,
known as principal strategies, has already been shut down,
Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s potential losses from faulty mortgages
aren&#8217;t large because the firm played a minor role in creating
such loans as well as in packaging them into securities, Viniar
told analysts today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home loans packaged into mortgage-backed securities in the
years leading up to the 2008 credit crisis are being challenged
by investors and government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, sometimes requiring banks to buy them back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fluid&#8217; Situation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a very fluid and evolving situation, but we really
are pretty small,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;We just don&#8217;t view our
exposure as being large in the context of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern that the costs of such mortgage put-backs will
increase after faulty foreclosure paperwork has led several U.S.
lenders to stop seizing homes and sparked an investigation by
all 50 state attorneys general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 8, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Litton Loan Servicing LP unit
said that it suspended some home-loan foreclosures as it
completes a review of procedures. Litton has 23,000 mortgages in
the foreclosure process, Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While certain process issues were identified as part of
the review to date, Litton believes the underlying foreclosure
decisions were warranted,&#8221; Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported
a $7.3 billion loss earlier today that the company said was
caused by new federal rules limiting fees on consumer accounts
and credit cards. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company
said yesterday it would resume foreclosures after an Oct. 8 halt
to review its procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Shift &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s results demonstrate a shift in how Goldman Sachs
makes money as the firm derived 69 percent of revenue from
fixed-income and equities trading in the first nine months of
the year compared with 77 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut the size of its average value-at-risk
during the quarter, a measure of how much the firm could lose
trading in a single day, to $121 million. That&#8217;s the lowest
level in almost four years and less than half the record set in
the second quarter of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from investment banking, which includes fees for
advice on takeovers as well as underwriting stock and bond
offerings, surged to $1.12 billion in the quarter, up 22 percent
from the previous quarter and 24 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the No. 1 ranked adviser on mergers and
acquisitions this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The firm&#8217;s advisory revenue increased to $496 million in the
quarter from $472 million in the prior quarter and $325 million
in the year-earlier period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from debt underwriting rose to $335 million from
$223 million in the prior quarter, while equity underwriting
revenue gained to $288 million from $222 million in the second
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, declined
the most in five months in New York trading after a drop in new
contracts overshadowed an improved financial forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services signings fell 7 percent to $11 billion in the
third quarter, Armonk, New York-based IBM said yesterday in a
statement, the third straight quarterly drop in new contracts.
While companies increased spending on IBM&#8217;s software and
hardware, such as storage computers, they&#8217;re holding back on
large outsourcing projects in the aftermath of the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.40 a share, the third time it raised 2010 earnings guidance
this year. The company also reported earnings and sales for the
period that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors focus on the service business because it accounts
for almost 60 percent of IBM&#8217;s annual sales and more than 40
percent of its profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are likely to key in on IT-services signings
being a bit below expectations,&#8221; said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, who recommends buying the
shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s a key measure of deal activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company signed a $1.8 billion outsourcing deal with ABN
Amro Group NV on Oct. 8. If that had occurred in the third
quarter, services signings would have been $12.7 billion, IBM
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell $4.80, or 3.4 percent, to $138.03 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest drop since
May 20. Earlier this month, the shares topped their record
closing high of $137.88 set in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Difficult to Predict&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to predict precisely when these deals
will close, and eight days is not going to make any difference
in the yield to this contract,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said yesterday on a conference call. The company has
a &#8220;strong deal list&#8221; for outsourcing signings this quarter, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the quarter increased 12 percent to $3.59
billion, or $2.82 a share, from $3.21 billion, or $2.40, a year
earlier. Analysts predicted $2.75, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales climbed 3 percent to $24.3 billion, topping analysts&#8217;
average projection of $24.1 billion. It&#8217;s the third consecutive
period during which all business units -- hardware, software and
both services segments -- posted sales gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new full-year profit forecast also exceeded the $11.30
average of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is aiming to almost
double operating earnings to $20 a share in the next five years.
Software will make up about half of profit by then, the company
said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has invested in analytics software and services that
help predict trends, as well as cloud computing, which helps
customers save money by letting them store and access data via
the Internet, rather than from their own servers. Palmisano also
has been investing in his Smarter Planet initiative, based on
the concept that infrastructure, such as buildings or roads, can
be equipped with digital sensors, which in turn will make them
more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three technologies, along with sales from emerging
markets, will add $20 billion in revenue by 2015, the company
said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions in the same period. He announced seven deals last
quarter, including the $1.7 billion purchase of Netezza Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Oct 19, 2010  3:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-19/goldman-cuts-trading-risks-to-lowest-since-06-ahead-of-new-capital-rules.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Cuts Size of Trading Risks to Lowest Since 2006</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s third-
quarter trading risks were the lowest in almost four years as
clients did less business and the firm conserved capital and
liquid assets in anticipation of new international requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-risk, a measure of the average sum the company
expects it could lose from trading, dropped to $121 million in
the three months ending Sept. 30 as the firm took smaller risks
in stock, currency and commodity markets, Goldman Sachs reported
today. The third-quarter risk is less than half the record set
in last year&#8217;s second quarter, when it reached $245 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The world is still not a very safe place,&#8221; David Viniar,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told analysts on a
conference call when asked why the firm held an average $173
billion in cash and highly liquid instruments. &#8220;The same reason
our risk is so low and our balance sheet really hasn&#8217;t grown --
there&#8217;s been no call on it because there&#8217;s been very, very
little activity from our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s decline in risk-taking coincided with a
drop in revenue from trading stocks, bonds, currencies and
commodities, the New York-based firm&#8217;s biggest source of income.
Third-quarter trading revenue fell to $5.63 billion, down 35
percent from the same period last year, the bank said. Average
value at risk fell 42 percent from $208 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said
he was surprised to see that the firm didn&#8217;t take bigger risks
in fixed-income given that prices for most bonds improved in the
quarter. The firm said value-at-risk, known as VaR, related to
interest rates was little changed at $88 million compared with
$87 million in the prior quarter and $159 million a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Why Would It Be?&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Was there any secret that rates were dropping and that
credit spreads were coming in? No,&#8221; Hintz said. &#8220;So why would
it be that VaR was held down?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, 55, confirmed on today&#8217;s call that the firm shut
down a group of traders that made bets with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own
capital, known as proprietary trading. The unit, called Goldman
Sachs Principal Strategies, was closed to comply with new U.S.
regulations that aim to curb risk-taking by banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s accurate that our GSPS business, which is the one
walled-off proprietary trading business, is essentially wound
down,&#8221; Viniar said. Before making decisions on other units
&#8220;we&#8217;re waiting to see how the rules unfold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar also said he thinks the firm has adequate capital
and liquidity, or easy-to-sell assets, to meet new requirements
that will be imposed by international regulators under the so-
called Basel III regime. He estimated that the firm&#8217;s Tier One
common equity would have equaled almost 8 percent of the
company&#8217;s risk-weighted assets at the end of the second quarter
under the new calculations, beating the 7 percent requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would suspect that as these rules get more and more
clarified over the next several years, we would be in a position
to give more capital back,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to pin
down an exact date though.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s potential
losses from faulty mortgages aren&#8217;t large because the firm
played a small role in originating and packaging such loans,
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a very fluid and evolving situation, but we really
are pretty small,&#8221; Viniar, 55, said today on a conference call
with analysts. &#8220;We just don&#8217;t view our exposure there as being
large in the context of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home loans packaged into mortgage-backed securities in the
years leading up to the 2008 credit crisis are being challenged
by investors and government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, sometimes requiring banks to buy them back.
Concern about the potential costs of such mortgage put-backs has
grown after problems with foreclosure paperwork led several U.S.
lenders to stop seizing homes and sparked an investigation by
all 50 state attorneys general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litton Loan Servicing LP, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s mortgage-
servicing unit, said on Oct. 8 that it was suspending some
foreclosures to review its procedures. Viniar said today that
Litton has 23,000 mortgages in the foreclosure process and is
undertaking an &#8220;extensive review&#8221; of its procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While certain process issues were identified as part of
the review to date, Litton believes the underlying foreclosure
decisions were warranted,&#8221; Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar told analysts that Goldman Sachs, based in New York,
played a minor role in underwriting mortgage-backed securities
and had an even smaller part in creating the original loans
contained in the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think most of the risk is as an originator, and even
as an underwriter we were not one of the biggest players, so we
don&#8217;t think our exposure&#8217;s that big,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to settle
fraud allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, and acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; in providing
&#8220;incomplete information&#8221; in marketing materials for a 2007
mortgage-linked security. The settlement was the largest ever
paid to the SEC by a Wall Street firm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European stocks fell the most in two
weeks, led by basic-resources and technology shares, after
China raised its benchmark interest rate and Apple Inc.&#8217;s
earnings forecast missed analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto Group and Xstrata Plc fell more than 3 percent as
the People&#8217;s Bank of China increased its lending and deposit
rates for the first time since 2007. ARM Holdings Plc, the
designer of chips that power Apple&#8217;s iPhone, sank 2.6 percent.
Banks limited declines as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. reported earnings excluding one-time items that
topped analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.5 percent to 265.24 as of
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the biggest drop since Oct. 4.
The gauge has climbed 2.1 percent this month, closing at the
highest level since April yesterday, amid speculation that the
Federal Reserve will announce further plans to stimulate
economic growth at its November meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s action by the PBOC will likely have a negative
impact on risk assets worldwide,&#8221; Pierre Lapointe, a global
macro strategist at Brockhouse  Cooper Inc., which manages $500
million in Montreal, wrote in a report. &#8220;Chinese monetary
policy was inappropriately expansionist given the strength of
the country&#8217;s recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National benchmark indexes declined in 15 of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.&#8217;s FTSE 100 and France&#8217;s CAC 40
slid 0.7 percent. Germany&#8217;s DAX fell 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining Companies Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto, the world&#8217;s third-largest mining company,
dropped 3.2 percent to 3,948 pence. Xstrata slid 4.4 percent to
1,248.5 pence. A gauge of basic-resource shares retreated 2.5
percent, the biggest decline among 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx 600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, the biggest consumer of copper, said the one-year
deposit rate will increase to 2.5 percent from 2.25 percent and
the lending rate will increase to 5.56 percent from 5.31
percent, effective tomorrow. China&#8217;s inflation quickened to 3.5
percent in August, highlighting overheating risks that have
prompted the government to curb credit and clamp down on the
real-estate market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM fell 2.6 percent to 388.7 pence. Apple forecast profit
will be about $4.80 a share in the fourth quarter, which
includes the yearend holiday shopping season. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg had predicted profit of $5.03. Apple has exceeded
analysts&#8217; earnings projections every quarter since at least
2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 15 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have announced
results since Oct. 7, 10 have beaten analyst estimates for per-
share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the
U.S., 39 of the 47 Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index companies that
have announced results in the same period have topped forecasts,
the data show. Analysts predict 24 percent growth in third-
quarter profit from a year earlier for SP 500 companies, a
fourth straight increase, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings are taking centre stage and investors are
ignoring background noise a bit,&#8221; Monika Rosen, Vienna-based
head of research at UniCredit Private Bank, said on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s Countdown with Maryam Nemazee. &#8220;If they manage to
give a better outlook for the current quarter then the market is
prepared to view the glass as being half full.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porsche SE preferred shares slumped 8.7 percent to 38.97
euros after Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn said Europe&#8217;s largest automaker may put its merger
with the producer of the 911 sports car on hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Drag On&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It can&#8217;t be ruled out that the legal proceedings may drag
on for some time to come until a final decision is reached,&#8221;
Winterkorn, who also heads Porsche&#8217;s board, said in the text of
a speech today in Stuttgart. &#8220;For that reason, the planned
merger could possibly be delayed.&#8221; VW preferred stocks slid 1.3
percent to 90.30 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks advanced as Goldman Sachs and bank of America
released third-quarter results. Deutsche Bank AG, Germany&#8217;s
largest lender, gained 1.8 percent to 42.20 euros. UBS AG, the
biggest Swiss bank, rose 1.7 percent to 17.58 francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said banks will
have until 2015 to fully implement rules on how much cash and
liquid securities they must hold to gird against a funding
shortage in a crisis. The committee also said it would review
the rules to make sure they aren&#8217;t too onerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SKF AB jumped 10 to 168 kronor, the highest level since at
least 1989. The world&#8217;s largest maker of ball bearings reported
third-quarter net income of 1.39 billion kronor ($208 million),
topping the 1.18 billion-krona average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, SKF agreed to buy Lincoln Industrial Corp., the
100-year-old maker of lubrication pumps, for $1 billion to tap
demand for equipment in North America and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The euro is unlikely to climb much
further because a stronger currency will reopen divisions
between nations and put political pressure on the European
Central Bank, according to JPMorgan Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region&#8217;s economy will suffer as euro appreciation
exposes the gap in competitiveness between nations such as
Germany and Portugal, said Nigel James Rayment, London-based
manager of JPMorgan&#8217;s Euro Managed Currency Plus Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re already in the realms of the euro being over-
valued, and the question is how sustainable that is,&#8221; said
Rayment, whose fund is the third-best performer among peers
tracked by Bloomberg. &#8220;There are many stresses and structural
issues within Europe itself. We would argue that currency
strength is effective monetary tightening, which would put more
pressure on the ECB, and ultimately the euro will struggle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European divisions and a stall by the euro may occur as
soon as this year or the start of 2011, Rayment said in a
telephone interview yesterday. The currency has strengthened as
much as 12 percent against the dollar since reaching a five-week
low on Aug. 24. Investors have focused on weakness in the U.S.
economy, and deemed the euro-region&#8217;s woes were not so severe as
to lead to the breakup of the common currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index lost almost 9 percent in the same period
on expectations the Federal Reserve will restart buying
Treasuries with new money at its next meeting on Nov. 3. The
dollar is likely to remain weak after the Fed steps up such so-
called quantitative easing, Rayment said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they deliver on QE and provide the liquidity the
market is expecting, then the dollar should stay under
pressure,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.3868 as of 1:41 p.m. in
London. It reached $1.4159 on Oct. 15, the most since Jan. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Euro Managed Currency Plus Fund, co-managed by
Robert Stewart, head of currencies at the asset manager,
returned 12.6 percent this year. The UBS Currency Absolute
Return Strategy handed investors 26.1 percent and the DB
Platinum FX Concepts Global Currency returned 15.5 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Oct 19, 2010 10:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-19/ozzie-s-departure-from-microsoft-fuels-concern-about-ceo-ballmer-s-bench.html"><headline>Ozzie''s Departure Fuels Concern About Microsoft''s Bench</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The departure of Ray Ozzie as
Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s chief software architect fueled concern that
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer may not be doing enough to
nurture would-be successors and executives who can set strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozzie, 54, joined the company in 2005 and was later named
as one of the two executives who would chart vision as co-
Founder Bill Gates stepped away from day-to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced the resignation of entertainment chief
Robbie Bach in May, and Office division head Stephen Elop said
last month he was leaving to become CEO of Nokia Oyj. Ballmer
needs to show he has a deep bench of up-and-coming executives
who can help him plan for the long term or run Microsoft in his
absence, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When multiple people depart from a given manager, at a
certain point it raises questions on the manager,&#8221; said
Gartenberg, who is based in Teaneck, New Jersey. &#8220;Once again,
there&#8217;s an empty seat at Ballmer&#8217;s table.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozzie won&#8217;t be replaced because the company has enough
leaders in place, Ballmer said yesterday in an e-mail on the
company&#8217;s website. Ozzie will be &#8220;on board&#8221; for a while before
leaving, Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 60 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $25.22 at 10:49
a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Ozzie leaving, Microsoft Chief Research and Strategy
Officer Craig Mundie will probably take a more significant role
in planning technology strategy for the future, Gartenberg said.
Plans for many of Microsoft&#8217;s products are also increasingly
laid by individual business groups, and executives such as Steve Sinofsky, president of the Windows division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozzie&#8217;s Legacy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Ballmer named Kurt DelBene to replace
Elop. Andy Lees was named president for mobile and Don Mattrick
for entertainment, replacing Bach. The quality of the executives
reporting to Ballmer varies, said David Smith, also an analyst
at Gartner, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozzie took the lead in pushing Microsoft into Internet-
based software. In a 2005 memo, he told executives the company
needs to respond to the shift or &#8220;our business as we know it is
at risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozzie has played a less prominent role more recently. He
didn&#8217;t speak to analysts and investors at the company&#8217;s annual
analyst meeting in July, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His departure didn&#8217;t surprise some analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to have a huge impact,&#8221; Smith
said. &#8220;He was trying to fill some pretty big shoes -- you don&#8217;t
just walk in and become the next Bill Gates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cultural Mismatch&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozzie, who had done much of his work in smaller companies,
may have found it difficult to exert influence at Microsoft,
said Paul Saffo, a managing director at Discern Inc., a San
Francisco-based investment research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pairing was a &#8220;cultural mismatch,&#8221; Saffo said,
because Ozzie was used to trying out ideas quickly and cutting
his losses if it didn&#8217;t work, a tall order at Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was surprised he went to Microsoft,&#8221; said Saffo, who
has known Ozzie since the 1980s. &#8220;I was surprised he stayed as a
long as he did. I&#8217;m not surprised that eventually there was
organ rejection here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffo said Ozzie leaves behind important accomplishments,
including getting the company to pursue so-called cloud
computing, which involves delivering software and computing
capabilities via the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, he unveiled Microsoft&#8217;s Azure cloud software for
storing and running customers&#8217; programs in Microsoft&#8217;s own data
centers. With the work on Azure shifted to Microsoft&#8217;s server
and tools business, under President Bob Muglia, Ozzie may have
found his work at Microsoft was done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What else is he going to do?&#8221; said Dan Warmenhoven,
chairman of NetApp Inc. &#8220;He&#8217;s smart as hell, but he&#8217;s not really
a businessman. He&#8217;s a technologist. He&#8217;s probably looking for
the next big thing, and didn&#8217;t see it there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has hired
Clemens Grafe as its chief Russia economist, according to two
people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grafe left his role as chief economist in Moscow for UBS AG
last week, said Richard Marton, a London-based spokesman for
UBS, in an e-mail. Goldman&#8217;s press service declined to comment.
Grafe&#8217;s mobile phone was switched off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will replace Rory MacFarquhar, who was Goldman&#8217;s head
economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States
in Moscow until March, the people said. MacFarquhar moved to the
U.S. Treasury Department as an adviser on international issues,
spokesman Andrew Williams said March 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former lecturer at the University of London&#8217;s Birbeck
College, Grafe joined UBS in 2005. He worked on Russia issues
for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and on
the International Monetary Fund-based stabilization program for
Russia throughout the 1990s, according to a biography compiled
by U.S. Milken Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the most profitable securities firm on Wall
Street, left Russia after the country defaulted on $40 billion
of domestic debt in 1998. The New York-based firm reopened its
Moscow office in 2007 and named Christopher Barter its sole
Russia chief in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Reinhard Cluse will take over Grafe&#8217;s
responsibility for Russia, Morton said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
biggest securities firm by revenue, said profit dropped 40
percent, beating analysts&#8217; estimates, as lower costs and higher
investment-banking revenue cushioned a decline in trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income fell to $1.9 billion, or $2.98 a
share, from $3.19 billion, or $5.25, a year earlier, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. The average estimate
of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $2.29 a share, with
predictions ranging from $1.81 to $3.09. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from trading fixed-income, currencies and
commodities surpassed results at JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of
America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., even after declining 14
percent from the second quarter. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, who led the firm to record earnings last year, is
navigating through a business slowdown and trying to burnish
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation after settling a fraud lawsuit from
the Securities and Exchange Commission in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s lining itself up for what should be a good
performance in a recovering environment,&#8221; said Brad Hintz at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., who was named the top analyst
covering brokerage firms in a survey of fund managers by
Institutional Investor magazine this year. &#8220;We&#8217;re probably at
the low point for Goldman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. set aside
$13.1 billion for compensation and benefits in the first nine
months of the year, down 21 percent from a year earlier, as
revenue fell 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount, equal to 43 percent of revenue, is enough to
pay each of the New York-based firm&#8217;s 35,400 employees $370,706
for nine months&#8217; work. That&#8217;s down from an average $527,192 for
the firm&#8217;s 31,700 workers a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007,
came under pressure last year from politicians and shareholders
to reduce bonuses following the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression. The company cut its full-year ratio of
compensation to revenue to 35.8 percent, the lowest since the
company went public in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They recognize that the world has changed,&#8221; said Brad Hintz at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., who was named the top
analyst covering brokerage firms in a survey of fund managers by
Institutional Investor magazine this year. &#8220;The only way to
improve your return on assets is to control compensation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year to pay employees, with most of the money
awarded in the form of year-end bonuses. Goldman Sachs reserved
$3.83 billion for compensation in the third quarter, or 43
percent of revenue, equal to the proportion in the first half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. reported that
it set aside 39 percent of its investment-bank&#8217;s revenue to pay
workers in the division for the first nine months of the year,
up from 38 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expense at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank fell 10 percent
to $7.88 billion from $8.79 billion. That&#8217;s equal to $298,866
for each of the unit&#8217;s 26,373 workers at the end of September,
down from $353,834 on average for the division&#8217;s 24,828
employees a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following compares compensation at Goldman Sachs and
JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;

Inc. and Dell Inc., credit default swaps show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Brazil debt against non-payment for
five years fell to 89 basis points on Oct. 13, the lowest level
since May 2008 and 6 below the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index that includes Goldman Sachs and Dell,
according to CMA DataVision. Brazil&#8217;s BBB- rating from Standard
 Poor&#8217;s is four levels below Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most
profitable securities firm, and three underneath Dell, the
third-biggest maker of personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bankers forecast Latin America&#8217;s largest economy
will grow more than 7 percent this year for the first time since
1986, and more than twice the pace of expansions in the U.S. and
Japan. International investors poured a record $41 billion into
developing-nation bonds this year, driving down yields in
Brazil, China and other emerging countries, according to
research firm EPFR Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a structural change as the credit profile of most
emerging-markets, including Brazil, is improving,&#8221; said Edgardo Sternberg, an emerging-market debt strategist at Boston-based
Loomis Sayles  Co., which manages about $140 billion in assets.
&#8220;There will be more upgrades down the road.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, which raised Brazil to an
investment-grade ranking of Baa3 in September 2009, said this
month it may revise the country&#8217;s rating as soon as March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBB+ Rating &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between Brazil&#8217;s default swaps and the investment
grade index on Oct. 13 was the biggest since September 2008,
according to CMA. It cost 42 basis points, or 0.42 percentage
point, more to insure debt sold by New York-based Goldman Sachs
against default than Brazilian bonds and 24 more to protect
securities from Round Rock, Texas-based Dell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is rated A1 by Moody&#8217;s and A by SP. Dell is
rated A2 by Moody&#8217;s and A- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs in New York,
and Dell spokesman David Frink declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s default swaps imply a ratings increase of two
levels, putting the rating at BBB+, according to Brown Brothers
Harriman  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s rating outlook was raised on June 28 to positive
from stable by Fitch Ratings, which cited the country&#8217;s &#8220;growth
dynamics&#8221; and &#8220;prudent&#8221; policies. Fitch rates Brazil BBB-,
the lowest investment grade and in line with rankings from SP
and Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Safe Bet&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s will review Brazil&#8217;s rating when it has access to
gross domestic product data next year, Mauro Leos, a senior
analyst at the New York-based company, said at an event in Sao
Paulo on Oct. 5. Sebastian Briozzo, an analyst with SP in
Buenos Aires, didn&#8217;t return a telephone call seeking comment
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The markets are pricing that it&#8217;s a pretty safe bet that
the upgrades will continue for Brazil,&#8221; said Win Thin, a senior
currency strategist at Brown Brothers in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratings companies will likely delay raising Brazil&#8217;s
ranking until the winner of this month&#8217;s presidential election
unveils a fiscal plan, said Henry Stipp, a fund manager at
London-based Threadneedle Asset Management, which manages about
$98 billion of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose Serra, a former Sao Paulo governor, is challenging
Dilma Rousseff, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&#8217;s handpicked
successor, in an Oct. 31 run-off vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rousseff, who would be Brazil&#8217;s first female president, has
vowed to maintain the social programs and the economic growth
that has lifted 21 million people out of poverty since 2003. She
said in August that promoting spending cuts was a &#8220;crime.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serra carried out spending cuts when he was governor of Sao
Paulo, Brazil&#8217;s wealthiest and biggest state. He has pledged to
cut government payrolls and renegotiate prices on public
contracts, helping offset plans to boost the minimum wage and
payouts to pensioners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lula&#8217;s government boosted spending 18.2 percent in July
from a year earlier, helping push the budget deficit to 3.4
percent of gross domestic product from 1.2 percent in October
2008. Brazil&#8217;s gross debt equaled 60 percent of GDP last year,
compared with 38 percent in Mexico and 46 percent in Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They should wait for after the election since we don&#8217;t
know what the policies are going to be in Brazil and the fiscal
situation is deteriorating,&#8221; Threadneedle&#8217;s Stipp said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk associated with Brazilian bonds is tumbling as
record-low interest rates in the U.S. and Europe boosts demand
for emerging-market assets. Policy makers in Brazil raised the
benchmark interest rate to 10.75 percent from a record low of
8.75 percent in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments and companies in developing countries borrowed
$196 billion from July to September, the most for any quarter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil may consider
selling 100-year bonds after Mexico issued $1 billion of the
securities in the longest-maturity offering by a Latin American
country, Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin said Oct. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s Oct. 5 sale of the so-called century bonds signals
a &#8220;bubble&#8221; in credit markets, RBC Capital Markets said in a
report two days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dollar-denominated bond market, yields on Brazil&#8217;s
4.875 percent securities due in 2021 have declined 19 basis
points in the past month to 3.76 percent. Yields on Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s 5.375 percent coupon due in 2020 have dropped 22 basis
points to 4.69 percent, while yields on Dell&#8217;s 5.875 percent
bonds due in 2019 declined 11 basis points to 3.79 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market debt is &#8220;very, very expensive,&#8221; said
Andrew Brenner, managing director at Guggenheim Capital Markets
LLC, a New-York based brokerage for institutional investors.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no justification for that. Brazil offers zero value in
dollar bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real tumbled 1.4 percent to 1.6973 per dollar today.
Finance Minister Guido Mantega boosted the tax on foreigners&#8217;
fixed-income investments to 6 percent yesterday, two weeks after
doubling it to 4 percent, to stem a currency rally. The
government is also raising the tax on foreign investors&#8217; margin
deposits for futures markets to 6 percent from 0.38 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real has gained 36 percent since the end of 2008,
extending its world-beating rally to 108 percent since Lula took
office in 2003. Mantega said last month that governments around
the world are engaging in a &#8220;currency war&#8221; as they attempt to
stem capital inflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This currency war needs to be deactivated,&#8221; Mantega told
reporters yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Brazil&#8217;s interbank rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose one basis point today to 11.29 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Brazilian dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed one basis point to
180, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to place your money somewhere and there&#8217;s an
adjustment of risk premium in the markets,&#8221; said Paul Biszko,
an emerging-markets strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
Toronto. &#8220;There&#8217;s a flush of liquidity into Brazil. It has been
a phenomenon now in which nobody assesses the sovereign risk as
what the rating agencies do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. may have lost a
client&#8217;s business and face a lawsuit after Taiwan&#8217;s Wintek Corp.
objected to an analyst&#8217;s report that said investors should sell
the company&#8217;s shares as it was poised to lose market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wintek will &#8220;end global depositary receipt cooperation
with JPMorgan&#8221; because of an Oct. 19 research report by Taipei-
based analyst Narci Chang, the company said in a filing to the
Taiwan Stock Exchange yesterday. The company, which makes
components for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad and iPhone, may take legal
action against Chang, the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 3.9 percent to NT$47.60 as of 9:17 a.m. in
Taipei and has slid 11 percent since Oct. 18, after Chang&#8217;s Oct.
19 report said it&#8217;s &#8220;an ideal time to take profit in the
shares.&#8221; Display makers AU Optronics Corp. and Chimei Innolux
Corp. are a &#8220;serious threat&#8221; to Wintek because they&#8217;re eroding
orders from Apple, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The analyst report said new players will grab market
share, but this assumption couldn&#8217;t be accompanied by any
evidence,&#8221; Jay Huang, a spokesman for Taichung, Taiwan-based
Wintek, said in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;Without this
event, I think we still would have cooperated with them to
conduct the GDR offering.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wintek&#8217;s board on Oct. 13 approved plans to sell as much as
$387 million of global depositary receipts, the company said in
an exchange filing that day. No bookrunner has been appointed,
Huang said. JPMorgan was the sole bookrunner and global
coordinator for the Taiwanese company&#8217;s global depositary
receipt sale in April, according to a prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chang&#8217;s &#8220;underweight&#8221; recommendation on the stock makes
JPMorgan the only one of 16 brokerages surveyed by Bloomberg to
have a &#8220;sell&#8221; equivalent rating on Wintek shares. Twelve
analysts recommend investors &#8220;buy,&#8221; three say &#8220;hold&#8221; and one
has suspended coverage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanghai may establish a holiday

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Thomas Black" date="Oct 20, 2010  4:32 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-20/coca-cola-femsa-gains-favor-with-bill-gates-after-parent-sheds-beer-unit.html"><headline>Gates Favors Coca-Cola Femsa After Parent Sheds Beer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the largest
Coca-Cola bottler by volume, is outpacing parent Fomento
Economico Mexicano SAB by the widest margin in five years as
Bill Gates and other investors seek more exposure to developing
nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa had risen 15.5 percent this year in Mexican
trading, compared with 6.4 percent for Femsa, also owner of
convenience-store chain Oxxo. Femsa has fallen short since Chief
Executive Officer Jose Antonio Fernandez sold its Mexican
brewing unit to Heineken NV this year in exchange for a 20
percent stake in the Amsterdam-based beermaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In shedding the century-old family beer business, Fernandez
made Femsa less focused on developing countries, making the
bottler a better prospect for investors targeting faster-growing
economies, said Vontobel Asset Management analyst Donny Kranson.
Fernandez, who runs both companies, said the sale of the beer
business to Heineken will allow Femsa to focus on building out
Oxxo and the bottler operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Femsa beforehand was pretty much a pure-play, emerging-
market company,&#8221; said Kranson, whose New York-based firm
manages about $10 billion and owns shares of Femsa and its
Mexican cola bottler. &#8220;From an emerging-market perspective,
Femsa is now less attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bill Gates Foundation and Cascade Investment LLC, which
manages money for billionaire Gates, bought the bottler&#8217;s U.S.
shares in May and June to boost combined holdings to 28 percent,
according to regulatory filings. Gates failed to add to his 13
percent stake in Femsa&#8217;s U.S. shares over that period. Michael Larson, who runs both firms from Kirkland, Washington, didn&#8217;t
respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa had a market value of about $14.7 billion.
Femsa&#8217;s was $19.2 billion, which includes a 54 percent stake of
Coca-Cola Femsa valued at $7.9 billion, a 20 percent stake in
Heineken valued at $6.1 billion and the Oxxo chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan Fonseca, chief of investor relations for Femsa, said
he recognizes the parent company is trading below the value of
the sum of its parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is not our role to suggest what the right valuation
should be for our company,&#8221; Fonseca said in an e-mailed
response to questions. &#8220;That is up to investors to decide.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockstep Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa and Femsa had traded in lockstep for the
past five years through the end of 2009, with a rate of return
that differed by only 4 percentage points as the stocks both
more than tripled. This year, Coca-Cola Femsa has risen 9
percentage points more than its parent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Femsa rose 16 centavos to 66.66 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 4:01 p.m. New York time. Coca-Cola Femsa fell 1.66
pesos to 99.41 pesos. Deutsche Bank AG analyst Jose Yordan cut
his recommendation on Coca-Cola Femsa to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221;
in a report today on concern over increased costs for sugar and
corn sweetener. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa is outperforming its parent because the
company probably will grow through acquisitions and partnerships
with the Coca-Cola Co., said David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen
Advisers LLC in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, an investment firm
that manages about $1.8 billion. Coca-Cola Femsa became the
world&#8217;s largest franchise for the beverage after Coca-Cola Co.
bought its North American bottling operations this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, is likely to choose the
Mexican bottler as a partner to run the North American
operations, according to Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Carlos Laboy. The two formed a partnership to sell non-carbonated
drinks in Latin America with the purchase of Mexican juice
producer Jugos del Valle in 2007. They also may expand the
partnership by agreeing to buy Grupo Industrias Lacteas, a milk,
yogurt and juice maker in Panama, Coca-Cola Femsa said Oct. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep Trailing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Femsa will keep trailing Coca-Cola Femsa since investors
tend to apply discounts to holding companies, said Luis Miranda,
an analyst with the Mexican unit of Banco Santander SA. Femsa
trades at 25 percent less than the value of its holdings, said
Miranda, who cut his recommendation on Femsa to &#8220;hold&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; in an Oct. 5 report. He raised his recommendation for
Coca-Cola Femsa to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;hold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount may present a buying opportunity as investors
begin to realize the growth potential of Oxxo, Winters said. In
the past five years, Oxxo&#8217;s operating income has risen almost
fivefold to 4.56 billion pesos ($360 million) in 2009, while the
beer unit&#8217;s profit rose 24 percent to 5.89 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is expanding the chain in Colombia and has said
it will increase stores in Mexico to 12,000 by 2014 from about
7,300 at the end of 2009. The moves may help investors see
beyond Femsa&#8217;s holding company status, Winters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxxo&#8217;s Accomplishments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People don&#8217;t quite appreciate what a great accomplishment
Oxxo is,&#8221; Winters said. &#8220;That business in the long term could
have legs beyond Mexico.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Femsa reported net income of 29.2 billion pesos in the
second quarter, an increase of more than tenfold, because of a
26.5 billion peso gain from the Heineken transaction. Coca-Cola
Femsa had net income of 2.48 billion, a 15 percent increase from
a year ago. The companies are both scheduled to report third-
quarter results this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. reduced its
arbitration claim against state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela SA by at least $5 billion as it seeks compensation for
the nationalization of oil assets by President Hugo Chavez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, cut the amount it
seeks through international arbitration to $7 billion from $12
billion plus interest, PDVSA, as the company based in Caracas is
known, said in a preliminary notice for an upcoming bond issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may incur losses arising from our pending arbitrations
and litigation,&#8221; PDVSA said in the notice that was obtained by
Bloomberg News. &#8220;Venezuela recognizes the execution of foreign
judgments and arbitration awards, subject to certain conditions
provided for in Venezuelan laws.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez forced foreign oil producers into joint ventures as
minority partners in 2007 and is in international arbitration
with the U.S.&#8217;s Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, which rejected
revised terms. He has nationalized parts of the oil, metals,
cement and utilities industries during his 11 years in power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDVSA and Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, are
preparing responses to be filed by Oct. 25 following an
international arbitration hearing that concluded Sept. 24, PDVSA
said in the notice. PDVSA expects a ruling in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albania, the poorest country in the
Balkans, expects visa-free travel with the European Union to
provide the biggest boost to its economy in two decades, central
bank Governor Ardian Fullani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will be the most important thing that happened in
the last 20 years for Albania, its citizens and the whole
region,&#8221; Fullani, 55, said today in an interview at a business
conference in Belgrade. &#8220;No doubt this will positively impact
the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product is forecast to expand an annual 3.2
percent this year with exports driving the recovery and &#8220;good
promises&#8221; for growth next year, he said. Inflation is targeted
in a band of 2 percent to 4 percent and price growth is &#8220;under
control,&#8221; he said. The economy expanded 2.8 percent last year,
according to the International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albania, a potential candidate for EU membership, relies on
annual remittances from abroad, which equal about 15 percent of
GDP, mostly from citizens living in Italy and Greece, according
to the CIA factbook. The Adriatic Sea nation that became part of
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in April last year will gain
visa-free travel to the 27-nation bloc along with Bosnia-
Herzegovina by year&#8217;s end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy hasn&#8217;t been &#8220;too adversely affected&#8221; by
Greece&#8217;s debt crisis, Fullani, who was appointed to a seven-year
term in 2004, said. The nation had GDP per capita at $6,400 in
2009, which compares with Slovenia&#8217;s $24,000, the wealthiest
nation in the Balkans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country has lagged behind other former communist states
in east Europe in allowing competition into the formerly state-
controlled economy. It is working to improve infrastructure and
beef up corporate governance to attract more foreign investment,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banking industry is stable and well capitalized,
Fullani said. &#8220;Non-performing loans have peaked.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albania will avoid asking the IMF for assistance as
government &#8220;significantly reduced&#8221; expenditure, Fullani said.
The Washington-based lender in July forecast that Albania&#8217;s
economy will grow 2.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. and juice
maker Hansen Natural Corp. are among the top candidates for
takeovers in the consumer-products industry because of their
growth prospects, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pace of deal activity in consumer staples has picked
up,&#8221; analysts including Judy Hong said in the report, citing
the takeovers of companies including Alberto-Culver Co. and
American Safety Razor Co. They also named Lorillard Inc., the
maker of Newport cigarettes, as a potential target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are grabbing bigger shares of sales in their
markets, making them ripe for consumer-products makers seeking
expansion, according to the report. Corona, California-based
Hansen, for example, reported a 22 percent increase in revenue
in its latest quarter, bolstered by sales of Monster Energy
drinks in the U.S. and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, there have been 48 deals in the U.S. in
the beverage industry alone, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead, based in Glenview, Illinois, gained 28 cents to
$57.68 at 9:38 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading, while
Lorillard climbed 69 cents to $83.60. Hansen Natural rose 50
cents to $50.23 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives at Hansen couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached
for comment. Mead spokesman Chris Perille declined to comment,
as did Bob Bannon, a spokesman for Greensboro, North Carolina-
based Lorillard. &lt;/p&gt;

Countrywide Home Loans unit were accused of racketeering in a
lawsuit filed by two Indiana residents claiming that perjured
affidavits were used to foreclose on their home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwayne Ransom Davis and Melisa Davis filed the complaint
yesterday in federal court in Indianapolis. Their lawyer, Irwin
Levin, confirmed the filing in a phone interview. The filing
couldn&#8217;t be independently verified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants and their cohorts engaged in a pattern of
racketeering activity in which they routinely and repeatedly
prepared perjured affidavits in order to rapidly churn
foreclosures,&#8221; the couple said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender, resumed
foreclosures on Oct. 18, after a 10-day nationwide pause to
review more than 100,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our assessment shows underlying information provided as
the basis for our past foreclosure decisions is accurate,&#8221; Rick
Simon, a spokesman for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank,
said in an e-mailed statement earlier yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon was responding then to an announcement by Tom Dart,
sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, that
he will halt foreclosure evictions starting Oct. 25 unless Bank
of America and two other lenders provide him with assurances
that the proceedings are being lawfully pursued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To my knowledge, we have not seen this suit and cannot
comment on it,&#8221; Simon said of the Davis case in a later phone
interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Davis v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc., 10-cv-
01303, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Indiana
(Indianapolis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC Sued by Bank of America Over Taylor Bean Mortgage Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Insurance Deposit Corp. was sued by Bank of
America Corp. over $1.75 billion in investor losses stemming
from an alleged fraud by failed lender Taylor Bean  Whitaker
Mortgage Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC has denied claims by Bank of America against
Colonial Bank and another financial institution in receivership
that bought fake mortgages from a Taylor Bean unit, Ocala
Funding LLC, according to a complaint filed Oct. 1 in federal
court in Washington. Bank of America was the trustee for notes
issued by Ocala Funding, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocala financed Taylor Bean&#8217;s mortgages, issued debt and
used the proceeds to buy the mortgages, Bank of America said in
the complaint. Ocala then sold the notes to pay off the debt or
buy additional mortgages, according to the compliant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2000 to 2009, Taylor Bean and Colonial Bank schemed to
steal from Taylor Bean&#8217;s borrowing facilities to hide liquidity
problems, Bank of America said in its complaint. Taylor Bean&#8217;s
former chairman was accused by the U.S. in June of helping run a
more than $1.9 billion fraud scheme to deceive financial firms
and the government&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief Program by covering
up shortfalls, the Justice Department said in a statement in
June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme contributed to the failures of Colonial Bank,
which had been one of the 50 largest U.S. banks, and Taylor
Bean, once one of the largest closely held mortgage companies in
the U.S., the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Barr, an FDIC spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail
message seeking comment after regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of America v. FDIC, 10-01681, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure Fortune Buys Bugatti, Yacht, Mansions for Attorney &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Americans, the foreclosure crisis has wiped out
fortunes, bringing destitution and homelessness. For Florida
attorney David J. Stern, it has brought mansions, a Bugatti
sports car and a luxury yacht, Bloomberg News&#8217;s David McLaughlin
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida has the third-highest residential foreclosure rate
in the U.S., and Stern, 50, has made a fortune off the bust. His
foreclosure-processing business has generated hundreds of
millions of dollars in revenue preparing documents for the cases
that his law firm brings on behalf of lenders seeking to reclaim
homes from borrowers who can&#8217;t pay their mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now his business is under scrutiny, as banks suspend
foreclosures and evictions amid allegations that some home
seizures were based on fraudulent documents. Attorneys general
in every U.S. state have joined to probe foreclosure practices
generally. Stern&#8217;s foreclosure firm and three others are under
investigation by Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of these law firms we&#8217;re dealing with, we have
reason to believe, actually forged documents, committed fraud,
did all kinds of things,&#8221; McCollum said in an interview Oct.
15. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know where this is headed right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern&#8217;s attorney, Jeffrey Tew, said Stern has used
technology and a well-organized operation to efficiently process
foreclosures. Stern gets a flat fee of about $1,400 a
foreclosure, according to Tew, of Tew Cardenas LLP in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;David&#8217;s wealth is a reflection of his acumen and the
tremendous volume of foreclosures,&#8221; Tew said in an interview
Oct. 18. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Bankruptcy Advisers&#8217; Fees Top $1 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. paid its lawyers and managers
$51.8 million in September, putting total advisers&#8217; fees over
the billion-dollar mark after 24 1/2 months in bankruptcy court,
according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restructuring firm Alvarez  Marsal LLC, which runs the
defunct investment bank through its co-founder, Bryan Marsal,
led recipients with $356.4 million in fees for &#8220;interim
management,&#8221; according to an Oct. 18 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP of New York has
collected $237 million for acting as the lead bankruptcy-law
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which pays advisers at the rate of $1.3 million
every day of the year, calculated last month that its creditors
may eventually recover an average of 15.8 cents on the dollar.
The advisers haven&#8217;t faced major challenges from the bankruptcy
judge or trustee who monitor such payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, once the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest investment bank,
filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008
with assets of $639 billion. Creditors include Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., UBS AG, the New York Giants professional football
team and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority as well as individuals
who hold Lehman bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Judge Defers Ruling on Feeder Clients&#8217; Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge overseeing the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s
investment firm deferred a ruling on whether investors who lost
money in so-called feeder funds will receive payments from the
bankruptcy court trustee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New York yesterday
said he will rule later on the request by trustee Irving Picard
to deny the claims of investors who weren&#8217;t direct customers of
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, the firm at the
center of the world&#8217;s largest Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It really comes down to a narrow issue: who&#8217;s a customer
and who&#8217;s entitled to the benefits?&#8221; Lifland said after hearing
arguments from both sides in court yesterday. &#8220;The statute is
largely formulaic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard said in December the feeder-fund claims were
rejected because they weren&#8217;t from direct Madoff accounts. The
trustee filed a motion in June to obtain the judge&#8217;s approval of
that action and to allow objectors to be heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in 19 accounts with 16 feeder funds were denied
reimbursement of their claims, the trustee said in the motion.
The feeder funds included Fairfield Greenwich Group, J. Ezra
Merkin&#8217;s Gabriel Capital Corp. and Kingate Global Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeder funds themselves, not the individual claimants,
are the &#8220;customers&#8221; of Madoff, David Sheehan, the lawyer for
the trustee, said in the motion. Investors in feeder funds filed
about 1,700 objections, Sheehan said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty in March 2009 and is serving a
150-year prison sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Computer Users Object to Class-Action Denial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. faces objections to a court official&#8217;s
recommendation that computer users be denied group status in
their lawsuit accusing the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker of
antitrust violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Master Vincent J. Poppiti wrote in a July 28 report
to U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark in Wilmington, Delaware,
that purchasers of computers with Intel microprocessors &#8220;have
not established that they will be able to demonstrate an
antitrust violation through common proof.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Poppiti&#8217;s recommendation, J. Clayton Athey,
a plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer seeking class-action status for the case,
said Oct. 15 in court papers that &#8220;the alternative to class
certification is millions of individual actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote that the plaintiffs &#8220;have also set forth common
evidence&#8221; that &#8220;as a result of its anticompetitive conduct,
Intel overcharges for its microprocessors resulting in inflated
PC prices to consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer purchasers&#8217; case was a companion lawsuit to
Advanced Micro Devices Inc.&#8217;s 2005 complaint alleging antitrust
violations by rival Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel agreed last November to pay Advanced Micro $1.5
billion to settle that case, which claimed Intel controlled the
microprocessor market by providing discounts to customers to
avoid AMD products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the special master was correct to start off
with,&#8221; an Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead case is Paul v. Intel Corp., 05-cv-485, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, JPMorgan Chicago Evictions on Hold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure evictions by Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Ally Financial Inc.&#8217;s GMAC will be suspended
next week in Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago,
Sheriff Tom Dart announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dart said yesterday he is halting evictions until he
receives assurances that they are legal. His decision, effective
Oct. 25, affects about 1,500 pending cases, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I need them to tell me that everything was done
properly,&#8221; Dart said at a press conference, referring to the
lenders. He is demanding affidavits to support the banks&#8217; cases,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the second time since 2008 that Dart has halted Cook
County foreclosure evictions over concerns about lender
practices and procedures. The three affected by yesterday&#8217;s
announcement have announced reviews of their paperwork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America said Oct. 18 it will start resubmitting
foreclosure affidavits next week in 102,000 cases. It said Oct.
8 it would stop foreclosure sales nationally pending the review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dart said his office has reviewed 350 foreclosure cases and
only 17 had complete paperwork to justify an eviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Loses Bid to Appeal Unlawful Dismissal Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. lost a bid to appeal a Hong Kong
court&#8217;s order that a former trader&#8217;s lawsuit, claiming she was
fired so the bank wouldn&#8217;t have to pay a bonus, should go to
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Court of Appeal Judge Maria Yuen yesterday
rejected the bank&#8217;s argument that its former employee Sunny
Tadjudin should have sued under a different law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadjudin, who is seeking at least HK$10.9 million ($1.4
million) in damages, also won in June when the same court
overturned an earlier dismissal of her claim. Bank of America&#8217;s
Hong Kong-based spokesman Mark Tsang then said the bank was
confident the claim will be held to be without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsang declined to say yesterday whether the bank will
appeal further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadjudin, who worked for the bank&#8217;s distressed debt trading
group from June 2000 to August 2007, claims her former manager
had made false accusations against her in order to fire her and
earn a higher bonus himself. She declined to comment on her case
or yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tadjudin Sunny and Bank of America NA,
CACV173/2009, Hong Kong Court of Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands Testifies He Wouldn&#8217;t Have Bid on EMI Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy Hands, the founder of Terra Firma Capital Partners
Ltd., testified in his $8.3 billion fraud suit against Citigroup
Inc. that his firm wouldn&#8217;t have bid on EMI Group Ltd. if he had
known there were no other bidders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands, 51, claims that Citigroup&#8217;s David Wormsley tricked
him into overpaying for EMI, a 113-year-old music company, in a
2007 auction. Hands testified yesterday on the second day of a
trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands claims Wormsley lied to him in a series of phone
conversations over the weekend leading up to the Monday, May 21,
2007, auction for EMI, falsely telling him that Cerberus Capital
Management LP planned to submit a competing bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If he hadn&#8217;t made those statements, we wouldn&#8217;t have been
bidding that Monday morning at all,&#8221; Hands told jurors, under
questioning by his lawyer, David Boies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands told jurors that several rival bidders dropped out in
the days before the May 21, 9 a.m. deadline for bids, including
Fortress Investment Group LLC, Warner Music Group Corp. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s One Equity Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands said that on the final weekend before the auction,
Wormsley, whom he described as his friend and business
associate, told him that Cerberus remained in the auction and
was bidding 2.62 pounds per share. Hands told jurors about a
telephone conversation he said he had with Wormsley from the
study of his home, at midnight, nine hours before the bids were
due. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He told me that Cerberus were there at 262, that the bid
had to be in at 9 a.m. the next morning and he told me not to
play any games with the price,&#8221; Hands testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he had known the process had turned into a &#8220;busted
auction,&#8221; with his firm the only bidder, Terra Firma would have
withdrawn from the bidding and negotiated with the sellers
directly for a lower price, Hands told jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning after his midnight phone call with Wormsley,
Hands said, he spoke to Tim Pryce, Terra Firma&#8217;s chief executive
officer who was, at the time, the firm&#8217;s general counsel. Hands
said he told Pryce to go forward with Terra Firma&#8217;s bid of 2.65
pounds a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Terra Firma v. Citigroup, 09-cv-10459, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Bawag CEO Elsner Should Be Given New Trial, Prosecutor Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian prosecutors recommended that former Bawag PSK Bank
Chief Executive Officer Helmut Elsner should be given a new
trial on charges that he misused funds and caused 1.7 billion
euros ($2.4 billion) in losses at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of the court in 2008 weren&#8217;t sufficient for a
guilty conviction of Elsner, prosecutor Erich Weiss said in
arguments filed to Austria&#8217;s supreme court on Oct. 15, his
spokesman, Wilfried Seidl said in a telephone interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsner, 75, and his fund manager Wolfgang Flottl, 55, were
the most prominent among nine men convicted in 2008 of charges
including improper use of funds, fraud and false accounting. The
losses were discovered in 2006 after U.S. futures broker Refco
Inc. collapsed into bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We recommend nullifying the verdicts and sending them
back to the first court&#8221; for a retrial, Weiss said. &#8220;The
findings were not sufficient for a guilty verdict&#8221; on several
counts for Elsner and all counts for Flottl, Seidl said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria&#8217;s supreme court has scheduled two days starting
Dec. 22 to discuss the case, court spokesman Ronald Rohrer said.
The court isn&#8217;t bound by the prosecutors&#8217; recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsner&#8217;s lawyer, Wolfgang Schubert, wasn&#8217;t available for a
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Wins Arkansas Woman&#8217;s Lawsuit Over Prempro &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. properly warned an Arkansas woman about the
cancer risks of its Prempro menopause drug, jurors found in
rejecting her bid for at least $3.5 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas,
deliberated less than an hour before siding with Pfizer, the
world&#8217;s largest drugmaker. Margaret Wilson, a 68-year-old former
bank teller, claimed that Prempro helped caused her breast
cancer and executives of Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit hid the medicine&#8217;s
health risks from women and their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth now has won six of the 13 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. Wyeth got some verdicts
against it thrown out at the post-trial stage or had awards
reduced. Wyeth also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury&#8217;s decision &#8220;affirms that Wyeth communicated the
risks and benefits of Prempro,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer
spokesman, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wilson v. Wyeth, MDL 03-cv-1507-WRW, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas (Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wridgways Wins Court Approval for Plan to Sell to Santa Fe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wridgways Australia Ltd. won an Australian court&#8217;s approval
for its plan to sell the company to Santa Fe EAC Moving and
Relocation Services for A$89.6 million ($88.6 million), to be
voted on by shareholders Nov. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Fe&#8217;s offer of A$2.80 a share is 10 percent less than
the high end of a range of A$2.60 to A$3.11 that accounting firm
BDO Australia concluded Wridgways was worth, Federal Court Judge
Peter Jacobson said at a hearing in Sydney yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court doesn&#8217;t usurp the judgment of the
shareholders,&#8221; said Jacobson, who had to decide whether the
plan was fair. It will be up to the shareholders to decide
whether the A$2.80 offer is adequate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Santa Fe, based in Hong Kong, offered on Sept.
20 to buy Wridgways, a 117-year-old Australian moving company
with 30 offices and 470 employees, under a so-called scheme of
arrangement. Under the plan, Santa Fe must win support from 75
percent of Wridgways shareholders and the judge must approve it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobson raised concern that parts of the plan protecting
Santa Fe&#8217;s bid, including its right to match any competing offer
and a lack of a provision giving a potential rival bidder time
to respond to a matching offer, might be anti-competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a disincentive to a competing bidder,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wridgways must inform the shareholders of any superior
offer that&#8217;s made, and a rival bidder will have time to respond
to Santa Fe&#8217;s match because of a delay before shareholders get a
chance to vote, Malcolm Oakes, a lawyer for the company, told
the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Application by Wridgways Australia Ltd.,
NSD1227/2010, Federal Court of Australia (Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doha Bank QSC hired Morgan Stanley

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By James Lumley" date="Oct 20, 2010  6:41 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-20/former-jpmorgan-banker-loses-u-k-pre-nuptial-case-in-supreme-court-ruling.html"><headline>Ex-JPMorgan Banker Loses U.K. Case Over Pre-Nuptials</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pre-nuptial agreements may be given
decisive weight in U.K. divorces, the nation&#8217;s highest court
ruled today in a case that brings the U.K. a step closer to
U.S.-style &#8220;pre-nups.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court in London ruled that a divorce settlement
between a wealthy German heiress and a former JPMorgan Chase 
Co. investment banker could be reduced because of a &#8220;pre-nup.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-nups in England and Wales have gained popularity during
a decade-long trend of judges awarding large settlements to
departing spouses, lawyers say. The contracts help to avoid such
payouts in divorce cases, and U.K. judges are giving them
greater weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anybody with any money will now want a pre-nup -- they&#8217;d
be mad not to,&#8221; Mark Harper, a family lawyer at Withers LLP
said in a telephone interview. Today&#8217;s ruling is &#8220;a huge
boost&#8221; to U.K. pre-nups, said Harper, who isn&#8217;t connected with
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute involves Nicolas Granatino, a French-born
former banker who was seeking a bigger divorce payout from
German heiress Katrin Radmacher. He claimed their pre-nup
shouldn&#8217;t be enforced because Radmacher withheld the full extent
of her wealth and he didn&#8217;t have proper legal advice when he
signed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m really pleased with the ruling, but saddened at the
four-year process that brought us to this point,&#8221; Radmacher
said in a statement after the ruling. &#8220;For Nicolas and I, in
our homelands -- France and Germany -- these agreements are
entirely normal and routine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Chinese stocks
on any &#8220;dips&#8221; following an interest-rate increase in the
nation, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. Higher rates are a
&#8220;positive&#8221; signal for equities, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank yesterday unexpectedly raised borrowing
costs for the first time since 2007, lifting the benchmark one-
year lending rate to 5.56 percent from 5.31 percent. The deposit
rate was increased to 2.5 percent from 2.25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would buy into any major market dips for the medium to
longer-term upside as we believe that earnings are solid,
valuations are reasonable and the rate hike could actually
remove a risk overhang,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts including Helen Zhu and Timothy Moe wrote in a report. Market declines after
previous rate increases were &#8220;short-lived, if any,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent to close at
3,003.95 today, reversing an earlier 2 percent loss. The
benchmark gauge has surged 13 percent this month after lagging
behind other emerging markets and as a higher yuan drew
increased capital inflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s policy makers are trying to curb lending and
prevent an asset-price bubble in a country that surpassed Japan
this year as the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Tao, head of China economic research at UBS AG, said
investors&#8217; initial reaction to the surprise rate increase was
likely to be negative, especially for property developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;However, in general, we think the market should see the
rate hike as a speed bump on the road,&#8221; Wang said in a report.
&#8220;It also reflects the government&#8217;s confidence in the strength
of economic activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hot Money&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate increase will raise expectations for an
appreciation in the yuan and encourage more inflows of &#8220;hot
money,&#8221; Shenyin  Wanguo Securities Co. analysts led by Li Huiyong said in a report. Yuan-denominated assets become more
attractive and the decision indicates confidence among policy
makers on the strength of the economy, Citic Securities Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in four
months in September, while industrial output rose 13.9 percent
in August, exceeding economists&#8217; estimates. Citing the economy&#8217;s
outlook, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service on Oct. 8 put the nation&#8217;s
debt rating on review for a possible upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ma Jun, head of Hong Kong and China strategy at Deutsche
Bank AG, said higher borrowing costs will hurt the outlook for
developers and commodity producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rate increases will also be negative for commodities, as
their demand growth is highly sensitive to overall investment
and loan growth,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s interest-rate increase is a &#8220;positive signal&#8221; for
the nation&#8217;s equity market as it supports a view that economic
growth may have bottomed out and is set to recover, Frank Li and
Peng Chen, analysts at JPMorgan in Hong Kong, said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government&#8217;s new
formula to measure consumer prices may push down the index by
0.4 percentage point, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statistics bureau will change the way it calculates the
figures in August 2011. Some 28 goods and services that have
increased in importance, such as music downloading fees,
electronic dictionaries and fried chicken, will be added to the
basket of goods, according to the bureau&#8217;s plans. Dried sardines
and express mail are among the 22 that will be removed because
of decreased significance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan, which said this month that price
declines will continue to narrow, is unlikely to adjust its
assessment of deflation because of the formula adjustment,
Chiwoong Lee, a Tokyo-based economist at Goldman Sachs, said in
a report today. Even so, continuing deflation and a
deteriorating economy is likely to prompt the central bank to
expand the 5 trillion yen asset-purchasing fund ($62 billion) to
20 trillion yen by the end of next year, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices excluding fresh food, the central bank&#8217;s
preferred gauge of inflation, slumped for an 18th month in
August. The statistics bureau revises its calculations every
five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edith Cooper remembers the
questions, almost a decade ago, from a Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
client. He interrupted her and a female colleague, then co-heads
of Goldman&#8217;s commodities unit for Europe, as their meeting
began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He said, &#8216;You are two women running a business; how do you
get people to listen to you?&#8217;&#8221; Cooper recalls. &#8220;Then he said,
&#8216;You must manage men. Do they do what you say?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all the men -- and women -- at Goldman Sachs have to
listen to Cooper, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its
November issue. As head of human capital management, she
oversees hiring and training and sits on the five-person panel
that will hand out the coveted titles of&#160;managing director and
partner in November. She is one of four women who sit on
Goldman&#8217;s 30-member management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm over Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role in the financial crisis
-- the firm paid $550 million in July to settle securities fraud
charges -- didn&#8217;t slow hiring. Head count has risen more than
50&#160;percent since 2005, and the firm has expanded offices in
Sao&#160;Paulo and Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We learn from challenging periods just as we learn from
great periods,&#8221; Cooper says in an interview in Goldman&#8217;s new
lower Manhattan headquarters on a scorching July Friday. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not that we are perfect. We are people,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We have to
make sure we have our compass correct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piled Paycheck &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs says applications for full-time positions
rose 31 percent in 2010 from 2009. Only one in 45 people who
apply -- 2.2 percent -- gets a job. Goldman is the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history and divvies up billions a
year in profit among workers.  Goldman Sachs shares yesterday
rose to the highest in six months after the company reported
$1.9 billion in profit for the third quarter, exceeding
analysts&#8217; expectations. Still, Cooper says, those out for the
money alone are making a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you are on the fifth version of something and working
late, you are not going to have your paycheck piled up in front
of you,&#8221; she says. &#8220;What is going to keep you going is that you
are interested in the business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper, 49, grew up in Manhattan and worked after school in
her father&#8217;s dental practice. She attended Harvard University
and then worked at First Chicago Bank while earning a Master of
Business Administration at Northwestern University&#8217;s Kellogg
School of Management. After stints at Bankers Trust and Morgan
Stanley, she joined Goldman Sachs in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, she moved to London with her husband and three
children, then ages 5, 7 and 9. Leaving the U.S. was critical to
grasping a global business, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex Not Issue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As an American, and as an African-American woman in this
business, I thought I was particularly aware and culturally
sensitive,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I quickly realized that I had some
learning to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and the colleague were one of the few pairs of women to
co-head a Goldman Sachs unit. After the client&#8217;s queries that
day, they said they hadn&#8217;t found their sex to be an issue and
carried on, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By the end of that meeting, he wasn&#8217;t wondering if we
could get anyone to listen to us,&#8221; she says. He wanted to follow
up on their business suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some women say they have a tough time being treated equally
at Goldman Sachs. On Sept. 15, three former employees, including
a managing director, sued the bank, saying they were paid less
than male colleagues and left out of team-building outings on
the golf course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One former associate said her boss had her make photocopies
and answer his wife&#8217;s phone calls, duties her male peers never
had to perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Men at Goldman Sachs are viewed more favorably, receive
more compensation and are more likely to be promoted,&#8221; the
employees said in the complaint. Lucas van Praag, a bank
spokesman, says the charges are without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper says her colleagues inside Goldman Sachs have helped
her throughout her career transitions. When Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein telephoned in 2000 to say she&#8217;d been
named a partner, he told her not to be disappointed that her job
would feel the same. As a partner, her responsibility to the
firm had changed, he said. The role of &#8220;partner&#8221; changed at
Goldman after the company went public in 1999, and those with
the title no longer shared exclusive ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, after she joined the management
committee, Gary Cohn, the bank&#8217;s president, pulled her aside to
assess her performance at the group&#8217;s Monday morning meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of it wasn&#8217;t warm and fuzzy,&#8221; she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent college graduates asking Goldman Sachs recruiters
about the bank&#8217;s role in society have helped Cooper and her team
keep an eye on their compass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to talk about our business in a way that is
transparent and clear,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Students are very honest and
frank. You can&#8217;t really get away with much.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Jo Kilroy is running against
Wall Street again, echoing a message that won her a first term
in Congress two years ago. This time, the Ohio Democrat is in
danger of losing her seat to a former bank lobbyist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2008, as financial markets tumbled and
lawmakers approved a $700 billion bank bailout, Barack Obama led
Kilroy and other Democrats in harnessing voter anger to win the
White House and score big gains in the House and Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kilroy defeated Republican Steve Stivers by about 2,300
votes after a monthlong recount. Her struggle to get re-elected
in a rematch with Stivers sums up her party&#8217;s failure to
replicate that strategy even after passing the most sweeping new
financial-market rules in seven decades. For many voters,
concern about jobs overwhelms ill-feeling toward the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need Wall Street,&#8221; said Peggy Kolodziej, 63, a nurse
from Columbus in Kilroy&#8217;s 15th congressional district. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t need those million-dollar bonuses, but we need them to
help the economy grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The populist tone seems off-key in Columbus, Ohio&#8217;s capital
and largest city, because this is where Wall Street meets Main
Street. In the McCoy Center, an office complex on 150 acres on
the outskirts of the city, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Columbus&#8217;s
largest private employer, has its biggest facility in the world.
Some 10,000 employees are housed in a four-story building so
wide that it has roughly the same square footage as the 102-
story Empire State Building in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABC, CBS and NBC have blocked access
to Google TV as the networks negotiate with Google Inc. over
rights to rebroadcast their programs over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC won&#8217;t allow Google TV to show its programs, the Walt
Disney Co.-owned network said today in an e-mailed statement.
CBS and NBC are also blocking content, according to people with
knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google executives have been negotiating with major TV
providers since summer to obtain programming. The service, which
began this month, carries shows from websites associated with
Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s HBO and TBS. The clash with Google comes as
the biggest broadcast networks have been seeking compensation
from pay-TV systems for signals that are free over the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in the early phases of Google TV and already have
strong partnerships with Best Buy, Logitech and Sony, among
others,&#8221; Mountain View, California-based Google said in a
statement. &#8220;It is ultimately the content owner&#8217;s choice to
restrict users from accessing their content on the platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and New York-based CBS Corp. couldn&#8217;t agree on a
price for the shows, said an executive with knowledge of the
network&#8217;s deliberations. NBC channels online viewers to its
NBC.com website, said a person with knowledge of the network&#8217;s
stance who wasn&#8217;t cleared to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google TV also carries programming from NBC Universal&#8217;s
CNBC and from Chow, an online cooking site owned by CBS. For
now, New York-based News Corp.&#8217;s Fox is allowing its programming
to be seen on the Google service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The idea of blocking access to Google TV has been
explored, but a firm decision has yet to be reached,&#8221; Fox said
in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google rose $4.01 to $611.99 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. The shares have lost 1.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the networks&#8217; dispute with
Google earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nick Leiber" date="Oct 21, 2010  5:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/chile-offers-visas-40-000-grant-to-lure-overseas-startups-boost-economy.html"><headline>Chile Offers Visas, $40,000 Grant to Lure Overseas Startups, Boost Economy</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Like so many young entrepreneurs,
Stanford University graduates Amit Aharoni and Nicolas Meunier
had an idea for a business: a website to help Americans find
deals for cruise-ship vacations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other entrepreneurs, they didn&#8217;t start their
company in Silicon Valley, opting instead to go about 6,000
miles (10,000 kilometers) south, to Santiago, Chile, Bloomberg
Businessweek reports in its Oct. 25 issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aharoni, a 30-year-old with a master&#8217;s degree in business
administration who spent nine years in the Israeli defense
forces, and Meunier, 25, a programmer from France with a
master&#8217;s in electrical engineering, are the first participants
in Start-Up Chile, a government program to woo foreign
entrepreneurs. The goal is to put Chile on the map as an
innovation hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have come to Chile if it hadn&#8217;t been for the
program,&#8221; Aharoni said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something that you might
consider naturally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start-Up Chile is trying to tackle what Chilean President
Sebastian Pinera calls an obstacle to growth: a dearth of
entrepreneurs. Shortly after taking office in March, the
billionaire, who made his fortune introducing credit cards to
the country, pledged to add 100,000 businesses and 800,000 jobs
by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July speech, Pinera said Chile needs to look outside
its borders and &#8220;work hard to regain its entrepreneurial and
innovative culture.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Shea, a Chilean who had been running an e-learning
company in Silicon Valley, moved back to Santiago to help run
Start-Up Chile. The program will have a $1 million budget this
year and $5 million in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software to Solar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 150 people, with ideas ranging from software to
solar panels to gadgets that use radio-frequency identification
technology, have applied. Those who make the cut will receive a
$40,000 grant, a one-year residency visa and assistance from the
program&#8217;s seven-person team to ensure that participants settle
in quickly and make connections with potential hires and
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program&#8217;s five-person selection committee has approved
25 companies this year, most of them submitted by foreign-born
residents of the U.S., Shea said. The idea is to borrow talent,
not steal it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be ridiculous to want to compete with Silicon
Valley or Bangalore,&#8221; Shea said. &#8220;But we want to be in the
game as an agile, friendly player -- a good place to do a test
market. I can&#8217;t think of a cheaper public policy to gather all
the talent that we will gather.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create Jobs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detractors have questioned why Chilean citizens are
ineligible for the grants. In comments on blogs and via Twitter,
they argue that subsidies should be awarded to Chileans to
develop the country from the inside. Supporters of the program
counter that foreigners will help create jobs and serve as an
inspiration to locals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chileans will see that &#8220;taking the entrepreneurial plunge
is possible because here comes this guy with an idea&#8221; and it
got funding, said Alex Seelenberger, managing director at Aurus
Bios in Santiago, one of about 20 Chilean venture capital firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aharoni said the program is paying off more quickly than he
expected. He and Meunier have already met with several Chilean
investors and plan to have a prototype ready by January, which
they intend to use to raise money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While salaries for software developers in Chile &#8220;are much
closer to Silicon Valley than China or India,&#8221; the Start-Up
Chile staff has provided valuable help in setting up meetings
with potential partners, Aharoni said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We started seeing that our schedule is more and more
filled,&#8221; Aharoni said. &#8220;It&#8217;s at least as filled as it was in
California, business-wise and social-wise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ian Thomson" date="Oct 21, 2010  4:14 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/mattel-s-big-doll-reign-with-american-girl-targeted-by-disney-toys-r-us.html"><headline>Mattel''s American Girl Faces Disney, Toys `R'' Us Holiday Rivals</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;American Girl, the Mattel Inc. doll
that has dominated the big (18 inches, or 46 centimeters, tall)
and expensive ($95) part of the market for 24 years, may have to
watch her back this holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us Inc., Walt Disney Co. and MGA Entertainment
Inc. are all out to get her. Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us, the world&#8217;s biggest
toy retailer, has introduced a line of ethnic dolls called
Journey Girls for $29.99. Disney&#8217;s $49.99 Princess  Me doll has
made &#8220;most wanted&#8221; lists from Toy Insider and
TimetoPlayMag.com. MGA&#8217;s Best Friends Club features a $32.99
doll that promotes friendship through a storytelling website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio of new big dolls may be the biggest threat to
American Girl sales since a Wisconsin educator created the
history-themed characters in 1986. With U.S. unemployment
hovering at 9.6 percent, the cheaper entrants may be appealing
to gift buyers seeking to economize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The angle most people seem to be pursuing is to price
well below American Girl,&#8221; said Edward Woo, an analyst at
Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. &#8220;That&#8217;s an opportunity
to break into this market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us decided to enter the market after observing the
continuing popularity of big dolls, Lisa Harnisch, a vice
president of the Wayne, New Jersey-based retailer, said in an
interview. About a year ago, she and her colleagues met with
manufacturers and concluded 18-inch dolls -- more than six
inches taller than Mattel&#8217;s Barbie line -- would sell well
during the 2010 holiday season; Journey Girl was born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each doll comes with a back story describing its travel
experiences and hobbies. Taryn is a musician who dreams of
playing at the New Orleans Jazz Festival; Meredith is a skier
who hopes to visit the Alps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Like Friends&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Kids can really relate to these larger dolls,&#8221; Harnisch
said. &#8220;They&#8217;re like friends to the girls who play with them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Disney Princess  Me line, Disney&#8217;s first foray into
18-inch dolls, features six popular movie characters including
Cinderella, Ariel from &#8220;The Little Mermaid&#8221; and Aurora from
&#8220;Sleeping Beauty.&#8221; Among other accessories, girls can get the
same outfits as their dolls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The popularity and success of American Girl has opened
the market to other brands and opportunities,&#8221; Jennifer Caveza,
a marketing vice president at JAKKS Pacific Inc., which makes
the Disney Princess dolls, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathalie Crausse, a flight attendant from Montpellier,
France, was at the flagship Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us store in Times Square on
Oct. 8, checking out Disney Princess  Me outfits for her 6-
year-old daughter, Tara. Crausse is a regular in the store
during her bimonthly stopovers in New York and says she has
bought eight Disney Princess dresses in the past 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Buy Something&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I can&#8217;t get something for my daughter,&#8221; said Crausse,
&#8220;I always buy something for the doll.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGA&#8217;s Best Friends Club line aren&#8217;t the only dolls the
company makes that competes with Mattel products. MGA&#8217;s Bratz
line has gone head to head with Barbie. The two companies have
tussled in court over the ownership rights to Bratz. In July, an
appeals court overturned an earlier ruling that had awarded the
rights to Mattel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing American Girl aside won&#8217;t be easy, says New York-
based toy industry analyst Sean McGowan of Needham  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American Girl is not purchased instead of any other
doll,&#8221; said McGowan, explaining that the dolls appeal to
customers who aren&#8217;t easily swayed by price. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a
different kind of purchase.&#8221; McGowan expects this year&#8217;s sales
to surpass the record $463 million in both 2008 and 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educator &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Girl first appeared in 1986 after Pleasant T. Rowland, an educator and writer based in Madison, Wisconsin, was
looking for dolls for her nieces. Rowland couldn&#8217;t find any that
represented girls aged nine to 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She decided to create a line of dolls and books
representing periods of American history, from Felicity
Merriman, a colonial girl from 1774, to Molly McIntire, a World
War Two-era girl from 1944. The dolls&#8217; popularity attracted the
interest of Mattel, which bought Rowland&#8217;s company for $700
million in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The El Segundo, California-based toymaker kept the craze
going by opening stores, which now number nine, and backing a
series of movies. Mattel added contemporary dolls in 1995, with
varying combinations of skin tone, eye color and hair style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales Rose &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales surged 15 percent in 2005 following the release of
the first of five films, &#8220;Samantha: An American Girl Holiday.&#8221;
While the growth has since slowed, sales rose during the
recession, climbing 7.3 percent between 2007 and 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel climbed 40 cents to $22.73 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have climbed 14 percent
this year, compared with a 5.8 percent increase in the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerie Fallon is an American Girl buyer of long standing.
Over the past nine years, the mother of three from Newtown,
Connecticut, has purchased a salon chair, hair brushes, a horse
and an equestrian set for her three girls, as well as a matching
soccer kit for doll and child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallon&#8217;s youngest daughter, Kiersten, celebrated her 8th
birthday at American Girl&#8217;s New York City store with cookies and
cupcakes on Oct. 8. Each year, Fallon says, she spends &#8220;a
couple of hundred dollars&#8221; on American Girl products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring on the competition, Julie Parks, American Girl&#8217;s
director of public relations, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re really proud to have created this 18-inch doll
genre,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We feel we have a great product line for
2010. Our content has evolved into entertainment and theater,
and that has been our point of difference from the outset.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co. is poised to start a unit
to invest in stocks with a cadre of proprietary traders from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., after new financial regulations
spurred the investment bank to shed a team that made bets with
the company&#8217;s capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR, founded by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, is close
to hiring nine members of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s U.S. principal-
strategies team, Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for the New York-
based buyout firm, said in an interview. Bob Howard, who heads
that group, will join KKR as managing director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is part of a strategic build-out of our asset-
management platform,&#8221; Kravis and Roberts said today in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hirings mark KKR&#8217;s first venture into overseeing liquid
equities, an area that may include hedge funds. The firm, along
with larger competitor Blackstone Group LP, is pushing into
businesses outside traditional private equity to boost fees and
appease public shareholders eager for stable profit growth. KKR
competed with investment bank Perella Weinberg Partner LP and
hedge fund Avenue Capital Group, run by Marc Lasry, to hire the
Goldman Sachs traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is disbanding the team to comply with new
U.S. rules aimed at curbing risk. A provision of the Dodd-Frank
financial-overhaul act prohibits banks from risking capital by
betting for their own accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, approved a $7.5 billion plan to develop oil
and natural gas fields in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico, the
largest investment since the Obama administration ended its
drilling ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two fields, known as Jack and St. Malo, are located
about 280 miles (450 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans and
are estimated to hold the equivalent of more than 500 million
barrels of oil, Chevron said in a statement today. The project
includes a floating platform to handle production, expected to
begin in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes six months after an explosion aboard
a deep-water Gulf drilling rig triggered the biggest offshore
oil leak in U.S. history. The U.S. Interior Department last week
issued new safety regulations and ended a moratorium on new
deep-water drilling that was put in place after BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo
well leaked an estimated 4.9 million barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision came as a surprise so soon after the safety
rules were announced, said Jason Gammel, a London-based analyst
for Macquarie Securities USA Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economics of this project are robust enough to
overcome any incremental cost of new regulation,&#8221; said Gammel,
who rates Chevron shares &#8220;outperform&#8221; and owns none. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what Chevron is telling us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, owns half of Jack
and 51 percent of St. Malo and will pay about $3.8 billion as
its share for initial development of the project. Its partners
in the Jack field are Statoil ASA and A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S,
each with 25 percent shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep-Water Wells &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil also owns 21.5 percent of St. Malo, alongside
Petroleo Brasileiro SA with 25 percent and Exxon Mobil Corp. and
Eni SpA, with 1.25 percent each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s Macondo well was under about 5,000 feet (1,524 meters)
of water, about 40 miles from New Orleans. The St. Malo and Jack
wells lie under 7,000 feet of water, Chevron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project includes a central production plant with the
capacity to handle 170,000 barrels of oil and 42.5 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day, Chevron said. Current Chevron oil
production from the Gulf is 149,000 barrels a day, about 7.8
percent of its total worldwide crude production in the second
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has seven other deep-water discoveries in the Gulf
awaiting development, including the Caesar and Tonga fields
scheduled to begin production next year. Like the project today,
Caesar and Tonga will be a joint development. It&#8217;s expected to
cost $1.7 billion, the company said in a March presentation to
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 23 cents to $84.25 at 4 p.m. in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained
9.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, can subpoena an American attorney working
for Ecuadorean villagers suing the company in a multibillion
dollar environmental pollution case, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan yesterday
denied a request by New York attorney Steven Donziger and
plaintiffs in the lawsuit in Ecuador to block a subpoena by
company lawyers seeking testimony and documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan said the evidence he reviewed, including outtakes
from the documentary film &#8220;Crude,&#8221; showed that Donziger&#8217;s
 &#8220;principal functions&#8221; in events in Ecuador &#8220;have included
 lobbying, media and press relations, and politics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Donziger&#8217;s role at least in major respects is that of a
political operative, not a lawyer,&#8221; Kaplan said in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is fighting a lawsuit in Ecuador over the effects
of wastewater discharges from Texaco Inc.&#8217;s oil operations that
occurred more than 20 years ago in the Amazon basin. The company
said it needs to gather evidence to prove lawyers for plaintiffs
improperly influenced the findings of a court-appointed expert
who estimated billions of dollars in damages owed by Chevron,
according to court filings. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Ecuadoreans deny wrongdoing. Karen Hinton,
a spokeswoman for the Amazon Defense Front, which is involved in
representing Ecuadoreans in the lawsuit, said the group
disagrees with Kaplan&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron now seeks to use its false allegations to pry
open all private communications between lawyers and their
clients for the entire 17-year duration of this litigation,&#8221;
Hinton said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fraud and Corruption&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron is confident that the evidence obtained in this
process will provide additional proof of the fraud and
corruption perpetrated by Mr. Donziger and his associates in the
trial against Chevron in Ecuador,&#8221; Justin Higgs, a Chevron
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit in Ecuador was brought by Amazon Basin
residents who claim the company is responsible for pollution and
illness caused by toxic waste from oil drilling in the jungle
from 1964 to 1990 or later. The pollution was allegedly left by
Texaco, according to the complaint. Chevron has denied
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is in a court in Lago Agrio, a town 20 miles
(32 kilometers) south of the Colombia border and near the former
Texaco oil fields. Donziger has been counsel to the Amazon
residents since 1993. A ruling in the case is expected early
next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoena case is In re Application of Chevron Corp.,
10-00002, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever seen a Microsoft Zune HD? It&#8217;s
a lovely little device for watching movies, listening to music
and playing games. Slim, sleek, sophisticated -- and irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s because the Zune HD was released two years after the
debut of Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPod Touch. By the time it joined the
battle, the war was already lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technology, being late can be as disastrous as being
wrong. And that&#8217;s the battle Microsoft Corp. is now fighting
with the release of Windows Phone 7, its new smartphone
operating system. The good news is that the software is
generally a winner: fun, easy to use and not just another iPhone
wannabe. The bad news is that the good news may not matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hasn&#8217;t just lost market share since the iPhone
inaugurated the modern smartphone era, it has seen its position
implode, falling to 5 percent in the second quarter from 22
percent in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company simply can&#8217;t afford to be shut out of the
booming market. Morgan Stanley analyst Mary Meeker predicts that
within five years, more users will connect to the Internet on
mobile devices than the desktop computers that Microsoft has
dominated for decades. Unless the company can establish a
beachhead in mobile, it&#8217;s facing a long slow slide into
irrelevance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Microsoft Corp.
call options because the world&#8217;s largest software maker may
rally on &#8220;potentially significant&#8221; corporate software sales
and the introduction of a new video-game controller, Morgan
Stanley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Christopher Metli and Sivan Mahadevan recommended buying &#8220;attractively priced&#8221; January $26
calls on the Redmond, Washington-based company. The calls, which
give the right but not the obligation to buy the stock at the
strike price, rose 11 percent to 90 cents as of 10:49 a.m. in
New York. Microsoft shares rose 0.8 percent to $25.51. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may benefit as corporations upgrade to new
versions of its software and as cost cuts expand profit margins,
the strategists said, citing stock analyst Adam Holt in a
report. Microsoft also may gain as it introduces a motion-
sensing controller, called the Kinect, for its Xbox 360 in
November and its Windows Phone 7 platform, which competes with
Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in smartphone operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growing momentum in Microsoft&#8217;s enterprise business is
being overlooked,&#8221; the New York-based strategists wrote. With
Windows Phone 7 and Kinect potential near-term catalysts, they
said they like buying calls to wager on gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paring Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may be able to pare this year&#8217;s 17 percent
retreat with positive reviews for Phone 7 and the $400 million
it will spend on marketing, Holt wrote in an Oct. 11 report
after the product&#8217;s introduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying the calls makes sense because Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;option
prices are at low levels&#8221; and the January $26 calls break even
if the shares climb about 6.4 percent, the strategists said. The
stock hasn&#8217;t closed above $26 for 11 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for
options expiring in three months is about 24, which is below the
32 level for other software stocks and is at the 35th percentile
for readings over the past year, the strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in the
price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves or
bet that volatility, or stock swings, will rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
considering repaying the $5 billion investment it received two
years ago from Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said a
person familiar with the company&#8217;s plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A repayment isn&#8217;t likely to happen imminently because the
bank requires approval from the Federal Reserve, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the deliberations
aren&#8217;t public. The person wouldn&#8217;t say whether Goldman Sachs is
already seeking the Fed&#8217;s consent. The Wall Street Journal
reported earlier today on the possible repayment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs turned to Buffett, the second-richest
American and a cult figure in the investing world, to shore up
the investment bank&#8217;s capital and restore market confidence
after its stock tumbled and borrowing costs spiked following the
Sept. 15, 2008, collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. News
of Berkshire&#8217;s investment also helped Goldman Sachs raise $5.75
billion from a stock offering a day later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, repeatedly
invoked the deal with Buffett, announced on Sept. 23, 2008, as
evidence that Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t relying on government funds
received from the U.S. Treasury a few weeks later. And Buffett,
80, praised Blankfein&#8217;s leadership after Goldman Sachs was sued
for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission in April.
The case was settled in July for $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$500 Million Cost &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, would like to retire the preferred shares it
sold to Buffett at the height of the financial crisis and
replace them with a cheaper form of capital, the person said.
Refunding Berkshire would also free Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top
executives from a requirement that they retain 90 percent of the
stock they own in the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. Carrie Kizer, a spokeswoman for Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire, didn&#8217;t immediately return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s stake gets a 10 percent dividend, costing
Goldman Sachs $500 million a year. By contrast, the $2.25
billion of five-year notes the firm issued in July yield 2.95
percent, according to data from Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm held $173 billion in cash and other easy-to-sell
assets at the end of September and could use some of that money
to repay Buffett, the person said. The company is also
responding to new capital rules imposed by international
regulators under the Basel III regime, which wouldn&#8217;t count
Berkshire&#8217;s stake as Tier One capital, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warrants &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s $5 billion investment in perpetual preferred
shares, announced on Sept. 23, 2008, can be called at any time
at a 10 percent premium. Berkshire also received warrants to buy
$5 billion of common stock with a strike price of $115 per
share, which can be exercised at any time within five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of Berkshire&#8217;s investment, Blankfein, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar and Co-Presidents Gary Cohn and
Jon Winkelried were named in the &#8220;material definitive
agreement&#8221; that prevents them, their families and their estates
from selling more than 10 percent of the common stock they own
until Oct. 1, 2011, or until Berkshire redeems its $5 billion in
preferred stock, whichever comes soonest. Winkelried left
Goldman Sachs in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement pertained to stock owned by the executives as
of Sept. 28, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may repay a
$5 billion investment from Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. that boosted the bank during the 2008 financial crisis, the
Wall Street Journal said, citing unidentified people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has the option of paying $5.5 billion to
redeem the shares, although that would trigger a charge of $1.6
billion and need approval from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the
newspaper said. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in
Hong Kong, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s investment in September 2008 reassured
investors and allowed Goldman Sachs to raise another $5 billion
the following day, according to the newspaper. Goldman Sachs is
considering using some of its $173 billion in &#8220;excess
liquidity&#8221; to repay Berkshire, the Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual dividends of 10 percent on Berkshire&#8217;s preferred
Goldman Sachs shares have cost the investment bank about $1
billion, the equivalent of more than $1.3 million a day, the
newspaper reported. Funding from debt markets has become cheaper
since the crisis, and Goldman Sachs would be able to replace the
capital, the Journal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repaying Berkshire&#8217;s investment would also lift
restrictions that prevent Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein and other executives from selling more than 10
percent of their shares in the firm, according to the report.
That curb was requested by Buffett at the time of the deal, the
newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not clear whether executives at the New York-based
bank have sought approval from the Federal Reserve for repaying
Berkshire, the Journal said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA, the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said third-quarter profit
rose 9 percent as more clients turned to its cable-TV units for
phone and high-speed Internet services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to 2.2 billion pesos ($177 million) from
2 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based Televisa said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Sales rose 12 percent to
14.8 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is luring customers of billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s
Telefonos de Mexico SAB with packages of cable TV, phone and
Internet service. The three cable carriers controlled by
Televisa added a total of 31,658 Internet users and 28,737 phone
customers in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable unit was Televisa&#8217;s second-biggest division and
its fastest-growing, climbing 37 percent from a year earlier to
3 billion pesos. The broadcasting business, Televisa&#8217;s largest
source of revenue, expanded 7.1 percent to 5.86 billion pesos,
in line with the forecast of Michel Morin, an analyst with
Barclays Capital Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa boosted its forecast for broadcast-revenue growth
this year to as much as 6 percent, up from a projection of
5 percent, Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said
today on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Televisa&#8217;s cable units, Empresas Cablevision SAB, is
spending $240 million over three years to replace its older
cables with a fiber-optic network. In the next few months, the
company will begin adopting technology called Docsis 3.0 that
will allow it to add Internet services and boost download speeds
to as much as 20 megabits a second, more than double its current
fastest offer, de Angoitia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satellite-TV division, called Sky, ended the quarter
with 2.75 million customers, up 52 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 0.5 percent to 54.77 pesos at 4:10 p.m.

&lt;p&gt;Any oil price fall should be seen as
an opportunity to buy the contract as the next move in the
market is likely to be a rally, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The signal that the next leg higher is imminent will be
tighter Dubai forward spreads and a narrower Brent-Dubai
spread,&#8221; Lawrence Eagles, head of commodity strategy in New
York, said today in a monthly oil market report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it expects the dollar to weaken by four to
five percent over the next six months, giving oil a boost. A
declining dollar increases the appeal of energy as an inflation
hedge. The strength in crude is also bolstered by rising demand
in several regions, the bank said. A narrowing spread, when
Dubai oil rises closer to North Sea Brent, typically shows
increasing Asian demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, or EFS, for December
narrowed 12 cents to $2.40 a barrel today, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates. The EFS is the price difference between
Brent futures and Dubai swaps contracts and signifies Brent&#8217;s
premium relative to the Middle East grade. The December-January
Dubai spread shrank to minus 36 cents from minus 80 cents on
Sept. 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key risk is that we are being too cautious and that
the threat of $100 a barrel oil that is implicit in our fourth-
quarter 2011 oil forecast arrives much sooner than we expect,
driven by not only a weak dollar, but also by rampant Chinese
and emerging market demand, the rebuilding of French strategic
stocks, and an upward bias to food prices,&#8221; Eagles said in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Should Be Bought&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that any setback in the crude
price should be bought,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate oil for December gained as much as
81 cents, or 1 percent, to $81.37 a barrel in electronic trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $80.91 at 9:43
a.m. London time. Yesterday it declined $1.98 to $80.56 a
barrel. The contract is down 1 percent this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it sees a growing supply deficit in oil
products in the fourth quarter. The resulting increase in
refinery runs will lead to a draw in global crude inventories
through February, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent fall in crude stocks in Cushing should soon be
reversed, widening the WTI contango and sending WTI back to a
heavy discount to dated Brent,&#8221; Eagles said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nationwide strike in France, which has halted
refineries and led to fuel shortages, will lead to a six percent
drop in demand in October unless it &#8220;drags far beyond the end
of this week,&#8221; Eagles said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. are moving investment
bankers who specialize in advising financial-services companies
to Asia as banks and insurers sell record amounts of shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura, Japan&#8217;s largest securities firm, is moving Petter Sternby to Hong Kong from London as a managing director at its
Asian financial institutions group, people with knowledge of the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surge in fundraising by banks and insurers, along with
competition for talent from smaller equity underwriters like
Barclays Plc and Daiwa Securities Group Inc., has led to a
shortage of financial institutions bankers in Asia. The region
is home to the world&#8217;s five biggest initial public offerings by
financial companies in the past 12 months, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These individuals are highly sought after and banks have
been competing against each other in the war for talent to bring
them in,&#8221; said James Carss, executive general manager of
recruitment firm Hudson&#8217;s Hong Kong office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sternby, who previously was a financial institutions banker
for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, plans to relocate to
Hong Kong from London as early as this year, the people said,
asking not to be identified before an announcement. He will
report to Dan McNamara, global co-head of the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sundeep Tucker, a spokesman for Nomura in Hong Kong,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AgriBank, AIA Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial firms are on course to raise record amounts of
money in Asia-Pacific this year, led by Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd.&#8217;s $22.1 billion initial public offering in July.
American International Group Inc. raised $17.8 billion for its
AIA Group Ltd. unit, according to a statement released by AIA
today, making it Hong Kong&#8217;s biggest-ever IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers who have been relocated include Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Peter Enns, who moved to Hong Kong from New York last month to
head the financial institutions group for Asia excluding Japan,
said spokesman Edward Naylor. Enns replaced Douglas Feagin, who
moved back to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chad Holm, the former Citigroup Inc. banker who joined Bank
of America this month, will move to Hong Kong from New York in
November to work in the Asia-Pacific FIG team. Jeff Emmanuel,
former head of equities for Australia and New Zealand at UBS AG,
moved to Hong Kong in May as managing director of the financial
institutions group, said Chris Cockerill, a spokesman for the
Swiss bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman FIG Expansion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has doubled the size of its financial
institutions group in Asia this year, and hired Bernard Teo from
Nomura in August as a managing director, a person with knowledge
of the matter said. Fred Hu and Kenneth Wong, former managing
directors at Goldman Sachs who advised financial institutions,
left this year to work in private equity, according to two
people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions including banks, insurers and
securities firms have raised a combined $171 billion in Asia
outside Japan since 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc and Daiwa are hiring bankers to compete with
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for work managing stock sales
and advising on takeovers in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays hired former JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker Helge Weiner-Trapness as Asia-Pacific head of its financial
institutions group in September. Thomas Jackamo, a former
financial institutions group banker at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, left to join Daiwa Securities last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve may purchase $2
trillion of assets to stimulate the U.S. economy and start by
announcing a fresh round of monetary easing on Nov. 3, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect an announcement of $500 billion or perhaps
slightly more over a period of about six months,&#8221; Jan Hatzius,
the New York-based chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, said
in an e-mailed note. &#8220;The key question, however, is not the
size of the first step, but how far Fed officials will
ultimately need to move to achieve their dual mandate of low
inflation and maximum sustainable employment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest economy grew at a 2 percent annual pace
in the third quarter, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the Commerce
Department&#8217;s Oct. 29 report on gross domestic product. That&#8217;s
unlikely to be strong enough to give the 14.8 million unemployed
Americans hope of finding work soon, one reason why Fed policy
makers may be about to pump more money into the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is &#8220;almost certain&#8221; to announce additional
monetary easing next month, Hatzius said. The committee may also
announce a monthly purchase rate of perhaps $100 billion that
will remain in place until the outlook for jobs and inflation
improve &#8220;significantly,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of living in the U.S. rose less than forecast in
September a report showed Oct. 15, indicating companies are
keeping a lid on price increases to stoke demand. The consumer-
price index rose 0.1 percent, compared with projections for a
0.2 percent gain, Labor Department figures showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Zero Bound&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs estimates that the &#8220;zero bound&#8221; has kept
the Fed funds rate about 700 basis points too high to achieve
the central bank&#8217;s desired inflation and unemployment levels.
Easy fiscal policy, the Fed&#8217;s first round of asset purchases and
the central bank&#8217;s commitment to hold the benchmark interest
rate near zero for an extended period have reduced that gap by
400 basis points, Hatzius wrote. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman estimates that as much as $4 trillion of additional
large-scale asset purchases might be needed to bring inflation
and unemployment into line with the Fed&#8217;s targets. That&#8217;s based
on projections that $1 trillion in asset purchases equates to a
75 basis point cut in the benchmark rate, Hatzius said in the
note dated Oct. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is unlikely to buy that much unless the economy
gets much worse, Hatzius said. The key U.S. rate has been in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. reaffirmed

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, unveiled trend-
identifying software for smartphones and tablet computers,
aiming to expand its billion-dollar analytics business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program lets businesses access analytics software on
mobile devices and share the data via social networks, IBM said
today in a statement. The software, Cognos 10, works on Research
In Motion Ltd.&#8217;s BlackBerry and Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad and iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is betting that analytics software, which identifies
and forecasts trends, will help the company boost sales as
customers look to be more efficient. IBM&#8217;s sales from analytics
should climb to $16 billion in the next five years, an increase
of almost 80 percent, the company said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of mobile workers will top 1.19 billion by 2013,
IBM said, giving analytics a wider audience. Hertz Global
Holdings Inc., the largest car-rental company, will gather
survey data from customers via text messages, and use IBM&#8217;s
software to analyze responses. Employees can then receive real-
time information on potential problems, such as wait times at
car-rental locations, and adjust accordingly. Office Depot Inc.
also is using the software to gather, analyze and report store-
performance data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 17 cents to $139.84 at
4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have climbed 6.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has spent more than $14 billion on analytics
acquisitions in the past five years, including business-
management software maker Cognos Inc. for about $5 billion, its
largest acquisition ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Mulholland" date="Oct 25, 2010  3:41 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-25/bank-of-america-goldman-marketing-2-66-billion-of-hilton-cmbs.html"><headline>Banks Market Hilton, Extended Stay Commercial-Property Debt</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Banks are marketing more than $4.6
billion of bonds tied to hotel loans, signaling increased
confidence that commercial-property investments will rebound as
the economy grows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are
selling $2.66 billion of securities backed by debt from the 2007
buyout of Hilton Worldwide in the largest sale of its kind this
year. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG are offering $2
billion of debt tied to Extended Stay Inc., the hotel operator
that exited bankruptcy this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is seeking to unload debt tied to hotels, which
have more than twice the delinquency rate of office buildings
and shopping malls, as the Federal Reserve spurs demand for
higher-risk assets by holding the benchmark interest rates near
zero to fuel the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hotels were the first ones to get rocked and in some
respects have the most upside,&#8221; said Andrew Parower, a money
manager at Marketfield Asset Management LLC, a New York-based
firm that runs a $250 million commercial-mortgage backed
securities fund. &#8220;They got beaten up so quickly and so badly.
It&#8217;s a leveraged bet on the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotels are the worst-performing property type in the
commercial-mortgage bond market after households and businesses
curbed travel budgets during the economic recession. Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service said in an Oct. 14 report that 15.94 percent
of loans tied to hotels are behind on payments. That compares
with a 6.6 percent delinquency rate on shopping centers and
malls, and a 6.4 percent rate for office buildings, according to
Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates Reset &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While delinquency rates are higher, hotel rates reset every
night, which allows operators to respond more quickly to an
improving economy, according to an Oct. 22 report from Wells
Fargo Securities LLC. Office and retail buildings may lag behind
a recovery by up to 18 months because they&#8217;re tied to longer-
term leases, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the recession ended in June 2009, defaults in
commercial real estate are still mounting, and may not peak
until 2011 or later, Standard and Poor&#8217;s said today in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP, the world&#8217;s largest private-equity
firm, bought Hilton in July 2007 near the top of the real-estate
market for about $26 billion, including assumed debt. The
transaction was financed with $20.6 billion of mortgage and
mezzanine debt and about $5.7 billion of equity from New York-
based Blackstone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilton completed a deal to reduce debt by almost $4 billion
and extend its maturity to November 2015 in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extended Stay, which filed the largest bankruptcy by a U.S.
hotel owner in 2009, exited bankruptcy this month after its
$3.93 billion sale to Centerbridge Partners LP, Paulson  Co.
and Blackstone was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt Burden &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company cut its debt burden by almost $5 billion in the
bankruptcy process, the Spartanburg, South Carolina-based
company said in an Oct. 8 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Extended Stay bonds being marketed today are secured by
664 hotels, said a person familiar with the situation, who
declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public.
California accounts for 21.8 percent of the pool, followed by
Texas with 8.33 percent and Florida with 7.02 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unrated Hilton offering matures in as soon as 2.86
years, and is comprised of interest in all the assets of Hilton
worldwide, according to a person familiar with the Hilton sale,
who also declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of bonds tied to commercial property loans are
rising, with about $5.5 billion of the debt sold in 2010, up
from $3.4 billion last year, Bloomberg data show. Issuance
tumbled 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234
billion in 2007 as the credit crisis sapped demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc., the insurer that paid back $3.4 billion in federal bailout
money, rose in New York trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
upgraded the insurer to neutral from sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartford advanced 75 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $24.70 at
10:11 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised the company&#8217;s rating because it said
Hartford&#8217;s management had a &#8220;greater command&#8221; of its capital
needs and was reducing costs. Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee, hired a year ago, returned Hartford to profitability in
the last three months of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we believe HIG remains a &#8216;show me story,&#8217; valuation
is overly compelling,&#8221; the investment firm said in a note,
referring to the stock ticker of Hartford, which is based in the
Connecticut city of the same name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal Financial Group Inc., the Des Moines, Iowa-based
life insurer, rose 70 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $27.77 after
Goldman upgraded it to buy from neutral because of anticipated
improvement in its market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Chanyaporn Chanjaroen" date="Oct 25, 2010  5:07 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-25/jpmorgan-to-start-physical-copper-exchange-traded-fund-sec-filing-shows.html"><headline>Copper Exchange-Traded Fund Planned by JPMorgan, According to SEC Filing</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to introduce an exchange-
traded fund for copper, seeking to benefit from increased
investment demand for the metal used in pipes and wires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in the J.P. Morgan Physical Copper Trust will trade
on the New York Stock Exchange &#8220;as soon as practicable&#8221;, the
New York-based bank said in a filing to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, without giving a precise date. The Wall
Street Journal reported on the bank&#8217;s filing earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs trade like stocks, enabling investors access to
commodities such as gold without taking physical delivery of
them. Commodity prices including metals and grains surged today
as investors sought alternatives to a weakening dollar. Copper
in London has gained 29 percent over the past year on declining
stockpiles, increased demand and the weaker U.S. currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a view that such an ETF would be bullish for
prices,&#8221; Peter Richardson, chief metals economist at Morgan
Stanley, said today by phone from Melbourne. &#8220;We might also see
prices that are so high that they trigger demand destruction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange
gained as much as 2.6 percent to $8,549 a metric ton today,
taking gains this year to about 16 percent. The metal reached a
record $8,940 a ton in July 2008 before the global credit crisis
drove prices to a low of $2,817.25 in December that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical Copper &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The shares are intended to provide institutional and
retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means, with
minimal credit risks, of gaining investment benefits similar to
those of holding physical copper,&#8221; said the filing, which was
dated Oct. 22. Each share will be equivalent to one-hundredth of
a ton, backed by grade-A metal, not futures, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF Securities Ltd. said on Oct. 11 that it&#8217;s preparing to
start exchange-traded commodity funds backed by six industrial
metals. Aluminum is the most likely base metal to be used to
back an exchange-traded product, according a Bloomberg News
survey of 16 analysts the same month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper stockpiles monitored by exchanges in London, New
York and Shanghai totaled 543,932 tons as of Oct. 22, down 21
percent this year. That&#8217;s about 11 days of global consumption
based on the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc estimate for
demand this year of 18.2 million tons, down from almost 14 days
at the start of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Price Reaction&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of all the base metals, copper has the lowest level of
inventory both on a historical basis but also on a stock-
consumption basis,&#8221; said Catherine Raw, a fund manager at
Blackrock Inc. who helps manage the company&#8217;s flagship $14.2
billion World Mining Fund. &#8220;We would see a price reaction&#8221; to
a copper ETF, Raw said today on a conference call in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record holdings of gold-backed, exchange-traded products
together with the rally in LME prices and low interest rates in
developed economies were encouraging banks to introduce funds
backed by base metals, said Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Richardson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold assets in exchange traded products declined 0.9 ton to
2,098 tons as of Oct. 22, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14, the same day that spot gold climbed to an all-
time high of $1,387.35 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed in February to pay $1.7 billion for RBS
Sempra Commodities LLP&#8217;s global oil and metal activities and its
European power and gas assets. Through the acquisition, the bank
inherited Henry Bath  Son Ltd., which operates commodity
warehouses worldwide, its website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for the new product will be initially held at Henry
Bath&#8217;s storage in the U.S., the so-called cheapest-to-deliver
location, JPMorgan said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woodside Petroleum Ltd. may need a
&#8220;diplomat rather than an explorer&#8221; to overcome obstacles to
developing natural gas projects after Chief Executive Officer
Don Voelte retires, Goldman Sachs  Partners Australia Pty said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s second-largest oil and gas producer will
require a &#8220;talented negotiator&#8221; to work with the East Timor
government, landowners in the Kimberley wilderness region, gas
suppliers and its largest shareholder, Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
Sydney-based Goldman analysts Aiden Bradley and Mark Wiseman
wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key to delivering value from Woodside&#8217;s resource base
will likely lie in its ability to strike deals with a wide
variety of stakeholders,&#8221; the analysts wrote in the Oct. 22
report. &#8220;The ability to cement these deals has been Woodside&#8217;s
major weakness in recent years and the reason why the share
price is currently trading closer to A$40 than A$60.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voelte, CEO since April 2004, plans to retire in the second
half of next year after the A$13 billion ($12.9 billion) Pluto
liquefied natural gas project begins production, Woodside said
Oct. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Perth-based company increased 1 percent to A$43.94 by
the 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney, compared with a 1.3 percent gain
for the benchmark SP/ASX 200 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At times, it has seemed to us that Woodside has preferred
to create a competitive rather than a collaborative environment
when dealing with some of the largest oil and gas companies in
the world,&#8221; such as Chevron Corp., the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Martin, a Woodside spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tortoise and Hare&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s gas exploration campaign has been more successful
than Woodside&#8217;s, Goldman Sachs said. Chevron, the operator of
the A$43 billion Gorgon LNG venture off northwest Australia,
appears to have enough gas to expand the project to five
processing units from three, the analysts wrote. Chevron also
may have enough gas to expand its proposed Wheatstone LNG
development to four units from two, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tortoise, at this stage in the race, looks to have
overtaken the hare,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pluto is set to become the fastest LNG venture developed,
with the initial discovery of the field in 2005, Woodside says
on its website. The company delayed a decision to expand the
project until 2011 after its exploration campaign progressed
slower than expected, Voelte, 57, said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration to support an expansion will continue next
year, and Woodside remains in talks with other gas resource
owners in the Carnarvon Basin to feed the venture, it said Oct.
22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East Timor Clash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodside has clashed with East Timor over how to develop
the Sunrise LNG project. Woodside and its partners in the $30
billion Browse LNG project early this year chose a site in the
Kimberley area to process the gas. The Western Australia state
government moved to take over the site for the venture following
the failure of local indigenous groups with claims to the land
to reach agreement, Premier Colin Barnett said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodside&#8217;s relationship with 34 percent-shareholder Shell
is expected to be another priority for a new CEO, the Goldman
analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell is a partner with Chevron in the Gorgon project, and
if The Hague-based company opts to participate in Wheatstone,
that &#8220;would potentially place it in direct competition with
Woodside&#8217;s plans to expand Pluto,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California borrowed $6.7 billion
from JPMorgan Chase  Co. and five other banks to pay delinquent
bills that piled up during the state&#8217;s record-length budget
impasse, Treasurer Bill Lockyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California, the largest U.S. issuer of municipal debt,
agreed to pay 1.4 percent to the banks, which also include
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for the bridge loan, Lockyer said. He
will repay the debt in about two weeks when he sells an
estimated $10 billion of revenue anticipation notes, a short-
term municipal bond the state offers when cash is low and repays
from later tax collections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called bridge loan was needed after the most
populous state racked up $8.4 billion of bills that couldn&#8217;t be
paid in the 100 days California was without a budget. Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the spending plan Oct. 8 after
lawmakers agreed on steps to eliminate a $19 billion deficit
brought on by the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the plan, lawmakers delayed about $5 billion of
subsidies for schools and colleges until later in the year, to
ease the cash crunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge loan is California&#8217;s second in as many years.
Lockyer borrowed $1.5 billion in August 2009 from JPMorgan at an
annual interest rate of 3 percent after a similar budget impasse
forced the state to issue IOUs to pay some bills. The loan was
repaid when Lockyer sold $8.8 billion of short-term notes a
month later and used some of the proceeds to repay the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s $3.125 billion loan was the largest of the
group, followed by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $1.5 billion. Wells Fargo 
Co. lent $1 billion, followed by $500 million from Citigroup
Inc., $325 million from Morgan Stanley and $250 million from the
Golden 1 Credit Union. The loans mature in January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. added $10 billion to a stock-buyback plan, signaling the
world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider will keep using cash
to boost per-share earnings rather than on large acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move brings the amount authorized for repurchases by
the board to $12.3 billion, Armonk, New York-based IBM said in a
statement today. In April, it authorized $8 billion in buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking over as chief executive officer in 2002, Sam Palmisano has spent more than $68 billion on buybacks, about 38
percent of IBM&#8217;s current market value. The company has said it
plans to spend about $50 billion on buybacks in the next five
years, compared with about $20 billion on acquisitions, as it
aims to almost double operating earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s crucial to their long-term EPS objectives,&#8221; said
Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher  Co. in San Francisco,
who rates the shares &#8220;neutral&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t own them. &#8220;They
realize the fact that they are a big, mature tech company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to increase operating earnings per share
to $20 by 2015, with about $2.80 coming from repurchases. The
company had $11.1 billion in cash at the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM climbed 83 cents to $140.67 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have added 7.5 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano has spent over $20 billion on more than 100
acquisitions since 2002. His largest purchase was business-
management software maker Cognos Inc. at $5 billion. Last month,
the company agreed to buy Netezza Corp. for $1.7 billion, his
sixth deal that topped $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on buying smaller companies contrasts with
competitors such as Hewlett-Packard Co., which has spent about
$50 billion over the same span on about half as many deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Palmisano criticized the rival, saying HP has
to pay too much for acquisitions because it cut back on research
and development. IBM spent about $6 billion on research last
year, double HP&#8217;s expenditure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to ask for additional buyback authorization at an
April board meeting, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s per-share earnings have increased more than 10
percent every year since 2005, while sales growth hasn&#8217;t met
that metric since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repurchases last quarter decreased the number of shares by
5 percent, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on the
company&#8217;s quarterly earnings call this month. The decline, along
with a sales increase, helped increase earnings per share by 18
percent to $2.82, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal Inc., the online-payments
processor owned by EBay Inc., introduced a mobile version of its
checkout software today as it tries to capitalize on surging
smartphone use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, holding a conference in San Francisco to
promote its service to mobile-phone and Web developers, also
unveiled a cheaper way for businesses to handle transactions of
less than $12, such as a 99-cent digital song or a single
newspaper article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more commerce moves to phones and social networks,
PayPal is racing against Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. to earn
the loyalty of programmers. Its developers, who began building
PayPal applications on smartphones, televisions and websites
last year, have generated $1 billion in payments volume for the
company. Mobile commerce will grow sixfold to $119 billion by
2015, according to ABI Research in Oyster Bay, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Developers are basically taking PayPal out to places
PayPal hasn&#8217;t been before,&#8221; said Nate Gilmore, vice president
of marketing and business development at Shipwire Inc., a Palo
Alto, California-based company that helps merchants store and
ship products. &#8220;This does for commerce application development
what online banking did for consumers or what the ATM did for
banking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook&#8217;s Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest social-networking
company, endorsed the new technology at the conference. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook&#8217;s chief operating officer, said her company
will use PayPal to pay its developers and adopt the new version
on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal estimates it controls about 10 percent of the online
payments market, ranking behind Visa and MasterCard. It
generated $22.4 billion in payments volume last quarter and
accounts for 37 percent of total revenue at San Jose,
California-based EBay. PayPal is outstripping growth at its
parent company, which expects online payments eventually to
become its biggest business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal gave developers more access to its software last
year, letting them build PayPal apps across the Web. The
platform, called PayPal X, has attracted 50,000 programmers and
1,000 applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile Payment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its mobile express checkout, which has been tested by
companies such as Nike Inc. and Buy.com Inc., will become
available to all merchants, PayPal said. The micropayments
product will let merchants collect low-dollar purchases until a
certain volume is reached, at which point PayPal will charge a
single processing fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That helps businesses lower their costs. Processing fees
for items less than $12 typically account for a large percentage
of the purchase price, making it unattractive for merchants to
accept credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest handler of payments, said
yesterday that it will give developers free tools to build
applications on a variety of devices through its Authorize.net
platform. Visa is afraid of losing developers to PayPal, said
Bill Smead, an EBay investor who oversees $160 million at Smead
Capital Management in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Visa doesn&#8217;t get them now, they will be gotten by
PayPal,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under President Scott Thompson, PayPal has forged
partnerships with Microsoft Corp. and International Business
Machines Corp. to help developers build payments apps.
Yesterday, PayPal bolstered its management team, hiring Sitel
Corp.&#8217;s Patrick Dupuis as chief financial officer. EBay Chief
Executive Officer John Donahoe said last year that he was open
to the idea of spinning off PayPal someday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We saw as early as last fall PayPal was going to take a
leadership role in mobile commerce,&#8221; said Scott Schwarzhoff,
vice president of marketing at Appcelerator Inc., which helps
businesses such as MTV and Budweiser build mobile apps. &#8220;We&#8217;re
enabling them to go a heck of a lot faster into mobile than they
can on their own.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore Exchange Ltd., which
agreed yesterday to buy Australia&#8217;s main stock-exchange operator,
was downgraded by JPMorgan Chase  Co., Credit Suisse Group AG
and Deutsche Bank AG. The stock slumped to a five-week low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reduced SGX to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight,&#8221;
citing the vulnerability of its share price to regulatory issues
related to the bid for ASX Ltd., and the higher indebtedness
that would result. Credit Suisse cut its rating to
&#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;outperform,&#8221; saying ASX&#8217;s growth
profile makes it unappealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enlarged company would oversee two separate markets
with almost $2 trillion of shares, making it better able to
compete with Hong Kong and Tokyo, and electronic trading
platform Chi-X Global Inc, which plans to open in Australia in
March. The cash-and-stock deal, worth A$8.09 billion ($8.01
billion) as of yesterday&#8217;s closing prices, faces regulatory
scrutiny in both countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The price SGX offered is a bit shocking,&#8221; said Mark Tan,
a Singapore-based fund manager at UOB Asset Management Ltd.,
which oversees about $12 billion including Singapore Exchange
shares. &#8220;Australia is a mature market with slower growth
potential yet such a big premium was offered. Perhaps that&#8217;s the
only way they can convince shareholders to agree to the deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Exchange shares closed 2.6 percent lower at
S$8.72, the lowest level since Sept. 22. That extended a 6.2
percent drop yesterday, the biggest decline in two years, when
the deal was announced. A reduction in the stock lowers the
value of the transaction&#8217;s stock component. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Bid Premium &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed takeover is more than twice the average
premium of buyouts among publicly traded financial companies
around the world in the past 12 months, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the merger are &#8220;not compelling given
integration risks, financial leverage and the absence of clear
revenue upside potential,&#8221; Andrew Hill, a Deutsche Bank analyst,
wrote in a report yesterday. He cut his rating on Singapore
Exchange to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASX shares, which jumped 19 percent yesterday, fell 7.4
percent, the most in 20 months, to A$38.67 in Sydney today as
political opposition to the agreement mounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greens Party, whose votes Prime Minister Julia Gillard
needs to pass legislation, &#8220;will not be facilitating or
supporting this takeover,&#8221; leader Bob Brown told reporters
today in Canberra, while opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey said the offer was &#8220;of great concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confident Of Approval &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Monetary Authority of Singapore will study the details
of the merger proposal when they are submitted, it said in an e-
mailed statement today. The central bank&#8217;s Financial Sector
Development Fund has a 23.5 percent non-voting stake in
Singapore Exchange through a holding company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect SGX to trade on ebb and flow of regulatory
stance on merger rather than volumes traded,&#8221; the JPMorgan
analysts led by Harsh Wardhan Modi wrote in a report dated
yesterday. &#8220;Despite accretive bottom-line on debt-funded deal,
we expect the stock to decline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASX CEO Robert Elstone said yesterday at a media briefing
in Sydney that the merger was in the interests of both countries,
and that the companies are confident that they&#8217;ll win
regulators&#8217; approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both parties appear to have done the groundwork with
regard to regulatory approvals required in both countries,&#8221;
Credit Suisse analysts led by Anand Swaminathan wrote in a
report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the rationale for SGX&#8217;s bid, valued at A$8.4
billion when it was announced, is &#8220;unconvincing&#8221; they said.
&#8220;ASX is not attractive in terms of profitability and growth
profile. It is also set to face stiff margin pressure due to
competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, is marketing
50-year debt to individual investors as returns on long-dated
bonds exceed those on shorter-maturity securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs plans to sell $250 million of notes maturing
in November 2060 this week, according to a person familiar with
the transaction. The $25 face value notes will be non-callable
for five years and be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the
New York-based bank said yesterday in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company debt maturing in more than 15 years has rallied
14.4 percent this year, beating the 5 percent return on notes
due in one to three years, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. The longer securities have faltered this month
amid speculation Federal Reserve efforts to spur the economy may
reignite inflation. That is likely to be a temporary reversal,
said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist and economist at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Concerns of resurgent inflation are pretty overblown,&#8221;
LeBas said. &#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely appetite for long bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer-dated corporate bonds have lost 1 percent this
month, compared with a 0.4 percent gain on the shorter debt,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Corporates,
15+ Yrs index and U.S. Corporates, 1-3 Yrs index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
company debt instead of Treasuries fell 2 basis points to 179
basis points yesterday, and yields dropped 2 basis points to
3.62 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S.
Corporate Master index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Rural &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corp. led
companies issuing $1.8 billion of bonds yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private, nonprofit cooperate association issued $300
million of three-year notes and $350 million of five-year notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. National Rural
Utilities provides members, primarily rural electric utility
systems in the U.S., with a source of financing to supplement
the loan programs of the Rural Utilities Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGM Resorts International, the biggest casino operator on
the Las Vegas Strip, issued $500 million of six-year notes, the
day&#8217;s only high-yield, high-risk debt sale, Bloomberg data show.
High-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk Spreads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on speculative-grade debt narrowed 6 basis points
to 590 basis points yesterday, while yields were down 4 basis
points to 7.7 percent, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. The yield is the lowest
since June 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; notes may yield 6.125 percent to 6.25
percent, said the person familiar with the offering, who
declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People will take 6.25 percent out to infinity these
days,&#8221; LeBas said of the sale. &#8220;They&#8217;re aiming this at yield-
hungry buyers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt will be marketed to individual investors,
according to a second person familiar with the transaction, who
declined to be identified before the debt is priced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a description of at least $7.39 billion of
pending sales of dollar-denominated bonds in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Grade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., the biggest securities firm by
revenue, plans to sell $250 million of 50-year bonds in an
offering directed toward individual investors, according to a
person familiar with the transaction. The debt due November 2060
may yield 6.125 percent to 6.25 percent, said the person, who
declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. The
securities will be sold in $25 denominations and can&#8217;t be
called, or redeemed, for five years, the New York-based bank
said in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAUDI BASIC INDUSTRIES CORP., the world&#8217;s largest
petrochemicals maker, plans to sell five-year, dollar-
denominated bonds to refinance debt, Chief Financial Officer
Mutlaq al-Morished said. The notes may yield &#8220;in the high 100
basis-point range&#8221; over the benchmark mid-swap rate, according
to two people with knowledge of the sale. HSBC Holdings Plc,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are
managing the issue and the notes will be sold through SABIC I
BV., said the people, who declined to be identified because the
terms haven&#8217;t been set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KOREA GAS CORP., the world&#8217;s biggest buyer of liquefied
natural gas, plans to raise as much as $1 billion from dollar-
denominated bonds to fund overseas investments, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter. The Seongnam-based company,
which hired five banks to help it sell notes, plans to hold
investor meetings in Asia, said the person, declining to name
the banks and asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential. Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and UBS AG arranged the meetings, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRANSNET LTD., South Africa&#8217;s state-owned ports, rail and
pipeline operator, said it may sell $1 billion worth of bonds in
international markets to pay for expansion. Transnet has 35.2
billion rand ($5 billion) of debt outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Rated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP PARIBAS HOME LOAN COVERED BONDS SA plans to sell five-
year notes in dollars, according to two people with knowledge of
the sale. Barclays Capital, Bank of America Corp. and Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc are managing the sale with BNP Paribas,
said the people, who declined to be identified because terms
aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRAVELLERS INTERNATIONAL HOTEL GROUP INC., the Philippines
casino operator owned by Alliance Global Group Inc. and Genting
Hong Kong Ltd., hired UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Banco de Oro
Unibank Inc. to help it sell seven-year dollar bonds, according
to a person familiar with the offering who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA LTD., the owner of PR Newswire and
publisher of InformationWeek, plans to sell $500 million of 10-
year notes, according to two people with knowledge of the
offering. Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC
Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are managing the sale,
said the people, who declined to be identified because terms
aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WII COMPONENTS INC., the manufacturer of wood cabinet doors
owned by Behrman Capital LP, plans to sell $115 million of
senior secured five-year notes, the company said in an Oct. 25
statement distributed by Business Wire. The notes may be used to
help fund a tender for outstanding 10 percent senior securities
due 2012, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STERICYCLE INC. plans to issue $175 million of seven-year,
3.89 percent notes and $225 million of 10-year, 4.47 percent
debt after receiving informal commitments from 22 institutional
investors to buy the securities, it said in a statement
distributed by Business Wire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Yield &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIKING ACQUISITION INC., the Avista Capital Partners-owned
entity that&#8217;s buying Clorox Co.&#8217;s auto-care business, plans to
sell $250 million of notes to pay for the acquisition, according
to a statement from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Moody&#8217;s assigned
the senior unsecured debt a grade of Caa1, according to the
statement. Standard  Poor&#8217;s rates the securities due in 2018 an
equivalent CCC+, it said on Oct. 21. Avista Capital Partners is

&#8220;no-deal roadshow&#8221; to gauge international investors&#8217; appetite,

general of the financial and economic policy department of
Mongolia, said at a forum in Ulan Bator on June 16. The

Europe&#8217;s debt crisis drove up borrowing costs. Investment banks
are advising Mongolia to issue debt with maturities of 5 years
to 10 years, Finance Minister Sangajav Bayartsogt said in a Feb.
9 interview. The securities may yield 8 percent to 11 percent,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of exchange-traded
funds for base metals won&#8217;t have a long-term impact on prices,
according to a report today from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Thomas Black" date="Oct 26, 2010  2:09 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-26/coca-cola-femsa-begins-coffee-dispenser-business-in-mexico.html"><headline>Coca-Cola Femsa Begins Coffee-Dispenser Business in Mexico</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the largest
soft-drink bottler in Latin America, plans to install as many as
35,000 coffee machines in corner stores in Mexico under the
brand name Blak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa is competing with Switzerland&#8217;s Nestle SA
to sell coffee products such as cappuccino and latte, said
Javier Astaburuaga, chief financial officer of parent company
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, known as Femsa. The Mexico City-
based bottler is setting up the dispensers in cities where it
delivers Coca-Cola Co. products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that in Mexico, even though Nestle has a very
strong presence in this segment, there are opportunities for us
because of our direct service to corner stores,&#8221; Astaburuaga
said in an interview in Monterrey late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incursion into the coffee market is part of Coca-Cola
Femsa&#8217;s push into non-carbonated drinks in cooperation with the
world&#8217;s biggest soft-drink maker. The Mexican company, which has
a 50-50 partnership with Coca-Cola, said on Oct. 14 it signed an
agreement for exclusive talks to purchase Grupo Industrias
Lacteas, a maker of dairy products in Panama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa fell 1.5 percent to 95.19 pesos in Mexico
trading yesterday, paring its gain this year to 10.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jugos del Valle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Coca-Cola Femsa purchased Mexico&#8217;s second-largest
juicemaker Jugos del Valle and has since increased sales to
Latin America in a partnership with the region&#8217;s bottlers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa began a pilot program for coffee last year
and will have 5,000 dispensers in Mexico City by December,
Astaburuaga said. That number could jump by five to seven times
over the next two to four years in Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s territories
in Mexico, he said. The company will determine after the first
quarter how quickly it will roll out the machines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I anticipate it will be aggressive,&#8221; Astaburuaga said,
referring to the speed of expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Blak coffee brand follows the Jugos del Valle model
and other Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico join the partnership, the
number of dispensers may increase to 50,000 or 60,000, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astaburuaga declined to say how much sales the coffee
business may generate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Kwok said he may agree to
leave Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. if his brothers offer him a
&#8220;reasonable price,&#8221; more than HK$20 billion, the South China
Morning Post reported, citing an interview with Kwok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HK$20 billion they&#8217;d offered to remove him as a
beneficiary of of a key trust controlling the family&#8217;s assets,
including a 42.4 percent stake in Sun Hung Kai Properties, &#8220;is
not a fair valuation,&#8221; Kwok said, as cited by the Hong Kong-
based English-language newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwok said he&#8217;s willing to go back into company managment if
his two younger brothers want him to, and if not he&#8217;s willing to
negotiate the buyout price, the Post said. He also wants
clarification as to whether his children are still trust
beneficiaries, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun Hung Kai Properties declined to comment on Kwok&#8217;s
remarks and said the contents of an Oct. 4 press release are
still valid, the Post said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. is a better
stock investment than Apple Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Google Inc. or
any of the largest multinational companies, according to analyst
recommendations compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY shows the South Korean electronics
maker has a 4.9 investment rating out of a possible 5, based on
40 analyst recommendations compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung is
followed by Coca-Cola&#8217;s 4.78 rating and Apple&#8217;s 4.75 in the Dow
Jones Global Titans Index, which tracks the 50 biggest companies
based on market capitalization outside of China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, the world&#8217;s top maker of televisions, memory
chips, flat screens and the No. 2 producer of mobile phones, is
better positioned to capitalize on a recovery in the global
economy because of its range of products, said Hwang Yu Sik, a
Seoul-based analyst at SK Securities Co. The company may widen
its lead as it invests 26 trillion won ($23 billion) this year,
more than any technology company, for upgrading its production
facilities and on research and development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that the company
continues to have growth potential,&#8221; said Hwang, who has a
"buy" rating on Samsung. &#8220;They&#8217;re retaining top-tier positions
in various sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung&#8217;s ability to develop products that can compete with
such devices as Google TV and Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone will make it
competitive next year, mitigating a risk from fluctuations in
chip prices, Hwang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung&#8217;s stock, which closed at 763,000 won in Seoul
yesterday, appears to be cheap, based on its earnings and market
capitalization, said Han Seung Hoon, who has a "buy" rating on
Samsung as an analyst at Korea Investment  Securities Co. in Seoul. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG are the only brokers that
have ratings equivalent to "hold" on Samsung, with the remaining
38 having "buy" ratings, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks tumbled, snapping a
five-day gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as investors
speculated that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s efforts to shore up the
economy will be gradual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. each dropped 1.3 percent
after metal and oil prices declined as the U.S. dollar rose to a
one-week high against the euro. Sprint Nextel Corp. slumped 9.9
percent after posting a wider-than-estimated loss. Broadcom
Corp. jumped 12 percent as quarterly revenue beat analysts&#8217;
predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slid 0.3 percent to 1,182.45 as of 4 p.m. in
New York. Futures extended losses before the open of exchanges
after the Commerce Department reported that orders for U.S. non-
military capital equipment excluding airplanes dropped in
September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 43.18 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 11,126.28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have been waiting for consistently better
economic growth,&#8221; said John Carey, a Boston-based money manager
at Pioneer Investments, which oversees about $250 billion.
&#8220;Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve had more of the same -- mixed data.
There&#8217;s also hope that the Fed action will be gradual. Too much,
too soon could be a problem with respect to inflation and
interest rates down the road. Stocks have had a nice run so
maybe some people are taking profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. is researching a way to cut electronic devices&#8217; power
consumption by 90 percent and reduce so-called vampire energy,
or power used while machines and gadgets are turned off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s Zurich laboratory is developing a transistor that
would regulate energy usage more tightly than the current
models, preventing energy from being used when devices are left
plugged into an electrical outlet, the Armonk, New York-based
company said today in a statement. It&#8217;s working on the project
with European universities and companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing power consumption in products with transistors,
which includes supercomputers, laptops and smartphones, would
help companies and home consumers reduce energy bills, said
Adrian Ionescu, a professor in the nanotechnology lab at Ecole
Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland, who is
working with IBM on the project. It also would stretch battery
life in mobile devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Instead of having to recharge your battery after two
days, you might extend that to weeks,&#8221; Ionescu said in a phone
interview yesterday. &#8220;Imagine your laptop lasting 10 times
longer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power from machines in standby mode cost U.S. households a
total of $3 billion in 2005, according to the most recent
Department of Energy figures, IBM said. Energy used by
information technologies and consumer electronics will double by
2022 and triple by 2030 to 1,700 terawatt-hours, the company
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile Devices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will last about three years, followed by
several years of development and trials, said Heike Riel, who
helps lead nanotechnology research at IBM&#8217;s Zurich lab.
Consumers would have products with the new transistors in 2015
&#8220;at the earliest,&#8221; Riel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing power needed in mobile devices such as smartphones
may allow use of alternative energy sources such as solar,
Ionescu said. Mobile devices currently require more power than
such energy sources can provide, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, spends
about $6 billion, or about 6 percent of total revenue, on
research and development each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 76 cents to $141.43 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 8 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said the country&#8217;s central bank followed conflict of
interest guidelines when it hired an adviser from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloc Quebecois lawmaker Daniel Paille and Thomas Mulcair of
the New Democratic Party both asked about the hiring of Timothy Hodgson for an 18-month term. Flaherty said in response that the
bank makes its own staffing decisions and that Hodgson has
&#8220;severed&#8221; his ties to the private sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Mark Carney and Hodgson worked together at Goldman
Sachs in New York from 1998-2000, and Hodgson was hired by the
central bank this year to work on developing rules for trading
repurchase agreements and over-the-counter derivatives, and
regulations to ensure banks have enough capital. Carney told
opposition lawmakers during committee testimony yesterday
employees are bound by a code of conduct and a conflict of
interest policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a question of the revolving door back to the private
sector,&#8221; Mulcair said today while asking questions of Flaherty,
adding that Hodgson&#8217;s contract has no &#8220;cooling-off period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any appearance of conflict of interest in our democratic
institutions undermines the public&#8217;s trust,&#8221; Mulcair said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flaherty replied by saying &#8220;the person in question has
severed his ties with the private sector&#8221; and &#8220;the Bank of
Canada makes its own hiring decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Canada spokesman Jeremy Harrison said that Hodgson
&#8220;has resigned from Goldman Sachs, severed all ties, divested
himself of all his holdings of Goldman Sachs stock and placed
his other investments in a blind trust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank&#8217;s conflict-of-interest policy will appropriately
limit his activities upon his departure,&#8221; Harrison said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to
acquire a majority stake in Brazil&#8217;s Gavea Investimentos Ltda.,
the fund manager founded by former Brazilian central banker
Arminio Fraga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavea will sell 55 percent of its operations, including its
entire private banking unit, to the New York-based lender, Gavea
partner Amaury Bier said today in a telephone interview from Sao
Paulo. JPMorgan may acquire a further 22.5 percent within three
years, and another 22.5 percent in five, Bier said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavea, which runs private-equity and hedge funds, manages
about $6 billion and has 119 employees, according to the firm&#8217;s
website. JPMorgan will initially pay $270 million, and the total
amount may reach $1 billion, Brazil&#8217;s Valor Economico newspaper
said today, without citing the source of the information. Those
prices are &#8220;speculations,&#8221; Bier said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The value will depend on our performance and will go as
far as the eye can see, as long as it would be reasonable,&#8221;
Bier said. &#8220;The value of resources managed by Gavea will fall
by about $1 billion, which is from private banking, to about $5
billion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Highbridge Capital Management struck the deal,
which is expected to be completed &#8220;shortly,&#8221; the companies
said in a statement today that didn&#8217;t disclose terms. The firm,
which will remain independent, will be called Highbridge Gavea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists project Brazil&#8217;s economic growth will more than
double that of the U.S. this year, helping the country attract
so much capital the government imposed taxes on foreign
investors to stem a currency rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Direct Exposure&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gavea brings strategy and geographic diversification to
Highbridge,&#8221; said Glenn Dubin, co-founder and chief executive
officer of Highbridge, in an interview. &#8220;We had virtually no
exposure to Brazil, and now we have the most valuable local
partner imaginable there.&#8221; Fraga also brings an expertise in
macro investing to Highbridge and will manage a portion of
Highbridge&#8217;s $6 billion multi-strategy hedge fund. Fraga will
also sit on Highbridge&#8217;s investment committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavea, founded by Fraga in 2003, has offices in his native
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. A former fund manager for
billionaire George Soros, he has been in talks with the bank
since at least February, a person with knowledge of the
negotiations said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are expanding internationally to tap faster-growing economies. Brazil&#8217;s gross domestic product is forecast
to jump 7.1 percent this year, according to the median estimate
of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That compares with 2.7
percent for the U.S., based on estimates from 65 economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;International Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International sales and service have been more profitable
for JPMorgan, which derived 24.5 percent of net revenue from
overseas markets last year and 61.6 percent of profits. In
February, it expanded its global commodities-trading unit by
agreeing to purchase parts of RBS Sempra Commodities LLP for
$1.7 billion. That same month, the bank said it plans to double
a 4 percent share of the Asian market over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon, 54, has also made expanding in the
emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China a priority
by appointing Heidi Miller to the new position of head of
JPMorgan International in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has a &#8220;good presence&#8221; internationally, Miller
said when she took the job. &#8220;The question is, can we accelerate
growth plans in Asia, can we accelerate what&#8217;s going to be
growth in emerging Europe and Latin America?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s our goal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraga, 53, was central bank president from 1999 to 2003. He
named his fund after a Rio de Janeiro neighborhood that is
partially covered by tropical rain forest and is home to
Brazil&#8217;s only urban national park. He is a member of JPMorgan&#8217;s
International Council, which advises the bank on global
business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hungarian bonds fell, pushing the
five-year yield to its highest in more than a month, and the
forint weakened for a second day after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said the country&#8217;s deficit-reduction plan is &#8220;unsustainable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the local-currency note due in 2015 jumped 13
basis points to 6.886 percent, its highest since Sept. 20, as of
10:35 a.m. in Budapest. The forint dropped as much as 0.6
percent and traded 0.3 percent weaker at 275.24 per euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary&#8217;s plan to curb its fiscal deficit with new taxes
may hurt the economic recovery, will fail to bring down the
country&#8217;s borrowing costs, and won&#8217;t improve risk perceptions,
Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at Goldman Sachs,
wrote in a research report to clients late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fiscal adjustment based on one-off taxes is ultimately
unsustainable and potentially negative for growth,&#8221; Polan
wrote. &#8220;From the fundamental perspective, this means that the
government may find it difficult to achieve a lasting reduction
in the risk premium and long-term interest rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynas Corp., building a A$550
million ($535 million) rare earths project in Australia, fell to
the lowest in three weeks in Sydney trading after JPMorgan Chase
 Co. downgraded the stock following recent gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynas dropped 6.7 percent to A$1.45 at the 4:10 p.m. close
in Sydney to the lowest since Oct. 5. The Sydney-based company&#8217;s
shares have dropped 17 percent since reaching a record on Oct.
21. Alkane Resources Ltd., which is seeking to develop a project
to produce the minerals used in hybrid cars and wind turbines,
declined 11 percent to 76 Australian cents.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They can&#8217;t keep running like that,&#8221; Lucinda Chan,
division director and head of Asian business at Macquarie
Private Wealth in Sydney said by phone. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen trading
play in there without a doubt and there&#8217;s been a lot of talk of
rare earths, their strength and the Chinese market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market values of companies with rare earth assets have
doubled and tripled since July when China, the world&#8217;s biggest
supplier, said it would cut shipments by 72 percent in the
second half. Lynas is developing the Mt. Weld project, with
first output due next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Time to let project delivery catch up with the share
price,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by Alistair Reid said yesterday
in a report, cutting the bank&#8217;s rating on Lynas to &#8220;neutral&#8221;
from &#8220;overweight.&#8221; The project &#8220;remains at risk from
unforeseen cost inflation and-or commissioning delays.
Importantly, we believe the current share price is already
factoring in much of the upside from successful commissioning,&#8221;
they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave it to tiny Singapore to tell
us where the global economy is heading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to look to the gargantuan U.S. economy for guidance
on financial trends. After Wall Street&#8217;s collapse, we turned to
the Group of 20 nations. More insight might be gleaned looking
at an island nation with 5 million people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a place with no natural resources and a
state-capitalism model is a global bellwether will strike many
as absurd. Yet Singapore Exchange Ltd.&#8217;s attempted takeover of
Australia&#8217;s stock exchange shows how Asia&#8217;s money is changing
the face of finance and geopolitics as we know it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Exchange&#8217;s A$8.1 billion ($7.9 billion) bid for
ASX Ltd. might not go through amid an outcry from Australian
lawmakers. It almost doesn&#8217;t matter. The point is that fast-
growing and cash-rich Asia is about to go shopping in ways that
might shock the biggest developed economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transaction is full of chutzpah. Singapore&#8217;s stock
market is half the size of Australia&#8217;s and the deal looks
expensive. The real issue is ambition. Singapore is clearly
prepared to spend big to get economies of scale that don&#8217;t come
naturally. Expect more of this dynamic in Asia -- even from
smaller countries that get little attention globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will the West respond when China, Japan and India go on
a mergers-and-acquisitions tear? And those are just Asia&#8217;s three
biggest economies. Executives from Seattle to London should also
expect more phone calls from acquisitive companies in South
Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and sovereign wealth fund
managers everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Wave &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has been scooping up energy assets around the globe,
and has $2.6 trillion of reserves to accelerate the campaign. It
seeks to leapfrog over the years needed to build domestic
corporate powerhouses. In today&#8217;s world, it&#8217;s easier to buy a
chunk of International Business Machines Corp. than create and
cultivate brands over time. As the yuan rises, tech leaders like
Nokia Oyj or Motorola Inc. become cheaper for mainland
executives. Why censor Google Inc. when you can just own it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next wave of globalization features developing nations
buying the crown jewels of developed ones, and it will be messy.
In 2005, the U.S. Congress freaked out when China&#8217;s CNOOC Ltd.
bid for oil company Unocal Corp. and scuttled the deal. Just
wait until China sets its sights on Boeing Co., Microsoft Corp.
or Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Envy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last name has long been coveted in Asia. Government
officials in Tokyo and Seoul crave having globally known, savvy
and profitable financial leaders. That tends to be code for
having their own Goldman. Now, Asia could just buy the real
thing. Well, try to at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s hard to believe developed-market lawmakers would let
many household names fall easily into Asian hands. Creative
attempts would be made to explain why Pacific Investment
Management Co. being acquired by foreigners poses a national-
security threat. Or why Apple Inc. or cable news network CNN
must remain American concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind how these arguments might run afoul of World
Trade Organization rules. The next few years will see a
disorienting flurry of takeover bids from Brasilia to Beijing,
putting politicians in unprecedented positions. Nationalistic
tendencies will collide with globalization as never before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore helped prove the point that Asia has money at a
time when others don&#8217;t. Its investment firms in recent years
took stakes in Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Barclays Plc and others,
shoring up some of capitalism&#8217;s biggest names. Bidding for
Australia&#8217;s ASX is the next logical step and a reminder that
Singapore&#8217;s long game is worth watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bet on Gambling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take casinos, which are suddenly the rage in conservative
Singapore. The government realized it had to let its hair down
to net more of the tourism dollars flowing elsewhere in Asia.
Welcoming casino-resorts run by Genting Singapore Plc and Las
Vegas Sands Corp. was a gamble that is clearly working. So was
revamping downtown to host Formula One races. Tourist arrivals
are exploding, and other Asian capitals are racing to emulate
Singapore&#8217;s success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore is working to reinvent itself as a biotechnology
hub with reasonably liberal immigration laws to feed its
development. Its transparent financial system has been a magnet
for hedge funds setting up shop in Asia. The ASX bid is
recognition that Singapore can&#8217;t grow much beyond its domestic
market and must look outward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunities Abound &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia wants to avoid Japan&#8217;s arrogant and ill-considered
purchases during the bubble years. Buying Rockefeller Center and
the Pebble Beach golf course didn&#8217;t work out so well for
investors. Officials and executives in Singapore, Beijing, New
Delhi and Seoul must avoid the temptation for such vanity deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunities abound, though. Several governments are
sitting on hundreds of billions of reserves and companies are
hoarding cash. Add the desire to grow economies and corporate
balance sheets and you have a clear recipe for expansion -- and
a huge one as Asia floods markets with more equity than ever
amid booming demand for initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shopping spree will shake up the global power balance
like rarely before. Perhaps nowhere is this huge shift more
apparent than in tiny Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years after unveiling a plan to
shift into cloud computing, Microsoft Corp. may finally be
making headway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s then-Chief Technology Officer Ray Ozzie penned
a memo in October 2005, saying the company was at risk if it
didn&#8217;t reinvent itself as a provider of software and computing
services over the Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heeding the warning, Microsoft has signed up customers
including Toyota Motor Corp., 3M Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp.
for its cloud product. By March, 90 percent of the company&#8217;s
engineers will be working on cloud-related products, says Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. And the server unit may
generate $10 billion in annual revenue from cloud services in a
decade, says Microsoft President Bob Muglia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will see those numbers and more,&#8221; Muglia said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are learning more about the cloud strategy at a
conference today at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Redmond,
Washington, where Microsoft is highlighting tools that make it
easier to move applications to the cloud. In a report due after
the market closes today, Microsoft will say net income rose 34
percent last quarter to $4.8 billion, or 55 cents a share, as
sales gained 22 percent, according to analysts&#8217; predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trailing Amazon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further progress in cloud computing will hinge on whether
Microsoft can narrow Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s lead. Microsoft in
November released its flagship cloud product, Azure, which
stores and runs customers&#8217; programs in its own server farms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That came three years after market leader Amazon introduced
a suite of cloud services that let companies rent, rather than
buy, servers -- the powerful machines that run networks and
handle complex computing tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Microsoft ranks high in surveys asking chief
information officers which cloud vendors they plan to use, said
Sarah Friar, a software analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Microsoft is doing well from a cloud perspective is
they are enterprise class and understand what it means to both
sell to large enterprise but also meet all their requirements,&#8221;
said Friar, who is based in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach won over Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota. The
automaker is using Azure to track the 2,000 calls daily that
come into the Lexus roadside and crash assistance service. The
program took days to implement, compared with weeks for an
internal database, said Glen Matejka, a Toyota manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M Cut Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M, whose products range from Post-It notes to flu tests,
uses Azure to host a new program, called Visual Attention
Service, that lets website designers assess which parts of a
site catch the human eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, halved costs by
entrusting the program to Microsoft&#8217;s machines instead of its
own, said Jim Graham, technical lead for the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing can make it affordable for companies to
tackle projects that previously would have required purchasing
and maintaining tens of thousands of servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Look at the so-called quants on Wall Street,&#8221; said
Microsoft General Manager Bill Hilf. &#8220;They say, &#8216;I want to ask
a question, but it&#8217;s going to take me 20,000 servers to
answer.&#8221; Each time that happens, banks don&#8217;t want to build a
new server farm. They want to just access those machines as
needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hedging Our Bets&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting customers on board wasn&#8217;t easy. During Microsoft&#8217;s
mid-year reviews, a series of meetings in hotel ballrooms near
Microsoft&#8217;s campus early this year, executives got a sobering
message from sales staff, Muglia said. Customers weren&#8217;t
convinced Microsoft took its cloud push seriously, Muglia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we talked about choice, what they heard was we were
hedging our bets,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sales chief Kevin Turner decided that the pitch
needed to change. Rather than discussing various options,
Microsoft&#8217;s sales force has altered its pitch to &#8220;lead with the
cloud&#8221; and now focuses customer meetings on cloud technologies,
Muglia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are powerful new platforms that are creating a wave
of new opportunity,&#8221; Ballmer said at Microsoft&#8217;s developer
conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s biggest challenge in cloud computing may come
from Seattle-based Amazon. The online-commerce provider
generates about $500 million in sales from cloud services, more
than five times Microsoft&#8217;s cloud-related revenue, according to
Friar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon&#8217;s Goal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said Amazon Web Services, which
includes the company&#8217;s cloud services, will eventually be as
large as its electronic-commerce business, which makes up 97
percent of sales. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft discloses cloud-
related revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 23 cents to $26.28 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among small and medium-sized businesses, 77 percent 
surveyed by Goldman Sachs said they used Amazon, compared with
10 percent for Microsoft and 17 percent apiece for Google Inc.
and Salesforce.com Inc. Larger businesses reported 12 percent
use for Microsoft, compared with 18 percent for Salesforce and
11 percent for Google. Amazon wasn&#8217;t included in that survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon isn&#8217;t encountering a lot of competition when it bids
for customers, said Adam Selipsky, an Amazon vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re really not being told by customers or prospects
about material adoption of broad cloud offerings that are
currently out there from other vendors,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. started offering
cloud programs in March that let businesses develop and store
programs in IBM data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware Inc., a software maker, has an edge over Microsoft
in so-called private clouds, which store programs in a company&#8217;s
own servers, Friar said. And Google and Salesforce have some
high-end features Azure lacks, according to David Smith, an
analyst at Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling software as a service may also squeeze Microsoft&#8217;s
profit margins because it entails additional costs of operating
data centers to run customer programs, Friar says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the company should be able to generate more revenue
from cloud products than for its regular software, Muglia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud products, which are sold as a subscription, may help
Microsoft get more customers on multiyear agreements. Those make
revenue flow more predictably and lessen reliance on the
vagaries of product cycles and computer upgrades, Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catching Up? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may not lag behind rivals long, Goldman Sachs
research suggests. When the firm&#8217;s analysts asked companies
about the future, 29 percent listed Microsoft in their cloud
purchasing plans. IBM came in second, with 25 percent,
Salesforce racked up 24 percent and Google garnered 20 percent.
Amazon trailed, with 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muglia likens the advent of cloud computing to the shift
away from mainframes toward personal computers and servers. He
says he doesn&#8217;t want to see Microsoft consigned to a role as
leader in a has-been technology, citing IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The threat is that we become like IBM is on the
mainframe,&#8221; Muglia said. &#8220;People still use mainframes an awful
lot, but it&#8217;s not where the future lies. I just have no interest
in running the Microsoft mainframe business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia selected Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Merrill Lynch and eight more advisers for a planned $59
billion of asset sales in the next five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG are also on the list, along with Moscow-based Renaissance Capital, VTB Capital, VEB and Russian Auction House,
the government said in an order signed on Oct. 25 and posted
today on its website. UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and Barclays
Capital are among the foreign banks who lost out, along with
local brokerage Troika Dialog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For those banks on the list, it can be a golden egg,&#8221;
said Peter Westin, chief strategist at Aton Capital in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia plans to sell as much as 15 percent of OAO Rosneft,
its biggest oil producer, as the government seeks to raise 1.8
trillion rubles ($59 billion) in asset sales over five years to
help balance the budget. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin&#8217;s
government approved the plan to sell stakes in about 900
companies, including lenders OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, First
Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on October 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shuvalov said yesterday the list of banks should be
enlarged. &#8220;We have 900 projects,&#8221; Shuvalov told reporters in
Moscow. &#8220;We need more banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Jordan, country head of UBS, said the Swiss bank
still hoped to work with the Russian government on
privatizations. &#8220;It&#8217;s my understanding there may be an
additional list and we would hope to be on it,&#8221; said Jordan by
phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Deficit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will use some of the revenue to narrow its
deficit to 1.8 trillion rubles, or 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product, in 2011 from an estimated 5.3 percent this year. Russia
had a shortfall of 5.9 percent last year, its first deficit in a
decade, after the economy posted its biggest contraction on
record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to reduce its holding in Sberbank,
Russia&#8217;s biggest lender, to a controlling stake between 2011 and
2014, Shuvalov said. It will &#8220;try to complete&#8221; the sale of a
10 percent stake in VTB Group, the second-biggest bank, this
year and may sell an additional 10 percent in 2011 and 10
percent to 15 percent in 2012, according to Shuvalov. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia needs banks that &#8220;understand the best time to put
assets on the market,&#8221; Alexei Uvarov, head of the Economic
Ministry&#8217;s property department, said on March 25. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying
to find new mechanisms of privatization that are less archaic
than before, with flexible market mechanisms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia raised 1 billion rubles from asset sales last year,
when liquidity was tight and there was no demand from investors,
Uvarov said. The economy contracted a record 7.9 percent as
global demand plummeted, the biggest drop on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s last major asset sale was in 2007, when VTB Group,
the country&#8217;s second-largest bank, raised $8 billion in the
biggest initial public offering that year. Oil producer OAO
Rosneft&#8217;s IPO a year earlier raised $10.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. is trailing its
rivals ever since Russell Investments labeled it a growth stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest company by share value,
has gained 6.2 percent since June 11 when Russell said it would
put 92 percent of its market capitalization in the Russell 1000
Growth Index, Chevron Corp. jumped 14 percent and ConocoPhillips
rose 12 percent. Russell assigns 95 percent of Chevron to its
value gauge and 62 percent of ConocoPhillips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year when Apple Inc. has soared 46 percent and Oracle
Corp. increased 17 percent, money managers have failed to
embrace Exxon&#8217;s new ranking, in part because Russell based its
decision on four analysts who lacked a consensus. Robb Parlanti,
who manages a fund at Turner Investment Partners that buys the
fastest-growing companies, avoided Exxon because he&#8217;s skeptical
profits will match his other holdings. David Kovacs, who
oversees a fund at Turner focused on the cheapest equities, cut
his stake after Exxon&#8217;s share of the Russell value index shrank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we couldn&#8217;t understand was, why does Russell seem to
think Exxon&#8217;s a growth stock and no one else does?&#8221; said Doug Leggate, a Houston-based oil industry analyst at Bank of America
Corp. &#8220;People are making huge swings in their investment
decisions, which is impacting the performance of the shares.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Adam Satariano and Rob Gloster" date="Oct 28, 2010  1:39 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-28/microsoft-cisco-alumni-use-technology-savvy-to-get-giants-to-world-series.html"><headline>Microsoft, Cisco Alumni Use Tech Savvy to Get Giants to Series</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Giants, backed by
owners from Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and
Intel Corp., are bringing Silicon Valley knowhow to bear as they
take on the Texas Rangers in the World Series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under former Microsoft General Counsel Bill Neukom, who
took over as managing general partner in 2008, the team is
increasingly using technology to hone players&#8217; skills and draw
more fans. The Giants also put a bigger emphasis on pitching
after years of relying on Barry Bonds&#8217;s home runs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Giants use motion-sensor suits to help evaluate
throwing and hitting mechanics and a specially outfitted
pitching machine that shoots different-colored balls at more
than 100 miles per hour (160 kph) to help batters overcome blind
spots. The team also is the first to use software that sets
ticket prices based on supply and demand, similar to airlines or
hotels. Such innovations, along with players&#8217; raw talent and a
$357 million waterfront ballpark, have helped boost the club&#8217;s
value almost fivefold since the ownership group took over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The point is to be restless about where technology can
help us on the baseball side and on the business side,&#8221; Neukom,
also the Giants chief executive officer, said in an interview in
the team&#8217;s offices at ATT Park. The Giants got an early lead in
the series last night, beating the Rangers 11-7 in game one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franchise&#8217;s Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ownership group, called San Francisco Baseball
Associates LP, bought the Giants for $100 million in 1992,
saving them from moving to Florida. The team is now worth $483
million, making them the ninth-most-valuable franchise among the
30 clubs in Major League Baseball, according to Forbes magazine.
The Giants also own a third of Comcast Sports Net Bay Area, the
cable channel that carries their games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Giants&#8217; backers, who get seats between home plate and
the dugout along the third-base line, include Arthur Rock, a
former Intel chairman and Apple Inc. director; Yahoo board
member Arthur Kern and the company&#8217;s former president, Jeff Mallett; Cisco executive Dan Scheinman; and venture capitalist
Paul Wythes. Hewlett-Packard Co. co-founder William Hewlett was
an owner before his 2001 death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about some of the premier guys in Silicon
Valley,&#8221; said Larry Baer, the club&#8217;s president and chief
operating officer. In addition to the technology industry
veterans, the 31 owners include investor Charles Johnson,
chairman of Franklin Resources Inc., a mutual-fund company in
San Mateo, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetary Boost &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching the World Series is worth &#8220;several millions of
dollars&#8221; in additional revenue, Baer said, without elaborating.
About 4,000 new season ticket applications have been received by
the club since the beginning of September, when the team began
its push toward clinching the 21st National League title in its
127-year history. The Giants haven&#8217;t won a World Series since
moving to San Francisco from New York in 1958. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real benefit is 2011, where you can drive season
tickets, where you can drive sponsorships, where we can drive
pricing,&#8221; said Baer, 53. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing in the World Series will bolster the Giants&#8217;
season-ticket sales, merchandise orders, endorsement deals and
TV revenue, said Richard Walden, the head of sports business at
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Private Bank unit. Still, consistently
winning year after year does more for a team&#8217;s value than a
single championship appearance, he said. JPMorgan helped the
Giants finance their ballpark, which opened in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Run &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will translate over time if they maintain the same
discipline with regard to the on-the-field and off-the-field
management of the club,&#8221; Walden said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t necessarily
make a huge difference unless you have a long history of
winning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team&#8217;s investors aren&#8217;t seeking a short-term
moneymaker, Neukom said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The basic business model is to invite investors who are
passionate about baseball to make an investment and to
recognize, however, that it is not a near-term strategic
investment,&#8221; Neukom said. &#8220;If you want to have a fund for your
grandchildren to go to private schools in case the public
schools aren&#8217;t what you want them to be, then don&#8217;t put that
money here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neukom, who became an owner in 1995, orchestrated
Microsoft&#8217;s legal defense against antitrust allegations by the
U.S. government in the 1990s. He first started working with
Microsoft after Bill Gates&#8217;s father asked Neukom to help the
younger Gates build the software company, which had about a
dozen employees at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates&#8217;s Pitch &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neukom, 68, also helped give Gates some pointers on
baseball. In the late-1980s, Gates was invited to throw out the
first pitch at a Seattle Mariners game. To practice the day
before, Neukom, Gates and Mariners catcher Dave Valle went into
the woods behind Microsoft&#8217;s headquarters for a few warm-up
throws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He threw about six pitches, went back to work and the
next night in the Kingdome he threw a nice pitch,&#8221; Neukom said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neukom took over as the team&#8217;s managing general partner
after former Safeway Inc. CEO Peter Magowan stepped down.
Magowan and Baer led the effort to purchase the Giants and build
the ballpark adjacent to San Francisco Bay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Giants sought investors to help keep the team from
moving to Florida in the 1990s, technology executives were an
obvious option because of Silicon Valley&#8217;s proximity to San
Francisco, Baer said. The technology hotbed, home to Apple,
Intel and Hewlett-Packard, is about 40 miles from the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were dialing for dollars,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dot-Com Boom &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Giants&#8217; ballpark was the first privately financed major
league venue since Los Angeles&#8217;s Dodger Stadium in 1962. The
effort was aided by the dot-com boom, Baer said. It would have
been tougher to get funding to build the ballpark after the
bubble burst in 2000, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stadium was the first to offer Wi-Fi Internet service
to fans in 2004. Now the Giants are exploring ways to distribute
content on mobile devices and social networks, Neukom said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he took over, the team was five years into a six-year
playoff drought and rebuilding after Bonds&#8217;s departure. Bonds,
who set home run records as a Giant, saw his career marred by
steroids allegations. He is scheduled for trial in March on
charges of obstruction and lying to a federal grand jury in
2003, when he said he never knowingly took the drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neukom aimed to create a new vision and wrote a manifesto
called the &#8220;Giants Way,&#8221; outlining priorities, including
identifying and nurturing talent, teamwork and conditioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Giants&#8217; four starting pitchers in the World Series came
up through its minor league system. That includes two-time Cy
Young Award winner Tim Lincecum, who pitched 5 2/3 innings in
last night&#8217;s game. The bearded reliever, Brian Wilson, and
rookie catcher Buster Posey also were drafted by the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very proud of that,&#8221; said Neukom, who was showered
with champagne in the team clubhouse after the Giants defeated
the Philadelphia Phillies to win the National League pennant and
earn a spot in the World Series. &#8220;If we&#8217;re playing good
baseball, lots of other good things will follow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. says
it&#8217;s banking on President Barack Obama&#8217;s visit to India next
week to ease concern over increased U.S. visa costs and
protectionism toward software-services companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bill passed by the U.S. Senate in August increased visa
costs, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive officer of Tata
Consultancy, India&#8217;s largest software exporter, said in an
interview during the Sibos conference in Amsterdam today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about regulatory changes and
the protectionist discussions, which are very concerning for the
industry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope what happens during the visit
reduces those tensions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, passed unanimously by the Senate, would add
$2,000 to visa fees for companies with more than half of their
employees in the U.S. on such visas. The increase could cost
software-services companies based in India, such as TCS and
Infosys Technologies Ltd., as much as $250 million a year, Som Mittal, president of Indian industry trade group Nasscom, said
on Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies such as Wipro Ltd. and Infosys send
skilled workers from overseas, often from India, to the U.S. to
develop software and manage projects for customers in the
country. TCS has absorbed the increased visa costs in its
business model, Chandrasekaran said, although he couldn&#8217;t say if
Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy will take measures to soften the
effect, such as hiring more U.S. workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strategic&#8217; Visit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;TCS continues to hire people in different markets,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We have two big centers in the U.S, one in Cincinnati
and one in Midland, Michigan, and we continue to hire
professionals in these centers and also in other parts of the
U.S. We&#8217;ll continue to pursue that. We need to see how the whole
regulatory develops and then make suitable changes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama will address a conference sponsored by the U.S.-India
Business Council Nov. 6 in Mumbai, India&#8217;s financial capital,
while in India at the start of a four-nation trip to Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip is &#8220;very strategic,&#8221; Chandrasekaran said. &#8220;I
hope the trip makes our two nations much more close and we start
engaging in many more strategic initiatives than ever before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Oct 28, 2010  9:42 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-28/exxon-mobil-profit-rises-as-worldwide-growth-in-energy-demand-lifts-prices.html"><headline>Exxon Mobil Profit Rises as Demand Growth Boosts Energy Prices</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest company, posted its largest third-quarter profit
increase in six years as rising worldwide energy demand lifted
commodity prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income rose 55 percent to $7.35 billion,
or $1.44 a share, from $4.73 billion, or 98 cents, a year
earlier, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today.
Per-share profit was 5 cents more than the average of 14
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorists, airlines and railroads are burning crude-based
fuels at a rate of one supertanker load every 33 minutes this
year, a 2.2 percent increase from 2009, according to Barclays
Capital. Exxon boosted production by more than one-fifth amid a
12 percent jump in U.S. oil futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon already was producing more oil and gas than any of
the other public companies so for them to increase output and by
such a large margin is a good thing,&#8221; said Douglas Ober, whose
$682 million under management at Petroleum  Resources Corp. in
Baltimore includes Exxon stock. &#8220;This probably took a lot of
people by surprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in net income was the largest for a third
quarter, excluding one-time gains, since 2004. Exxon rose 74
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $66.41 at 9:37 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares, which before today had
declined 3.7 percent this year, have nine buy ratings from
analysts, 12 holds and one sell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raghuram G. Rajan&#8217;s &#8220;Fault Lines,&#8221;
a look at why the financial order is prone to blowing bubbles,
won the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the
Year Award, defeating Andrew Ross Sorkin and other authors on
the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajan, a former International Monetary Fund chief economist
who teaches at the University of Chicago, overcame competition
from Sorkin&#8217;s &#8220;Too Big to Fail,&#8221; Michael Lewis&#8217;s &#8220;The Big
Short&#8221; and other finalists to claim the award of 30,000 pounds
($47,414) during a dinner last night at the Pierre hotel in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is totally unexpected,&#8221; Rajan said in accepting the
award. &#8220;As I was leaving the house tonight, my wife told me to
remember to smile when the winner is announced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books on the crisis were so prevalent in this year&#8217;s
contest that Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., recused himself from the judging process for
the first time since the prize was inaugurated in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajan, who predicted the crisis two years before it hit,
says in &#8220;Fault Lines&#8221; (Princeton) that it&#8217;s tempting to pin
the blame on bankers, governments and homebuyers. Yet these
individuals, for all their shortcomings, were only responding to
three fault lines, he argues: domestic political pressures,
trade imbalances and incompatible financial systems. The
fractures continue to threaten the world economy, he says,
meaning &#8220;we risk going from bubble to bubble.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A book is always a complex product of many efforts,&#8221; he
said last night. &#8220;My years at Chicago made me what I am.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Big Short&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the five other finalists received a prize of 10,000
pounds ($15,800), up from 5,000 pounds in previous years. They
included Sorkin&#8217;s &#8220;Too Big to Fail&#8221; (Allen Lane/Viking), a
fly-on-the-wall account of how Wall Street and Washington
struggled to save the financial system, and Lewis&#8217;s &#8220;The Big

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Steven Church" date="Oct 29, 2010  8:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-29/tribune-lenders-sue-jpmorgan-merrill-claiming-they-knew-buyout-was-fraud.html"><headline>Tribune Lenders Sue JPMorgan Claiming Buyout Was Fraud</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A group of Tribune Co. lenders sued
affiliates of JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. and
Citigroup Inc. over the 2007 buyout of the newspaper publisher,
claiming the banks knew the deal would ultimately fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they pushed to close the two-stage transaction, the
banks knew the $3.7 billion in financing &#8220;was tainted with
fraud and other misconduct,&#8221; the lenders, who include hedge
funds and investors who specialize in distressed debt, said in a
complaint filed today in New York state court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Chicago-based Tribune filed bankruptcy last year,
lenders and other creditors have fought among themselves in
court over whom was to blame for the company&#8217;s bankruptcy and
how to divide ownership of the biggest newspaper and television
company in bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is allied with Tribune and hedge funds Angelo
Gordon  Co. and Oaktree Capital Management LP, who are also
buyout lenders but not part of the lawsuit. They have proposed
splitting Tribune among themselves and settling some potential
buyout lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other creditors have until midnight to file their own
reorganization plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lending Agreement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint, a group that holds about $767.7 million
of the $8.3 billion buyout debt alleged JPMorgan and the other
banks violated the lending agreement that binds all of the
lenders and the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks knew that the second stage of the transaction
would add so much debt on the company that Tribune wouldn&#8217;t be
able to repay the loans, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan and Citigroup didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls seeking comment. Bank of America spokeswoman
Shirley Norton declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting among Tribune&#8217;s creditors, who are owed more than
$12 billion, intensified after July 27 when a bankruptcy
examiner, Kenneth N. Klee, released a report that bolstered the
position of lower-ranking creditors and lenders who funded the
first stage of the buyout. Klee found that the second part of
the buyout, which closed in December 2007, was vulnerable to a
court challenge by creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the bankruptcy, the banks have claimed that if
lenders in the first stage of the transaction win a lawsuit
related to the second stage, the banks get to share in the
monetary damages. The lenders want a judge to throw out that so-
called sharing provision of the lending agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint claims the banks structured the deal in a way
that reduced their risks at the expense of the lenders. The
banks also hedged themselves through credit default swaps, which
pay holders should a company go bankrupt, the lenders claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Alden Global Distressed Opportunities Fund LP
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 651884/2010, New York State Supreme
Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. followed Intel Corp.
and Texas Instruments Inc. in reporting a tradeoff likely to
weigh on technology sales through year&#8217;s end: While corporate
customers are spending more, consumers are keeping wallets shut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday posted first-quarter results that were
buoyed by corporate demand, even as households held off on
personal-computer purchases. Quarterly earnings by Texas
Instruments and Intel this month also reflected lackluster
buying by consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations that cut spending during the recession are now
upgrading aging systems and stepping up orders for computers and
software. By contrast, households concerned about joblessness
and home prices are capping companies&#8217; sales growth. That poses
a challenge to an industry increasingly dependent on consumers,
who may represent 30 percent of total technology spending in the
next few years, up from about 20 percent now, according to
researchers at IDC in Framingham, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consumer is kind of damaged for a while,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr., principal at Becker Capital Management in Portland,
Oregon, which oversees about $2.3 billion in assets, including
1.5 million Microsoft shares. &#8220;On the business side, the
corporate balance sheet is as good as we&#8217;ve ever seen there. But
you have two different balance sheets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strong&#8217; Business Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday said net income rose 51 percent to $5.41
billion, or 62 cents a share, compared with the 55 cents
projected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The 25 percent
sales increase, to $16.2 billion, was fueled by demand for
Office 2010, corporate versions of Windows 7 and software for
running the server computers that anchor corporate networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, gained 39 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $26.67 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The stock has dropped 13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer PC shipments grew less than 10 percent, while
computers for businesses rose in the mid-teens, General Manager
Bill Koefoed said on a conference call. Microsoft gets about 70
percent of revenue from businesses and the rest from consumers,
according to Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Business demand was very strong and that was a big driver
of Office and Server sales,&#8221; said Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. &#8220;Consumer PC growth was a little
less than people had predicted three months ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, Texas Instruments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Intel, the world&#8217;s largest maker of computer chips, and
Texas Instruments, which ranks No. 2 in the U.S., the split
between consumers and companies was more pronounced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, lamented slumping
demand among consumers in the U.S. and Europe, even as corporate
buying helped the company predict fourth-quarter sales that may
exceed analysts&#8217; estimates. Texas Instruments, based in Dallas,
forecast smaller fourth-quarter sales than some analysts had
estimated, citing a slowdown in consumer-electronics spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments Chief Executive Officer Rich Templeton
said consumer demand is cooling, hurting sales of computers and
televisions, while industrial demand remains &#8220;especially
strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The round of growth fueled by the upgrading of dated
machinery could peter out in the first half of next year if
concerns over growth persist, said Stephen Minton, an analyst at
IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pretty Nervous&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the economy is still struggling three months from now,
companies will be pretty quick to put spending on hold,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Companies are still pretty nervous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point: International Business Machines Corp., the
world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, said services
signings fell 7 percent to $11 billion in the third quarter, the
third straight quarterly drop in new contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing importance of consumers to the computer
industry is being felt by chipmakers, whose rebound from the
recession last year was partly fueled by demand for laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is on course to grow 18 percent from last year
on an annual basis, according to Intel CEO Paul Otellini. Yet,
this year&#8217;s holiday shopping surge may fall short. Intel, whose
chips run more than 80 percent of the world&#8217;s PCs, usually gets
an 8 percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue from the
previous three months amid year-end holiday shopping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel says sales will grow at most 6.3 percent this quarter
from the third. At the low end of Intel&#8217;s forecast, revenue will
decline. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Intel&#8217;s closest rival in
processors, predicted sales will be little changed this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple as Exception &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. consumers will spend about 2 percent less on gifts
this holiday season as shoppers remain concerned about a weak
economy, the Consumer Electronics Association said earlier this
month, citing an annual survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average consumer will spend $750 on holiday gifts, the
industry trade group said Oct. 19. A third of the survey&#8217;s
respondents said they planned to reduce spending for reasons
related to unemployment, the association said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technology companies are still benefiting from
consumer spending. Apple Inc. posted record earnings last
quarter after selling 14.1 million iPhones, more than analysts
predicted. Samsung Electronics Co., the biggest maker of
televisions and other consumer electronics, reported a 17
percent profit increase, also a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many households are putting off PC purchases and opting
instead for tablets, such as Apple&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Holidays? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This holiday season is going to be absolutely fantastic&#8221;
for Apple, said Michael Obuchowski, chief investment officer of
First Empire Asset Management, which holds Apple shares. &#8220;They
were able to refresh their entire product line during the
recession. All of their devices are new designs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the technology world, retail spending on clothes
and other goods may be starting to recover. Analysts expect
shares of Macy&#8217;s Inc., Target Corp., Nordstrom Inc. and Kohl&#8217;s
Corp. to jump over the next year. Economists lifted estimates
for consumer purchases in the third quarter after retail sales
climbed more than forecast in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consumer market is growing, but at a slower pace than
the business sector,&#8221; Gregory Spierkel, chief executive officer
of Ingram Micro Inc., the biggest distributor of computer
equipment. &#8220;That was not the story last year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Rita Nazareth" date="Oct 29, 2010  4:58 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-29/u-s-stock-index-futures-fall-before-gdp-data-microsoft-gains-on-earnings.html"><headline>U.S. Stocks Fluctuate as GDP Data Match Forecast; Chevron Falls</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks rose, with the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index completing its second straight
monthly advance, as Microsoft Corp. beat profit estimates and
economic growth matched forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 1.5 percent as corporate customers increased
purchases. Monster Worldwide Inc. soared 26 percent after the
job-listing service raised its fourth-quarter forecast. Chevron
Corp. declined 2.2 percent after its earnings missed analyst
estimates. Merck  Co. slumped 1.7 percent after saying that the
legal costs to resolve a criminal probe into its Vioxx
painkiller reduced profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost seven stocks advanced for every five that declined
on U.S. exchanges. The SP 500 fell less than 0.1 percent to
1,183.26 as of 4 p.m. in New York. The gauge rose 3.7 percent in
October on speculation the Federal Reserve will buy bonds to
stimulate the economy, a practice known as quantitative easing.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.54 points, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 11,118.49 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is in a holding pattern,&#8221; said Mark Bronzo, a
money manager in Irvington, New York, at Security Global
Investors, which oversees $21 billion. &#8220;The GDP numbers came in
as expected. I&#8217;m not sure it will change the Fed&#8217;s mind on QE2.
Don&#8217;t forget that the Fed is said to be getting inputs from
banks as a way to avoid any surprise next week. The market has
had a very good move and it&#8217;s now digesting it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has risen as much as 16 percent from its 2010
low in July. Most U.S. stocks fell yesterday as 3M Co. drove
industrial shares lower after cutting its profit forecast,
helping erase an early gain triggered by Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s
better-than-estimated earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter as consumer spending climbed the most in almost
four years, the Commerce Department said today, a sign the
expansion is developing staying power. The increase in gross
domestic product matched the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News and followed a 1.7 percent gain the
prior three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s slow growth at best,&#8221; said Richard Sichel, who
oversees $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co. &#8220;There&#8217;s no surprise in the GDP figures.
Consumer spending is growing, but not as much as we would like.
It seems that unemployment will stay high for the foreseeable
future. That most likely calls for further quantitative easing
next week.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence among U.S. consumers fell in October to the
lowest level in almost a year, which may temper the biggest part
of the economy. Another report showed that business activity in
the U.S. unexpectedly accelerated in October, signaling
corporate and consumer spending are holding up after the economy
expanded at a faster pace in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may not be out of the woods, but I wouldn&#8217;t get too
negative here,&#8221; said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at
First Citizens Bancshares Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which
manages $5 billion. &#8220;The lackluster economic numbers really
suggest the Fed will have to implement more aggressive stimulus
measures. On the other hand, as business confidence improves,
we&#8217;ll get a better jobs picture and ultimately investors&#8217;
psychology will improve. That will be gradual, though.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at 249 of the 310 companies in the SP 500 that
have reported results since Oct. 7 have beaten analysts&#8217; per-
share earnings estimates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict 26 percent
growth in third-quarter profit from a year earlier for SP 500
companies, the fourth straight quarterly increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 1.5 percent to $26.67. The world&#8217;s largest
software maker reported first-quarter earnings of 62 cents a
share, beating an average estimate of 55 cents as corporate
customers stepped up purchases of computers and the programs
that run on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster Worldwide jumped 26 percent to $18.06 for the
biggest gain in the SP 500. The world&#8217;s largest online-
recruiting company forecast adjusted earnings in the fourth
quarter of as much as 8 cents a share, higher than the 5-cent
average analyst estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron sank 2.2 percent to $82.60. The second-largest U.S.
energy company posted an unexpected drop in net income, bucking
the trend of bigger profits among its peers, after a jump in
costs erased gains from higher crude prices and record
production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck slumped 1.7 percent to $36.31. The second-biggest
U.S. drugmaker set aside $950 million to resolve a criminal
probe into the Vioxx painkiller it withdrew six years ago,
raising potential legal costs to $7.7 billion. The legal reserve
contributed to a 90 percent decline in third-quarter income to
$342 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. posted an unexpected
drop in net income, bucking the trend of bigger profits among
the largest oil companies, after costs from exploration failures
erased gains from higher crude prices and record production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter profit fell 1.6 percent to $3.77 billion, or
$1.87 a share, from $3.83 billion, or $1.92, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said in a statement today.
That&#8217;s 28 cents less than the average of 15 analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration expenses soared 74 percent during the quarter
as the company took &#8220;significant&#8221; write-offs on wells in
Turkey and Canada, Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington
said today during an investor conference call. Higher costs
wiped out the benefit of a 12 percent climb in oil prices and
the most third-quarter crude and gas production in company
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are coming up short in the upstream business at a
time when everyone else in the industry is reporting healthy
earnings with the improvement in the crude pricing
environment,&#8221; said Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire
Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago-based risk-management
adviser to oil producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-biggest U.S. energy company, fell
$1.84, or 2.2 percent, to $82.60 a share at 4 p.m. in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has 19 buy and
six hold ratings from analysts and has risen 7.3 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Buyback &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 6.6 percent to $49.7 billion from $46.6 billion
in the third quarter of 2009, Chevron said. Profit from oil and
gas sales, which account for 95 percent of Chevron&#8217;s net income,
declined 4.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron plans to spend $750 million to buy its own stock
during the current quarter, Jeanette Ourada, general manager of
investor relations, said during the call. The company last made
buybacks in the final three months of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson last week
announced the company would move forward with a $7.5 billion
project in deep-water oil fields in the Gulf. It&#8217;s the largest
investment since the Obama administration ended the drilling ban
imposed after BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well caused the biggest offshore
oil leak in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, 53, disclosed plans in March to shrink the
company&#8217;s refining workforce and sell Chevron&#8217;s only remaining
European refinery because of thin profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Exploration &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, who succeeded David O&#8217;Reilly as CEO on Jan. 1, is
focusing investment on oil exploration in the Gulf and West
Africa, and building liquefied natural gas facilities to handle
recent discoveries off the coast of Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yarrington said on the call that the company is engaged in
&#8220;pure wildcatting&#8221; in some exploration regions. Wildcatting is
oil-patch slang for drilling the riskiest prospects in virtually
unmapped geological formations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yarrington didn&#8217;t provide any details about the well
writedowns in Turkey and Canada. The company has a joint venture
with the Turkish state oil company, Turkiye Petrolleri AO, to
explore the Black Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the biggest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday that its third-quarter net income rose 55 percent to
$7.35 billion, buoyed by a rise in oil prices. ConocoPhillips,
the third-biggest U.S. energy company, said on Oct. 27 its
third-quarter profit more than doubled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA reported today a 32 percent rise in profit for the
quarter. Royal Dutch Shell Plc yesterday beat analysts&#8217;
estimates and posted a 6.5 percent increase in net income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index trimming its second
straight monthly advance, as the market digested a new report on
economic growth that matched economist forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. declined 1.7 percent after its earnings were
below analyst estimates. Microsoft Corp. rose 1.5 percent after
the biggest software maker reported profit that topped
predictions. Monster Worldwide Inc. soared 26 percent after
raising its fourth-quarter forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,183.06 as of 12:18 p.m.
in New York. The gauge had risen 3.7 percent in October through
yesterday on better-than-estimated corporate earnings and
speculation the Federal Reserve will buy bonds to stimulate the
economy, a practice known as quantitative easing. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost 5.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to
11,108.19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The GDP number was OK and probably baked into investors&#8217;
expectations,&#8221; said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist
at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which manages
$342 billion. &#8220;The figures also suggest that the Fed might be
doing less than what some people expected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks fell yesterday as 3M Co. drove industrial
shares lower after cutting its profit forecast, helping erase an
early gain triggered by Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s better-than-
estimated earnings report. The SP 500 has risen as much as 16
percent from its 2010 low in July. &lt;/p&gt;

the trend of bigger profits among its peers, after a jump in

&lt;p&gt;Genworth Financial Inc. had the biggest decline in the SP
500, slumping 11 percent to $11.25. The mortgage guarantor and
life insurer reported third-quarter operating income excluding
some investment results of 6 cents a share, missing the 26-cent
average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. rose 1.5 percent to $26.66. The world&#8217;s
largest software maker reported first-quarter earnings of 62
cents a share, beating an average estimate of 55 cents as
corporate customers stepped up purchases of computers and the
programs that run on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster Worldwide Inc. jumped 26 percent to $18.10 for the
biggest gain in the SP 500. The world&#8217;s largest online-
recruiting company forecast adjusted earnings in the fourth
quarter of as much as 8 cents a share, higher than the 5-cent
average analyst estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at 249 of the 310 companies in the SP 500 that
have reported results since Oct. 7 have beaten analysts&#8217; per-
share earnings estimates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict 26 percent
growth in third-quarter profit from a year earlier for SP 500
companies, the fourth straight quarterly increase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groupe Eurotunnel SA&#8217;s bid for the
rail line from London to the Channel Tunnel faces competition
from 3i Group Plc, the Borealis infrastructure fund and German
insurer Allianz SE, people with knowledge of the auction said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurotunnel made an offer for the High Speed 1 contract,
valued by analysts at 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion), before
a noon deadline in London, said Kate Hill, a spokeswoman for the
company&#8217;s GB Speedrail bid vehicle, in an interview. The group
includes the infrastructure units of Eurotunnel shareholders
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Prudential Plc, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offers also came from 3i Infrastructure Plc teamed with
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s infrastructure unit and Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, and from Canada&#8217;s Borealis Infrastructure Management
with the Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the sale process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabel Unsworth, a spokeswoman in London for 3i, Europe&#8217;s
largest publicly traded private equity firm, declined to
comment. Toronto-based Borealis didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
calls to its office in the U.K. capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth bid is from Munich-based Allianz, Europe&#8217;s
largest insurer, advised by Bank of America Corp., the people
said. Allianz spokesman Michael Matern declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s coalition government is selling a 30-year
concession to run High Speed 1 through state-owned London 
Continental Railways as part of an asset-disposal program aimed
at paying down a 155 billion-pound budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a unique combination of expertise in railway and
infrastructure-operating skills, infrastructure-management
skills and access to finance,&#8221; GB&#8217;s Hill said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of the
18 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve, said a
resumption of asset purchases by policy makers next week would
likely include 30-year Treasury bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders have speculated that the Fed would focus on buying U.S. government debt maturing in 10 years and less as part of a
policy known as quantitative easing to sustain the economic
recovery by keeping borrowing costs low. Ten-year Treasury notes
serve as a benchmark for loans ranging from corporate debt to
mortgages. Policy makers conclude their two-day meeting Nov. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed purchased $30.3 billion of Treasuries in the 12- to
30-year maturity range as part of its $300 billion in total
Treasury purchases last year, according Fed data tracked by
Barclays Plc. The difference in yield on 10- and 30-year
securities reached a record 1.46 percentage points on Oct. 15 on
concern the flooding of cash into financial markets by the Fed
will spur inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time we&#8217;re hearing someone voice the
opinion publicly that the Fed&#8217;s going to have to do something
different in terms of QE,&#8221; said Gary Pollack, who helps oversee
$12 billion as head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank
AG&#8217;s Private Wealth Management unit in New York. &#8220;Goldman&#8217;s a
respected voice on the Street and is saying the Fed&#8217;s going to
have to go out to 30s to do something.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred Inflation Measure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on 30-year bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.03 percent at 9:39 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report showing the Fed&#8217;s preferred inflation measure
added to expectations that policy makers will buy longer-term
assets. The price gauge, which is tied to consumer spending and
strips out food and energy costs, climbed at a 0.8 percent
annual pace in the third quarter, less than the 1 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and down from a 1 percent
increase the prior quarter, Commerce Department figures showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying 30-year bonds may cause the difference in yield
between the securities and 10-year debt to narrow,Francesco Garzarelli, a London-based analyst, wrote in an e-mailed note
today. The difference in yields was 1.40 percentage points
today, compared with a five-year average of 0.52 point,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinvestment Program &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has purchased longer-term Treasuries, including
those with maturities of almost 30 years, in part of its current
program of reinvesting proceeds of maturing mortgage holdings
into Treasuries. Policy makers have bought $2.4 billion of bonds
in the 20- to 30-year maturity range in the reinvestment program
so far, according to Fed data tracked by Barclays. The Fed held
three operations since the program began in August for
Treasuries that fall in the maturity range of February 2021 to
August 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our view is that the Fed is likely to continue
concentrating its purchases in the belly of the curve,&#8221;
said Michael Pond, co-head of U.S. rates strategy in New York at
primary dealer Barclays. &#8220;But if the program is sizable enough,
it will be forced to make a decision between spreading purchases
more along the curve or harming liquidity in certain sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed may broaden its purchases this time as the likely
size of this new quantitative easing program may cause the
central bank to reach its internal guidelines of how much it can
hold of any given issue, Pond said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed limits itself to owning no more than 35 percent of
any specific security it holds in its System Open Market
Account, or SOMA. The Fed could increase this self-imposed limit
to approximately 50 percent, said Pond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank makes the securities in its portfolio
available to dealers through its daily securities lending
operation, making it unlikely that Fed purchases alone would
lead to an acute shortage of a given issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates for the ultimate size of an asset-purchase
program range from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Global Research to $2 trillion at Goldman Sachs. Economists at
both firms agree the Fed will likely start by announcing $500
billion next week. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Oct 31, 2010  7:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-31/goldman-sachs-losing-edge-in-fixed-income-trading-as-risk-appetite-wanes.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Losing Fixed-Income Trading Edge as Risk Falls</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is losing
its edge in fixed-income trading, the firm&#8217;s biggest business
and the one that led to record earnings last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s share of fixed-income trading revenue at
eight of the largest U.S. and European banks slipped to 19
percent in the third quarter from a peak of 29 percent in the
last three months of 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gap between industry leader Goldman Sachs and its
nearest rival narrowed to $239 million in the quarter, the
smallest amount since confidence in credit markets collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, who once
ran the fixed-income unit, hasn&#8217;t made any public statement
indicating concern that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s dominance slipped as
client trading fell and the bank cut the risk it&#8217;s taking while
competitors ramped up their efforts. The company benefited
during and immediately after the financial crisis by being in a
stronger position than rivals, said Roger Freeman, an analyst at
Barclays Capital in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They gained a ton of market share,&#8221; Freeman said. &#8220;As
firms that made it got back on their feet over the course of
last year, the competitive environment picked up and that took
some of that advantage away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $3.77 billion from trading bonds,
currencies, commodities, interest-rate products and credit
derivatives in the third quarter, the lowest amount since 2008.
That was $1.46 billion more than the average of the other seven
banks, the smallest lead since the second quarter of 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading accounted for 52 percent of the New
York-based company&#8217;s $45.2 billion in net revenue last year.
This year, it has comprised 51 percent. That compares with 25
percent at Morgan Stanley, 23 percent at Zurich-based Credit
Suisse Group AG and 13 percent at Bank of America Corp., the
largest U.S. bank by assets. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue for the
first nine months of the year was $30.5 billion, down 14 percent
from the same period in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s value-at-risk, or VaR, a measure of how much it
could lose in the markets on a single day, slid to $121 million
in the third quarter, the lowest since 2006, falling 42 percent
from a year earlier. It reached record levels in the first half
of 2009, hitting $245 million in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VaR at Credit Suisse, whose CEO said he expects client
trading to pick up in coming quarters, climbed 31 percent to 118
million Swiss francs ($119.3 million) over the last 12 months.
It increased 4 percent to $142 million at New York-based Morgan
Stanley, which has hired about 400 people in its sales and
trading unit over the past 15 months. &lt;/p&gt;
