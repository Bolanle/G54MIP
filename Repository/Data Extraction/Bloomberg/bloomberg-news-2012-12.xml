&lt;p&gt;About 10 pounds of benzene was
released by a pipeline leak at Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Baton Rouge
Refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to a report made
to the National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric monitoring is being conducted at the site and
absorbent pads have been placed under the leak, according to the
report, which was taken at 2:08 p.m. yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substance in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (CITI), and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) must face claims over home foreclosure practices in a lawsuit brought by the Massachusetts attorney general, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allegations that the banks violated state law by conducting invalid foreclosures can proceed, according to a decision by Justice Judith Fabricant of Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston dated Nov. 30. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Invalid foreclosures resulting in properties with clouded titles may have caused harm to third-party purchasers &#8220;and the real estate market as a whole, and thereby to the public,&#8221; Fabricant wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The three banks along with Bank of America Corp. and Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage were sued last year by Attorney General Martha Coakley. Coakley accused the lenders of using fraudulent documents in home foreclosures, foreclosing without legal authority, undermining public land records and misrepresenting loan-modification programs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the claims in the lawsuit were settled as part of a $25 billion agreement between the banks and 49 states reached earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Consumer Law &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coakley claimed the banks violated the state&#8217;s consumer protection law by initiating foreclosures on homes before holding the mortgage. Fabricant said that claim could move forward against the banks except Bank of America. The judge said the state didn&#8217;t identify &#8220;any instance&#8221; in which the bank conducted a foreclosure sale when it didn&#8217;t hold the mortgage, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fabricant dismissed claims related to the registering of real estate records. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is pleased with the decision. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Vickee Adams said the San Francisco-based lender &#8220;will continue to represent our point of view&#8221; in the litigation. Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, declined to comment. Representatives for GMAC and JPMorgan didn&#8217;t respond to requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brad Puffer, a Coakley spokesman, said the office was reviewing the decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Bank of America NA, 11-4363, Suffolk County Superior Court (Boston). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Niamh Ring" date="Dec 03, 2012  4:23 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-03/dell-gains-after-goldman-says-leveraged-buyout-possible.html"><headline>Dell Gains After Goldman Says Leveraged Buyout Possible</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc. (DELL) advanced after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. upgraded the stock to buy and said the
company&#8217;s net cash balance could present an opportunity for a
leveraged buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 4.4 percent to $10.06 at the close, the
highest price since Sept. 24. The shares have declined 31
percent this year, while the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has
risen 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell, the No. 3 personal computer maker, is struggling as
companies wait to upgrade machines and consumers turn to
smartphones and tablets like Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad and iPhone. While
demand for PCs has declined, Dell&#8217;s net cash balance of $5.15
billion provides &#8220;some downside buffer as it produces
opportunity for an LBO or levered recap under the right
conditions,&#8221; said Bill Shope, an analyst at Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dell has become an attractive deep value play and we
would be buyers of the stock,&#8221; Shope said in a research report.
He raised his price target on Round Rock, Texas-based Dell to
$13 from $9, and had previously recommended selling the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Frink, a spokesman for Dell, declined to comment on
the Goldman research. &#8220;Our focus is on long-term strategy,&#8221;
Frink said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell on Nov. 15 forecast a fourth-straight quarter of
declining sales, indicating fiscal fourth-quarter revenue will
be $14 billion to $14.4 billion. That was less than the $14.5
billion average estimate of analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC shipments tumbled 8.3 percent in the calendar third
quarter from a year earlier, according to market researcher
Gartner Inc., and are projected to decline this year for the
first time since 2001, according to IHS iSuppli. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market for traditional personal
computers has no growth left because people are increasingly
using mobile devices to connect to the Web, said Rick Sherlund,
an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. covering Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As consumers shun personal computers in favor of
smartphones and tablets, the PC market will contract by 1.2
percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS
ISuppli, the first annual decline since 2001. The recent debut
of Windows 8, the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship
operating system, hasn&#8217;t delivered a sales boost, according to
NPD Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows 8 is off to a very rough start, not all the
hardware is out yet, not all the hardware vendors have done a
good job yet,&#8221; Sherlund said today in a radio interview on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherlund recommends buying Microsoft shares, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said last week that it
has sold 40 million software licenses since Windows 8, went on
sale on Oct. 26. Some of that tally includes versions shipped to
corporate customers with multiyear contracts, making it a poor
indicator of consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPD said U.S. retail sales of PCs running Windows have been
weak, with revenue declining 21 percent since the latest
software release, compared with the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surface Tablet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decrease has been fueled by a 24 percent drop in sales
of notebook computers as many customers opt for Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iPad or tablets powered by Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s software instead of
Windows, NPD said. The report excluded Microsoft&#8217;s own stores,
where the company&#8217;s Surface tablet is sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People just don&#8217;t need PCs the way they used to,&#8221;
Sherlund said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got alternatives now for accessing the
Internet. They&#8217;ve got smartphones and tablets, so there&#8217;s really
no growth left in the traditional PC market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last week that it will charge a minimum of
$899 for its Surface Pro tablet, the version that has an Intel
Corp. (INTC) chip, and is targeted at corporate customers or those who
want to use older Windows programs. The high price has analysts
such as Wes Miller at Directions on Microsoft concerned it will
put off tablet shoppers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better compete with Apple and Google, Microsoft
is moving to a new software development system for Windows that
would involve issuing smaller, more frequent updates on more of
an annual cycle, according to people familiar with the matter.
The first such update is planned for next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take another quarter or two until Windows machines
with compelling features and prices to reach consumers, Sherlund
said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), which bought Motorola
Mobility to gain leverage in the global legal battle over
smartphone and tablet computer inventions, can&#8217;t use some of its
patents to block sales of Microsoft Corp. products, a federal
judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said in a Nov.
30 opinion that, because Motorola Mobility pledged to license
some patents on fair and reasonable terms, it can&#8217;t seek a court
order to halt sales of products that use those inventions. The
ruling applies to a group of Motorola Mobility patents that are
deemed essential to industry standards for video decoding and
Wi-Fi technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At all times during this litigation, the issue was not
if, but when and under what terms, a license agreement would be
established between Microsoft and Motorola,&#8221; Robart wrote in
the opinion. He ruled that Motorola Mobility won&#8217;t be harmed if
it can&#8217;t block the sale of products that comport with
industrywide specifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niki Fenwick, a spokeswoman for Google, said the company
had no comment on the ruling. David Cuddy, a spokesman for
Microsoft, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Google spent $12.5 billion
to buy Motorola Mobility and cited its history of innovations
and patents on mobile phones as a key reason behind the
purchase. Google has cited Motorola Mobility&#8217;s patents to fight
back against patent-infringement claims by Microsoft and Apple
Inc. (AAPL) over devices running on Google&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing Terms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robart&#8217;s ruling came in a breach-of-contract case brought
by Microsoft over Motorola Mobility&#8217;s licensing demands for the
Xbox video-gaming system and Microsoft Windows. Robart had
already ruled that Motorola Mobility had a contractual
obligation to license its standard-essential patents on fair
terms because it helped establish the standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate case in which Motorola Mobility is seeking to
block imports of the Xbox is scheduled to begin this week at the
U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the three patents in the ITC case relate to the
standard for video decoding that were the subject of Robart&#8217;s
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility had demanded a royalty of 2.25 percent of
the retail price of each product, a figure Microsoft called
excessive. The Redmond, Washington-based software maker has said
that would amount to $4 billion a year in royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Essential Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robart is evaluating testimony to determine a proper range
for reasonable royalties on patents that are incorporated into
standards designed to let products from different manufacturers
work together. His ruling, expected early next year, would form
the basis for a jury trial to determine whether Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s royalty demand violated its contractual commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge had previously prevented Motorola Mobility from
seeking sales bans of Microsoft products in Germany based on
claims of infringement of standard-essential patents. That
decision was upheld by a U.S. appeals court in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple had also accused Google of violating its commitments.
That case, in a Wisconsin federal court, was thrown out after
Apple said it wouldn&#8217;t accept any rate set by the trial judge
that exceeded $1 per unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union
are investigating claims filed by Microsoft and Apple that
Motorola Mobility is misusing its patents to thwart competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Motorola Inc., 10cv1823,
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington
(Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX), the online video
service, signed a multiyear accord to carry Walt Disney Co. (DIS)
films, marking the first time a major studio has bypassed
traditional cable-TV outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement starts with movies released in 2016, the
companies said today in a statement, without disclosing terms.
Netflix will replace Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA)&#8217;s Starz Entertainment
when its output deal with Disney expires in 2015. Netflix surged
the most since January while Liberty Class A tumbled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is a coup for Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, who faces emerging competition in online video and
pressure for a sale of the company from activist investor Carl Icahn. U.S. subscribers of Netflix will get access to movies
from Disney, including its Pixar and Marvel releases, as soon as
seven months after they open in theaters, a time frame
traditionally reserved for premium pay-TV channels like Starz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a long slog, but ultimately we displayed enough
sustainability that Netflix became a real and viable option for
the pay-TV window,&#8221; Ted Sarandos, the video service&#8217;s chief
content officer, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, surged 14 percent
to $86.65 at the close in New York, more than doubling its year-
to-date gain. Liberty Media, based in Englewood, Colorado, slid
4.9 percent, the most since May 17, to $105.56. Disney, the
world&#8217;s biggest entertainment company, was little changed at
$49.30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA), the owner of
cable network Starz LLC, fell the most since May after Netflix
Inc. signed a multiyear agreement with Walt Disney Co. (DIS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix last year failed to agree to a new contract with
Starz, causing the online movie rental company to lose films
from Sony Pictures and Disney. Today&#8217;s Disney contract
alleviates the loss of Starz content for Netflix and gives the
Los Gatos, California-based company exclusive access to first-
run TV rights to animated and live-action films in 2016,
potentially diminishing Starz&#8217;s value to consumers, Vijay Jayant, an analyst at New York-based ISI Group, said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It reads like the replacement of the Starz contract,&#8221;
Jayant said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what it does to Starz subscriptions in
2016.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s deal with Netflix for first-run content emphasizes
the importance to Starz of developing &#8220;robust original
content&#8221; to replace the lost films, Anthony DiClemente, an
analyst at Barclays Plc in New York, said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starz will have exclusive access to all Disney movies and
their digital streaming rights into early 2017, the company said
in an e-mailed statement. Starz said its decision not to renew
with Disney allows the channel to focus on &#8220;exclusive, premium-
quality original series&#8221; to compete with Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s HBO
and CBS Corp. (CBS)&#8217;s Showtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Media tumbled 4.9 percent to $105.56 at the close,
the steepest one-day drop since May 17. Netflix rose 14 percent
to $86.65, its largest one-day gain since Jan. 26. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IACI), the Internet
company founded by Barry Diller, tumbled the most in almost six
weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its rating on the stock
to sell, citing increased competition for Web visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 7.8 percent to $43.50 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day decline since Oct. 24. The stock has
gained 2.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that depend on users finding them through
Internet searches, including IAC, Demand Media Inc. (DMD) and AOL
Inc. (AOL), are under threat from changes to Google Inc.&#8217;s policies
and increased competition, Heath Terry, a Goldman analyst, said
in a note to investors today. They are paying more money to show
up more frequently in search results, which makes their business
model less sustainable, Terry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the companies may be able to continue this
business, as IAC has for years now, we believe, at best, the
cost of those revenues will increase as competition increases,
while at worst significant segments of those revenues could be
eliminated by policy changes,&#8221; said Terry, who had previously
given IAC a neutral rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet searches account for more than half of the revenue
at IAC, which owns Ask.com and earlier this year purchased
About.com from the New York Times Co. (NYT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also downgraded Demand Media to sell from
neutral. The company&#8217;s shares fell 6.5 percent to $8.63. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s top oil producer,
said it&#8217;s in talks with Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
and other energy companies to reach an agreement on tax demands
proposed in draft legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s always the intent to try and strike a balance,
particularly from the side of government,&#8221; Petroleum Minister
Diezani Alison-Madueke said today at a conference in Abuja.
&#8220;There seemed to be such disparity in terms of where we stood
on the fiscals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Petroleum Industry Bill, or PIB, is aimed at increasing
the country&#8217;s share of profits from oil pumped off its shores.
The government claims that extraction laws going back to 1993
are based on crude at $20 a barrel and unrealistic at prices
that are now more than four times as high. The energy companies
have warned Nigeria against driving away investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to have that interplay and balance between the
fiscal package to be able to incentivize investments,&#8221; Mark
Ward, managing director of Exxon&#8217;s Nigerian unit, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country is seeking to increase its share of profits to
73 percent from 61 percent, Alison-Madueke said Sept. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposals would reduce Nigerian oil output by about 40
percent, Mutiu Sunmonu, Shell&#8217;s local chairman, said Nov. 30.
Shell, Chevron Corp. (CVX), Exxon, Total SA and Eni SpA (ENI), which pump
more than 90 percent of Nigeria&#8217;s oil in ventures with Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp., said in a joint 2009 presentation that
the higher taxes would make exploration uneconomical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The multinationals are really yearning for reform and so
we are not fighting the PIB,&#8221; Sunmonu said today at the
conference. &#8220;We just want to be sure that the pitfalls in the
provisions of the bill are addressed very clearly before it
comes into law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill was approved by Nigeria&#8217;s Cabinet and sent to
Parliament in July, having initially been introduced to
Parliament more than three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal judge&#8217;s ruling last week that Google Inc. (GOOG) can&#8217;t wield some patents to block the sale of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) products may point toward resolution of a fundamental question underlying the global smartphone wars -- what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In cases across the U.S. and Europe, Google, Microsoft and other companies are battling over the power of patents used in industrywide standards for technologies, such as Wi-Fi, that let competing products work together. Patent owners who help set those specifications pledge to license their inventions on &#8220;fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No court has defined that concept, helping spark conflict when companies can&#8217;t agree on a fee. U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle may become the first. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is so much litigation going on trying to determine what a reasonable royalty is,&#8221; said James Kulbaski, a patent lawyer with Oblon Spivak in Alexandria, Virginia. &#8220;Everyone has agreed to pay it, but no one knows what it is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robart ruled on Nov. 30 that, because Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility had agreed to license its standard-essential patents, it was only entitled to seek fair royalties from Microsoft, not to ask the court to forbid sales of Microsoft products that use standards including those patents. The judge&#8217;s next step is to figure out what fees Microsoft should pay. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That threshold question is bedeviling the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the European Commission, the U.S. International Trade Commission and courts on four continents. While the concept of fair and reasonable royalties for essential technologies has been around for decades, the debate heated up with the global legal actions over smartphones and tablet computers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Important Step&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Somehow, this judge is going to have to define fair and reasonable,&#8221; Kulbaski said. Defining what&#8217;s reasonable &#8220;is a key question to all patents related to standards&#8221; and will &#8220;be an important step in future license negotiations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google paid $12.5 billion to buy Motorola Mobility, an early pioneer in the mobile phone market, in part to get access to its patents on industry-standard technologies. The FTC, in a broad-ranging probe of Google, is looking at whether the Mountain View, California, company is improperly using those patents to stifle competition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of the patents in the smartphone wars don&#8217;t relate to industry standards. Still, defining fair and reasonable -- eliminating that contentious issue -- could be a springboard for resolving lawsuits over other patents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Inefficient Litigation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The litigation we&#8217;re seeing, which is costing hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, is inefficient and it would be good to reduce the litigation if possible,&#8221; said Jorge Contreras, an associate law professor at American University in Washington. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a company agrees to license its patents on fair terms, &#8220;the patent holder has told the market that it does not need exclusivity and is willing to accept money in return,&#8221; Contreras said. &#8220;The only question is how much money it is owed, a question that the court should answer soon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), based in Cupertino, California, and Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft argue owners of standard-essential patents shouldn&#8217;t be able to obtain orders that block the use of inventions, a position backed by Robart&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Limits on the patents could discourage companies from participating in groups that set specifications that make electronics work more efficiently, said Adam Mossoff, a George Mason University law professor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Low-Cost Infringement &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The people who are saying it&#8217;s a problem have dominated the public discourse to the point where everyone says there&#8217;s a problem, but the facts on the ground don&#8217;t support that,&#8221; Mossoff said. The companies &#8220;are using the legal system to get away with infringement at a lower cost.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mossoff said these types of disputes have been around for decades, and companies decide what&#8217;s fair without governmental intervention. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is zero evidence of any actual harm to consumers,&#8221; Mossoff said. &#8220;We all have our smartphones, tablets exist and there is amazing technology that comes out every week.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility contends it met its obligations and neither Microsoft nor Apple would bargain. The Libertyville, Illinois-based handset maker made an opening request for 2.25 percent of the retail price of Apple and Microsoft products, a figure both companies called exorbitant as they filed breach-of- contract claims. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apple Suit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s case in Wisconsin was thrown out after the iPhone maker said it would agree to a court-determined royalty only if it was less than $1 per unit. Microsoft, which has agreed to pay a royalty rate set by Robart, has told the judge that an appropriate figure would be for pennies per unit, or less than $1 million a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ITC Judge David Shaw is scheduled to hear arguments this week in a dispute between Motorola Mobility and Microsoft over some of the same patents that are involved in the Seattle federal-court lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agency, which has the power to block U.S. imports of products that infringe American patents, is considering whether it should issue bans on products based on standard-essential patents in a case filed by Samsung Electronics Co. against Apple. At the same time, Samsung is accused by Ericsson AB of refusing to pay fair royalties on wireless standards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission and members of Congress have argued that patent owners shouldn&#8217;t be able to use the threat of a U.S. import ban as a weapon in disagreements about royalty payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Standard Setting &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FTC has signaled it wants a greater role in determining what&#8217;s fair and reasonable. The agency, in a 3-2 decision Nov. 26, forced Robert Bosch GmBh to make standard-essential patents for air conditioners available to competitors as a condition for approving acquisition of the patent owner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FTC is right to take a look at this because we don&#8217;t have any overarching group looking at the standard-setting organizations,&#8221; said Robert Stoll of Drinker Biddle in Washington. &#8220;The consumer is harmed if the other companies can&#8217;t use those standards. The purpose of &#8216;fair and reasonable&#8217; is to give everyone an even playing field.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ian King and Dina Bass" date="Dec 04, 2012 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-04/microsoft-intel-push-to-combat-apple-in-tablets-sputtering-tech.html"><headline>Microsoft-Intel Push to Rival Apple in Tablets Sputtering</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A push by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC) to combat Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad in the $63.2 billion tablet market is getting off to a slow start. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of more than a dozen tablets Microsoft and Intel touted for the new version of Windows, only five can be purchased for immediate U.S. delivery. Early demand for Microsoft&#8217;s first computer, the Surface tablet, seems &#8220;disappointing,&#8221; said Craig Berger, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. And computer makers have been hampered in introducing tablets by limits Microsoft imposed on which manufacturers got a crack at prototypes, and by delays in Intel power-management software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The holdup is making it harder for personal-computer makers, already beleaguered by plummeting demand, to challenge Apple and Google Inc. (GOOG) during the year-end holiday shopping season. While PC variants running Windows abound, tablets built on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology-based chips or low-power processors from Intel are scarce. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can hardly even find one,&#8221; said Bob O&#8217;Donnell, an analyst at market researcher IDC in Framingham, Massachusetts. &#8220;So even if you wanted to buy it, it would be difficult.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The list of Windows tablets is short. In addition to Microsoft&#8217;s Surface, Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)&#8217;s Vivo Tab RT and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)&#8217;s IdeaPad Yoga run the RT version of Windows and boast ARM-based chips. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)&#8217;s ATIV Smart PC and Acer Inc. (2353)&#8217;s Iconia run Windows 8, and rely on Intel chips. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX)&#8217;s deal with Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) to stream new releases, including those from Pixar and
Marvel, signals online viewing has become mainstream and poses a
major threat to traditional pay TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2016, Netflix gains exclusive U.S. TV rights to
movies from Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company,
according to a statement yesterday. That gives the Los Gatos,
California-based video service new films in a time frame
historically reserved for premium channels like Liberty Media
Corp. (LMCA)&#8217;s Starz, as soon as seven months after theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord underscores the shift away from a decades-old
model in which studios prospered by offering blockbuster films
to home viewers on DVD and premium cable channels such as Starz,
Disney&#8217;s current pay-TV partner. Subscription and on-demand
services are becoming an important source of revenue for studios
coping with shrinking DVD sales. Netflix, the online leader, is
now a competitor to Starz, HBO and Showtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a big win for Netflix,&#8221; Jaison Blair, an analyst
with Telsey Advisory Group in New York, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. Tony Wible, an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC who follows both companies,
projects Netflix will pay Burbank, California-based Disney more
than $350 million a year. Barton Crockett, an analyst with
Lazard Capital Markets, estimated Disney gets about $200 million
a year now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exclusive Programs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix gets immediate access to classic titles like
&#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; and &#8220;Dumbo.&#8221; Next year, the service
adds direct-to-video titles, while new films start in 2016.
According to IMDB.com, Disney plans to release Marvel&#8217;s &#8220;Dr.
Strange&#8221; and Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Finding Nemo 2&#8221; that year. The studio
hasn&#8217;t announced any 2016 pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is a coup for Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, who faces emerging competition in online video and
pressure to sell the company from billionaire Carl Icahn. He
said last month he expects Icahn, who controls almost 10 percent
of the company through stock and options, to start a proxy
battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hastings has been pushing to make Netflix available around
the world, arguing people will pay for near-instant access to
content online instead of scheduled TV on premium outlets such
as Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s HBO or CBS Corp. (CBS)&#8217;s Showtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement highlights efforts by Ted Sarandos, the chief
content officer at Netflix, to obtain exclusive rights to films
in the same pay-TV time frame as HBO, Showtime and Starz, or
about seven months to a year after theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sony Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix beat out several competitors for Disney pictures,
Sarandos said, without identifying them. The company will bid
aggressively for exclusive rights to Sony Corp. (6758) films when that
studio&#8217;s contract with Starz ends around 2016, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They negotiate a long way out and we&#8217;ll be at the table
for each of them,&#8221; Sarandos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula Askanas, a Sony spokeswoman, said the company had no
comment on Sarandos&#8217;s remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix fell 3.8 percent to $83.37 at the close in New
York. The shares have advanced 20 percent this year, including
yesterday&#8217;s 14 percent surge. John Malone&#8217;s Liberty Media added
0.8 percent to $106.40. Disney rose 0.6 percent to $49.59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtnee Ulrich, spokeswoman for Englewood, Colorado-based
Liberty Media, didn&#8217;t return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Films from &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; creator Lucasfilm, which Disney is
buying for $4.05 billion, will be included once the purchase is
completed, Sarandos said today at a UBS AG (UBS) conference in New
York. He was interviewed by Harvey Weinstein of the independent
studio Weinstein Co., which also has an exclusive Netflix deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deeper Library &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Disney deal won&#8217;t trigger a price increase, Sarandos
said. The company will keep up an emphasis on exclusive content,
and is considering ways to promote its original shows, including
Web ads, he said. Relations with Icahn are &#8220;very positive,&#8221;
according to Sarandos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Disney, Netflix will be able to stream current or
catalog films from several studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom Inc. (VIAB)&#8217;s Paramount Pictures, home of the &#8220;Star Trek&#8221;
series, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF), owner of the &#8220;Hunger
Games&#8221; films, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. sell to Netflix
through their jointly owned cable channel, Epix. Relativity
Media LLC has an exclusive multiyear agreement with Netflix, as
does DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA), maker of the &#8220;Shrek&#8221;
movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kids&#8217; Programming &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s agreement makes Disney the first major studio
to bypass a traditional cable-TV outlet with its movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With pictures geared to children and families, Netflix can
build a base of subscribers less likely to cancel for competing
offerings, said Scott Devitt, an analyst with Morgan Stanley (MS) who
has a buy rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company is focusing on building a highly
differentiated content catalog aimed at kids, which is a
demographic that has relatively homogeneous tastes,&#8221; Devitt
wrote in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 30 million users worldwide, Netflix is extending its
lead over competing video services by Amazon.com Inc. and Redbox
Instant, from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Coinstar Inc. (CSTR),
which begins public testing this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Domestic Customers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix is also adding exclusive programs such as
&#8220;Lilyhammer&#8221; and &#8220;House of Cards&#8221; as it seeks earlier and
fuller home-video access to studio movies for its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has about 25.1 million U.S. subscribers,
compared with 20.7 million for Starz as of October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney embraced online media sooner than its competitors,
becoming the first major studio to sell and rent TV shows and
movies through Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iTunes. The company&#8217;s largest
shareholder is the trust of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One risk for Disney is that viewers will cancel their
traditional pay-TV service, costing the company subscription
revenue it gets for networks such as ESPN and the Disney
Channel, according to Michael Morris, an analyst with Davenport
 Co. in Richmond, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney has been clear they are platform agnostic,&#8221; said
Morris, who recommends the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Netflix bolsters its film lineup, the announcement
doesn&#8217;t settle a tug-of-war among investors over the company&#8217;s
prospects, said Arvind Bhatia, a Sterne, Agee  Leach analyst
who has a neutral rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With about $4.5 billion in streaming content obligations
due before the Disney films are available, and losses from
international expansion, Netflix must increase subscribers or
raise its $7.99-a-month price for unlimited viewing to remain
viable long-term, Bhatia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a big get, but clearly there are several unknowns
out there to determine if it&#8217;s a good get,&#8221; Bhatia said.
&#8220;Though we don&#8217;t know the financial terms, it&#8217;s clear this was
not a cheap deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michelle Fay Cortez" date="Dec 05, 2012  4:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-05/pfizer-experimental-drug-slows-late-stage-breast-cancer.html"><headline>Pfizer Experimental Drug Slows Late-Stage Breast Cancer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s experimental breast
cancer drug stopped progression of an incurable form of the
disease for more than two years in a study, a dramatic delay for
those with the second-deadliest cancer in women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were given the medicine, called PD 0332991, along
with Novartis (NOVN) AG&#8217;s Femara. The findings, reported today at the
San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, showed no tumor progression
for a median of 26.1 months, compared with 7.5 months in those
who received Femara alone. Results were from the second of three
stages of testing normally needed for U.S. approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine is the first in a new class of agents that
works by blocking a protein critical in the cancer cell cycle,
said lead researcher Richard Finn. It&#8217;s also among the most
promising in New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s drug development pipeline,
with the potential for generating $5 billion in annual sales for
breast and other tumor types, Andrew Baum, an analyst at
Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This magnitude of benefit is probably one of the largest
with any new agent in breast cancer, or perhaps any solid
tumor,&#8221; Finn, an associate professor of medicine at the Jonsson
Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, Los
Angeles, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s dramatic to see
this level of benefit with a new agent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noteworthy Findings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are noteworthy because of the size of the
benefit and comparative safety of the experimental treatment,
said Claudine Isaacs, an oncologist and professor of medicine at
Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington.
The study, involving 165 patients with metastatic disease, was
small and must be confirmed in larger trials, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included women with tumors fueled by the hormone
estrogen, the most common type of breast cancer. All had
metastatic disease, which had spread to other parts of the body
and is no longer considered curable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women. Almost
230,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with it this year,
and more than 39,900 will die from it, according to the American
Cancer Society. Lung cancer is the deadliest form of the disease
for women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does make you stop and look,&#8221; Isaacs said in a
telephone interview. The results are &#8220;much more marked than we
typically see. It&#8217;s hard to ignore that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
something that is changing practice today, but it&#8217;s definitely
something to keep one&#8217;s eye on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Mega-Blockbuster Potential&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have overlooked the drug&#8217;s &#8220;mega-blockbuster
potential,&#8221; said Baum, the Citigroup analyst. Pfizer is at
least two years ahead of its closest competitors, Eli Lilly 
Co. (LLY) and Novartis, with similar cancer drugs in development, he
said in his Nov. 29 investment note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 1.9 percent to $25.64 at 4 p.m. New York time.
The shares have gained 29 percent in the past 12 months. Onyx
Pharmaceuticals Inc., which licensed rights to the experimental
drug to Pfizer, rose 3.4 percent to $77.05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results presented today stem from an interim review of
the data and come on top of potent treatment, Finn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-five percent of patients given the drug combination
responded to therapy, compared with 31 percent given Femara
alone. When the researchers included women who had stable
disease for six months or more, 70 percent given both drugs
benefited, compared with 44 percent of those given Femara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is moving the compound into the final stage of
testing needed for approval as quickly as possible, with an
international trial in the same type of cancer slated to begin
next year, said Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of
clinical development in the company&#8217;s oncology unit. Additional
research is examining other types of tumors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Discussion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also talking to regulators to determine what
kind of information will be needed to win marketing approval of
the medicine, he said in a telephone interview. While the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration typically requires two studies
confirming the benefits of an investigational agent, it has
leeway to expedite the process for promising drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in three patients needed to have their dose of
the experimental drug lowered during the study. Side effects
included low levels of infection-fighting white blood cells,
anemia and fatigue, though there weren&#8217;t any serious cases of
fever tied to the low white blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 66 patients were post-menopausal women with
estrogen-receptor positive cancer. The second 99 patients also
had tumors that were fueled by estrogen, though they had genetic
alterations the researchers hoped could further identify people
who would benefit from the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Disease &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half the women were initially diagnosed with advanced
disease and hadn&#8217;t gotten previous drug treatment. The other
half had previously received chemotherapy or treatment after
surgery to remove the tumor, Finn said. Laboratory work
conducted before the study began suggested the Pfizer medicine
was particularly potent against estrogen-receptor positive
cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no differences in response among women with the
biomarkers and those who didn&#8217;t have them, Finn said. Both sets
of patients had a significant benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The drug obviously hits a critical pathway in estrogen-
receptor positive breast cancer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we took triple
negative breast cancer, we wouldn&#8217;t expect this result.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is reaching out to cancer experts to help devise the
most efficient studies to answer questions about when and how
the drug should be given, and what other medicines should be
given with it to maximize the benefit, Rothenberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an irony of having a drug moving forward as quickly
as we can,&#8221; Rothenberg said. &#8220;There will be gaps in our
knowledge of how to give it and when. We&#8217;re trying to move
forward with a thoughtful, methodical approach.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metastatic Cancer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study targeted women who were newly diagnosed with
metastatic, or spreading, breast cancer. There are several other
effective treatments available even after the experimental
compound stops working, Finn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The magnitude of this benefit I don&#8217;t think should be
underestimated,&#8221; Finn said. &#8220;These are patients who have
incurable breast cancer. A lot of drugs in oncology have been
approved or are getting a lot of traction because of
improvements that last weeks to a few months. We have gone from
7 months to 26 months. That&#8217;s groundbreaking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Rich Jaroslovsky" date="Dec 05, 2012  4:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-05/nokia-lumia-htc-8x-gamble-on-microsoft-rich-jaroslovsky.html"><headline>Nokia Lumia, HTC 8X Gamble on Microsoft: Rich Jaroslovsky</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;How should we think about the Nokia (NOK1V)
Lumia 920 and HTC (2498) 8X? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we view them as the twin flagships of Microsoft&#8217;s
new Windows Phone 8 operating system? By that standard, they&#8217;re
impressive: two polished, highly capable new devices that show
off Microsoft&#8217;s colorful, innovative software to great effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or do we take into account external issues, like the
business struggles of both companies and the fact that WinPhone
8 versions of such critical applications as Spotify, Instagram
and Pinterest are missing in action? In that case, these look
more like desperate efforts by two also-rans in hardware to
hitch their fates to an also-ran in mobile-device software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to think the former. But a little caution is in
order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, Windows Phone 8 looks a lot like its
predecessor, Windows Phone 7. It preserves the same distinctive,
tile-based interface, albeit with a few tweaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now, for instance, choose from three sizes of
tiles, giving you additional control over your start screen. New
&#8220;Kid&#8217;s Corner&#8221; parental controls let you lock down certain
features and content before you hand the phone over to Junior to
play with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the visible changes are few, things are vastly
different beneath the hood. Essentially, Microsoft (MSFT) pulled out
the engine and rebuilt it from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Powerful Processors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operating system now supports more powerful processors
and higher-resolution screens than Windows Phone 7 could
handle.&#160;The flip side is that apps written for the new software
won&#8217;t run on WinPhone 7 hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the new phones, if you put the Lumia 920 and 8X side
by side, it isn&#8217;t easy to tell them apart. The Lumia has a
marginally larger screen -- 4.5 inches, versus 4.3 inches for
the 8X -- but both displays are beautiful, with bright colors,
deep blacks and even more pixels per square inch than the iPhone
5&#8217;s 4-inch Retina display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glass is also rounded at the corners and framed by very
thin bezels. Both phones have polycarbonate bodies and are
available in a selection of colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick them up, though, and a big difference becomes
apparent: The Lumia is a brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heavy Duty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 6.5 ounces, it&#8217;s one of the heaviest current-model
smartphones -- 65 percent heavier than Apple (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone 5 and 39
percent heavier than the Samsung (005930) Galaxy S III, which has a
larger screen. It&#8217;s even heavier than Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Note II,
which, with its enormous 5.5-inch screen, is almost more tablet
than phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of tablets, the Lumia is almost 50 percent
thicker than an iPad mini. In short, this is one big hunk of
hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, offsetting benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the price: In the U.S., the Lumia costs only
$100 on a two-year contract with ATT. For that, you get a
generous 32 gigabytes of storage, a Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon S4
processor and, a specialty of Nokia&#8217;s, a high-quality 8.7-
megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss optics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also runs over ATT (T)&#8217;s ultrafast 4G LTE network, if
you&#8217;re lucky enough to live in one of the 100 or so markets
where the service has been rolled out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neat Extras &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the extras. One is the ability to charge the
phone wirelessly simply by laying it on top of an optional $49
charging pad. (ATT is including the pad for a limited time at
no extra cost.) And there&#8217;s an excellent maps application.
(Nokia owns Navteq, one of the world&#8217;s major providers of
geographic data.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Lumia 920 is so far available only on ATT, HTC&#8217;s
8X is appearing on both ATT and Verizon Wireless, where it can
access LTE, as well as on T-Mobile (DTE), whose non-LTE &#8220;4G&#8221; network
generally provides slower speeds. The Verizon (VZ) version also
supports wireless charging, though I wasn&#8217;t able to try it out
since my test unit was from ATT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 8X has the same processor as the Lumia 920 but costs
twice as much for half the storage: $200 for 16 gigabytes. (ATT
is also offering an eight-gigabyte model for $100.) It also has
a less-beefy battery (though both should get you through a full
day of normal use) and an eight-megapixel camera that&#8217;s OK, but
that I didn&#8217;t like as much as the Lumia&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the 8X is a far more compact package,
both lighter -- 4.6 ounces -- and thinner. And HTC has put some
extra effort into the audio, including Beats technology and an
amplifier for cranking up the volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#8217;s your choice: value, power and camera versus
comfort, elegance and sound. With just a little question mark
about what the future holds for all three companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold, still in its longest winning
streak in at least nine decades, will probably peak in 2013 and
keep declining the following year as U.S. growth accelerates,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices will peak in 2013 before declining even as the
Federal Reserve expands stimulus, the bank said in an e-mailed
report today. Bullion will be at $1,825 an ounce in three
months, $1,805 in six months and $1,800 in a year&#8217;s time, it
said, lowering its three-month forecast from $1,840 and its six-
and 12-month outlooks from $1,940. It introduced an average 2014
estimate of $1,750. This year&#8217;s average is $1,670. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal is headed for a 12th consecutive annual gain as
central banks from the U.S. to Europe to China pledged more
steps to spur economic growth. Investors are holding a record
amount in gold-backed exchange-traded products and nations from
Russia to South Korea added to gold reserves this year. Global
growth will accelerate to 3.6 percent in 2013, from 3.3 percent
this year, the International Monetary Fund estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the short term, the combination of more easing and
weaker growth should prove supportive to gold,&#8221; Jeffrey Currie,
an analyst at the bank, wrote in the report. &#8220;Medium term,
however, the gold outlook is caught between the opposing forces
of more Fed easing and a gradual increase in U.S. real rates on
better US economic growth. Our expanded modeling suggests that
the improving U.S. growth outlook will outweigh further Fed
balance sheet expansion and that the cycle in gold prices will
likely turn in 2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold Price &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold traded at $1,695.60 by 9:19 a.m. on the Comex in New
York, set for an 8.2 percent advance this year. Futures reached
a record $1,923.70 in September 2011. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
gauge of 24 commodities added 0.2 percent since the beginning of
January and the MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) of equities rose 11
percent. Treasuries returned 2.7 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold rallied 70 percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of
debt in two rounds of monetary easing from December 2008 through
June 2011. The central bank said Oct. 24 it will maintain $40
billion in monthly purchases of mortgage debt and probably hold
interest rates near zero until mid-2015. It has swapped shorter
term securities for longer term debt through its $667 billion
Operation Twist program that is scheduled to end by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We find that gold prices &#8216;look through&#8217; easing that does
not require Fed balance sheet expansion - like Operation Twist -
increasing instead on announcements of easing through expansion
on the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet,&#8221; Currie said. &#8220;Risks to our growth
outlook remain elevated, however, especially given the
uncertainty around the fiscal cliff, making calling the peak in
gold prices a difficult exercise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fiscal Cliff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama is hardening his stance in his first
post-election confrontation with Republicans, declaring that he
will make no deal on the country&#8217;s fiscal future unless
congressional leaders first accept tax-rate increases for top
earners. If the so-called fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax
increases that will kick in at the beginning of next year isn&#8217;t
averted, the U.S. may face a recession, according to the
Congressional Budget Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without additional easing by the Fed late next year, gold
may fall to $1,625 by the end of 2014, Goldman predicts. Under
weaker U.S. growth, prices may reach $1,900 by the end of next
year, while better growth means bullion may stall near current
prices, before falling to $1,500 by the end of 2014, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Richter" date="Dec 05, 2012 10:18 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-05/commodities-super-cycle-not-ending-as-goldman-sees-more-gains.html"><headline>Commodities &#8216;Super Cycle&#8217; Not Ending as Goldman Sees More Gains</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;super cycle&#8221; of gains for
commodity prices is not ending as improving global economic
growth boosts demand for raw materials, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising consumption may create limited availability of
immediate supplies and boost near-term prices higher than long-
term levels, a trading opportunity that may provide
&#8220;significant&#8221; returns, New York-based Jeffrey Currie,
Goldman&#8217;s head of commodity research, said in an e-mailed report
today. The bank reiterated its recommendation that investors
should be &#8220;overweight&#8221; in commodities, and that prices will
return 7 percent in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As economic growth improves into the latter half of 2013,
we believe current fundamentals are likely to create near-term
shortages,&#8221; Currie said. &#8220;We now believe that any upside will
be more near term and demand driven in nature as opposed to long
term and supply driven, which leads us to expect a return to
high near-term prices relative to long-term prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
which has increased almost fourfold since 2001, is little
changed this year as growth slowed in economies including China,
the world&#8217;s biggest consumer of cotton, soybeans and copper.
Goldman&#8217;s view contrasts with Citigroup Inc., which said the
&#8220;super cycle&#8221; has ended in a Nov. 19 report written by
analysts including Edward L. Morse, the bank&#8217;s global head of
commodities research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodity &#8216;Renaissance&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With commodity supply constraints easing, Chinese growth
slowing and producer company returns normalizing, it is tempting
to call an end to the commodity super cycle,&#8221; Goldman said.
&#8220;However, we believe current market developments are simply the
next phase of a commodity investment cycle that commenced in the
late 1990s and, like previous phases, it will create new
investment opportunities and should therefore be viewed more as
a &#8216;renaissance.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other money managers have increased their
bets on higher commodity prices in the past two weeks, with
investor net-long positions climbing 20 percent since Nov. 13 to
929,588 futures and options contracts, U.S. government data
show. Holdings are still down 30 percent since this year&#8217;s peak
in September as Chinese manufacturing cooled, Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis worsened and U.S. leaders failed to reach a budget
agreement to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff of tax increases
and spending cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman recommended an equally-weighted position in rolling
front-month indices in petroleum, corn and copper, with a
targeted return of as much as 12 percent over six months. The
bank forecast crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
$99 a barrel in 2014, saying the global market will stay
&#8220;cyclically tight&#8221; with low inventories next year and in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drug companies and universities are
spending 55.6 million euros ($72.7 million) to develop a bank of
stem cells to use in testing potential treatments for hard-to-
treat diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort, known as Stembancc and managed by the
University of Oxford in England, will focus on generating 1,500
induced pluripotent stem cell lines, researchers said at a
London news conference. The cells will be used by drugmakers
including Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Sanofi (SAN) and Roche Holding AG (ROG) to test
treatments for peripheral nervous disorders, pain, dementia,
migraine, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and diabetes
and to perform toxicology tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a pioneering effort,&#8221; said Zameel Cader, a
neurologist at Oxford and one of Stembancc&#8217;s leaders. &#8220;We want
to be a flagship project within Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers chose to use induced pluripotent stem
cells, which are adult stem cells that can be reprogrammed to
generate any type of cell, because they probably have the
genetic information needed for studying the diseases, Cader
said. John Gurdon of the U.K. and Shinya Yamanaka of Japan won
the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work on
induced pluripotent stem cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private
collaboration of the European Union and the European Federation
of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, is contributing
26 million euros of the cost; the EFPIA is contributing 21
million euros; and other organizations are giving 8.6 million
euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, initiated by Roche, involves 10 drugmakers and
23 universities, the Basel, Switzerland-based company said in a
statement. Other companies involved include Abbott Laboratories (ABT),
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY), Johnson  Johnson,
Merck KGaA (MRK), Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) and Orion Oyj. (ORNAV) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP, a
London-based buyout firm, has hired Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to advise on the sale of German energy-metering
business Ista International GmbH, according to three people 
familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is scheduled to kick off early next year, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because talks are
private. Charterhouse is seeking more than 3 billion euros
($3.93 billion) for the company as well as so-called staple
financing from banks of more than 2 billion euros for potential
buyers, people familiar with the matter said last month. An IPO
is also an option, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ista, based in Essen, Germany, provides electricity, water,
heat and gas-meter reading services and hardware to property
managers, home owners and utilities in 25 countries. The company
may benefit from tougher European Union rules that require
energy distributors to save 1.5 percent of their sale volumes
annually, as part of efforts to meet the EU&#8217;s target of 20
percent energy savings by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ista may be one of the largest private-equity asset
transactions in Germany next year. Springer Science  Business
Media, the German academic publisher being sold by EQT Partners
AB, may fetch 3 billion euros to 4 billion euros, people
familiar with the sale have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charterhouse couldn&#8217;t provide any official to comment on
the matter. Spokesmen at Ista, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and
CVC Capital Partners Ltd. declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charterhouse bought Ista from CVC for 2.4 billion euros in
2007. CVC re-invested part of the proceeds to buy a stake in
Ista. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are offering so-called staple financing of about 7
times Ista&#8217;s estimated earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of about 315 million euros, people
said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms often arrange staple financing to
support a sale, as it shows other buyout firms an estimate of
how much debt the deal can draw and the return they can achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repsol SA (REP), the Madrid-based oil and
gas company, accused Chevron Corp. in a lawsuit in federal court
in Manhattan of improperly obtaining rights to develop Argentine
shale and natural gas resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed yesterday, Repsol accuses Chevron of
getting those rights from Buenos Aires-based YPF SA (YPF) in
negotiations with officers appointed by Argentina&#8217;s government,
which expropriated the company, not &#8220;legitimate managers&#8221;
appointed by Repsol as its majority shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron nevertheless has assured Argentina and the
government-appointed managers that it is willing to overlook
this illegal conduct and partner in Argentina&#8217;s illegal scheme
to deprive Repsol of its rightful interest in the energy
assets,&#8221; according to the Spanish company&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accusing San Ramon, California-based Chevron of unjust
enrichment and interfering with its contractual relations,
Repsol seeks a court order blocking Chevron&#8217;s development of the
Vaca Muerta formation, which holds the equivalent of 23 billion
barrels of oil, and other assets, according to Repsol&#8217;s
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no legal basis for this lawsuit against Chevron
Corp. (CVX) or the unit that signed a memorandum of understanding with
YPF in September, said James Craig, a spokesman for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron Argentina stands by the legitimacy of its
MOU,&#8221; Craig said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The company also
remains firmly committed to its long-standing business
relationship with YPF and to helping Argentina achieve its goal
of returning to energy self-sufficiency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Repsol SA v. Chevron Corp., 12-cv-8799, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Dec 06, 2012  4:49 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-06/chevron-seen-eyeing-cobalt-to-kosmos-in-oil-hunt-real-m-a.html"><headline>Chevron Seen Eyeing Cobalt to Kosmos in Oil Hunt:Real M&amp;amp;A</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the U.S. oil giant
facing its longest slide in energy output in four years, could
tap record cash to reignite growth by acquiring Cobalt
International Energy Inc. (CIE) or Kosmos Energy Ltd. (KOS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural gas production from Chevron&#8217;s wells during
the third quarter dwindled to the lowest since 2008, slashing
profit by one-third and adding to declines that had already
forced the world&#8217;s fourth-largest energy company to abandon its
full-year output target. Even after the earnings drop, Chevron&#8217;s
cash stood at an all-time high of $21.3 billion, exceeding that
of bigger rivals Exxon (XOM) Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA),
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Chevron is spending more than $45 billion to harvest
Australian natural gas fields that will produce enough of the
fuel to supply all of China&#8217;s gas-import terminals, Phoenix
Partners Group LP says the company still has ample resources to
expand into nascent oil-exploration regions. Cobalt&#8217;s billion-
barrel discovery off the coast of Angola could bolster Chevron&#8217;s
deep-water African reserves, and Kosmos and Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR)
control &#8220;significant&#8221; untapped deposits from Tanzania to
Morocco, according to Tudor Pickering Holt  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron is going to have to grow through acquisitions,&#8221;
Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Phoenix Partners in
New York, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;They are going to
have to come to the market because they haven&#8217;t returned the $21
billion on the balance sheet to shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Heavy Investment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Avram, a Chevron spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement that the San Ramon, California-based company&#8217;s &#8220;cash
position supports our long-held financial priorities,&#8221; and
declined to comment on any acquisition plans. He referenced a
March presentation to analysts in which Chief Financial Officer
Pat Yarrington listed the company&#8217;s priorities, which included
paying dividends, funding capital projects and returning surplus
cash to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in a period of heavy investment and our cash
balance allows us to weather lower commodity prices,&#8221; Avram
wrote. &#8220;We view a strong balance sheet as a risk mitigation
tool.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, with a market value of $206 billion, said last
month that it pumped 3.2 percent less oil and gas from its
56,000 wells during the third quarter compared with a year
earlier, extending the company&#8217;s streak of production declines
to a seventh straight quarter, the longest since a nine-quarter
stretch that ended in 2008. Shutdowns related to weather and
repairs contributed to the recent drop, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) opens an expanded section of its Magic Kingdom today with the aim of drawing more visitors to a Florida park battling stagnant attendance for the past five years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney World employees at the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride now hand out pagers to guests, who can take children to an air-conditioned play area until their turn comes. Customers are also able to purchase beer and wine in the park for the first time at a new restaurant modeled after the animated movie &#8220;Beauty and the Beast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes to the Fantasyland area, estimated by Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. to cost $300 million, mark the biggest expansion in the 41-year history of Disney&#8217;s Magic Kingdom in Orlando. They are part of a wider effort by the world&#8217;s largest theme-park company to find high-tech ways to shorten lines and boost sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;With new technologies, we&#8217;ve got greater capability to immerse people in stories,&#8221; Thomas Staggs, chairman of Disney parks and resorts, said in an interview. &#8220;The food can come out sort of magically and appear. In the Little Mermaid queue, it&#8217;s not so much waiting as playing a game and interacting with the crabs. That&#8217;s technology that wasn&#8217;t there when Walt was first envisioning the park.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bibbidi Bobbidi &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reducing wait times for rides frees guests to spend money elsewhere in the park and should lead to higher profit eventually, according to Jaison Blair, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re not standing in line you&#8217;ll take your daughter to the Bibbidi Bobbidi salon or your son to the store to buy something,&#8221; Blair said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes aren&#8217;t cheap. Jay Rasulo, Disney&#8217;s chief financial officer, said on a Nov. 8 conference call that investments in the resorts unit, including new cruise ships and the remodeling in Orlando, will lead to roughly $500 million in added revenue this fiscal year -- and a similar rise in costs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bulls like me say, &#8216;Yes, you are managing this asset for a lifetime and you must do periodic projects like this,&#8217;&#8221; said Todd Juenger, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. &#8220;Bears look at the same situation and say, &#8216;That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t like the parks business, it&#8217;s a capital sinkhole.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hologram Crabs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal is a more enjoyable experience for customers. Guests waiting to ride the new Under the Sea: Journey of Little Mermaid attraction can peer through portholes and tell hologram crabs to collect treasure from the ocean floor. Diners at the castle-themed Be Our Guest restaurant enter orders on a touchscreen and head to their tables with a plastic rose- imprinted device that directs servers to their location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney is also serving beer and wine with dinner at the restaurant, a first for the park. Among the options, a $69 bottle of the Lasseter Family St. Emilion Red Blend from the winery of John Lasseter, chief creative officer of Disney&#8217;s animation studios. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fantasyland, one of the original themed areas in the park and home to attractions such as Cinderella Castle and It&#8217;s a Small World, is more than doubling in size with the makeover, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the two-year-plus construction, Disney closed Mickey&#8217;s Toontown Fair, a 1988 addition, and built an Enchanted Forest with waterfalls and castles tied to &#8220;The Little Mermaid&#8221; and &#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; animated films. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The additions include Maurice&#8217;s Cottage, where kids can take part in an interactive play with Belle, a character from &#8220;Beauty and the Beast,&#8221; and Beast&#8217;s Castle, where parents can dine on thyme-scented pork chops as fake snow falls outside of windows nearby. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next Generation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a quantum leap forward in atmosphere for a Disney restaurant,&#8221; said Kevin Yee, a former employee who blogs at Ultimateorlando.com. &#8220;They&#8217;ve obviously spent a ton of money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the use of pagers, new restaurant technology and interactive entertainment for waiting riders, the Fantasyland redo marks a step in a larger initiative that Disney calls next generation. The goal is for guests to pick rides and attractions before and during their trips to skip lines or shorten waits, according to Staggs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walt Disney&#8217;s resorts division, which includes the parks, cruise ships and a Hawaiian hotel, is the Burbank, California- based company&#8217;s second-largest business after television networks, contributing 31 percent of revenue and 19 percent of operating income in the last fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Most Popular &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Magic Kingdom remains the world&#8217;s most-popular theme park, attendance has been little changed at around 17 million visitors annually for the previous five years, according to a report by the Themed Entertainment Association and the consulting firm Aecom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Universal Studios&#8217; nearby Islands of Adventure boosted attendance 66 percent to 7.6 million over two years, after opening the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in 2010, according to the report. Universal Studios is owned by Comcast Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.5 percent to $49.06 at the close in New York. The shares had gained 31 percent this year, to rank eighth in the 16-stock SP 500 Media Index. Comcast, up 57 percent, is first. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The broader strategy is to meet Universal head on,&#8221; said John Gerner, a theme-park consultant in Richmond, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass and Brian Womack" date="Dec 06, 2012  3:58 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-06/facebook-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-microsoft-s-atlas-ad-product.html"><headline>Facebook Said to Be in Talks to Buy Microsoft&#8217;s Atlas Ad Product</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) is in talks to purchase
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Atlas Web advertising-placement service, a
person familiar with the matter said, a deal that would step up
Facebook&#8217;s rivalry with Google Inc. (GOOG) in the online-ad market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, seeking to sell assets from its $6.3 billion
acquisition of AQuantive Inc., is unlikely to get more than a
price in the tens of millions, according to another person, who
asked not to be named because the discussions are private.
Microsoft wrote down almost the entire value of the 2007
AQuantive deal earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlas&#8217;s tools help companies choose and place ads on
websites and monitor their effectiveness. Facebook, the biggest
social network, may be looking to bolster its challenge to
search leader Google, which gained ad-serving technology with
its $3.2 billion acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008. At stake is
an online display-advertising market that is expected to reach
$32.8 billion this year, up 19 percent from 2011, according to
ZenithOptimedia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AllThingsD reported the talks earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon McCormick, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to
comment. Microsoft declined to comment in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has focused more of its attention and funds on
building its search-based advertising business, at the expense
of the graphical-display ad business that includes Atlas and the
AQuantive assets. At the same time, Microsoft would benefit from
increased display-ad competition for Google, making a sale to
Facebook -- a Microsoft partner -- a good option, said one of
the people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays
Plc (BARC) joined a creditor group in American Airlines&#8217; bankruptcy
case that may provide financing for the carrier&#8217;s restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee has expanded to 20 members from 12 since
September, according to a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in New York disclosing its members and their company debt
holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Airlines&#8217; parent, AMR Corp. (AAMRQ), said in court papers
in August that it would negotiate with the group about potential
financing for its reorganization. It won court approval to pay
fees of the group&#8217;s advisers as negotiations proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group holds claims against American Airlines and AMR,
according to today&#8217;s filing. Besides Goldman Sachs and Barclays,
members include JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Credit Suisse Group AG,
Claren Road Asset Management and Marathon Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks sold $85.6 million of notes
tied to the stock price of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in November, the
biggest month for securities tied to the company since December
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest offering was $37.6 million of three-year auto-
callable notes sold by UBS AG (UBSN) on Nov. 30. The securities yield
10.7 percent a year as long as the share price doesn&#8217;t fall
below 75 percent of its initial value of $41.08 with all capital
at risk, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. UBS can call the notes
quarterly starting in March. It distributed the securities for a
2.25 percent fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have bought $289.9 million of notes tied to the
largest U.S. bank by assets this year, the most referencing any
bank and 40 percent more than through the end of November 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks sold $111.4
million of notes tied to shares of Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the next
biggest-selling bank used as a reference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan Chase have gained 24 percent to $41.20

&lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) and Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) are among technology companies that will open new offices
in East London as the U.K. government pledged 50 million pounds
($81 million) to revamp the startup hub known as Silicon
Roundabout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds will go to refurbishing the neighborhood to the
East of London&#8217;s old city, to create the &#8220;largest indoor civic
space&#8221; in Europe to host classrooms and working space, the Tech
City Investment (CLIG) Organization, a branch of the government&#8217;s trade
and investment department, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London has been working to attract technology jobs and
investment to the city as the U.K. grapples with budget
shortfalls and unemployment. Microsoft has committed to opening
a technology development center which will employ young people
as apprentices, Tech City said in the statement. Cisco will
partner with University College London and DC Thomson, the
Scottish publisher of the Beano comic series, to create a center
that will host digital and media companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.K. is in a global race, and I am determined that we
as a government continue doing everything we can to equip the
U.K. to compete and thrive,&#8221; Prime Minister David Cameron said
in the statement. &#8220;As well as backing the businesses of today,
we are creating an aspiration nation and also backing the
innovative, high-growth businesses of the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Chambers of Commerce cut its growth forecasts
for 2013 and 2014 this week as George Osborne, chancellor of the
exchequer, announced a fiscal plan that cut welfare spending and
pensions of the wealthy. The unemployment rate in the U.K. for
the three months ended in August was 7.9 percent, or 2.53
million jobless, according to the Office for National

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services provider, drew fire from a
worker organization for a change to its 401(k) retirement plan
that cuts the frequency of company contributions to once a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will switch from matching employee
contributions to their 401(k) plans twice a month to every Dec.
15, a move that &#8220;shortchanges IBM employees,&#8221; Alliance@IBM
said on its website. While the amount that employees receive
isn&#8217;t changing, workers who leave or are fired before Dec. 15
won&#8217;t get their payment for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said the change was made to help keep the company
competitive. The move may set a precedent for companies looking
for savings in employee benefits, said Dan Kravitz, president of
Kravitz Inc., which administers about 1,000 retirement plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if other employers started to
look at this for their plan,&#8221; Kravitz said in an interview.
&#8220;Requiring employees to stay through the end of the year to get
a match would be pretty significant cost savings for such a
large employer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. workers have increasingly relied on 401(k) plans since
the 1980s, when defined-benefit plans became less common. The
name refers to a section of Internal Revenue Code enacted in
1978 that lets workers contribute to their retirement accounts
on a tax-deferred basis. Americans held $3.3 trillion in 401(k)
plans as of June 30, according to the Washington-based
Investment Company Institute, a trade group for the mutual fund
industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will pay
$1.5 million to settle U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
claims the firm failed to supervise a trader who hid an $8.3
billion position. One CFTC commissioner dissented, saying the
penalty is far too small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs inadequately policed trades made by Matthew
Marshall Taylor on seven days in late 2007, ultimately suffering
more than $118 million in losses as his bets were unwound,
according to the CFTC. Later, Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t send the
regulator &#8220;important information&#8221; on the incident that was
provided to another industry watchdog, the CFTC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the egregious nature of the failure to supervise
adequately, combined with the high number of violative
transactions, I believe that the monetary penalty should be
significantly higher,&#8221; Bart Chilton, one of three Democrats at
the CFTC, wrote in a dissent posted on the regulator&#8217;s website.
Fines should represent more than a &#8220;slap on the wrist,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor concealed the position by bypassing the New York-
based firm&#8217;s internal system for routing trades to the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and manually entering fabricated futures
trades in a different internal system, the CFTC wrote in a
complaint filed against him at federal court last month. His
attorney disputed those allegations at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and CIFG
Assurance North America Inc. retained a mediator as the two
companies seek to settle a lawsuit in New York state court in
Manhattan, according to a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer sued Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme
Court in August 2011, accusing the New York-based investment
bank of making misrepresentations in connection with the
securitization of a portfolio of 6,204 mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides have participated in one mediation session
and have scheduled another for Dec. 19, according to a document
filed in court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice O. Peter Sherwood in May granted Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
motion to dismiss three counts in the lawsuit, including one for
fraudulent inducement, while refusing to throw out three claims
for breach of contract. He also granted a motion by Buffalo, New
York-based MT Bank Corp. to remove it as a defendant &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIFG and Goldman Sachs appealed Sherwood&#8217;s decision, and
the judge in July ordered the two sides to engage in mediation,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIFG filed another lawsuit against Goldman Sachs in the
same court this week, accusing the bank of fraudulently inducing
the insurer to provide a policy on a credit default swap
guaranteeing $325 million of notes in a collateralized debt
obligation called Fortius II Funding Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Comment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a phone interview today, Michael DuVally, a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on yesterday&#8217;s filing or
the CIFG suit filed this week. Attorneys for CIFG didn&#8217;t
immediately return voice-mail messages and e-mails seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIFG, based in New York, has taken similar actions in the
same court during the past three years, including a $277 million
suit against GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. filed in October
and a $150 million suit against Bank of America Corp. filed last
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CIFG Assurance North America Inc. v. Goldman,
Sachs  Co., 652286/2011, New York Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold traders are the least bullish in
seven weeks as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the metal&#8217;s longest
winning streak in at least nine decades will peak next year amid
accelerating U.S. growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices
to rise next week and 10 were bearish. A further seven were
neutral, making the proportion of bulls the lowest since Oct.
19. Goldman lowered its 12-month estimate by 7 percent to $1,800
an ounce on Dec. 5 and said the metal would average $1,750 in
2014. Morgan Stanley said yesterday bullion will be among next
year&#8217;s best-performing commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors from John Paulson to George Soros are holding a
$143.7 billion bet through record holdings in bullion-backed
exchange-traded products as central banks from the U.S. to China
pledge more steps to spur economic growth. While gold is headed
for a 12th consecutive annual gain, it has failed to reach a new
record this year for the first time since 2007. Global economic
expansion will accelerate to 3.6 percent in 2013, from 3.3
percent this year, the International Monetary Fund estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold remains in the middle of a superstorm, but it&#8217;s not
the perfect storm,&#8221; said Filip Petersson, an analyst at SEB AB
in Stockholm. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the time to short gold but on the other
hand it is not very appealing either. If the global recovery
picks up pace without inflation the game is over for gold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold Price &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold rose 8.8 percent to $1,701.70 in London this year,
reaching a one-month low today. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI gauge
of 24 commodities lost 1.7 percent since the beginning of
January and the MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) of equities climbed
11 percent. Treasuries returned 2.8 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve said Oct. 24 it will maintain $40
billion in monthly purchases of mortgage debt and probably hold
interest rates near zero until mid-2015. Gold rose 70 percent as
the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of monetary
easing from December 2008 through June 2011. Prices will average
$1,853 in 2013, 11 percent more than this year&#8217;s average, Morgan
Stanley estimates, citing a weaker dollar, low interest rates
and purchases by central banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors buying bullion as a hedge against inflation and a
weaker dollar generally earn returns only through price gains,
increasing its allure as interest rates decline. The U.S. Dollar
Index, a measure against six currencies, reached a six-week low
two days ago. U.S. Mint sales of American Eagle gold coins more
than doubled in November to 136,500 ounces, the most since July
2010, data on its website show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETP Holdings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal held through ETPs increased every year since 2003,
when the first product was listed, and reached a record 2,627.6
metric tons Dec. 5, equal to almost a year of mine production,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Soros Fund Management
LLC raised its stake in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest gold
ETP, by 49 percent in the third quarter and Paulson  Co.
maintained the largest holding now valued at $3.6 billion, U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold will peak next year even as the Fed expands stimulus,
according to Goldman, which expects a price of $1,825 in three
months. It may drop to $1,625 by the end of 2014 without
additional Fed easing or $1,500 if U.S. growth is better than
expected, the bank said. America&#8217;s expansion will slow this
quarter before accelerating in the next four, the median of as
many as 73 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While BNP Paribas SA expects central-bank stimulus to help
gold set a new record next year, the bank cut its 2013 forecast
for average prices by 1.8 percent yesterday to $1,865 and
predicts $1,780 in 2014. That would be the first drop in average
annual prices in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Average &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices averaged a record $1,668 so far this year. They&#8217;re
yet to beat the all-time high of $1,921.15 set in September
2011. The 5.3 percent drop since Oct. 5 pushed gold below its
100-day moving average this week for the first time since
August. That may be because some hedge funds are selling the
metal to cover redemptions, economist Dennis Gartman wrote in
his daily newsletter yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hedge funds that have underperformed and need to raise
liquidity for redemptions are likely to sell their winners,&#8221;
said Jeffrey Sica, who helps oversee more than $1 billion of
assets as president of SICA Wealth Management in Morristown, New
Jersey. &#8220;We will get momentum again, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
going to come until after the first of the year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based IMF cut its 2013 growth forecast twice
since July as Europe contends with a credit crisis and expansion
slowed in China, last year&#8217;s second-biggest gold buyer. Jewelry
demand slumped 9.8 percent in the first nine months, World Gold
Council data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hedge Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds&#8217; bets on a rally this year are on average about
28 percent lower than in 2011, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. They raised wagers in the three weeks to
Nov. 27, with their net-long position of 168,238 contracts now
15 percent below the 13-month high set in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other commodities, 15 of 25 traders and analysts
surveyed expect copper to gain next week and six were bearish.
The metal for delivery in three months, the London Metal
Exchange&#8217;s benchmark contract, climbed 5.8 percent to $8,040 a
ton this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of 10 people surveyed expect raw sugar to rise next
week and the same amount predict a decline. The commodity slid
18 percent to 19.19 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Super Cycle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen of 27 people surveyed anticipate higher corn
prices next week and six said the grain will decline, while 18
of 28 said soybeans will rise and eight expect lower prices. Ten
of 21 traders predicted higher wheat prices and five were
bearish. Corn rose 15 percent to $7.415 a bushel this year as
soybeans advanced 23 percent to $14.81 a bushel in Chicago.
Wheat gained 31 percent at $8.5725 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley joined Goldman in predicting the so-called
commodity super cycle isn&#8217;t over as the SP GSCI gauge headed
for its worst year since 2008. Goldman reiterated its
recommendation that investors should be &#8220;overweight&#8221; in raw
materials, and that prices will return 7 percent in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed will announce its latest policy decision Dec. 12 at
a time when U.S. lawmakers seek a deal to avoid the so-called
fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases due at the start
of next year. The European Central Bank has pledged more action
and China approved a $158 billion subways-to-roads construction
plan. The Bank of Japan is ready to take &#8220;appropriate and
decisive action&#8221; if risks to its outlook become significant,
Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said Dec. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The upcoming fiscal-cliff delays in resolutions will
certainly impact sentiment for commodity investments,&#8221; said
Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management in
Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. &#8220;Global stimulus and growth rates
would be commodity-price supportive due to higher demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

(GS), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Credit Agricole SA predict policy makers will act to reverse lira gains. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One-year currency swaps on the lira, used to protect foreign investors switching from dollars to buy Turkish bonds, rose 14 basis points since Dec. 4, the first three-day increase since September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That makes it more expensive to hedge investments in the best-performing debt among 19 major emerging markets this year. HSBC says it&#8217;s &#8220;one of the most expensive currencies&#8221; in that universe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The banks are betting the lira will fall as policy makers cut rates this month to stimulate an economy that the government forecasts will slow to 3.2 percent this year from 8.5 percent in 2011. The central bank&#8217;s index for the real effective exchange rate, or REER, which measures the lira against the currencies of Turkey&#8217;s main trading partners, rose to 119.2 on Dec. 4. The central bank would consider a value of 120 to be &#8220;overvalued,&#8221; Governor Erdem Basci said on Nov. 9. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect short-term depreciation as the central bank is targeting the REER level,&#8221; Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging-market strategist at Credit Agricole in Paris, said in e-mailed comments yesterday. The French bank cut its forecast for the lira to 1.83 a dollar by March from 1.74, he said, citing &#8220;a more dovish central bank&#8221; and &#8220;the threat of rate cuts,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Most Expensive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central bank&#8217;s concern over the lira&#8217;s strength, which makes Turkish goods relatively less competitive for exports, marks a stark turnaround from last year. The lira plunged 18 percent against the dollar in 2011 after Basci cut his benchmark rate to a record low 5.75 percent in August. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He reversed course in October last year and doubled the effective cost of central bank funding to banks using a dual-rates policy. The lira has gained 5.6 percent since the end of December, the third-best performance among 10 markets in eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lira is one of the most expensive currencies in the EMEA space,&#8221; Murat Toprak, head of currency strategy for the region at HSBC in London, said in e-mailed comments yesterday. &#8220;The lira will underperform going forward and selling the lira versus some other emerging-market currencies makes sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Currency Swaps &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of a one-year currency swap for lira debt rose to 4.89 percent at 4:40 p.m. in Istanbul today from 4.75 percent on Nov. 4. The lira fell 0.1 percent today to 1.7908 per dollar. Futures contracts show the currency at 1.8105 in February and 1.8210 in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs forecasts are more bearish. The New York-based investment bank sees the lira weakening in three months to 1.90 before paring its loss to 1.85 six months to a year from now. The currency may continue to gain this month, Goldman analysts Ahmet Akarli and Michael Hinds said in a report published Dec. 5, saying that it may prompt the central bank &#8220;to act on its previous market guidance and begin to ease.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lira is &#8220;the world&#8217;s most overvalued currency&#8221; and &#8220;investors need to recognize that at some stage they are likely to face losses on their investments,&#8221; a report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington said on Nov. 30. &#8220;Turkey&#8217;s situation has this element of precariousness hanging over it.&#8221; Peterson Institute Chairman Peter G. Peterson is co-founder of the Blackstone Group (BX) and was secretary of commerce under President Richard Nixon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Current Account &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central bank&#8217;s next rates decision is on Dec. 18. Current-account (TUCALNEW) figures for the third quarter, which will show the widest view of Turkish trade and financial flows, are due to be published by the central bank on Dec. 11. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deficit may fall to $57.3 billion by year-end, according to a bi-weekly survey of economists by the bank published yesterday. That was compared with $77.1 billion last year, when Turkey had the second-biggest deficit in the world, behind the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shortfall may equal 6.3 percent of gross domestic product by year-end, according to the average of 15 economist estimates on Bloomberg. That compares with 2.3 percent for Brazil and a surplus of 4.5 percent for oil-exporting Russia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The decrease in the deficit helped reassure investors on Turkey&#8217;s economy and pushed yields on two-year notes down 524 basis points this year. That&#8217;s more than double the decline in 2012 among all of the 19 other major emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg, except Brazil, where yields fell 310 basis points. Two-year debt yielded 5.77 percent today after reaching a record low earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bond Risk &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five-year credit-default swaps on Turkey were unchanged at 126 today. That compares with 134 for Russia and 109 for Brazil. Declining prices show improving perceptions for a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness, and gains indicate the reverse. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or cash if a borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Turkish debt denominated in dollars rather than U.S. Treasuries fell six basis points to 180, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMBI Global Index. That&#8217;s down from 385 at the end of last year and compares with 189 for Russia, 442 for the average of countries in the Middle East and 228 for emerging-market countries in Europe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the current-account balance improved this year on the back of Basci&#8217;s higher rates, the central bank is likely to now cut rates in order to &#8220;stimulate corporate lending,&#8221; Nigel Rendell, a senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors in London, said by e-mail yesterday. HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Credit Agricole also expect a rate cut this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Turkish economy still has some problems such as the large current-account deficit, which undoubtedly is negative for the lira,&#8221; Stanislava Pravdova, an analyst at Copenhagen-based Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE), said in e-mailed comments yesterday. &#8220;We will basically keep our bearish view on the lira.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Stephen Bierman" date="Dec 07, 2012  3:44 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-07/exxonmobil-to-spend-300-million-on-rosneft-tight-oil-pilot.html"><headline>ExxonMobil to Spend $300 Million on Rosneft Tight Oil Pilot</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) plans to spend as
much as $300 million on a pilot project with OAO Rosneft to tap
tight oil resources in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-run Rosneft will own 51 percent and Exxon will hold
49 percent of the venture that will explore the Achimov and
Bazhenov formations in western Siberia next year, according to a
statement today. The work will focus on 23 license blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon formed a partnership with Rosneft last year in which
the Irving, Texas-based company also gained access to offshore
deposits in Russia&#8217;s frontier Arctic and Black Sea region.
Russia, which vies with Saudi Arabia as the world&#8217;s largest oil
producer, may overhaul its tax system to support tight oil
production, according to Rosneft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership will select blocks for commercial
development in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asked more than
2,000 current and former employees to contribute to a settlement
with the U.K.&#8217;s tax authority over their use of an offshore
trust for bonus payments, according to a person briefed on the
situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees who participated in the trust were asked to help
fund a payment of at least a few hundred million pounds if they
want to settle with Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, the U.K.
tax authority, the person said, asking not to be named because
the talks are private. The bank and workers may pay about 500
million pounds ($802 million) total, the Financial Times
reported yesterday, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations including Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), Amazon.com Inc. and
Google Inc. have come under attack from British lawmakers and
protesters for using complex accounting methods to minimize tax
liabilities in the U.K. The government will invest in the part
of the tax office that targets multinational companies,
Chancellor George Osborne said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involving JPMorgan focuses on a Jersey-based trust
established 20 years ago, according to the FT. Such entities,
typically holding bonus payments that can&#8217;t be repatriated
without triggering tax payments, are being closed after they
were targeted in legislation last year, the FT said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our employee trust has always been transparent to HMRC,
and its independent trustee has consistently paid taxes in
accordance with U.K. tax law,&#8221; JPMorgan said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blind Auction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to taxes paid by the trust, the bank has paid
more than 1 billion pounds of corporate and payroll taxes to the
U.K. authority annually over the past decade, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who used JPMorgan&#8217;s trust told the FT they were
asked to participate in a so-called blind auction, in which they
would volunteer to pay a tax rate of their choosing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the auction fails to generate enough money to fund the
settlement, people who submitted less than the average bid would
be excluded from the deal and face a 52 percent tax rate when
the trust&#8217;s assets are liquidated, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who don&#8217;t wish to participate can try to fight the
government&#8217;s demand, the person briefed on the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMRC cannot comment on individual cases, spokesman Patrick
O&#8217;Brien wrote by e-mail, citing confidentiality rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, shuffled management around the world at its
newly combined corporate and investment bank to take advantage
of any rebound in capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Willsey, 49, was elevated from co-head of the
investment bank in North America to global chairman of capital
markets, according to an internal memo from the New York-based
bank today. Larry Slaughter, who ran the North American division
with Willsey, will become global chairman of diversified
industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, has overhauled
management during a year marred by more than $6.2 billion in
trading losses and as banks struggled with weak revenue. In
July, he also combined treasury services with the corporate and
investment banks to create the new unit. Former investment bank
CEO James &#8220;Jes&#8221; Staley, 55, relinquished day-to-day management
responsibilities to Michael Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto at the
time and was appointed the division&#8217;s chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank wants &#8220;a more holistic approach to coverage as
others step back and capital-markets activity picks up,&#8221; Viswas Raghavan, 46, who was promoted to head of banking for Europe,
Middle East and Africa, said in an interview today. &#8220;The worst
is probably past in Europe, and though it won&#8217;t be smooth
sailing, a new balance will be found.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Posts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raghavan, the former head of global equity capital markets,
was among about a half dozen executives in Europe, Asia and
Latin America to also get new jobs today. The changes were
announced by Jeff Urwin, 56, the global head of investment
banking, and Don McCree, 51, who was named chief executive
officer of global corporate banking earlier this month, in a
memo to employees of the recently combined corporate and
investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alejandro Guevara and Lisandro Miguens were named as co-
heads of banking in Latin America. Tom DuCharme and Therese Esperdy will also co-run investment banking in Asia Pacific,
according to a separate memo confirmed by a spokeswoman in
London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Stein, 45, who ran the diversified industries group in
investment banking in North America, will become head of
investment banking coverage for the same region, reporting to
Urwin, according to today&#8217;s memo. Liz Myers will succeed
Raghavan as global head of equity capital markets, reporting to
Urwin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Contente, the former co-head of equity capital
markets, is returning to the firm in January after a leave of
absence and will become a vice chairman of equity capital
markets, reporting to Myers, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc sold a cargo of Russian Urals
crude to Trafigura Beheer BV in northwest Europe at a higher
price than the previous trade. OAO Lukoil canceled two export
lots of the grade from the Baltic port of Primorsk, said two
traders with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. lifted its force majeure on Qua Iboe
crude loadings from Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s largest oil producer, a
company official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no bids, offers or deals reported in the North
Sea market for the second session, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA bought Forties lot F1110 for loading Dec. 27 to
Dec. 29 from Mercuria Energy Trading SA at 40 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent in the last trade on Dec. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days fell 3 cents to 38 cents more
than Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for January settlement traded at $107.95 barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $106.96 on Dec. 7. The February contract
was at $106.88, a discount of $1.07 to January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mediterranean/Urals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trafigura bought the 100,000 metric ton consignment of
Urals on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey showed. The
shipment traded at a $1.10 a barrel discount to Dated Brent,
compared with a Nov. 30 trade at minus $1.20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukoil, Russia&#8217;s second-biggest oil company, canceled
shipments of 100,000 tons each for loading Dec. 20 to Dec. 21
and Dec. 24 to Dec. 25, the people said, asking not to be
identified because the information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc canceled an 80,000 ton lot of Urals
for loading Dec. 13 to Dec. 14 from the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk, the traders said. The Shell consignment was due to
be shipped by Salym Petroleum, its west Siberian venture with
OAO Gazprom Neft, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was unchanged for a third day at a discount of 60 cents,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Africa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon removed the force majeure, a legal step that protects
a company from liability when it can&#8217;t fulfill a contract for
reasons beyond its control, on Qua Iboe, Paul Arinze, general
manager in charge of public and government affairs, said in a
statement released today in Lagos, Nigeria&#8217;s commercial capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qua Iboe blend increased 14 cents to $2.72 a barrel more
than Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That&#8217;s the highest since March 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. sold 1 million barrels of Angolan Nemba grade
for loading in January to Bharat Petroleum Corp., India&#8217;s
second-largest state refiner, said two traders who asked not to
be identified because the information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindustan Petroleum Corp., India&#8217;s third-largest state
refiner, is seeking to buy as much as 1 million barrels of crude
for loading from Jan. 1 to Jan. 20, said two traders who asked
not to be identified because the information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s tender closes on Dec. 12 and offers will
remain valid until the following day, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Viswas Raghavan head of banking for Europe, Middle East and Africa, and
chiefs for Asia and Latin America as part of a revamp to improve
coverage of corporate clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender appointed Alejandro Guevara and Lisandro Miguens
co-heads of banking in Latin America, while Tom DuCharme and
Therese Esperdy will be co-heads of banking in Asia Pacific,
according to a memo confirmed by a spokeswoman in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives will oversee investment banking, corporate
banking and treasury services in their regions as the biggest
U.S. bank combines those units into one. New York-based JPMorgan
shook up its top management in July after a $6.2 billion trading
loss in its chief investment office, and earlier this month
named Don McCree to oversee corporate banking with Jeff Urwin,
who heads investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The objective is to broaden the client footprint and have
a more holistic approach to coverage as others step back and
capital-markets activity picks up,&#8221; Raghavan, 46, the former
head of global equity capital markets, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;The worst is probably past in Europe, and though it
won&#8217;t be smooth sailing, a new balance will be found.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranks eighth this year among so-called mandated
arrangers of loans to European companies, up from 12th last year
and the highest since 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also announced Todd Marin, formerly co-head of
investment banking in Asia Pacific, will become vice chairman of
investment banking for the region, reporting to Urwin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (CVX) lifted its force

oil producer, a company official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The force majeure, a legal step that protects a company
from liability when it can&#8217;t fulfill a contract for reasons
beyond its control, has been removed, Paul Arinze, general
manager in charge of public and government affairs, said in a
statement released today in Lagos, Nigeria&#8217;s commercial capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loading halt had been in place since Nov. 20 after a
Nov. 9 pipeline leak from an Exxon Mobil offshore facility in
the southern Akwa Ibom state spilled crude into the sea. The
facility was shut a day after the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Force majeure on Royal Dutch Shell Plc&#8217;s Forcados grade was
lifted on Nov. 29, while a similar halt by Total SA on gas
shipments to Nigeria LNG Ltd. was also ended on the same day and
normal production resumed from onshore block OML 58 that pumps
90,000 barrels a day of oil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, asked a U.K. judge to invalidate Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s European patent protection for synchronizing message
statuses across multiple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sued Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility last
December in a preemptive challenge to a 2002 patent it claims
shouldn&#8217;t have been issued because the technology was obvious to
experts in the field at the time, Microsoft&#8217;s lawyers said at a
week-long trial scheduled to end today in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re grateful for the chance to demonstrate that
Motorola&#8217;s claims based on this patent are unfounded,&#8221; David
Howard, a deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in an e-
mailed statement about the latest salvo in a global dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are locked in legal battles over patents for
smartphone technology and Xbox gaming software in the U.S. and
Germany. Microsoft claims all devices that run on Google&#8217;s
Android operating system use its technology and is seeking
royalties from Motorola Mobility. Motorola Mobility, which
Mountain View, California-based Google acquired in May, says
it&#8217;s owed royalties on the Xbox for use of the company&#8217;s Wi-Fi
and video-compression technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola&#8217;s lawyer, Zoe Butler of Powell Gilbert in London,
declined to comment. The company&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a phone message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the patent in the U.K. trial relates to pager
technology from the 1990s, the arguments center on its
application to newer mobile devices and computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is running parallel to Motorola&#8217;s lawsuit against
Microsoft over the same patent in Germany, where the companies
are awaiting a decision from a judge. Google has said it bought
Motorola Mobility in part because of its patents and history of
innovation in mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: Microsoft Corporation v. Motorola Mobility
Inc., case no. HC11C04536, High Court of London, Chancery
Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd. challenged the
European Union&#8217;s refusal to allow it to change a 2010 cap on
debit-card transaction fees paid by retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission&#8217;s July 31 decision to reject Visa
Europe&#8217;s request should be overturned, the operator of Europe&#8217;s
largest payment-card network said in an appeal to the bloc&#8217;s
second-highest court. The commission violated the EU&#8217;s Charter
of Fundamental Rights by refusing Visa Europe &#8220;the opportunity
to effectively make known its views on the relevant facts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission also &#8220;committed a manifest error of
assessment&#8221; by rejecting evidence by Visa Europe &#8220;on the basis
of flawed considerations,&#8221; the London-based company said in its
appeal, details of which were published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe reduced debit-card transaction fees in 2010 as
part of a settlement of a 2009 statement of objections by the EU
antitrust regulator. In July, Visa Europe was sent another EU
statement of objections for &#8220;possible violations of EU
antitrust rules concerning multilateral interchange fees&#8221; for
transactions with consumer credit cards set by the company. Visa
Europe split from Visa Inc. (V) before the U.S. card company&#8217;s
initial public offering in early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe declined to comment beyond confirming it had
filed the appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: T-447/12, Visa Europe v. Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia plans to retaliate against
U.S. legislation targeting human-rights offenders in Russia by
barring travel by Americans who commit crimes against Russian
citizens or violate their rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A draft law submitted today with cross-party support to the
Russian lower house of parliament will also bar investments and
freeze assets in Russia of these individuals, according to a
document published on the Duma&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate on Dec. 6 approved a bipartisan bill that
imposes a visa ban and asset freeze on officials implicated in
the death of tax attorney Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow jail and
others guilty of rights violations including torture and murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia has condemned the legislation and repeatedly warned
it will damage ties between the two countries. Tensions are
already growing after President Vladimir Putin, who faced
unprecedented protests in 2011 and earlier this year, criticized
the administration of his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama over its
efforts to promote democracy in Russia and a bid to oust Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia said in June it had barred 11 serving and former
U.S. administration officials for human rights abuses at
facilities including Guantanamo Bay and the Abu Ghraib prison in
Iraq. The ban on entry to Russia was enacted last year in
retaliation for a U.S. visa ban for 11 Russian officials accused
of playing a role in the death of Magnitsky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most Corrupt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia ranks as the most corrupt nation among the Group of
20 advanced economies in Berlin-based Transparency
International&#8217;s 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index. The jailing
of businessmen such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former
billionaire owner of Yukos Oil Co. arrested in 2003, is a
touchstone for investors concerned about the independence of
Russia&#8217;s judiciary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnitsky, an attorney for London-based Hermitage Capital,
alleged a $230 million tax fraud by Russian officials. He died
at age 37 in November 2009 after being beaten to death and
denied medical care during almost a year in pre-trial detention
on fabricated tax evasion charges, according to a Russian
presidential human rights body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Browder, head of Hermitage Capital, identified 60
Russian officials responsible for Magnitsky&#8217;s prosecution and
death and the tax fraud that he uncovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar legislation may now be approved in a number of
European Union countries including the Netherlands and the U.K.,
Jamison Firestone, co-founder of the law firm Firestone Duncan
and a former colleague of Magnitsky, said in an interview in
London Dec. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill is H.R. 6156. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it has boosted
the production of its Surface RT tablet computer and will make
the device available at more retail stores. Staples Inc. (SPLS) and
Best Buy Co. (BBY) will start sales tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers will be able to buy the Surface running Windows
RT software, an update to the company&#8217;s flagship operating
system, at an expanded list of retail stores in the U.S. and
Australia &#8220;as early as mid-December,&#8221; Microsoft said today in
a statement. The Redmond, Washington-based company also will
extend its Microsoft holiday stores, including turning some of
the temporary outlets into permanent ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been selling the devices since Oct. 26 only
at its more than 60 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, and
online in seven countries. The company has declined to provide
sales numbers, leading some analysts to express concern demand
might be falling short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Buy said it will offer Surface tablets online from
tomorrow, and in some retail outlets starting Dec. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the added distribution, Microsoft should sell about a
million units this quarter, according to Rick Sherlund, an
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional retailers will be added in &#8220;a number of
countries in the coming months,&#8221; Microsoft said in the
statement. The company didn&#8217;t elaborate or say how much it
expanded production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last month that it will introduce a new
model of the device, the Surface Pro, in January. That device
features an Intel Corp. (INTC) i5 processor. Microsoft may release a
version with Intel&#8217;s Clover Trail chip, which would offer better
battery life and performance, &#8220;perhaps by March,&#8221; Sherlund
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three consecutive years of smaller
U.S. corn harvests are driving inventories of the world&#8217;s most-
consumed grain to a 39-year low and spurring Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to predict that prices will rise near record highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stockpiles will drop 11 percent to 117.61 million
metric tons by Oct. 1, or 13.6 percent of what will be used for
food, ethanol and livestock feed, the lowest ratio since 1974,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices surged 44 percent since mid-June as U.S. farmers
endured their worst drought in 56 years, and heat waves and dry
weather seared crops from Australia to Europe. While futures
fell 14 percent since reaching a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug.
10, tightening supply before next year&#8217;s harvest will drive
prices to an average of $8.25 in the next six months, 13 percent
higher than today, Goldman said in a Dec. 5 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will take more than one year of good weather and high
yields to dig the world out of this supply hole,&#8221; said Peter Meyer, a senior director of agriculture commodities at PIRA
Energy Group in New York. &#8220;While corn prices may not spike,
they will remain well supported until the extreme moisture
deficits in the U.S. are rectified.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grain Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn fell 0.3 percent at close at $7.28 2 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, paring this year&#8217;s rally to 13 percent.
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Agriculture Index of eight
commodities gained 7.7 percent since the start of 2012, while
the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities advanced 13
percent. A Bank of America Corp. index shows Treasuries returned
2.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production in the U.S., which accounted for 32 percent of
world supply this year, fell 13 percent to 272.4 million tons,
the smallest harvest since 2006, the USDA said Nov. 9. That&#8217;s 18
percent less than the record 332.5 million tons in 2009 after
dry weather in 2010 and heat waves last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global consumption will exceed supply for the second time
in three years, even as a faltering economy erodes demand by 1.7
percent to 862.52 million tons in the season ending Oct. 1,
according to the USDA. While that would be the first drop since
1995, the decline in production will be even steeper, retreating
3.7 percent to 849.09 million tons, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices will reach $7.85 in six months because inventories
are &#8220;precariously low,&#8221; Hussein Allidina, the head of
commodity research at Morgan Stanley in New York, wrote in a
Dec. 5 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Corn Overvalued&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures are headed for a record annual average this year,
and that should spur farmers to sow more crops. Informa
Economics Ltd., a Memphis, Tennessee-based research company,
predicted Nov. 2 that global production will jump 14 percent to
a record 950.7 million tons next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the weather returns to normal, futures for December
2013, after the U.S. harvest, may be as much 37 percent
overvalued, Chris Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
London, said in a report Dec. 6. Gadd predicted the contract may
drop as low as $4, compared with $6.2775 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are just one crop away from a substantial increase in
supplies,&#8221; Douglas Carper, the principal of Omaha, Nebraska-
based DEC Capital Inc., a commodity trading adviser and
consultant to hedge funds. &#8220;If we have a widespread moisture
event over the heart of the Corn Belt between now and April,
there would be an epiphany that would sweep over folks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dry Weather &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 56 percent of the nine-state Midwest region where
most of the crop is grown had moderate to exceptional drought by
Dec. 4, compared with 15 percent a year earlier, according to
the U.S. Drought Monitor. That reduced the level of the
Mississippi River, delaying barges carrying grain to Gulf of
Mexico ports and export markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other speculators boosted their net-long
positions, or bets on higher prices, for three weeks and are the
most bullish on corn since Oct. 23, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global inventories may not get the expected boost in
February from Argentina and Brazil, the biggest exporters after
the U.S. Flooding led farmers in Argentina to plant 10 percent
fewer acres than expected, which means output may total 22.5
million tons, below the USDA&#8217;s estimate of 27.5 million, said
Michael Cordonnier, the publisher of the Soybean  Corn Advisor
in Hinsdale, Illinois. In Brazil, dry weather may cut output to
70 million tons from 73 million a year ago, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demand Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for corn to feed livestock and make ethanol may not
be slowing as much as the USDA expects. Hog farmers kept buying
corn even as prices topped $8 because they were hedging some of
their costs, Larry Pope, the chief executive officer of
Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD), the largest pork producer, said on a Dec.
6 conference call with analysts. Hog herds expanded about 4
percent in the three months ended Oct. 28, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. red-meat production jumped 7.2 percent to 4.579
billion pounds in October, and pork output gained 8.7 percent to
2.21 billion pounds, the highest ever for the month, government
data show. Supplies of young chickens rose 7.5 percent and
turkey 9.9 percent, the USDA said in a Nov. 26 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic corn inventories before the 2013 harvest may fall
to 546 million bushels, below last month&#8217;s USDA forecast of 647
million bushels, said Dan Cekander, the director of grain-market
analysis at Newedge USA LLC in Chicago. The increase in feed
demand during the three months ended Dec. 1 probably won&#8217;t
appear in USDA data until the Jan. 11 report, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fuel Use &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol distillers, who used 41 percent of the U.S. crop
last year, boosted production by 4 percent in the week ended
Nov. 30, the biggest gain in 14 months and the highest output
since the end of June, Energy Department data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliance on crops to make fuel and expanding economic
growth will keep grain inventories tight and contribute to a
&#8220;new norm&#8221; of high food prices over the next two decades, the
World Bank said in a Nov. 27 report. Risks to supply are
increasing at a time when 12 percent of the world population
remains chronically undernourished, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World food prices, while down 11 percent from a record in
February 2011, were the highest ever on average during the past
two years and more than doubled in the past decade, according to
the United Nations Food  Agriculture Organization in Rome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People and animals continue to eat,&#8221; said Sal Gilbertie,
who helps manage $69 million of assets as president and chief
investment officer of Teucrium Trading LLC in Santa Fe, New
Mexico. &#8220;Everything in grocery stores is made from corn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 150 chief executive officers, including JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Lloyd Blankfein, called on President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner to compromise on a budget deal that would include new tax revenue and spending cuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without a &#8220;principled compromise&#8221; soon, the chief executives warned in a letter today, the U.S. will suffer &#8220;long-lasting, if not permanent&#8221; economic damage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Boehner, an Ohio Republican, and Obama are continuing their private talks on a tax-and-spending deal, each side is insisting publicly that the other must give in first. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama is pressing for the expiration of tax breaks for top earners, while Boehner said today on the House floor that he expects the president to propose spending cuts as part of a deficit-reduction package. If the White House and Congress don&#8217;t reach agreement, more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts will start taking effect in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Delaying this doesn&#8217;t do any good to anybody,&#8221; Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric Co. (GE), told reporters today during a conference call. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been dealing with this amount of uncertainty for not just since the election but for almost two years now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Business Roundtable &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CEOs are members of the Business Roundtable, a Washington-based association. The group plans to buy newspaper advertising and visit lawmakers and White House staff to discuss the short-term and long-term issues tied to the nation&#8217;s debt and deficit, Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), told reporters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Compromise will require Congress to agree on more revenue -- whether by increasing rates, eliminating deductions or some combination thereof -- and the administration to agree to larger, meaningful structural and benefit entitlement reforms and spending reductions that are a fiscally responsible multiple of increased revenues,&#8221; said the CEOs&#8217; letter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other CEOs signing the letter include James McNerney of Boeing Co. (BA), David Cote of Honeywell International Inc., Kenneth Chenault of American Express Co. (AXP), Laurence Fink of BlackRock Inc. and Doug Oberhelman of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) The executives also sent the letter to the Senate majority and minority leaders as well as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By initiating tax and entitlement overhauls &#8220;simultaneously,&#8221; Congress and the White House can rebuild the confidence needed &#8220;for business to invest in new factories, equipment and employees,&#8221; the executives wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Victoria Slind-Flor" date="Dec 11, 2012  3:29 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-11/microsoft-porsche-heineken-intellectual-property.html"><headline>Microsoft, Porsche, Heineken: Intellectual Property</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;(Corrects Pirate Bay copyright item to delete reference to

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, asked a U.K. judge to invalidate Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s European patent protection for synchronizing message
statuses across multiple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sued Google Inc.&#8217;s Motorola Mobility last
December in a preemptive challenge to a 2002 patent it claims
shouldn&#8217;t have been issued because the technology was obvious to
experts in the field at the time, Microsoft&#8217;s lawyers said at a
weeklong trial scheduled to end yesterday in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re grateful for the chance to demonstrate that
Motorola&#8217;s claims based on this patent are unfounded,&#8221; David
Howard, a deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in an e-mail
statement about the latest salvo in a global dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are locked in legal battles over patents for
smartphone technology and Xbox gaming software in the U.S. and
Germany. Microsoft claims all devices that run on Google&#8217;s
Android operating system use its technology and is seeking
royalties from Motorola Mobility. Motorola Mobility, which
Mountain View, California-based Google acquired in May, says it
is owed royalties on the Xbox for use of the company&#8217;s Wi-Fi and
video-compression technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola&#8217;s lawyer, Zoe Butler of Powell Gilbert in London,
declined to comment. The company&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a phone message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the patent in the U.K. trial relates to pager
technology from the 1990s, the arguments center on its
application to newer mobile devices and computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is running parallel to Motorola&#8217;s lawsuit against
Microsoft over the same patent in Germany, where the companies
are awaiting a decision from a judge. Google has said it bought
Motorola Mobility in part because of its patents and history of
innovation in mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corporation v. Motorola Mobility
Inc., HC11C04536, High Court of London, Chancery Division
(London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple-Google Team Up for $500 Million-Plus Kodak Patents Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. have joined forces to offer more
than $500 million to buy Eastman Kodak Co.&#8217;s patents out of
bankruptcy, said people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies, competing for dominance of the
smartphone market, have partnered after leading two separate
groups this summer to buy some of Kodak&#8217;s 1,100 imaging patents,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlikely partnerships are typical in patent sales because
they allow competitors to neutralize potential infringement
litigation. A group including Apple, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and
Research in Motion Ltd. bought Nortel Networks Corp.&#8217;s more than
6,000 patents for $4.5 billion out of bankruptcy last year.
Google lost the auction for those patents after making an
initial offer of $900 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple-led group pursuing Kodak&#8217;s patents included
Microsoft and Intellectual Ventures Management LLC as of July,
the people said, while Google&#8217;s partners included patent-aggregation company RPX Corp. and Asian makers of Google&#8217;s
Android phones. The two groups had separately offered less than
$500 million for Kodak&#8217;s portfolio. They now teamed up to offer
more together, said two of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niki Fenwick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-based Google, said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on rumor or
speculation. Christopher Veronda, a spokesman for Rochester, New
York-based Kodak, declined to comment on the patent sale, citing
a court-ordered confidentiality agreement. Kristin Huguet, a
spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents for sale relate to the capture, manipulation
and sharing of digital images. Kodak is selling them to fund a
turnaround after seeking Chapter 11 protection in January. At
the same time, it&#8217;s pursuing a plan to shrink the company and
focus less on photography and more on commercial, packaging and
functional printing and enterprise services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court documents, Kodak has said the patents may be worth
$2.21 billion to $2.57 billion, based on an estimate by patent
advisory firm 284 Partners LLC. Kodak said it has generated more
than $3 billion in revenue by licensing some of the digital-imaging patents to users, including Samsung Electronics Co., LG
Electronics Inc., Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit and Nokia
Oyj. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The portfolio is actually worth much less because it has
been widely licensed,&#8221; said Richard Ehrlickman, former vice
president of Intellectual Property at International Business
Machines Corp. and president of IPofferings, a patent brokerage
and consulting company in Boca Raton, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 132-year-old photography company listed $5.1 billion in
assets and $6.75 billion in debt in its bankruptcy filing. It
plans to exit bankruptcy in the first half of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Matthew Inman Sued by Excelsior Printing Over &#8216;Oatmeal&#8217; Marks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Inman, the Seattle-based computer programmer who
posts cartoons and humorous commentary on his &#8220;The Oatmeal&#8221;
website, was sued for trademark infringement by a Massachusetts
printing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His website gets more than 2 million page views a month,
and Inman is the author of &#8220;5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a
Dolphin in the Mouth&#8221; and the &#8220;How to Tell If Your Cat Is
Planning to Kill You&#8221; calendar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-defendant with Inman is Papyrus-Recycled Greetings Inc.
of Chicago, the publisher of greeting cards based on Inman&#8217;s
cartoons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, Excelsior Printing Co. of North
Adams, Massachusetts, bought Oatmeal Studios Inc. in January
2011. The acquired company had produced greeting cards and other
items under the &#8220;Oatmeal Studios&#8221; for more than 35 years, and
Excelsior says it continues in the use of the mark and the
greeting card business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The products are promoted through the oatmealstudios.com
website, Excelsior said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company objects to the items produced by Papyrus-Recycled that are sold under &#8220;The Oatmeal&#8221; name. It says
customers are likely to assume mistakenly that an affiliation
exists between its products and Inman&#8217;s &#8220;The Oatmeal&#8221;
merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excelsior asked the court to bar further infringement of
its trademarks, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees
and litigation costs. The printing company also requested that
the damages be tripled to punish the defendants for their
actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Inman nor Papyrus-Recycled responded immediately to
an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Excelsior Printing Co. v. Matthew Inman, 3:12-cv-30200, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Springfield). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Porsche&#8217;s &#8216;919&#8217; Trademark Application May Hint at New Model &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the Stuttgart, Germany-based
maker of luxury cars, has applied to register &#8220;919&#8221; as a
trademark in Germany, the Motorward.com automotive news website
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the website, while Porsche doesn&#8217;t comment on
future activities, there is speculation in the automotive world
that this mark will be used for a new sports vehicle to compete
with Ferrari SpA&#8217;s 458 Italia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heineken Wins Dismissal of Appeal of Russian Trademark Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heineken NV (HEIA)&#8217;s Heineken Ceska unit has prevailed in a
trademark dispute over unauthorized imports of its products into
Russia, the Russian Legal Information Agency has reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands-based brewer persuaded Russia&#8217;s Supreme
Commercial Court to deny Elitvoda.Ru&#8217;s appeal of a ruling
awarding Heineken damages for importing Heineken&#8217;s Krusivice
beers into the country without permission, according to the news
agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heineken acknowledged that the goods were legitimate, but
had argued that under Russia law, trademark goods can&#8217;t be
imported without the consent of the trademark owner, according
to the news agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch brewery, which has several Russian units, had
argued that unauthorized shipments of trademarked goods must be
seized by customs, the news agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mattel Returns to Appeals Panel That Threw Out Bratz Verdict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel Inc. (MAT) is asking the same appeals court panel that two
years ago concluded the Barbie doll would thrive on competition
to now reverse a $310 million jury verdict won by Bratz
dollmaker MGA Entertainment Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel was scheduled to present its case yesterday in
Pasadena, California, before the three-judge U.S Court of
Appeals panel that undid Mattel&#8217;s earlier trial victory giving
the company almost complete ownership of its rival&#8217;s Bratz
dolls. The panel ruled then that the world&#8217;s largest toymaker
couldn&#8217;t claim a monopoly &#8220;over fashion dolls with a bratty
look or attitude.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, El Segundo, California-based Mattel no longer
argues, after two trials and more than eight years of
litigation, that MGA infringes its copyright because the first
Bratz sketches were made by a Mattel designer. Mattel now
contends the &#8220;jaw-dropping&#8221; $137.2 million in legal fees it
was ordered to pay MGA for having to defend the copyright claim
is unjustified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mattel knows of no copyright fee and cost award that was
similarly shifted on a claim that had been successful before one
jury, had resulted in substantial relief from a federal district
judge, and was remanded by a court of appeals before being
unsuccessful before a second jury,&#8221; the company said in its
Feb. 27 appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the appeals court panel said that, even if Mattel
were to convince a jury that it owned the original Bratz
sketches made by its former employee, Carter Bryant, it would
only entitle it to ownership of that particular expression of
the bratty-doll type, not to the idea itself. That decision
overturned a $100 million jury verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in Santa Ana, California, last year rejected
Mattel&#8217;s claim that MGA stole the idea for Bratz dolls. It also
found Mattel liable for stealing MGA&#8217;s trade secrets and awarded
closely held MGA $88.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge David Carter, who reduced that verdict
to $85 million, later added $85 million in punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter also awarded MGA $2.52 million in fees and costs for
its trade-secret claim, in addition to $105.6 million in lawyer
fees and $31.6 million in costs for Mattel&#8217;s copyright claim,
which the judge said &#8220;imperiled free expression, competition,
and the only serious competitor Mattel had faced in the fashion
doll market in nearly 50 years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGA, based in Van Nuys, California, said the $310 million
verdict is &#8220;but a drop in the bucket&#8221; compared to the harm
Mattel caused MGA through &#8220;its litigation strategy of
destroying Bratz.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mattel Inc. v. MGA Entertainment Inc.,
11-56357, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San
Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K. Pirate Party Prepares for Copyright Suit From BPI &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. branch of the Pirate Party, the international
political group opposed to many copyright restrictions, has
refused a request from an organization representing content
owners to take down a proxy server leading to the Pirate Bay
website which has been implicated in illegal downloading cases,
TechWeek Europe reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Phonographic Industry, which represents music
copyright holders, had asked the U.K. Pirate Party to take down
the site in November at the risk of being sued, according to
TechWeek Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pirate Party has responded to the request by saying
that &#8220;Censorship is never the right answer,&#8221; and if it has to
go to court, it will argue that this kind of blockage does
&#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; to search engines, service providers and
others, TechWeek Europe reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexa, a Web metrics company, reported that the U.K. Pirate
Party&#8217;s proxy site is the 140th most visited Internet
destination in that country, according to TechWeek Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirate Party UK &#8220;has never been issued a court order to
take down our Pirate Bay proxy, much less refused to comply with
one,&#8221; spokesman Jack Allnutt said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VimpelCom Sued Over Copyright by Russian Music Publisher &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP), the Netherlands-based telecommunications
company, was sued for copyright infringement by a unit of
Russia&#8217;s Gala Records, the Moscow Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in Moscow Arbitration Court, relates to
what the music publisher says is unauthorized use of one of its
songs in a VimpelCom ad campaign last summer, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for VimpelCom told the Moscow Times that the
company didn&#8217;t post to the Internet the video in which the song
was performed, and that it was footage of a singer performing at
a company promotional event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music publisher is seeking damages of 500,000 rubles
($16,268) in compensation, according to the Moscow Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the
biggest Dutch retirement fund, said it settled a lawsuit with
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) over sales of residential mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ABP is very content to have reached this settlement and
is pleased that JPMorgan was willing to reach a mutually
satisfactory conclusion of this litigation,&#8221; the Heerlen,
Netherlands-based fund said today in an e-mailed statement.
Harmen Geers, a spokesman for ABP, declined to comment on the
amount of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in state court in Manhattan in December
2011, accused the bank of negligent misrepresentation, alleging
the sales were based on false and misleading statements. New
York-based JPMorgan has denied and continues to deny these
claims, ABP said in today&#8217;s statement. A JPMorgan spokesman
declined immediate comment when called by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABP has sued other banks in the same court over similar
allegations, including Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ABP serves as the
pension fund for Dutch public educational and government workers
and had about 274 billion euros ($356 billion) of available
assets at the end of the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawaii, buffeted in the aftermath of the U.S. recession and Japan&#8217;s tsunami, is benefiting from a travel rebound that&#8217;s sent tourism revenue to a record and spurred real estate investments across the islands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) last month announced a $1.85 billion loan for a once-distressed hotel portfolio that has five Hawaiian properties, including the Sheraton Waikiki and the Westin Moana Surfrider in Honolulu. Companies from Walt Disney (DIS) Co. to Starwood Hotels  Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) are expanding resorts. On the Big Island, the first new residential development in at least five years is starting construction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Property investors and lenders are seeking to take advantage of increased demand from affluent Asian travelers and visitors from Northern California enriched by the technology- industry boom, according to Honolulu-based Hospitality Advisors LLC, an industry consulting firm. Oahu, which attracts the most visitors of Hawaii&#8217;s eight major islands, has the highest hotel occupancy among the top 25 U.S. markets, research firm STR said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s driving Hawaii now, particularly Oahu, is the resurgence of the Japanese market -- there was a lot of pent-up demand after the tsunami -- and substantial growth in Chinese and Korean numbers because of the increase in wealth in those regions,&#8221; said Joseph Toy, president of Hospitality Advisors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest oil producer by market value, raised its long-term
global energy-demand growth estimate to 35 percent from 32
percent as expanding populations in Africa and India use more
electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide consumption of fuels to run power plants, trucks,
trains and airplanes will climb to the equivalent of 705
quadrillion British thermal units by 2040, compared with 522
quadrillion in 2010, the base year for Exxon&#8217;s forecasters, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising electricity use will be the primary driver of demand
growth, accounting for more than half the increase, Exxon said.
As the world&#8217;s population expands to about 9 billion in 2040,
more households and businesses will need power, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North America is expected to become a net exporter of oil
and fuels derived from crude by around 2030, Exxon said.
Worldwide, oil demand will increase by 26 percent though 2040,
while natural gas and hydropower use will rise by 65 percent and
66 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power consumption will more than double globally
through 2040 and coal use will decline by 2 percent, Exxon said.
Demand for renewable energy sources, excluding biomass and
waste, will more than quadruple, outpacing growth for all other
energy sources, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon revises its long-term energy-demand outlook annually
to guide long-term investment decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elekta AB (EKTAB) advanced the most in one
week in Stockholm trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
forecast that the Swedish company will increase sales and
earnings by taking market share from its biggest rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elekta, a manufacturer of radiation-surgery equipment,
gained as much as 2.1 kronor, or 2.1 percent, to 104.4 kronor,
its steepest climb since Dec. 4, and was up 2 percent at 104.3
kronor as of 12:16 p.m. local time. The volume was 38 percent of
the three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs today raised its 12-month share price target
on Elekta to 133 kronor, from 122 kronor previously, and
reiterated its earlier Conviction List Buy recommendation on the
stock. The Swedish company, which is based in Stockholm and has
3,300 employees, competes with Varian Medical Systems Inc. and
Germany&#8217;s Siemens AG. (SIE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Elekta remains the best positioned company on our
industrial scorecard,&#8221; Veronika Dubajova and Mick Readey,
analysts at Goldman Sachs in London, wrote in a note to clients
today. &#8220;We expect growing demand for radiation therapy in
emerging markets coupled with market share gains from Siemens
and Varian to drive top-quartile revenue and earnings growth,
and top-quartile returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elekta&#8217;s current valuation is &#8216;&#8216;relatively undemanding,&#8217;&#8217;
the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) forecasts global
energy consumption will rise 35 percent by 2040, driven by China
and India, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing the
company&#8217;s latest long-term energy outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon projects North America will become a net energy
exporter by 2025 because of an increase in oil and gas
production and improvements in energy efficiency, the newspaper
said. The Irving, Texas-based company is the world&#8217;s biggest
energy producer by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of coal will decline 33 percent by 2025, compared
with a previous estimate of 23 percent, as more natural gas-
fired power stations are built, the report said. The growth of
U.S. and Canadian oil and gas production may lead to an increase
in international shipments, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon compiles the outlook annually to guide long-term
investment decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand in developed regions such as the U.S., Canada and
Europe will be unchanged or decline as they become more
efficient, according to the newspaper report. While developed
nations by 2040 are forecast to generate 80 percent more
economic output than in 2010, they will use the same amount of
energy, the newspaper said, citing the outlook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Home Depot Inc. (HD) and other retailers
lost their bid to appeal a judge&#8217;s preliminary approval of Visa
Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA)&#8217;s proposed $7.25 billion settlement of
a merchant fee price-fixing case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in Manhattan refused to give
expedited treatment to the retailers&#8217;s appeal and deferred the
matter until after the judge has given final approval and
entered a final judgment in the case, according to a filing
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the retailers had sought a hearing and decision
on the appeal as soon as possible because they said the trial
judge in the case granted an injunction that makes them part of
the settlement group without rights to opt out of the accord or
bring future lawsuits, according to a Nov. 29 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Neuwirth, an attorney for Home Depot, and Wesley
Powell, a lawyer for the credit card companies, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to e-mails sent after regular business hours
seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Gleeson gave preliminary approval
of the $7.25 billion settlement on Nov. 9 over objections by
retailers opposing the deal. The decision allowed plaintiffs to
begin signing up more than 7 million retailers that might be
eligible to participate. A final approval hearing is scheduled
for Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord, estimated to be the largest-ever antitrust
settlement, would end a seven-yearlong case alleging that the
card companies conspired with major banks to fix interchange, or
swipe, fees charged to merchants when customers pay with
plastic. Retailers opposed to the deal claim it forces them to
give up too many rights to sue over card company practices in
the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &#8220;The Smitten Kitchen
Cookbook&#8221; (Knopf, $35), Deb Perelman has hit the bull&#8217;s-eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her collection has a distinctive, funny voice, luscious
photos she took herself, recipes that really work -- and a
fantastic binding that lets the book lie flat on the counter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from a tiny New York City kitchen, Perelman has
been cooking and blogging for years, creating food you&#8217;ll want
to eat, like harvest roast chicken with grapes, olives and
rosemary. Her linguine with no-cook cauliflower pesto was a
lifesaver on hot days last summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she&#8217;s one of the few cooks out there I trust equally on
baking. I can&#8217;t wait to try her fig, olive oil and sea salt
challah and marbled pumpkin gingersnap tart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cooking Memoir &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dinner: A Love Story&#8221; (Ecco, $27.99) is another blog-
turned-book from a home cook. It&#8217;s the only cookbook I&#8217;ve ever
read cover to cover, like a memoir.  Author Jenny Rosenstrach&#8217;s
goal is to get people cooking and eating together with their
families, and recipes like &#8220;back-pocket&#8221; chicken tacos and
salmon with yogurt-mustard-dill sauce take the stress out of
putting a healthy, delicious meal on the table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mad Scientist &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modernist Cuisine at Home&#8221; (The Cooking Lab, $140) may
have the word &#8220;home&#8221; in the title, but it&#8217;s not a book that
will help you make dinner on a Wednesday night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) chief technology officer
Nathan Myhrvold along with the team that helped him put together
the six-volume &#8220;Modernist Cuisine,&#8221; this is for scientifically
minded cooks who want to make scrambled eggs using the sous vide
method, like Ferran Adria or Heston Blumenthal. (Myhrvold also
is a columnist for Bloomberg View.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare hamburgers, start by grinding your own meat,
then add salt precisely one hour before cooking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braised short ribs cook in a 144 degree Fahrenheit water
bath for 72 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photos are breathtaking and the book comes with four
framable prints. And in case you actually want to use it in the
kitchen and not just leave this 11-pound behemoth on the coffee
table, the package includes a separate spiral-bound book of
recipes with waterproof pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thomas Keller &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bouchon Bakery&#8221; (Artisan, $50) is big and beautifully
designed, like all of chef Thomas Keller&#8217;s books. The recipes
aren&#8217;t as intimidating as Myhrvold&#8217;s, though I doubt many people
will go to Keller for a bran muffin recipe. With Keller&#8217;s
trademark precision and clear, simple photographs, you&#8217;ll learn
to roll out tart dough, create cream puffs of uniform size and
make several different fillings for eclairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Worlds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jerusalem&#8221; (Ten Speed, $35) is travel guide, culinary
history and cookbook rolled into one. There are full-page photos
of the city&#8217;s rooftops and food markets alongside recipes like
lamb meatballs with barberries, yogurt and herbs, and braised
eggs with lamb, tahini and sumac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors -- Yotam Ottolenghi, who&#8217;s Jewish, and Sami
Tamimi, who&#8217;s Muslim -- grew up on opposite sides of Jerusalem
and now work together in London. Their book gathers the many
strands of cooking that make up the tapestry of tastes in their
home city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Greely, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)&#8217;s head of energy research, is joining Bridgewater
Associates LP, according a spokeswoman for Bridgewater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greely is joining the Westport, Connecticut-based employee-
owned hedge fund sponsor as a portfolio manager, said the
spokeswoman, who did not want to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leslie Shribman, a New York-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greely is known in part for forecasting Feb. 23 that West
Texas Intermediate&#8217;s discount to Brent oil would narrow to $5
within six months because the reversal of the Seaway pipeline by
Enterprise Products Partners LP and Enbridge Inc. (ENB) would ease a
bottleneck of oil in the center of the U.S. that had depressed
prices of WTI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seaway began moving oil May 19 to Texas refiners from
Cushing, Oklahoma. The spread shrank to $11.03 in June from
$15.79 on Feb. 23 before widening again. It was $22.73 a barrel
based on today&#8217;s settlement prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greely&#8217;s prediction countered those of analysts at
Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc who said surging U.S. production
and limited pipeline space would keep Cushing supplies high and
the WTI-Brent spread wide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI traded at an average 32-cent premium to Brent between
2005 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s anti-smoking drug
Chantix produced a higher rate of heart attacks or strokes in
patients using the treatment than those who didn&#8217;t take the
product, according to an analysis of clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cardiovascular issues in patients on Chantix
and those who took a placebo was uncommon, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration said today in a safety notice on its
website. While the increased risk wasn&#8217;t statistically
significant for those on Chantix, it seems &#8220;more likely that it
is related to the drug and not purely a chance finding,&#8221; the
agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantix carries a warning that it raises the risks of
suicide and may be tied to higher heart danger in patients with
cardiovascular disease. The warning label had been changed last
year after regulators cited the heart concerns and asked New
York-based Pfizer to further evaluate the risks with a large
analysis of existing studies of the drug. The agency&#8217;s
announcement today followed that analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 4,190 Chantix users, 13 were found to have experienced a
major cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke
compared with six of 2,812 who took a placebo in 15 Pfizer-
sponsored clinical trials, the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of Chantix outweigh the risks, MacKay Jimeson,
a spokesman for Pfizer, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The benefits of quitting smoking are immediate and
substantial,&#8221; Jimeson said. &#8220;Chantix has been demonstrated to
increase the likelihood of abstinence from smoking for as long
as one year compared to treatment with placebo.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease, the FDA
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chantix Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients taking Chantix should contact their doctor if they
experience new or worsening symptoms of cardiovascular disease,
such as chest pain, shortness of breath, calf pain or sudden
onset of weakness, numbness or difficulty speaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantix generated $720 million in sales last year for
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The FDA notice said that about 2.3
million Chantix prescriptions were dispensed in the year ended
in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer faces a January trial in federal court in Florence,
Alabama, in a lawsuit claiming the anti-smoking drug caused
psychiatric disorders that led a man to be placed in a mental
hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The interest in Windows 8 is quite high, even among

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s next
chief executive officer already works at the firm, CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a very high likelihood, close to 100 percent,
that the next leader of Goldman Sachs is at Goldman Sachs,&#8221;
Blankfein, 58, said today at a conference in New York hosted by
the New York Times&#8217;s DealBook. The board has responsibility to
choose the CEO, not him, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who became CEO in 2006, has overseen the firm&#8217;s
highest profits and biggest losses as a public company. He said
he&#8217;s heard that executives typically get a sense of when it&#8217;s
time to step down, and that hasn&#8217;t happened to him yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I come in every day and I&#8217;m happy to be with the people I
work with, it&#8217;s exciting,&#8221; Blankfein said in an interview
conducted by Andrew Ross Sorkin, who appears on CNBC as well as
leading the New York Times&#8217;s DealBook section. &#8220;Would I like it
better if I were at home just watching you on TV all day? I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like that very much.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will put a fire

the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will prevent its units from accessing non-public

&lt;p&gt;Copper consumers including Encore Wire Corp., AmRod Corp.,

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL), Australia&#8217;s
largest beverages company, fell the most in more than a year in
Sydney trading after saying weak consumer sentiment and
discounting by competitors hurt growth in sales volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock declined 2.6 percent, its biggest drop since Nov.
17, 2011, to A$13.56 at the close in Sydney, with trading volume
at more than three times the daily average in the past three
months. &#8220;Price-driven competitor activity&#8221; has restrained
sales volume growth in the second half of the year, and
&#8220;consumer spending levels continue to be soft,&#8221; the Sydney-
based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Co. bottler has been so highly rated by the
markets that its share performance won&#8217;t permit any
disappointment, Dan Hurren, an analyst at UBS AG, said by phone
from Sydney. It&#8217;s the second-highest valued large Australian
consumer staples company, using a measure of enterprise value
and estimated earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The valuation hasn&#8217;t taken into account that there&#8217;s
natural risk around the weather for this stock,&#8221; said Hurren,
who rates Coca-Cola Amatil sell. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a relatively cool
start to the summer months in Australia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil said it still expects to boost volume and
sales in the six months through December in Australia, its
largest market responsible for about 70 percent of revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong growth continues in the Indonesia and Papua New
Guinea operations, while earnings in New Zealand and Fiji will
fall in line with the broader market, the company said, without
providing earnings figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil&#8217;s enterprise value is about 10.4 times
estimated earnings this year, the second-highest after Treasury
Wine Estates Ltd. (TWE) among Australian consumer staples companies
with more than A$1 billion ($1 billion) in annual sales,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polish power for next year advanced
for a third day as JPMorgan Chase  Co. said the contract would
advance from current levels amid recovering demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish electricity for next year advanced 0.3 percent to
170.10 zloty ($54.36) a megawatt-hour, broker data on Bloomberg
showed. The contract fell to 167.20 zloty a megawatt-hour on
Dec. 10, its lowest level since at least June 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s power demand may fall by 1 percent this year
as the economy slows and grow by 2 to 2.5 percent annually in
the following years, Javier Garrido, a JPMorgan analyst in
Madrid, said in a research note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Polish demand should be further fueled by the gradual
replacement of domestic coal with electricity and in the future
gas for heating purposes, driven in our view by rising gross
domestic product per capita and growing Silesian coal prices,&#8221;
the analysts said. The bank expects the contract will average
180 zloty a megawatt-hour next year amid falling coal
inventories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Polish day-ahead contract declined 12 percent to 189.31
zloty a megawatt-hour as the nation was set to become a net
importer during peak afternoon hours tomorrow, getting 373
megawatts of power from neighbors from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. That
compares with net exports of 400 megawatts at the same time
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day-ahead electricity on the coupled market of the Czech
Republic, Slovakia and Hungary plunged 25 percent, according to
the countries&#8217; market operators. The contract settled at 50.75
euros ($66.38) a megawatt-hour in the Czech Republic and at
51.21 euros in Hungary and Slovakia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is sticking with a
decision to make it harder to track users&#8217; online behavior,
earning plaudits from privacy groups while drawing fire from the
advertisers its money-losing Web unit needs most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of criticism that the new tools cut off
valuable customer-targeting information, the software maker has
no plans to change the automatic setting in its newest Internet
Explorer browser that tells websites not to track user behavior,
General Counsel Brad Smith said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We crossed the Rubicon and are completely comfortable
being on the other side of the river,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have no
intention of going back and have no intention of engaging in
discussion on that possibility.&#8221; Smith will provide an update
on the company&#8217;s position today in a blog posting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called Do Not Track feature has been at the center
of privacy debates over browsing data and how websites and
marketers use it to make money. For Microsoft and the
advertisers, at stake is a $31.7 billion U.S. Internet ad market
that grew 22 percent in 2011, according to the Interactive
Advertising Bureau, much of it generated by ads tailored to user
behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Microsoft, whose banner advertising business was
already losing market share to Facebook Inc. and Google Inc., is
being criticized by trade groups and facing opposition from
advertisers and even partners like Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), who say they
will ignore privacy signals transmitted by Internet Explorer 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Achilles Heel&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Advertisers have invested a lot in their ad platforms and
the Achilles heel is the consumers aren&#8217;t aware that their data
is being bought and sold,&#8221; said Anthony Mullen, an analyst at
Forrester Research Inc. &#8220;That being exposed, which is what this
Microsoft initiative does, is healthy, but I can see why the ad
industry is nervous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants to engage in talks with advertisers and
standards bodies to assuage some concerns, Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Microsoft surprised privacy advocates and some of
its own managers by saying its Internet Explorer 10 browser, the
version included in the new Windows 8, would automatically turn
on a signal that tells advertisers not to follow user behavior.
Other browsers, by contrast, have the Do Not Track signal turned
off and give users the option to turn it on. In Explorer, users
can choose to change the setting to &#8220;off&#8221; to enable tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default Setting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Association of National Advertisers President and CEO Bob Liodice said his group opposes the decision to turn on the
signal by default, even after Microsoft made some changes that
make the setting clearer to users. The group, whose board
includes members from Coca-Cola Co. (KO), Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
Unilever NV and Intel Corp. (INTC), has written Microsoft to register
its opposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Liodice said Microsoft has expressed a
willingness to talk to advertisers, and &#8220;they seem amenable to
compromise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Smith said the company is willing to discuss
tweaks to how it describes the setting to users, and how easy it
is for users to alter. He also wants the group working on Do Not
Track to set up an easy way for trusted advertisers to gain user
consent to be followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, the kerfuffle is the latest challenge to
its ad business. The company wrote down $6.2 billion from the
unit in the quarter that ended June 30, and Microsoft&#8217;s U.S.
display business is forecast to grow 13 percent this year, while
the total U.S. market for display ads expands by more than 20
percent, according to data from EMarketer Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limited Use &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, a lot of the debate over Do Not Track is just
saber-rattling. Internet Explorer 10 was released on Oct. 26
with the newest Windows software, so it&#8217;s not in use on many
systems yet. Advertisers are unlikely to pull listings from
Microsoft&#8217;s websites in retaliation if the ads make money, said
Clark Fredricksen, a vice president at EMarketer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, advertising industry groups are concerned that
Microsoft may crimp future ad-spending growth by creating a
larger group of Web users who object to being tracked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all sites collect browsing data and track Web
surfers&#8217; habits to decide which ads to show consumers, and use
the demographic information to persuade advertisers to buy
space. Without this information, ads would be far less
effective, making it harder to generate the ad revenue that
Liodice said pays for much of the content on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Privacy Complaints &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a 2007 complaint by privacy groups such as
the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Consumer Federation
of America about the tracking and selling of private user data,
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission began examining the idea of a
Do Not Track list. Do Not Track now works by having a browser
send a signal to websites, stating that the user doesn&#8217;t want
his or her behavior to be monitored. As the feature was
envisioned, advertisers would voluntarily comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the major browser makers -- Microsoft, Google Inc. (GOOG) and
Mozilla Corp. -- have incorporated Do Not Track signals into
their products. Google and Mozilla have the setting turned off
as a default, requiring users to actively turn it on to block
tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now it&#8217;s not even clear how advertisers wanting to
comply with Do Not Track should behave. A World Wide Web
Consortium working group tasked with devising a standard for Do
Not Track has labored for about 18 months without coming to an
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surprise Decision &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s move was surprising to people both inside and
outside the company. The Internet Explorer team made the
decision over the objections of some of Microsoft&#8217;s advertising
officials, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not
to be named because the decision was confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the announcement, even Microsoft officials on the Do
No Track working group had raised questions about whether it
made sense to turn the signal on by default, said Jonathan Mayer, a member of the group and a Stanford University graduate
student who is one of the researchers who came up with the
initial idea for the standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Explorer group itself, though, decided that
starting with the setting activated was the best way to protect
consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Seventy-five percent of the consumers we surveyed in the
U.S. and Europe said they wanted DNT on by default,&#8221;
Microsoft&#8217;s Smith wrote in an October blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may also be aiming to use privacy as a stick to
beat rival Google with, Mayer said. Google&#8217;s Chrome browser has
gained share, rising to 15 percent of the market last month from
10 percent at the end of 2010, according to Net Applications.
Internet Explorer fell to 48 percent from 57 percent. Google is
also poised to seize the No. 1 spot in the display-ad market
this year from Facebook, EMarketer forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it&#8217;s not clear whether the more consumer-oriented
approach will win Microsoft any Chrome users, and it has already
alienated one group -- big advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its October letter to Microsoft, Liodice&#8217;s Association
of National Advertisers said the default Do Not Track setting
will hurt advertising, reduce the amount of Internet content
supported by those ads and ultimately &#8220;undermine American
innovation and leadership in the Internet economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both that association and the Digital Advertising Alliance
are recommending advertisers ignore Do Not Track signals coming
from Internet Explorer 10. Yahoo, the biggest U.S. Web portal
and Microsoft&#8217;s partner in search, has said it will ignore the
setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consumer Information &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Internet is funded by advertisers,&#8221; Liodice said.
&#8220;The ability to reach our consumers requires that we absorb
information from them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if Microsoft and the advertisers can make peace,
Do Not Track still faces major challenges. Every Wednesday at 9
a.m. San Francisco time, Mayer spends 90 minutes on a conference
call with other members of the workgroup and any advertisers or
industry members that want to join. There&#8217;s been no progress
toward agreeing on a standard to guide advertisers on how to
abide by Do Not Track, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything that could be said has been said,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There are fundamental differences of opinion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is studying slashing the
amount Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-biggest U.S. oil company, will
pay to a fraction of the 40 billion reais ($19 billion)
Brazilian prosecutors had sought for a 2011 oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s National Petroleum Agency and the IBAMA
environmental agency worked with Chevron to reach a proposed
settlement of 311 million reais ($149 million), Gisele Porto,
the prosecutor responsible for the case, told reporters in Rio
de Janeiro today. The public ministry will analyze the
settlement, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s much better to reach a reasonable amount, it would
take 10 years to get 40 billion reais,&#8221; Porto told reporters in
Rio de Janeiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, was producing
about 60,000 barrels a day at the Frade field before shutting it
in March to study the geological reasons for a spill from a
drilling accident in November 2011. The halt contributed to a
decline in Brazil&#8217;s oil output this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-controlled oil producer, Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), a
partner at Frade, is heading toward its first yearly output drop
since 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 9 cents to $107.82 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL), the largest
publicly traded Coke bottler by volume, agreed to buy a 51
percent stake in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. for $689
million in its first acquisition outside of Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement includes an option for Coca-Cola Femsa to buy
the rest of the Philippines bottler within seven years of the
deal closing, the Mexico City-based company said in a statement.
It will also have the option to sell its ownership to Coca-Cola
Co. (KO) any time during year six, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal gives Coca-Cola Femsa access to a nation of about
95 million people with a Coke-products consumption per capita
that was 40 percent above the worldwide average last year. The
Philippines operation will sell about 530 million cases of
beverages this year, about 17 percent of Coca Cola Femsa&#8217;s
volume, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican bottler &#8220;is buying its way into what could
potentially become a whole new Southeast Asian opportunity&#8221; in
the long term, Antonio Gonzalez, an analyst with Credit Suisse
Group AG, wrote in a report. &#8220;There are not that many bottlers
in a position to have such serious global aspirations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa rose 1.2 percent to 187.93 pesos at the
Mexico City close. Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, which
controls the bottler, rose 1.1 percent to 126.01 pesos. Coca-
Cola, based in Atlanta, rose 0.2 percent $37.66 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enterprise Value &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close early next year, according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s biggest soft-drink maker, has owned
all of the Philippines unit since buying the 65 percent stake
owned by San Miguel Corp. (SMC) in 2007 for $590 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This announcement reflects our long-standing belief in
the global franchise system,&#8221; Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer
Muhtar Kent said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase price represents an enterprise value of $1.35
billion for the Philippines bottler, at a multiple of about 13.5
times expected 2012 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization, or Ebitda, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa spent more than 24 billion pesos ($1.88
billion) since the start of 2011 to acquire soft drink makers
and add bottling rights. It bought the beverage unit of Grupo
Fomento Queretano for 6.6 billion pesos and the bottling
operations of Grupo Cimsa for 11 billion pesos. The company also
paid 6.55 billion pesos for the Coke division of Grupo Tampico
SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deal Multiples &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those deals had multiples of between 9.6 times and 10 times
Ebitda, according to Alan Alanis, an analyst at JPMorgan in New
York. Coca-Cola Femsa paid about $2.50 per unit case of volume
in the Philippines deal, compared with about $4.80 in its
Mexican deals, Gonzalez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa is 49 percent owned by Fomento Economico
Mexicano and Coca-Cola has a 29 percent stake, according to its
website. The Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation and Cascade
Investment LLC, which manages money for billionaire Gates, own
about 19 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s American depositary
receipts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its home market, Coca-Cola Femsa has rights
to sell drinks such as Coke, Sprite and Fanta in parts of
Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela,
Brazil and Argentina, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Joyce Chang as its global head of fixed-income research, according to
an internal company memo seen by Bloomberg News and confirmed by
London-based spokesman Patrick Burton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chang replaced Terry Belton, who was appointed the head of
global portfolio strategy in the bank&#8217;s chief investment office
last week, Burton said. Chang, who is based in New York, was
previously the company&#8217;s global head of emerging-market
research. In her new role, she will assume global responsibility
for foreign-exchange, rates, securitized-products and public-
finance research, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Normand&#8217;s role as the global head of foreign-exchange
strategy in London will be expanded to include interest-rate
strategy for Europe, Japan and Australia, according to the same
document. He will report to Chang, the memo showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has overhauled
management during a year marred by more than $6.2 billion in
losses at JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office. In July, he

&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU) reached a 1.6 billion-euro ($2.1 billion) financing deal, gaining time to overhaul the French phone-equipment maker and try to sell as much as 1.5 billion euros of assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The senior secured credit facilities underwritten by Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will be denominated in U.S. dollars and euros, with maturities of 3 1/2 to six years, the Paris-based company said today. The stock gained 7 percent and the company&#8217;s 8.5 percent bonds jumped to the highest in almost eight months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The funding will allow Alcatel to &#8220;aggressively&#8221; consider all options to boost profitability, improve its strategy and shore up the company&#8217;s finances, Chief Executive Officer Ben Verwaayen said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CEO has so far sold smaller assets, cut jobs and costs and signed a patent-licensing agreement. Those measures have failed to reduce an average annual cash consumption of 700 million euros since the 2006 merger of Alcatel SA and Lucent Technologies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company, whose debt is rated junk by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s, faces more than 2 billion euros of debt repayments over three years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Asset Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent shares closed at 91 cents in Paris, after rising as much as 15 percent. They surged 16 percent on Nov. 22 after Bloomberg News reported the company was in talks with Goldman Sachs about obtaining funding in exchange for assets offered as collateral. Still, the stock has fallen 24 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) won a judge&#8217;s
final approval of a $44.6 million settlement of a class-action
lawsuit alleging that the bank rigged bids for municipal bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in New York issued the
order yesterday. The judge had given preliminary approval to the
accord in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement was attained following an extensive
investigation of the facts,&#8221; Marrero wrote in his five-page
order. &#8220;It resulted from vigorous arm&#8217;s-length negotiations
which were undertaken in good faith by counsel with significant
experience litigating antitrust class actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was filed by bond issuers alleging JPMorgan Chase
and other banks rigged bids and &#8220;restrained, suppressed or
eliminated&#8221; competition for municipal derivatives, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord approved by Marrero yesterday involved only
JPMorgan Chase and its Bear Stearns unit. Other banks settled
previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his June 4 preliminary-approval order, the judge had
certified a class of state, local and municipal government and
other entities that had purchased municipal derivatives through
negotiation, competitive bidding or auction, from the bank or
any alleged provider or broker co-defendant or co-conspirator
between January 1992 and August 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Escrow Account &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has already deposited $24 million into a
settlement escrow account, must now add $18.6 million more,
according to Marrero&#8217;s order. The bank&#8217;s agreement to settle
didn&#8217;t constitute an admission of wrongdoing that can be used in
any other civil or criminal proceeding, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Its the beginning of a series of other settlements that
we will be announcing over time,&#8221; in the municipal derivatives
litigation, plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Michael D. Hausfeld said in a
phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called yesterday&#8217;s approved accord satisfactory in the
context of earlier settlements between the defendant banks and
states&#8217; attorneys general. Hausfeld is the principal of the
Washington law firm Hausfeld LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment on the court order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Municipal Derivatives Antitrust
Litigation, 08-cv-2516, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
analyst testified that his team did a great job in helping
Dragon Systems Inc. sell itself to a Belgian firm that dissolved
in an accounting scandal six months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Berzofsky, speaking in a videotaped deposition
played yesterday for jurors in federal court in Boston, answered
questions from a lawyer for Dragon Systems&#8217; former owners, who
are suing the bank over its advice on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re saying Goldman did a great job for Dragon?&#8221; asked
Alan K. Cotler, the attorney for Jim and Janet Baker who founded
the speech recognition developer in their suburban Boston home
30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Berzofsky replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that Jim and Janet Baker lost their life&#8217;s work
doesn&#8217;t affect your opinion that Goldman did a great job for
them, right?&#8221; Cotler asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Correct,&#8221; said Berzofsky, who left Goldman Sachs in 2000
and is now a managing director at Warburg Pincus LLC, a private
equity firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon&#8217;s founders claim that a four-man team of Goldman
Sachs bankers assigned to the transaction committed gross
negligence by failing to pursue questions about Lernout 
Hauspie Speech Products NV&#8217;s finances that should have led them
to avoid the $580 million all-stock deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say they lost their company and access to the
technology they had spent their careers developing, including
Dragon NaturallySpeaking dictation software, when Lernout 
Hauspie filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2000. The
deal closed in June of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competent Advice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs claims its team gave Dragon competent advice
and says it urged company management to press their accountants,
at Arthur Andersen LLP, to probe Lernout  Hauspie&#8217;s finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Patti Saris, who is presiding over the
case, said the trial, which began Dec. 10, may last until Jan.
25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 13, the jury heard testimony from Richard Wayner, a
senior member of the Goldman Sachs team on the Dragon deal.
Wayner said Goldman Sachs had unanswered questions about Lernout
 Hauspie&#8217;s suspicious surges in sales in Asia -- revenue that
turned out to be fictitious -- but never sought to stop Dragon
from selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Satisfactory Answers&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayner said that after informing Dragon that Goldman Sachs
didn&#8217;t received satisfactory answers from Lernout  Hauspie, it
was &#8220;the client&#8217;s decision whether or not they want to do the
deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berzofsky, a 1996 Harvard graduate who was 25 at the time
of the Dragon sale, said due diligence was up to Dragon. His
team&#8217;s job was&#160;&#8220;shepherding&#8221; the deal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Dragon showed him Goldman Sachs marketing
materials touting the firm&#8217;s devotion to its clients and
commitment to excellence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Did it ever cross your mind that after Lernout  Hauspie
went bankrupt and was found out to be a fraud, did it ever cross
your mind that maybe you and your team did not meet that
principle of achieving excellence on behalf of Jim and Janet
Baker?&#8221; Cotler asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It never crossed my mind,&#8221; Berzofsky replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the deposition, Berzofsky lounged back in his chair,
ate snacks and repeatedly stroked the back of his head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Recall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He yawned when attorneys show him a document related to
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s decision to walk away from making any
investments of its own in Lernout  Hauspie in the late 1990s
and said he didn&#8217;t recall ever seeing the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon paid Goldman Sachs $5 million for its work under an
agreement that would have paid the bankers only $150,000 per
quarter if the sale didn&#8217;t occur, according to testimony in the
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What did you do for $5 million?&#8221; Cotler asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We gave them advice on how to sell their company,&#8221;
Berzofsky replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Baker v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Chris Dolmetsch" date="Dec 17, 2012  6:31 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-17/jpmorgan-goldman-ask-judge-to-dismiss-mortgage-lawsuit.html"><headline>JPMorgan, Goldman Ask Judge to Dismiss Mortgage Lawsuit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other banks asked a New York state judge to
dismiss a $1.8 billion lawsuit brought by residential mortgage-
backed securities investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors, which included Phoenix Light SF Ltd., sued
New York-based JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and the other lenders in
New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan in May, accusing them
of making misrepresentations about the loans backing the
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants in documents filed on Dec. 14 asked Justice
Charles E. Ramos to dismiss the suit, saying the investors
failed to show they&#8217;re entitled to the requested relief and that
their claims are barred by a three-year statute of limitations
under German law. The defendants also say the investors have
failed to identify &#8220;any actionable misrepresentation&#8221; that
they relied upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs made their purchases before the bulk of the
prospectus supplements containing the alleged misrepresentations
were even created or filed, and, as some of the most
sophisticated investors in the world, plaintiffs had an
affirmative duty to conduct an independent investigation into
the risks associated with their investments,&#8221; the banks said in
the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phoenix is a limited liability company based in Dublin that
inherited legal claims from six separate legal entities &#8220;that
collapsed or nearly collapsed,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entities include Dusseldorf, Germany-based WestLB, the
180-year-old German state-owned lender that ceased operations on
June 29 as part of European Union conditions tied to a 17
billion-euro ($22.4 billion) bailout following the 2008
financial crisis, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors including Phoenix Light have filed similar suits
in the same court over the past year, including a complaint
filed against Deutsche Bank AG in February and actions against
Bank of America filed in September and November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. JPMorgan Securities
LLC, 651755-2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova and Joe Richter" date="Dec 17, 2012  5:53 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-17/jpmorgan-wins-approval-for-first-u-s-physical-copper-etf.html"><headline>JPMorgan Wins Approval for First U.S. Physical Copper ETF</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) won regulatory
approval for the first U.S. exchange-traded fund backed by
physical copper, which some industrial users said may disrupt
the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule change by NYSE Arca Inc. to list JPM XF
Physical Copper Trust was approved, the regulator said in an
order on its website dated Dec. 14. BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and ETF
Securities Ltd. also have said they plan to start physically
backed ETFs for industrial metals in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of industrial copper consumers including AmRod
Corp., Southwire Co. and Encore Wire Corp. (WIRE) and hedge fund RK
Capital LLP opposed the plan, saying funds backed by copper
would leave less of the metal available for manufacturers,
creating shortages and driving up prices. Senator Carl Levin, a
Michigan Democrat who in July had advised rejecting the ETF,
said in a statement today that the approval is &#8220;a blow to
American businesses and consumers that rely on copper,&#8221; and
that Congress should review the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study released last month by an SEC division concluded
that asset flows from exchange-traded products tied to metals
don&#8217;t have a significant impact on the price of the commodity.
Those findings were disputed by the copper-users group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, a London-based spokesman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment on when the firm plans to introduce the
fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs trade like stocks, giving investors access to
commodities such as copper without taking physical delivery. ETF
Securities started the first exchange-traded products backed by
copper, nickel and tin in London in December 2010. Company data
shows that the copper fund holds about 2,000 metric tons of the
metal, compared with more than 20 million tons that the
International Copper Study Group said will be mined and used
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surplus Metal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper will have its first production surplus in four
years, with output set to top demand by 458,000 tons next year,
the ICSG said Oct. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inventories of the metal in warehouses tracked by the
London Metal Exchange, down 19 percent this year, climbed 9.5
percent in a day to 298,625 tons, the most since Sept. 5, 2008,
exchange data showed today. Inventories tracked by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange advanced for a second week, rising 7,406 tons
to 205,385 tons, data from the bourse showed Dec. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Arca Inc., the electronic platform of NYSE Euronext,
filed with the SEC to list and trade JPM XF Physical Copper
Trust, according to an April 2 document. It sought approval to
list BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Copper Trust on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Dec. 14, copper for delivery in three months
climbed 6.1 percent to $8,065 a ton on the LME this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the biggest U.S.
oil company, will begin exploring off the coast of South Africa
after it agreed to buy a 75 percent stake in blocks owned by
Impact Oil  Gas Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon will control operations in the area it&#8217;s acquiring in
the Tugela South Exploration Right from closely held Impact,
according to a statement from the Irving, Texas-based company
today. Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed for the acquisition, which
includes the right to buy a 75 percent stake in three other
offshore areas Impact has permits to study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has been facing production declines as discoveries
from past decades falter and governments in the Middle East and
Latin America prohibit exploration by foreign businesses or make
it too expensive. The company is turning to South Africa, which
has become one of Africa&#8217;s hottest attractions for energy
producers such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;South Africa is one of the new areas offshore that there
seems to be growing interest in,&#8221; Brian Youngberg, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;Thoughts have been that South Africa is probably an uptapped
market that could really see production grow in coming years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon doesn&#8217;t have any existing operations in South Africa
and will explore for oil and natural gas, Patrick McGinn, a
company spokesman, said in e-mailed responses to questions
today. Information on the cost and schedule of Exxon&#8217;s
exploration program is considered confidential, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exploration Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tugela South Exploration Right covers 2.8 million acres
near Durban off the east coast of South Africa, in water depths
of as much as 6,500 feet (2,000 meters). The additional
exploration rights cover 16 million offshore acres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact, based in London, has one of the largest holdings
off the South African coast by a closely held company, according
to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe South Africa has significant potential and we
will continue to look for additional opportunities there,&#8221;
Stephen Greenlee, president of Exxon&#8217;s exploration company, said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the company also got a permit from the South
African government to study the potential of the deep-water
Durban Basin, covering about 12.4 million acres. Exxon has
exclusive rights to study the area for a year and can seek a
permit if it wants to explore further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Orange Basin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, The Hague-based Shell said it was collecting
seismic data in the Orange Basin off the north-west coast of
South Africa. The company may make a decision on drilling in the
next year or so. Anadarko, based in The Woodlands, Texas, has
interests in about 24 million gross acres off western South
Africa, according to a company presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is lagging behind rivals in finding new energy
sources. It found enough oil and gas last year to replace 107
percent of what it pumped from wells, a so-called reserve-
replacement ratio that was less than one-third that of OAO
Rosneft, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Exxon formed a
partnership with Russia&#8217;s Rosneft last year to increase its
access to resources in the Arctic and Black Sea region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, in a report earlier this month, raised its long-term
global energy-demand growth estimate to 35 percent from 32
percent as expanding populations in Africa and India use more
electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company remains growth-challenged given its size and
scale, and it&#8217;s hard for Exxon to find new areas that can
&#8220;really move the needle,&#8221; said Youngberg, who has a hold
rating on Exxon shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. If South African
exploration is successful, production may come online near the
end of the decade, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have the cash flow to explore numerous areas around
the world on an ongoing basis in order to hopefully find some
new production that could help them over time,&#8221; Youngberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 0.9 percent to $88.87 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union
Administration board sued a J.P. Morgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit
claiming Bear Stearns  Co., which it acquired in 2008, used
misleading documents in selling $3.6 billion in mortgage-backed
securities to four credit unions that later failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents said the mortgage originators had adhered to
underwriting guidelines that actually had been &#8220;systematically
abandoned,&#8221; the credit union agency said in a federal court
lawsuit filed Dec. 14 in Kansas City, Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because the mortgages in the pools collateralizing the
RMBS were largely underwritten without adherence to the
underwriting standards in the offering statements, the RMBS were
significantly riskier than represented,&#8221; the National Credit
Union Administration said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alexandria, Virginia-based agency is responsible for
recovering losses to minimize the costs to its industry-funded
stabilization fund. Its complaint was filed as liquidator of the
U.S. Central Federal Credit Union and the Western Corporate
Federal Credit Union, both placed into conservatorship in 2009
and involuntary liquidation a year later, and the Southwest
Corporate Federal Credit Union and Members United Corporate
Federal Credit Union, which were placed in conservatorship and
then liquidation in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Spokeswoman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s complaint follows similar lawsuits the credit union
agency filed against other banks, including one in September
against Barclays Plc (BARC) and those previously against a unit of
Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, the
Wachovia Corp. unit of Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS)
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was also the target of a separate claim in June
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays last month filed papers seeking dismissal of the
lawsuit against it, arguing the claims were filed too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Accords &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. (C) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)
agreed in November 2011 and March to pay a combined $171 million
to resolve similar accusations, with $145 million from Deutsche
Bank, $20.5 million from Citigroup and $5.3 million from HSBC.
The banks didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Firms like Bear, Stearns acted unfairly by ignoring the
rules for underwriting,&#8221; NCUA Board Chairman Debbie Matz, said
today in a statement. &#8220;They packaged these securities and then
told buyers the paper was sound. When the securities plunged in
value, we learned the truth. NCUA is now working to hold these
underwriters accountable and secure recoveries on behalf of
federally insured credit unions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Credit Union Administration Board v.
Bear Stearns  Co., 12-cv-2781, U.S. District Court, District of
Kansas (Kansas City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading of depositary receipts fell
to a six-year low in 2012 as concern about Europe&#8217;s debt crisis
and China&#8217;s economic slowdown damped investor confidence,
according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of receipt trading dropped 30 percent in the
first 11 months of the year to the lowest level since 2006,
JPMorgan said in a report. Trading volume declined 14 percent
from the same period of 2011 as initial public offerings that
included global depositary receipts declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The capital raising environment was not great, but the
activity numbers have dropped less than the broader markets,
which is a good sign,&#8221; Dennis Bon, the global head of
Depositary Receipts at JPMorgan, said in a telephone interview
from New York on Dec. 14. &#8220;We saw a blip in the last couple of
years, with a lot of activity, and now we begin to see the trend
line getting back to normal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of depositary receipts traded in the first 11
months was $2.5 trillion, below the $3.6 trillion seen in the
same period last year, according to the JPMorgan data. A backlog
of potential IPOs in China and Russia may bolster trading of
receipts next year, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latin America was the second-biggest market for depositary
receipt trading. Brazil accounts for 75 percent by value in the
region, with programs from raw-material producers Vale SA and
Petroleo Brasileiro SA leading volumes in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, depositary receipt capital raising through IPOs
and follow-on offers totaled $12.4 billion, the lowest value
since 2004, according to JPMorgan. Fifty-two equity offerings
were withdrawn or postponed in Latin America, emerging Asia and
Eastern Europe this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bon expects offerings to pick up in 2013, led by Latin
America and Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia is a large issuer, the pipeline is huge in terms
of companies looking to IPO, and there&#8217;s still a lot of investor
interest,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors almost doubled purchases
of commodities this year, at a time when Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Morgan Stanley are forecasting higher prices and
Citigroup Inc. (C) says the best returns are over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money invested in commodity funds increased by $21.6
billion this year, up 92 percent from the gain in 2011,
according to Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks the flows. Hedge funds&#8217; bets on a rally are 51 percent
bigger than a year ago, U.S. government data show. Precious
metals will lead returns in 2013, rising as much as 25 percent,
as grains advance 18 percent and industrial metals 16 percent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 131 traders, investors and
analysts across 15 raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While commodities are headed for their first annual retreat
since 2008, growth in emerging markets will boost demand and
tighten supply, Goldman Sachs&#8217; analysts said in a report Dec. 5.
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials almost
tripled in the past decade as producers failed to keep up with
consumption. That &#8220;super cycle&#8221; of returns has now ended
because China is growing more slowly and supply has caught up,
Citigroup&#8217;s analysts said in a report last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It comes back to the uncertainty about the economy, and
the government policies that are going to be enacted or
potentially changing over the next year,&#8221; said Peter Jankovskis, who helps oversee about $3 billion of assets as co-
chief investment officer at Lisle, Illinois-based Oakbrook
Investments LLC. &#8220;That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re seeing that disparity in
the outlooks of many of these forecasting firms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading Partners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI fell 0.7 percent this year, the worst
performance since a 43 percent drop in 2008, with the biggest
declines in coffee, cotton, sugar and crude oil. The MSCI All-
Country World Index (MXWD) of equities advanced 14 percent and the
Dollar Index, a measure against six major trading partners,
dropped 1 percent. Treasuries returned 2 percent, a Bank of
America Corp. index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The declines in crude and gasoline are driving the SP GSCI
lower because energy accounts for about 70 percent of the gauge
by weight. Eighteen members of the index advanced this year, led
by gains of 23 percent or more in wheat and soybeans as U.S.
farmers endured the worst drought in a half century. Gold is
headed for a 12th consecutive annual increase, driven by central
bank stimulus, and corn and cattle reached records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Increasing Consumption &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerating economic growth in the second half of 2013
will spur more demand, said Jeffrey Currie, Goldman&#8217;s New York-
based head of commodity research, predicting a 7 percent return
in commodities over 12 months. Increasing consumption will curb
available supply, boosting near-term prices relative to longer-
dated contracts, he wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for energy and grains will be &#8220;resilient&#8221; and
delayed harvests in South America will limit corn and soybean
supplies, Hussein Allidina and Peter Richardson, analysts at
Morgan Stanley in New York and Melbourne, wrote in a Dec. 6
report. Economies will accelerate in the second half of next
year should central banks extend stimulus measures, they said.
Policy makers from Japan to China to Europe to the U.S. have
pledged to do more if growth weakens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup says prices that have risen in nine of the past
10 years are spurring more investment in production, creating
supply gluts, according to a Nov. 19 report by Edward L. Morse,
the bank&#8217;s New York-based global head of commodities research.
Output will exceed demand next year in 10 of the 15 commodities
covered in the Bloomberg survey, according to supply and demand
estimates from either Barclays Plc or Rabobank International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Central Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank said Dec. 6 it expects the 17-
nation euro-area&#8217;s economy to shrink 0.3 percent next year,
having previously forecast growth. Europe accounts for about 18
percent of copper demand and 14 percent of global energy
consumption, Barclays and BP Plc (BP/) data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds pared bullish wagers in the fourth quarter,
with net-long positions dropping 35 percent since the end of
September, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
While the Bloomberg survey shows that everything from cotton to
soybeans will gain at least 9.9 percent in 2013, the analysts
have been wrong before. In last year&#8217;s survey, only three of the
15 commodities covered reached their projected highs in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodities tend to be victims of their own success,&#8221;
said Jack Ablin, who helps oversee about $66 billion of assets
as chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank in Chicago. &#8220;If
you think about industrial metals, we have now dug a little
deeper, and we&#8217;ve mined a little more, and now we have
unprecedented inventories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity assets under management rose 8.6 percent to $429
billion in the first 10 months of 2012, according to London-
based Barclays. Contracts outstanding across the members of the
SP GSCI advanced 12 percent this year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products
jumped 12 percent and were last valued at $143.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World growth will accelerate to 3.6 percent in 2013, from
3.3 percent this year, according to the International Monetary
Fund. China&#8217;s economy, the biggest consumer of everything from
coal to cotton to copper, will accelerate in the fourth quarter,
after slowing for seven consecutive quarters, the median of 30
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More central-bank stimulus means investors will continue to
buy gold to protect against inflation and currency debasement,
and prices will average a record $1,853 an ounce in 2013, Morgan
Stanley predicts. Gold for immediate delivery slid 1.6 percent
to settle at $1,671.10. Goldman says the prices will probably
peak next year because of improving U.S. growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tax Increases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for gold may also be boosted by mounting concern
that U.S. growth will slow. The Federal Reserve &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have
the tools&#8221; to counter the risks should lawmakers fail to reach
an agreement on about $600 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts that start automatically next month, Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said Dec. 12. Bullion will rise as much as 18 percent
to $2,000 in 2013, the median of 49 estimates in the Bloomberg
survey shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybeans and corn reached records this year and wheat
touched an almost four-year high as drought parched fields in
the U.S., the biggest agricultural exporter. Wheat will beat
corn and soybeans in 2013, advancing as much as 18 percent,
according to the median of 32 predictions. Citigroup expects
grain and soybean prices to be supported in the first half of
next year as supplies remain tight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee is expected to have the biggest gain among
the 15 commodities in the survey, climbing as much as 33 percent
after slumping 36 percent in 2012. Nickel may be the best-
performing industrial metal, rising as much as 16 percent, while
copper will gain 12 percent, the survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Measure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains may boost earnings for suppliers. BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP), the largest mining company, will report a 6.7 percent gain
in its most-closely tracked profit measure to $7.66 billion in
its fiscal second half ending June 30, the mean of five
estimates shows. Shares of the Melbourne-based producer rose 6.5
percent this year, and may climb 4.4 percent to A$38.28 in 12
months, according to the average of 20 forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It won&#8217;t be a straight line higher, but there&#8217;s a pretty
good undertow for commodities,&#8221; said James Paulsen, the
Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells Capital
Management, which oversees about $325 billion of assets.
&#8220;Commodities in general will trend higher the next few years,
but there&#8217;s room for selectivity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bain
Capital Partners LLC argued that investors are trying to &#8220;swing
for the fences&#8221; by claiming in a lawsuit that buyout firms
conspired to rig bids on takeovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants, who also include Blackstone Group LP (BX),
Carlyle Group, KKR  Co., Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), today urged U.S. District Judge Edward Harrington in Boston to dismiss the lawsuit by shareholders in
acquired companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals and pension funds that held shares in companies
including Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. (FSL), Neiman Marcus Group Inc.
and HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) sued in 2007 and 2008, claiming private-
equity firms conspired to rig bids and suppress prices for
leveraged buyouts, depriving shareholders of billions of
dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Tringali, an attorney at Simpson Thacher  Bartlett
LLP who argued for the defendants, said the sprawling conspiracy
claimed in the lawsuit, covering $250 billion worth of
transactions, isn&#8217;t possible because target companies controlled
the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They decided to swing for the fences and go big with the
conspiracy they&#8217;ve claimed here,&#8221; said Tringali, who cited
communications from suitors who lost out on deals or quit
bidding. &#8220;These are the words of competitors, not
conspirators,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;E-Mail Disclosure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, an amended complaint was unsealed, disclosing
e-mails among private-equity firm executives about potential
buyouts. In an e-mail referring to Freescale, Blackstone Group
President Tony James told KKR co-founder George Roberts,
&#8220;Together we can be unstoppable but in opposition we can cost
each other a lot of money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is a &#8220;complete fabrication,&#8221; James said later
in an earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &#8220;mountain of evidence&#8221; of collusion among the
firms, Christopher Burke, an attorney for the plaintiffs at the
law firm Scott  Scott, said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This conspiracy has been so substantiated by the evidence
you can actually draw a map,&#8221; he told the judge. &#8220;We can draw
all of the defendants together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms are accused of forming bidding clubs that suppressed
prices and allocating deals among themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Kirk Dahl said he and others in the proposed
class of investors owned shares in Freescale in 2006 when the
chipmaker announced a buyout by firms including Carlyle and
Blackstone for $17.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HCA Purchase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HCA was bought by companies including KKR and Bain for
$32.1 billion. The plaintiffs include the police and fire
department pension funds of Detroit and Omaha, Nebraska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If true, we have some pretty serious violations of the
antitrust laws,&#8221; Darren Bush, a professor of antitrust law at
the University of Houston Law Center, said in an interview. &#8220;If
this conduct is really going on and it&#8217;s really problematic, it
ought to have a trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tringali, arguing on behalf of buyout firms, defended the
practice of bidding groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mere fact you have three bidding groups as opposed to
three or six individual bidders is meaningless,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Three bidding groups are still bidding against each other and
the price is going up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deals in question occurred from 2003 to 2007. Two
lawsuits were consolidated by the judge, who denied a request by
the defendants to move the case to federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Original Buyouts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original complaint listed seven leveraged buyouts:
Freescale, Aramark, Neiman Marcus, PanAmSat Corp., SunGard Data
Systems Inc., Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) and HCA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge in 2010 allowed a second phase of fact-gathering
for eight additional transactions, involving Loews Corp. (L), NXP
Semiconductor NV (NXPI), Vivendi SA (VIV), Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH),
Nalco Holding Co., Cablecom Holdings, Susquehanna Media and
Warner Music Group Corp. Later that year, the judge allowed the
plaintiffs to add more deals and extended fact-gathering to
April 2012. The lawsuit now lists 19 buyouts and eight related
transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants also include Providence Equity Partners
Inc., Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, Silver Lake Technology
Management and TPG Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge asked why the plaintiffs claimed one large
conspiracy instead of several. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s causing me an awful lot of problems as how to
intellectually grasp it,&#8221; Harrington said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just almost
overwhelming. Because it comes down to this: Is there one
overarching conspiracy, or is it less?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Dahl v. Bain Capital, 08-10254, and Klein v.
Bain Capital, 07-12388, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the company that lost
its patent a year ago on the top-selling drug Lipitor, is firing
almost 20 percent of its roughly 3,000-person sales force for
primary-care drugs, said a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts, about 600 positions, are to begin this month and
are part of the New York-based company&#8217;s continuing effort to
lower costs, said the person, who asked not to be named because
they weren&#8217;t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been cutting expenses under Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read as it seeks to reposition itself after the loss
of Lipitor, the cholesterol-lowering medicine that generated
$9.6 billion in revenue in 2011. Read has said he&#8217;s refocusing
the company to bring new drugs to market as it continues to
integrate a decade&#8217;s worth of acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As part of our strategy to allocate our resources,
investments and people to the areas that best serve our patients
and customers, we continually evaluate how we can be more
efficient and effective,&#8221; Mackay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman,
wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;As a result, we are making changes in some
segments of our field force to better match the future needs of
the business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 1.1 percent to $25.64 at 4 p.m. New York time.
The stock is up 18 percent since the start of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary-care drugs make up Pfizer&#8217;s top-selling products,
and include the erectile dysfunction pill Viagra, pain therapy
Lyrica and the arthritis treatment Celebrex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had 103,700 employees at the end of 2011, according
to corporate filings. The company may hire more workers this
spring, assuming the U.S. approval and sales start of its
experimental blood thinner Eliquis, according to the person.
Pfizer is developing Eliquis with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) The
two companies will split sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the firings, Pfizer had about 3,000 primary-care
salespeople and managers, according to PharmaForce
International, which tracks drugmaker sales forces and provides
market intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil SA hired banks
including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to sell what would be the largest
initial public offering in Brazil in three years, a 5 billion
reais ($2.39 billion) deal for its pension and insurance unit,
four people with direct knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil also picked Citigroup Inc. (C), Banco Bradesco
SA (BBDC4), Banco Itau BBA, Grupo BTG Pactual and Brasil Plural SA Banco
Multiplo, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the decision isn&#8217;t public yet. Brasilia-based Banco do
Brasil will also be a member of the underwriting team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brazil, Latin America&#8217;s biggest lender by assets,
is seeking to raise about 5 billion reais by selling at least 25
percent of the pension and insurance unit, the people said. A
deal that size would be the largest IPO in Brazil since Banco
Santander Brasil SA&#8217;s $7.55 billion transaction in July 2009.
Banco do Brasil approved the creation of the new division, BB
Seguridade SA, yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BB Seguridade would be listed on BMFBovespa SA (BVMF3)&#8217;s Novo
Mercado special segment, the bank said in a regulatory filing
last month. The exchange has stricter rules for disclosure and
minority shareholders&#8217; rights, and requires companies to have at
least 25 percent of their capital traded publicly. The offering
would include primary and secondary shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joint Ventures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil is seeking to consolidate its insurance
businesses into a single company to lower costs, according to
the filing. BB Seguridade would control Banco do Brasil&#8217;s two
insurance joint ventures with Madrid-based Mapfre SA. (MAP) The lender
said it plans to expand into dental- and health-insurance
brokerages as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IPO for the insurance and pension business creates &#8220;a
lot of value&#8221; for Banco do Brasil, Itau BBA analysts wrote in a
report on Nov. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) expects the deal sometime in the first
half of next year, Alexandre Abreu, vice president of the bank&#8217;s
retail business, said in a telephone interview on Nov. 26. An
IPO will show the &#8220;hidden value&#8221; of the state-run company&#8217;s
insurance business, and capitalize the unit without taking
resources from Banco do Brasil, Abreu said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Banco do Brasil, Citigroup, JPMorgan, BTG
Pactual, Bradesco, Itau BBA and Plural declined to comment on
the underwriting assignment, and asked not to be identified, in
keeping with company policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Carla Main" date="Dec 18, 2012  8:28 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-18/google-ftc-probe-cftc-audio-rule-jpmorgan-compliance.html"><headline>Google-FTC Probe, CFTC-Audio Rule, JPMorgan: Compliance</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) is poised to make
voluntary concessions that will end a 20-month U.S. antitrust
probe of its business practices without any enforcement action,
two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which has been under investigation by the Federal
Trade Commission, is preparing a letter promising not to copy
content from rival websites without permission and to allow
advertisers to compare Google&#8217;s ad-campaign data with
performance on other Internet search engines, one of the people
said Dec. 16. That will close the investigation without a
lawsuit or settlement, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An end to the probe without any enforcement action would be
a blow to Google&#8217;s competitors including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Yelp
Inc. and Expedia Inc., which formed an alliance to press the
agency to act. They claim Google&#8217;s dominance of Internet search,
combined with favoring its own services in answers to queries,
violates antitrust laws and impedes competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Kovacevich, a Google spokesman, declined to comment on
whether Google is preparing to announce concessions or any
matters involving the FTC. Cecelia Prewett, a spokeswoman for
the FTC, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audio Records of Swaps and Futures Trades Required by CFTC Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives traders will be required to keep audio records
of commodities transactions under U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission rules completed in a private vote yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation, revised by commissioners to limit the
impact on smaller brokers, could help CFTC&#8217;s enforcement unit
determine traders&#8217; intent when later probing claims of market
manipulation and false reporting, the agency said in a
statement. It is already common practice for equities traders to
make such audio recordings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the rule approved in a 5-0 vote, derivatives brokers
and certain members of exchanges and swap-execution facilities
will be required to record quotes, bids, offers, trading and
prices that lead to transactions whether communicated by
telephone, voice-mail, mobile or other electronic media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC backed away from requiring records of oral
communications that lead to trades in grains, according to a
statement. Companies will have a year to comply with the
regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency delayed consideration of the rule in September
amid resistance from industry groups representing trading firms
and exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Stresses Bank Governance in Letter to Boards, Supervisors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve stressed the responsibility of boards
and managers for governance in a letter to banks and their
supervisors that also outlined other priorities for oversight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bank&#8217;s &#8220;board is expected to establish and maintain the
firm&#8217;s culture, incentives, structure, and processes that
promote its compliance with laws, regulations, and supervisory
guidance,&#8221; the letter, released yesterday in Washington, said.
The letter also called for managers to set &#8220;appropriate
compensation and other incentives that are consistent with the
institutional risk appetite.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the items on the Fed&#8217;s letter, such as heightened
standards for capital and liquidity, are already under way as a
result of the annual stress tests and tougher supervisory
oversight. Governance is one area the Fed rarely discusses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has been evolving its approach to large bank
supervision partly as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and also in
response to its own shortcomings during the 2008-2009 financial
crisis. The Fed said the guidance in the letter &#8220;does not apply
to community banking organizations, defined as institutions
supervised by the Federal Reserve with total consolidated assets
of $10 billion or less.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury Plan Would Fund Rate Cuts on Mortgages in Private Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some struggling homeowners left out of current U.S.
government mortgage-aid programs because their home loans have
been packaged into private securities could see their interest
rates cut through a subsidy being considered by the Treasury
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the plan, the government would pay the difference
between the new and original interest rates to the owners of the
loans for five years in an effort to overcome investors&#8217;
objections to mortgage modifications, according to a person
familiar with plan who asked not to be identified because the
initiative isn&#8217;t final or public. Details on the cost of the
program and how it would be paid for weren&#8217;t available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal is among efforts by the Obama administration
to aid homeowners who remain under stress even as the housing
market begins to recover. Borrowers who owe more than their
homes are worth and who have mortgages that have been packaged
into bonds issued by private securitizers have been unable to
take advantage of existing government aid programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments and
who owe at least 25 percent more than the value of their
properties would be eligible for the program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Wins Approval for First U.S. Physical Copper ETF &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) won regulatory approval for the first
U.S. exchange-traded fund backed by physical copper, which some
industrial users said may disrupt the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule change by NYSE Arca Inc. to list JPM XF
Physical Copper Trust was approved, the regulator said in an
order on its website dated Dec. 14. BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and ETF
Securities Ltd. also have said they plan to start physically
backed ETFs for industrial metals in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of industrial copper consumers including AmRod
Corp., Southwire Co. and Encore Wire Corp. and hedge fund RK
Capital LLP opposed the plan, saying funds backed by copper
would leave less of the metal available for manufacturers,
creating shortages and driving up prices. Senator Carl Levin, a
Michigan Democrat, in July advised rejecting the planned ETF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review released last month by an SEC division concluded
that asset flows from exchange-traded products tied to metals
don&#8217;t have a significant impact on the price of the commodity.
Those findings were disputed by the copper-users group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, a London-based spokesman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment on when the firm plans to introduce the
fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs trade like stocks, giving investors access to
commodities such as copper without taking physical delivery. ETF
Securities started the first exchange-traded products backed by
copper, nickel and tin in London in December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Arca Inc., the electronic platform of NYSE Euronext (NYX),
filed with the SEC to list and trade JPM XF Physical Copper
Trust, according to an April 2 document. It sought approval to
list BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Copper Trust on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, South Korea, the world&#8217;s fifth-biggest copper
consumer, is expected to introduce an exchange-traded fund
backed by physical metal this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ETF will be listed on the Korea Exchange by the Public
Procurement Service, a government agency that manages strategic
commodities, Soon Jae Yoo, deputy director for stockpiling, said
Dec. 10 at a seminar in London. The fund will be backed by metal
stored in the agency&#8217;s warehouses and will hold 1,100 metric
tons of copper when trading starts, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allianz Pays $12.3 Million to Settle SEC&#8217;s Indonesia Bribe Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allianz SE (ALV) will pay more than $12.3 million to settle U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission claims that the Munich-based
insurer made improper payments to government officials in
Indonesia during a seven-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was cited for violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act after an SEC investigation found 295 insurance
contracts on government projects from 2001 to 2008 that were
obtained or retained by payments of $650,626 by an Allianz
subsidiary to employees of state-owned entities, the agency said
in a statement yesterday. Allianz made more than $5.3 million in
profits as a result of the improper payments, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allianz resolved the claim without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. Joel Cohen, a Gibson Dunn  Crutcher LLP partner
representing Allianz, didn&#8217;t immediately comment on the
settlement when reached by telephone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley Fined $5 Million by Massachusetts on Facebook IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s (MS) handling of Facebook Inc.&#8217;s (FB) initial public
offering, a deal that cost investors billions of dollars, broke
a decade-old pledge to block investment bankers from influencing
analysts, according to Massachusetts regulators, who fined the
bank $5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior Morgan Stanley banker wrote a script that
Facebook&#8217;s then-treasurer used to update research analysts on
the company&#8217;s revenue outlook before the IPO, according to a
settlement document with Secretary of the Commonwealth William
Galvin. He faulted Morgan Stanley for dishonesty, ethics
violations and failing to supervise employees -- the first
regulatory claims to stem from the bank&#8217;s handling of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plunge in Facebook&#8217;s stock after it began trading in May
has fueled government probes and more than 40 lawsuits, with
some investors claiming the social-network company failed to
disclose revised forecasts before the IPO. The small size of
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s fine relative to investors&#8217; losses shows other
regulators may struggle to pin much blame on the bank, said Erik
Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan&#8217;s Stephen M.
Ross School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Grimes, the bank&#8217;s global co-head of technology
investment banking who helped lead the IPO, and a spokesman for
Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin&#8217;s office, didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment on the unidentified banker
described in the complaint. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman
for Morgan Stanley, declined to say whether Grimes is the
banker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Japan&#8217;s FSA Joins Probe Into RBS Rate Setting, Officials Say &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency joined a probe into
possible rigging of interest rates at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, two regulatory officials with knowledge of the matter
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA earlier this month began reviewing RBS&#8217;s Japan
banking and brokerage units on issues including compliance
related to the setting of London and Tokyo interbank offered
rates, the people said, asking not to be named as the matter is
confidential. Japan&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Surveillance
Commission began its inspection last month, a government
official with knowledge of the matter said at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS, Britain&#8217;s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, is among
banks facing allegations by regulators worldwide that they
manipulated Libor, the benchmark for more than $300 trillion of
securities.  The FSA was scrutinizing RBS&#8217;s Tokyo banking branch
and RBS Securities Japan Ltd. as of Dec. 5, the agency said on
its website without disclosing additional details. It informed
RBS about the probe on Nov. 27, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are fully co-operating with all of our regulators,&#8221;
said Atsuko Yoshitsugu, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for RBS. She
declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiroshi Okada, a spokesman for Japan&#8217;s FSA, declined to
comment. RBS hasn&#8217;t been accused of any wrongdoing by Japanese
regulators, which conduct regular inspections of financial
companies, according to the FSA&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hedge Fund Managers Convicted by Jury of Insider-Trading Scheme &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level Global Investors LP co-founder Anthony Chiasson and
former Diamondback Capital Management LLC portfolio manager Todd
Newman were convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy for an
insider-trading scheme that reaped more than $72 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deliberating a little more than two days, a federal
jury in New York found both men guilty of conspiracy to commit
securities fraud for a scheme to trade on Dell Inc. (DELL) and Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA) using illicit tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel found Chiasson, 39, guilty of five counts of
securities fraud, earning Level Global $68.5 million on inside
tips trading on the two technology company stocks. Newman, 48,
was convicted of four counts of securities fraud related to
trades on inside information that earned his fund about $3.8
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara&#8217;s office has charged
75 people with insider trading since October 2009. Seventy-one
of those pleaded guilty or were convicted after trial. Newman
and Chiasson, after the seventh trial connected to the probe,
are the ninth and 10th defendants convicted by federal juries in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men face as long as 20 years in prison for
securities fraud when they are sentenced by U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. attorneys Antonia Apps, Richard Tarlowe and
John Zach argued during the trial, which began Nov. 7, that the
two portfolio managers were part of a &#8220;corrupt chain&#8221; of
analysts and insiders at the two technology companies who
swapped and traded on illicit tips. The scheme ran from late
2007 until 2009, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six people charged with being part of the insider-trading
ring have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the U.S.,
including Jon Horvath, a former analyst at SAC Capital Advisors
LP&#8217;s Sigma unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Bruce, a spokesman for Diamondback, declined to
comment on the verdict. The fund told clients on Dec. 6 it will
shut after the FBI raided its offices two years ago, prompting
investors to flee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ford Loses Bid for $445 Million in Interest on Income Taxes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. (F) can&#8217;t collect $445 million in interest on
overpayment of income taxes, an appeals court ruled, saying the
Internal Revenue Service didn&#8217;t improperly calculate what the
company was owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford sued the U.S. in 2008, claiming that the government
shortchanged the auto company on interest accrued on overpayment
of corporate income taxes. A federal judge in Detroit rejected
Ford&#8217;s claim in 2010, agreeing with the government that the U.S.
had correctly calculated the interest Ford was due on the
overpayment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati to
overturn the decision, contending that U.S. revenue procedure
required interest to accrue from the time the company deposited
money with the Internal Revenue Service. The appeals court
yesterday ruled that revenue procedure couldn&#8217;t be used to
support the company&#8217;s argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Cooney, Ford spokesman, declined to comment immediately
on the court&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ford Motor Co. v U.S., 10-1934, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s policy changes for its Internet products including Hotmail and Bing are being formally examined by European data protection regulators for potential privacy issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Updates to Microsoft&#8217;s services agreement, which took effect Oct. 19, are being formally reviewed, EU privacy regulators wrote to Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer and the head of Microsoft Luxembourg. Luxembourg&#8217;s and France&#8217;s data protection commissions are leading the examination, according to the Dec. 17 letter, obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the wide range of services you offer, and popularity of these services, changes in your Services Agreement and the linked Privacy Policy may affect many individuals in most or all of the EU member states,&#8221; wrote Jacob Kohnstamm, who leads the association of EU data protection commissioners. They &#8220;decided to check the possible consequences for the protection of the personal data of these individuals in a coordinated procedure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The review will verify whether the changes could entail new risks for users&#8217; privacy. The examination is also checking whether Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft&#8217;s privacy policy meets European standards on notifying users and allowing them a choice of services, Gerard Lommel, head of the Luxembourg privacy regulator, said in an interview in October. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Privacy Policy &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In updating the Microsoft Services Agreement we did not change our privacy policy,&#8221; said Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels. &#8220;We are confident they will find Microsoft&#8217;s long-standing commitment to privacy has not changed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 27 EU data protection regulators, who work together in the so-called Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, urged Google Inc. to address concerns about its privacy policy in October following a review of changes implemented this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data protection is currently policed by separate regulators across the EU. As part of an overhaul of the union&#8217;s 17-year-old rules on the issue, its executive body wants to simplify the system so companies deal with only one regulator in the region. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Pablo Gonzalez and Rodrigo Orihuela" date="Dec 19, 2012  3:42 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-19/chevron-ypf-sign-venture-to-develop-argentine-shale-oil.html"><headline>Chevron, YPF Sign Venture to Develop Argentine Shale Oil</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) signed a deal with YPF
SA, (YPFD) Argentina&#8217;s largest energy company, which paves the way for
it to become the first major oil company to partner with the
Buenos Aires-based producer since its nationalization in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the agreement signed today by Miguel Galuccio,
chief executive officer of YPF, and Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s head
of Latin America, Middle East and Africa, the San Ramon,
California-based company gets an exclusive right for four months
to negotiate final terms for YPF to transfer a 50 percent
interest in Loma de la Lata Norte and Loma Campana, YPF said in
an SEC filing. The fields comprise an area of 290 square
kilometers (180 miles) in southwestern Argentina, YPF said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron is committed to make the expenditures in
accordance with a development program, for an estimated 100
wells, in these areas during a 12-month period,&#8221; YPF said in
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot program in Neuquen Province would cost $1 billion
and may eventually expand to an estimated 2,000 wells at a
pricetag of about $15 billion,Galuccio said in a
videoconference from Houston withMoshiri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies plan to identify additional exploration
blocks in an estimated 600-square kilometer area, where Chevron
will pay for the investments, YPF said in the filing. In
exchange, YPF said it will give Chevron 50 percent interest in
the blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Irrelevant&#8217; Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final agreement, if signed, will be the first YPF
reaches with a foreign oil company to invest in Argentina since
the government nationalized 51 percent of the company by seizing
shares from Repsol SA (REP) in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Chevron and YPF signed a memorandum of
understanding, the first step toward a development partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol, based in Madrid, filed a complaint Dec. 4 in a
federal court in Manhattan accusing Chevron of improperly
obtaining rights to develop Argentine shale and natural gas
resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol&#8217;s lawsuit against Chevron for partnering with YPF is
&#8220;irrelevant,&#8221; Moshiri said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is to start as soon as possible and the only
thing we need is to push our teams to put a definitive agreement
together as soon as possible,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dead Cow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta, which means &#8220;dead cow&#8221; in Spanish, holds at
least 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to a
report by independent auditor Ryder Scott released in February
by YPF. Argentina holds the world&#8217;s third-largest shale gas
reserves, according to US Energy Administration data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galuccio said the signing of the preliminary deal marks &#8220;a
very important day for YPF.&#8221; In August, he said that to boost
output YPF needs to invest $37.2 billion in the next five years,
$2.5 billion of which is to come from strategic partners, $5
billion from bond sales and bank loans, while the remainder
should come from its own cashflow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer, on a swing through Taiwan this month,
made time to meet with Peter Chou, his counterpart at HTC Corp. (2498) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Chou&#8217;s agenda: the low screen resolution that prompted
HTC to scrap plans for a bigger smartphone using Microsoft&#8217;s
mobile software, a person familiar with the matter said this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer needs to stay on Chou&#8217;s good side. HTC could help
his company vie with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) in the 718-
million-unit smartphone market, where, according to researcher
IDC, Microsoft has only a 2.6 percent share. After trying to
gain ground for a decade without success, Microsoft needs HTC --
which has drawn praise for its current Windows devices -- to
help it win over consumers with a hit product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HTC is important to Microsoft because they put together
one beautiful smartphone and when you have that kind of DNA, you
have a company that can boost general acceptance and market
share,&#8221; said Ramon Llamas, an analyst at IDC. &#8220;If you want
bigger market share, getting multiple vendors is the name of the
game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also relying on Nokia, which became the lead 
Windows partner last year through a multibillion-dollar 
marketing agreement, to expand in smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen ties to HTC, Ballmer and Chou meet in person
a few times a year and exchange phone calls and e-mails
frequently, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
It helps that Taoyuan City, Taiwan-based HTC runs its U.S.
operations out of Bellevue, Washington, a Seattle suburb next
door to Redmond, where Microsoft is based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HTC Struggles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other evidence of the closer cooperation between HTC and
Microsoft, the HTC 8X is shown in about 70 percent of
Microsoft&#8217;s advertising highlighting a specific phone, said
Jason Mackenzie, HTC&#8217;s president for global sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies need a hit. Microsoft, two years after
completely overhauling its mobile software, risks being shut out
of the growing market by smartphones based on Google&#8217;s Android
software and Apple&#8217;s iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC, which also makes Android phones, in October forecast
its lowest sales in 11 quarters as it loses Android customers to
Samsung Electronics Co. HTC had a 4.7 percent share of the
global smartphone market in the third quarter, IDC said, down
from a peak of 10.7 percent in the second quarter of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung dominated the Android market with 41 percent share
of those phones in the third quarter, IDC&#8217;s Llamas said. HTC,
with 5.5 percent, is in a battle for the No. 2 spot with seven
other vendors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android Dependence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC can&#8217;t afford to lose further ground. Chou decided to
scrap plans for a large-screen Windows smartphone because a low-
resolution version wouldn&#8217;t have been competitive, a person
familiar with the project said this week. That left HTC with
only Android for phones measuring larger than 5 inches
diagonally, and fewer products to claw back share from Samsung,
which offers Galaxy Note devices with bigger screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows Phone is very much a blue ocean -- there&#8217;s no
dominant player,&#8221; Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner
Inc., said in an interview. &#8220;The opportunity for HTC to become
the flagship device would give them a chance to not be as
dependent on Android.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, since HTC released the new Windows-based phones last
month, its monthly revenue has increased. Sales in November
jumped 23 percent from October, ending a four-month revenue
decline. HTC is on track to meet its fourth-quarter sales
forecasts, in part because of demand for new models such as the
Windows Phones, Jasmine Lu, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote
in a Dec. 10 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Go Big&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Microsoft and HTC goes back at
least a decade. HTC made the first-ever smartphone with Windows
in 2002. It also made the first phone showcasing the Android
operating system, and for the past several years, HTC has
devoted almost all of its marketing and its best designs to the
software made by Microsoft rival Google, said Mackenzie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We just weren&#8217;t promoting it,&#8221; Mackenzie said of Windows
Phone. &#8220;We just didn&#8217;t see the opportunity to get massive
sales. What changed is with Windows Phone 8, we saw a massive
opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ties between the companies got a restart in February, when
Mackenzie and Chou met in Barcelona with Ballmer and Microsoft
Windows Phone chief Terry Myerson. Ballmer urged HTC to &#8220;go
big&#8221; on using Windows Phone, Mackenzie said. HTC came prepared,
walking into the meeting with prototypes that, for the first
time in years, reflected high-quality design work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Ballmer&#8217;s Phone&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were devices that were going to be unique to Windows
Phone,&#8221; Myerson said. &#8220;I remember thinking they were beautiful
devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers from both companies soon began meeting weekly if
not more frequently, and officials jointly started pitching
wireless carriers on selling the devices, Myerson said. HTC also
opted to use the Windows Phone brand in the name of its products
-- something Nokia (NOK1V) hasn&#8217;t done with its Lumia lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Myerson even found himself dragged up on stage
by HTC&#8217;s Chou to sing karaoke at the W Hotel in Taipei in June,
at a dinner celebrating the company&#8217;s 15th anniversary dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC has been rewarded for its efforts. When Microsoft
decided to show &#8220;Ballmer&#8217;s phone&#8221; at an October event to
unveil Windows Phone 8, it was a red HTC 8X with tiles showing
updates from Ballmer&#8217;s wife, Connie, as well as Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nokia Ties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft and HTC forge closer ties, at least one
company that stands to lose is Nokia. Through last year&#8217;s deal,
Nokia switched its smartphones to Windows in exchange for
marketing and development funds. That agreement was crafted by
Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a former Microsoft executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which posted six straight quarterly losses totaling
$6.3 billion since the move to Windows, said its relationship
with Microsoft has enabled &#8220;Nokia to offer truly differentiated
products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view Android and Apple as our primary competition,&#8221;
said Doug Dawson, a spokesman for Nokia. &#8220;As such, we welcome
the momentum behind the Windows Phone ecosystem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Mackenzie says the bulk of Microsoft&#8217;s ads that
focus on just one handset will feature the 8X, including a
recent spot with musician Gwen Stefani showing her HTC phone.
The smartphone has received several positive reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 8X is a cutting-edge phone in virtually every way
except maybe capacity,&#8221; said Gartner&#8217;s Gartenberg. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
thin and light device. The Nokia 920 has a lot of high-end

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) will shut a fluid
catalytic cracker at the Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery in
February for maintenance, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alkylation unit will also be shut during the work, which
is scheduled to begin Feb. 24 and last about a month, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information

&lt;p&gt;BackOffice Associates LLC, a
provider of data-management software and services, bought out
its founders today as an early step toward holding an initial
public offering, said Chief Executive Officer David Booth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Harwich, Massachusetts-based company, which is
backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), bought out founders Tom and
Patricia Kennedy today for an undisclosed sum, obtained through
a loan from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Booth said in an
interview. The buyback leaves Goldman Sachs with controlling
interest in the company, which is also owned by management and
employees, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyout brings BackOffice closer to its goal of going
public in 12 to 18 months, according to Booth. Web-data analysis
provider Splunk Inc. (SPLK) has surged 73 percent since it went public
in April, while Workday Inc. (WDAY), a maker of human resource
applications, has almost doubled since its October debut,
reflecting robust investor demand for software companies that
cater to business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is not as vibrant as it was two years ago, but
there&#8217;s still a lot of interest in quality firms,&#8221; Booth said.
&#8220;We now have a simplified ownership structure. It will help
accelerate the continued move toward going public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BackOffice is discussing hiring Goldman Sachs, as well as
other banks, to handle its IPO, Booth said. The company plans to
use proceeds to pay back the new loan, as well as to expand
globally, particularly by adding staff in Latin America, Booth
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global market for data management software will grow 21
percent to $1.9 billion this year, according to estimates by
researcher Gartner Inc. Other companies competing for this
market include Informatica Corp. (INFA), Talend Inc., Utopia Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. BackOffice recently added
to its lineup by becoming a reseller for products from software
maker SAP AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BackOffice is &#8220;highly&#8221; profitable, and has annual sales
of $100 million to $200 million, Booth said in May. Revenue
growth is in double-digits, he said then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to acquire online coupon site Bloomspot Inc. for $35 million as it seeks to offer credit card holders more discounts to local shops, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal will bring Bloomspot&#8217;s technology and about 100 employees into the credit card unit, Bloomspot Chief Executive Officer Jasper Malcolmson said in the memo, which was e-mailed to investors. Closely held Bloomspot, which competes with Web- coupon leader Groupon Inc. (GRPN), sells online discounts to luxury spas, high-end restaurants and weekend getaways. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s consumer division is working to build loyalty in customers by letting them redeem discounts similar to those offered by Groupon. The deal comes amid slumping demand for Internet coupons, as Groupon&#8217;s stock has plummeted 76 percent this year and LivingSocial Inc., the second-biggest provider of online daily deals, has announced plans to cut jobs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the sale to JPMorgan, investors in Bloomspot will receive a 67 percent return of invested capital, Malcolmson wrote in the e-mail. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are disappointed that the deal is not generating a positive return for our investors, given alternatives, we believe this is a good outcome for our equity investors,&#8221; Malcolmson wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Venture Investments &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bloomspot, based in San Francisco, has raised more than $40 million from investors including venture capital firms True Ventures, Menlo Ventures and Columbia Capital. In August 2011, it received $35 million in financing from several venture firms and $5 million of venture debt from Western Technology Investment, according to a statement last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Bank of America Corp. introduced online and mobile cash-back deals in the U.S., giving customers discounts after they visited stores including Aeropostale Inc. and The Body Shop Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;American Express Co., whose finance chief Daniel Henry sits on Groupon&#8217;s board, has partnered with mobile location service Foursquare Labs Inc. to deliver coupons to customers at stores where they have checked in with the application. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lily Shen, chief marketing officer at Bloomspot, didn&#8217;t respond to a voicemail seeking comment. Paul Hartwick, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dow Jones earlier reported the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Andrew MacAskill and Bibhudatta Pradhan" date="Dec 20, 2012  8:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-20/india-s-modi-bolsters-bid-to-lead-bjp-with-gujarat-congress-rout.html"><headline>Modi Bolsters Bid to Lead BJP With Crushing Gujarat Victory</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi won a third
consecutive term as chief minister of the Indian state of
Gujarat, strengthening his bid to lead the main opposition party
into parliamentary polls in just over a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party won 115 of the total 182
seats in the provincial assembly, routing the Congress party
which heads the federal government in a two-stage vote that
ended earlier this week, according to the Election Commission of
India. Modi, 62, needs to tighten his grip over the state he&#8217;s
ruled for 11 years to help counter concern in his party that
anti-Muslim riots a decade ago make him incapable of wooing
allies ahead of the national campaign due by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The focus is solely on Modi&#8217;s performance as he seeks to
rehabilitate his image and build a platform to become prime
minister,&#8221; said N. Bhaskara Rao, chairman of the New Delhi-
based Centre for Media Studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s administration
struggling to reassert its reform credentials, and beset by
economic growth slowing to a decade&#8217;s low, Modi&#8217;s government has
been hailed by Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata, and billionaire
Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL), both of
which have investments in Gujarat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surplus Power &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s economy has grown an annual 10.2 percent on
average over the last decade, against 7.8 percent for the
national economy. Under Modi, Gujarat has raised power
generation capacity more than fivefold, while his government
says it is the only state in India to have surplus electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party colleagues, whose seniority makes them prospective
candidates for the nation&#8217;s top office, have praised Modi and
said he is qualified to lead the country. The Hindu nationalist
BJP last led the national government from 1998 to 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi won 117 seats five years ago, just short of a two-
thirds majority in the local assembly. In today&#8217;s count, Prime
Minister Singh&#8217;s Congress party won 61 seats, the commission
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, in the foothills
of the Himalayas, in another other vote counted today, Congress
ousted the ruling BJP government, winning 36 out of 68 seats,
according to the election commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Congress has not done as badly as some would have
feared,&#8221; said A.K. Verma, a political analyst at Christ Church
College in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, India&#8217;s most-populous state.
&#8220;Given all the scams and the unpopularity of some of their
policies, they will be given some hope from these results as
they prepare for the general elections.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stalled Legislation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years of corruption allegations against 80-year-old
Singh&#8217;s officials and ministers, the government&#8217;s inability to
curb inflation and coalition infighting over his proposals to
further open the economy to foreign investment have triggered
street protests and stalled legislation in parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been no major survey of probable voter
preferences since Singh in September began a reform drive to
overhaul the economy. A poll published in August by Nielsen
Holdings NV (NLSN) and India Today magazine forecast that his Congress
party alliance would win 181 seats, 78 fewer than it secured in
the May 2009 election. The BJP bloc of parties may win as many
as 205. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation, Slowdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s $1.8 trillion economy is set to expand 5.7 percent
to 5.9 percent in the year to March 31, according to the finance
ministry, the least in a decade. Inflation has stayed above 7
percent in all but one of the last 11 months this year, above
the central bank&#8217;s comfort level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh unveiled his reforms drive to kick start growth after
almost 24 months of legislative paralysis, and it included moves
to allow foreign investment in multibrand retail outlets,
insurance companies and in pension firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi topped a poll of preferred leaders by the India Today
magazine in March, with 24 percent favoring him to be India&#8217;s
next premier. Congress&#8217; Rahul Gandhi came second with 17
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opinion poll carried out for News 24 Today Chanakya, a
Hindi language TV channel, released earlier this week predicted
that the BJP may win as many 140 seats in Gujarat, or 77 percent
of those available. The margin of error was 11 seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rioting Mobs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after today&#8217;s victory, allegations that Modi failed to
stop rampaging Hindu mobs as they burned their way through
neighborhoods in 2002 may still threaten his emergence as a
national leader. The violence left more than 1,000 people dead,
most of them Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carnage, which left Modi barred from the U.S. and some
European nations, followed the killing of Hindu activists in a
train fire, a blaze for which Muslims were later found guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Supreme Court-appointed panel investigating one
documented incident found no evidence that Modi took decisions
to prevent assistance from reaching those being attacked. Maya
Kodnani, a former Modi aide, was jailed in August for her role
in the murder of 97 people in a suburb of Ahmedabad, Gujarat&#8217;s
biggest city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi&#8217;s administration said it did its best to maintain law
and order during the rioting. Modi hasn&#8217;t apologized for the
riots, saying &#8220;one only has to ask for forgiveness if one is
guilty of a crime,&#8221; in an interview with the Wall Street
Journal this year, according to the paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, has signaled
he&#8217;ll quit the BJP-led opposition bloc if Modi becomes its face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gujarat&#8217;s achievements in improving basic services have
been less impressive, according to an India Today survey last
month. It ranks 12th out of the largest 20 provinces in
improvements to its education system and 9th in health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, with about 5 percent of India&#8217;s population,
Gujarat generates 22 percent of its exports and 11.5 percent of
the country&#8217;s manufacturing, state government data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) faces possible
European Union fines as soon as next month over its failure to
comply with a settlement to give users a choice of web browsers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are close to a decision which would be &#8220;one of
the first in 2013,&#8221; Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s antitrust chief,
told reporters at a European Commission press conference in
Brussels today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker was sent EU antitrust
objections in October, a preliminary step before being punished
for failing to abide by a promise to show a browser-choice
screen to users of its Windows operating system. The company was
also warned to modify how it presents its Internet Explorer
browser in Windows 8 to avert another antitrust clash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already been fined 1.68 billion euros ($2.23
billion) in EU antitrust probes, including an 899 million-euro
penalty for failing to obey an order to share data with
competitors. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed in
2009 to offer access to rival browsers as a part of a settlement
to repair its relationship with the bloc&#8217;s regulators. It told
regulators last December that it was complying with its
commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, declined
to comment on Almunia&#8217;s remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia didn&#8217;t mention possible penalties, which can be as
high as 10 percent of yearly sales for breaching an antitrust
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Explorer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of Microsoft&#8217;s 2009 pledge, consumers who
buy personal computers were given a choice of the 12 most widely
used browsers to install in addition to, or instead of,
Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in July it only learned that month that it
didn&#8217;t offer its browser choice software to some 28 million
computers running Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the
computers that should have received it. It distributed a
software fix to computers that were affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any fines for Microsoft may take into account repeat
offenses, Almunia said in July in a reference to the EU&#8217;s 2008
penalty for the company&#8217;s failure to obey an earlier EU
decision. That ruling also ordered it to provide information to
software developers to make compatible products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halozyme Therapeutics Inc. (HALO), a
developer of drug-delivery systems, jumped the most in six years
after announcing a collaboration with Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to develop as
many as six injectable medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halozyme rose 27 percent to $7.01 at the close in New York,
its largest single-day increase since December 2006. The deal
includes an $8 million payment to Halozyme, future fees that may
reach $507 million and the potential for royalties based on
sales of licensed products, the San Diego-based company said in
a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halozyme, which had $56.1 million in sales last year, uses
human enzymes to modify biotechnology medicines so they can be
administered through an injection, rather than intravenously.
The agreement includes a license to develop two specific
treatments and the right for Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, to choose as many as four other targets, according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal &#8220;has the potential to enhance Pfizer&#8217;s ability to
optimize treatments for patients,&#8221; Jose Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos,
a senior vice president at New York-based Pfizer, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What this does is just expand the universe of when people
think about how this technology can be used for biologics,&#8221;
Gregory Frost, Halozyme&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in an
interview. &#8220;On the partnership side, this certainly warms
things up, but I think folks have had a lot of interest in the
pharma space for our technology in general.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halozyme had fallen 42 percent this year through yesterday
as U.S. regulators rejected an immune-deficiency treatment the
company developed with Baxter International Inc. (BAX) and halted a
study involving the therapy in collaboration with ViroPharma
Inc. (VPHM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 1.4 percent to $25.08. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Dec. 21 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co. named David Owen to be chief financial officer of the firm&#8217;s consumer and
community banking unit, after predecessor Marianne Lake was
promoted as part of a management overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owen, who joined the company in 2011 as CFO of the consumer
bank, will also become a member of the firmwide management team,
the New York-based lender said today in a statement. Lake was
selected last month to become the company&#8217;s CFO in the first
quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owen previously worked for Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s consumer division. He is a graduate of
the U.S. Army Airborne School. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will be the
target of a regulatory enforcement order stemming from mistakes
that led to at least $6.2 billion in trading losses, according
to a person briefed on the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is preparing
to issue a cease-and-desist order requiring the largest U.S.
bank to fix internal risk controls that contributed to its
wrong-way bet on credit derivatives, according to the person,
who asked not to be named because the discussions aren&#8217;t public.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said in May that the
firm&#8217;s strategy was beset by &#8220;errors, sloppiness and bad
judgment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the enforcement is uncertain, the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, and Bryan Hubbard,
an OCC spokesman, declined to comment on any potential
enforcement actions, reported yesterday by the Wall Street
Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faulty trades within the bank&#8217;s chief investment office
-- associated with London-based trader Bruno Iksil, widely known
as the London Whale -- may eventually cost more than $6.2
billion, Dimon has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investment office within JPMorgan&#8217;s national bank
suffered from &#8220;inadequate risk management, Comptroller of the
Currency Thomas Curry said during U.S. Senate testimony in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., (DIS) the world&#8217;s largest
entertainment company, won an appeals court ruling that protects
its trademark rights to the Winnie-the-Pooh characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was correct to throw
out challenges to the trademark ownership filed by Stephen
Slesinger Inc., which has waged a decades-long battle with
Disney over ownership of the Pooh characters, an appeals court
in Washington said today. Slesinger had already litigated the
issue and lost in district court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit said in an opinion posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.A. Milne, who wrote the Pooh books, transferred
merchandising rights to Stephen Slesinger in 1930, and his widow
licensed the rights to Disney in 1961. The Slesinger company and
Disney have been fighting in court over royalties since at least
1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal court ruled that Slesinger had
transferred all of its rights in the Pooh works to Burbank,
California-based Disney. The Federal Circuit today said that,
based on that 2009 ruling, the trademark office was right to bar
Slesinger from seeking to cancel the Disney trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell $1.08, or 2.1 percent, to $49.85 at 12:28 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
risen almost 33 percent so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signa Holding, a property investor
managed by Austrian Rene Benko, agreed to buy 17 German
department stores, including the country&#8217;s largest, for 1.1
billion euros ($1.45 billion) from investors that include
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stores are leased to retailer Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH
and the transaction will be completed next year, Richard Speich,
a spokesman for the investment group called Highstreet that&#8217;s
selling the stores, said today. The biggest of the 17 properties
is the historic KaDeWe store in Berlin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies outside of Germany are buying real estate in the
country&#8217;s large cities to gain safer investments as the euro

of 2012 rose 13 percent in Berlin and 7 percent in Cologne,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, won a U.K. ruling invalidating Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s patent protection for technology synchronizing
message statuses across multiple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 patent owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility
unit shouldn&#8217;t have been issued because the technology was
obvious to experts in the field at the time, Judge Richard Arnold said in a decision in London today. A week-long trial
ended earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The patent is invalid and should be revoked,&#8221; Arnold
said during a 30-second hearing. Both companies had received the
written judgment in advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are locked in legal battles over patents for
smartphone technology and Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox gaming software in
the U.S. and Germany. Microsoft claims all devices that run on
Google&#8217;s Android operating system use its technology and is
seeking royalties from Motorola Mobility, which Mountain View,
California-based Google acquired in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, filed the lawsuit
against Motorola Mobility in London a year ago in a pre-emptive
bid to invalidate the patent before it could be sued for
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;German Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is running parallel to Motorola&#8217;s lawsuit against
Microsoft over the same patent in Germany, where the companies
are awaiting a decision. Google has said it bought Motorola
Mobility in part because of its patents and history of
innovation in mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) won European Union
approval to buy George Lucas&#8217;s Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4.05 billion
in cash and stock, combining two of Hollywood&#8217;s most lucrative
film franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
said overlaps were &#8220;very limited&#8221; for the two companies&#8217;
activities in home entertainment, gaming software, film
production and distribution and licensing for both broadcast
rights and merchandise, according to an e-mailed statement
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission therefore concluded that the transaction
would not significantly impede effective competition&#8221; in
Europe, the Brussels-based authority said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, announced in October, will add &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; and
&#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; to Disney&#8217;s roster of film hits including
&#8220;The Avengers&#8221; and &#8220;Finding Nemo.&#8221; The &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; films
have generated $4.54 billion in worldwide ticket sales, second
to Warner Bros.&#8217; &#8220;Harry Potter,&#8221; according to Box Office Mojo.
&#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; pictures have collected $1.95 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition complements Disney Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger&#8217;s focus on sequels and film franchises, fitting the
same profile as its purchase of Marvel three years ago. Disney
paid a combined $11 billion for Pixar and Marvel in the past
decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas, 68, the sole owner of Lucasfilm, will receive half
of the purchase price in cash and the balance in stock, becoming
a major investor in the film, theme-park and TV company,
according to an Oct. 31 statement from Burbank, California-based
Disney. Lucas will receive about 40 million Disney shares,
becoming the second-largest non-institutional shareholder with
about 2.2 percent of the company, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The largest is the trust of late Apple Inc. co-founder
Steve Jobs, who sold Pixar to Disney in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. agreed to sell its
Motorola Home business to Arris Group Inc. (ARRS) for $2.35 billion,
finding a buyer for a division that sells television set-top
boxes while it focuses on expanding in smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arris, a cable-equipment maker, will pay about $2.05
billion in cash and about $300 million in newly issued shares
that will give Google a stake of about 15.7 percent, the
companies said in a Dec. 19 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which acquired the division through the $12.5
billion purchase of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. in May,
received multiple offers on Dec. 7, a person with knowledge of
the matter said earlier this month. Google sought a buyer for
the home unit as it aims to devote more attention to mobile
devices amid an accelerating rivalry with Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Google never really wanted the set-top box business,&#8221;
Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group in Portland,
Oregon, said in an interview. &#8220;What they wanted were the mobile
patents. It was very clear this wasn&#8217;t why they were buying the
business in the first place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pace Plc (PIC), a U.K. maker of set-top boxes and a suitor of the
assets, said in a statement that it was unable to reach an
agreement with Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding Motorola Home helps Arris more than triple sales, on
a pro-forma basis, to about $4.7 billion for the year that ended
Sept. 30, according to the statement. The company will have
about 2,000 patents after the acquisition, Arris said in a
presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement also includes provisions to cap potential
liability for intellectual-property infringement. Digital-video
recording company TiVo Inc. (TIVO) is suing Motorola Mobility and Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO) over use of recording technology in the set-top
boxes they make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement gives Arris patents in areas such as video
processing and digital-rights management, plus the right to
license additional intellectual property from Motorola Mobility,
Arris Chief Executive Officer Bob Stanzione said. Arris sees an
opportunity to sell new equipment to customers whose home cable-
TV sets don&#8217;t support Internet-video delivery, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Samsung Faces EU Antitrust Complaint Over Apple Patent Clash &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) faces a European Union antitrust
complaint over its use of standard-essential patents in legal
disputes with Apple Inc., the EU&#8217;s competition commissioner
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will adopt the statement of objections very soon,&#8221;
Joaquin Almunia, the bloc&#8217;s antitrust chief, said at a press
conference in Brussels yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung and Apple, the world&#8217;s two biggest smartphone
makers, have traded victories in their patent disputes fought
over four continents since Apple accused Asia&#8217;s biggest
electronics maker of &#8220;slavishly copying&#8221; its devices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While regulators were &#8220;happy&#8221; with Samsung&#8217;s announcement
this week that it will withdraw injunctions in Europe that seek
to block sales of Apple products, Almunia said the commission
will continue to investigate whether Samsung&#8217;s threats to use
legal action harmed competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are dissatisfied every time that we see the launching
of injunctions&#8221; involving standard-essential patents,&#8217;&#8217; Almunia
told reporters at a press conference in Brussels. &#8220;The
injunctions in the Apple-Samsung case were launched; it was not
only a threat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea &#8220;is fully cooperating
with the European Commission proceedings,&#8221; according to an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company earlier this week said it would withdraw
injunction requests against Apple in Germany, U.K., France,
Italy and Netherlands involving key patents it holds for
wireless communications, citing &#8220;the interest of protecting
consumer choice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will continue litigation that seeks damages in
intellectual property disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under phone industry agreements on standards, companies
owning the rights to essential technology must usually license
it to competitors on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms, known as FRAND. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. is also being
investigated by the EU for seeking and enforcing injunctions
against Apple&#8217;s iPhone and iPad and Microsoft&#8217;s Windows
operating system and Xbox gaming console, following complaints
by the two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent disputes began when Samsung released its Galaxy
smartphones in 2010. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs vowed before
his death last year to wage &#8220;thermonuclear war&#8221; to prove that
phones run on Google&#8217;s Android operating system copy the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symantec Wins Federal Jury Verdict Over Finjan Patent Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symantec Corp. (SYMC), the world&#8217;s biggest maker of security
software, won&#8217;t have to pay Finjan Inc. any royalties after a
federal jury decided Symantec didn&#8217;t infringe two patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury of three men and three women deliberated about
four hours following a three-week trial before also deciding
yesterday that the Finjan patents 6,092,194 and 6,480,962 aren&#8217;t
valid because the technology isn&#8217;t new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symantec &#8220;didn&#8217;t need Finjan&#8217;s technology,&#8221; said attorney
David Nelson, representing the company. &#8220;We already had it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998 and 1999, the two software makers discussed a
potential merger, Nelson said. Symantec chose not to pursue the
transaction because it had already developed its own innovative
software, according to the lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Symantec respects and agrees with the jury&#8217;s findings,&#8221;
Cris Paden, a spokesman for Mountain View, California-based
Symantec, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Symantec takes its
ability to innovate technology solutions very seriously&#8221; and
will defend itself if Finjan appeals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finjan, with offices in San Jose, California, and Netanya,
Israel, sued Symantec as well as Websense Inc. (WBSN) and Sophos Inc.
in 2010 over patents for protecting computers and networks from
&#8220;hostile downloadables,&#8221; according to court papers. The jury
also ruled in favor of Websense and Sophos, saying they didn&#8217;t
infringe, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Andre, a lawyer representing Finjan, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Finjan v. Symantec, 10-cv-593, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Haribo Wins Dispute With Lindt Over Foil-Wrapped Bear, AP Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haribo GmbH of Bonn, Germany, persuaded a regional court in
Germany that its &#8220;Goldbaer&#8221; (Gold Bear) trademark was
infringed by Lindt  Spruengli AG (LISN), Associated Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Gummy Bear candies had objected to Lindt&#8217;s
sale of a gold foil-wrapped chocolate bear, even though it was
called &#8220;Lindt Teddy,&#8221; according to AP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said that people would naturally refer to the
Lindt chocolate bear as &#8220;Gold Bear,&#8221; and infringe the Haribo
marks, AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindt, based in Kilchberg, Switzerland, has argued that no
one would mistake its product for the well-known gummy bears,
and that its packaging for the chocolate bear was akin to what
it used with its chocolate bunnies at Easter, according to the
wire service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NZ Chain&#8217;s &#8216;MacGowans&#8217; Registration Barred, Dominion Post Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mill LiquorSave, a New Zealand chain of discount liquor
stores, lost its bid to register &#8220;MacGowans&#8221; as a trademark
for whisky-flavored spirit, New Zealand&#8217;s Dominion Post
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scotch Whisky Association had opposed issuance of the
mark, claiming consumers could be fooled into thinking that the
product was real Scotch whisky, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Stephen Kos of the High Court of Wellington said in
his ruling that &#8220;MacGowans&#8221; wasn&#8217;t even capable of being
labeled as &#8220;spirits&#8221; because it was only 13.9 percent alcohol,
well below the 37 percent requirement for a product to be
designated spirits in that country, the Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brenda Kelly of the liquor chain told the court the product
wasn&#8217;t whisky, &#8220;a spirit or a wine,&#8221; even though the trademark
application had specified the mark would be used for a &#8220;whisky-
flavored spirit,&#8221; according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Psychic Carmen Harra Sued by Fred Fontana Over Biopic Screenplay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmen Harra, a self-described &#8220;intuitive psychic&#8221; who
has appeared on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Today Show,&#8221; was sued for copyright
infringement by a California screenwriter/producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred Fontana, who wrote &#8220;Florida Road&#8221; and produced the
independent film &#8220;Girl&#8217;s Best Friend,&#8221; is involved in a
dispute with Harra over a screenplay based on the psychic&#8217;s
life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed in federal court in Los
Angeles, Harra hired Fontana in December 2011 to rewrite
&#8220;Decoding Her Destiny: The Carmen Harra Story.&#8221; He said the
understanding was that he would receive a $13,000 advance, with
the balance of his fee to be paid out of the first money
investors put into the film. He was also to be employed as co-
producer, he said in his pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that investors have put money into the
film, Fontana said he hasn&#8217;t been paid any more money, even
though he has finished completely rewriting the screenplay and
has &#8220;performed a substantial amount of production work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said in the complaint that although Harra doesn&#8217;t own
his script, she has been attending film festivals and shopping
the screenplay to potential investors, producers and other
members of the entertainment industry without his authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fontana is the registered owner of the copyright to the
screenplay, according to a copyright registration certificate
filed along with the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked the court for at least $2 million in damages,
together with all profits derived from the alleged infringement
of his copyright. Additionally, he seeks $2 million for alleged
trademark infringement, and another $2 million each for claims
of breach of contract, breach of oral contract and fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fontana asked the court to declare him the owner of the
copyright and to bar further unauthorized use of his screenplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harra didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fontana v. Harra, 2:12-cv-10708, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full Public Release of EPA Report on Exxon Mobil Plant Unlikely &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details of an Environmental Protection Agency
inspection of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s facilities in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, are unlikely to be released to a New Orleans-based
environmental watchdog group because of trade-secret concerns,
New Orleans Times-Picayune reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Bucket Brigade had requested the details of
the inspection following a leak in June of naptha at the plant,
a petroleum byproduct with more than 31,000 pounds of the
carcinogen benzene, according to the Times-Picayune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Gottesman of the EPA said a full version of the
report is protected as confidential business information,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil spokeswoman Stephanie Cargile told the Times-
Picayune that &#8220;internal safety incidents are evaluated, an
appropriate team is selected to conduct the investigation, and
recommendations are followed up on until resolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A petition on the White House
website seeking to extend travel restrictions to Russian
lawmakers who proposed to ban the adoption of Russian orphans in
the U.S. surpassed 25,000 signatures, triggering a review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s lower house of parliament, the Duma, proposed the
adoption ban in retaliation for a law approved by Congress this
month that imposes a visa ban and asset freeze on Russian
officials suspected of involvement in the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and other human-rights abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnitsky, a Russian tax attorney, died in 2009 in a Moscow
prison after saying he was abused and denied medical care to
force him to withdraw allegations of a $230 million tax fraud by
officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web petition to U.S. President Barack Obama&#8217;s
administration called the Magnitsky law &#8220;a profoundly pro-
Russian step&#8221; in battling corruption and expressed outrage over
the Duma proposal, which will &#8220;jeopardize the lives and
wellbeing&#8221; of orphans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House will review any petition made on its
website that gains more than 25,000 e-signatures in less than 30
days, according to the site. The petition, created on Dec. 21 by
an Alexander V, has had more than 34,000 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in the
proposed Kitimat liquefied natural gas terminal from Encana
Corp. (ECA) and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG), joining the competition to ship
the fuel from North America to Asian markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will also acquire 50 percent of a pipeline serving
the Canadian project and drilling rights for 644,000 acres in
British Columbia&#8217;s Horn River and Liard basins, according to a
statement from the San Ramon, California-based company today. It
will operate the LNG terminal and pipeline, and project partner
Apache Corp. (APA) will handle the acreage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron joins Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Malaysia&#8217;s
Petroliam Nasional Bhd in pursuing gas exports from western
Canada to Asian markets, where the heating and power plant fuel
sells at a premium to North American prices. The Kitimat project
has a license from Canadian regulators to export 10 million
metric tons a year of the liquefied fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The involvement by Chevron in Kitimat LNG &#8220;elevates the
probability of this project going ahead and expedites the
timeframe,&#8221; said Daniel Cheng, a portfolio manager who helps
oversee C$375 million ($378 million) at Matco Financial Inc. in
Calgary, including Encana and EOG shares. &#8220;The partners in that
project were stalling because they were having a hard time
securing long-term, oil-linked price customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will probably pay a total of $1.3 billion, William Featherston, an analyst for UBS AG in New York, wrote in a note
today. All of the companies involved declined to provide terms
of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LNG Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steven Farris
estimated in March the Kitimat project would cost $15 billion,
including the terminal, pipeline and investment in related
drilling wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of building LNG terminals, which chill gas to -260
degrees Fahrenheit (-160 Celsius) to make it a liquid that can
be shipped on tankers, has surged in recent years as competition
for materials and workers has increased, James T. Jensen,
president of Jensen Associates, said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache is still completing the design process that will
help develop cost estimates, Paul Wyke, a spokesman for the
Houston-based company, said in an e-mail today. Chevron hasn&#8217;t
set a schedule for a final investment decision on the projects
or for when exports will begin, Gareth Johnstone, a company
spokesman, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and Apache are already partners in the Wheatstone
LNG export project in Australia. Chevron also is developing the
Gorgon LNG project in Australia, an effort that may cost as much
as A$52 billion ($54 billion) and begin first shipments in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Australian Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The British Columbia projects are trying very hard to
compete with Australia,&#8221; Jensen said. &#8220;The fact that Chevron
is getting in suggests that they&#8217;ve found it interesting
compared to what else they have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kitimat project is 400 miles (650 kilometers) north of
Vancouver. The Pacific Trail pipeline would stretch 290 miles,
connecting the terminal to a pipeline system owned by Spectra
Energy Corp. (SE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project &#8220;is ideally situated to meet rapidly growing
demand for reliable, secure and cleaner-burning fuels in Asia,
which are projected to approximately double from current levels
by 2025,&#8221; Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland said in the
statement. The transaction, subject to approval from Canadian
regulators, is expected to close by the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apache Net &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Horn River and Liard shale basins hold an estimated 50
trillion cubic feet of potential gas, Farris said in a separate
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache expects to net about $400 million on the
transaction, according to the statement. It will sell a 50
percent stake in the Liard acreage to Chevron for $500 million
and pay Chevron to raise its stake in the terminal, the pipeline
and the other producing areas to 50 percent from 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron is the premier LNG developer with longstanding
relationships in key Asian markets,&#8221;Farris said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both EOG and Encana held 30 percent stakes in the Kitimat
project. Apache said it and Chevron will explore sales of stakes
in the terminal and acreage to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EOG, based in Houston, is selling to focus on onshore crude
oil production, &#8220;which is generating more immediate
reinvestment opportunities,&#8221; Chairman and CEO Mark Papa said in
a separate release. K Leonard, a spokeswoman for the company,
didn&#8217;t immediately return voicemail messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Global Player&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Encana, Canada&#8217;s largest gas producer, &#8220;we do not have
former experience in LNG projects and Chevron does,&#8221; Jay Averill, a spokesman for the Calgary-based company, said by
phone today. &#8220;Bringing in a global player like Chevron, which
does have the experience and the financial ability to bring this
to fruition, takes the project to the next step.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 1 percent to close at $108.63 in New York.
Apache dropped 1.7 percent to $78.68 and EOG dropped 0.7 percent
to $122.77. Encana declined 2.3 percent to C$19.66 in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was &#8220;one of a fairly short list of natural
buyers,&#8221; Menno Hulshof, an analyst at TD Securities in Calgary,
said in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets acted as financial adviser for Apache,
Encana and EOG on the Horn River acreage sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is the largest U.S. oil company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Chief Research
and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie plans to retire in 2014 after
two decades and has shifted to a new role as a senior adviser to
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Rudder, chief technical strategy officer, is taking
over some of Mundie&#8217;s duties overseeing research, privacy and
security, as well as technology policy, Ballmer said in an e-
mail to staff on Dec. 14 that Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mundie&#8217;s job switch marks the second change to Microsoft&#8217;s
senior leadership team within the past two months. On Nov. 12,
the company announced that Windows chief Steven Sinofsky was
leaving. After releasing the latest version of its flagship
operating system in October, Ballmer is putting in place a new
team to start planning the next upgrade to help Microsoft
compete in a market that has shifted to mobile devices and

&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s federal government issued
new rules on Dec. 21 that give credit unions the option to
become federally incorporated entities, allowing them to expand
across the country and better compete with banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit unions, financial institutions owned by their
customers and overseen by provincial regulators, have been
waiting for the changes first announced in the 2010 federal
budget. The Department of Finance released the final rules in a
statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit unions choosing to convert would fall under the
oversight of Canada&#8217;s banking regulator, the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, giving them the
ability to operate nationally instead of being limited to their
home provinces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Phillips, chief executive officer of the trade
association for the country&#8217;s credit unions, said in a statement
that the organization welcomed the announcement as a &#8220;major
milestone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks&#8217; Loan-Loss Reserves Seen Jumping 50% in FASB Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks&#8217; loan-loss reserves may jump about 50 percent under a
proposed U.S. accounting-rule change that redefines how quickly
firms must recognize bad debts, standard-setters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s proposed rule,
revising a February draft, pushes banks to start recognizing
losses on loans, debt securities and other financial receivables
when firms see early signs of potential loss. The policy would
move from an &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; model to an &#8220;expected loss&#8221;
model, similar to changes under consideration by the
International Accounting Standards Board, which sets the rules
used in most nations outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FASB&#8217;s estimate shows banks probably would need to boost
reserves by billions of dollars if the new rule is implemented.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, had $24
billion in its allowance for credit losses at the end of
September. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
Corp., ranked No. 2, had $26 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Bank of America, New York-based JPMorgan and
Citigroup Inc., the third-largest U.S. bank, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FASB draft is open for comment until April 30. Even if
the final proposal is adopted next year, it probably won&#8217;t take
effect before 2015, according to a person with knowledge of the
plans, who requested anonymity because the timing wasn&#8217;t
announced. The effective date was left blank in the Dec. 20
draft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accounting board is looking to change how reserves and
asset values are measured after the financial crisis forced
lenders to devote capital to losses, leaving some of the world&#8217;s
largest banks struggling to meet regulatory thresholds and
remain solvent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Banks Told by U.S. Regulator to Share Cyber Attack Information &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. banking regulator told financial institutions to
report cyber attacks to law enforcement and alert customers to
their impact as new assaults targeted PNC Financial Services
Group Inc. (PNC) and other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dec. 21 alert from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency warned about a wave of so-called distributed
denial-of-service attacks. Such actions harness networks of
infected computers to pump large volumes of Internet traffic at
websites, often causing slowdowns or disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters
announced plans to attack banks in a Dec. 10 statement posted on
the website pastebin.com. The comptroller&#8217;s office, which didn&#8217;t
identify targeted banks or the groups responsible for the
attacks, said fraudsters can use them to distract bank personnel
to disrupt bank operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China to Allow Companies to Invest Idle Proceeds, Xinhua Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China will allow listed companies to invest idle proceeds
from fundraising in &#8220;safe, good liquidity&#8221; investment
products, such as government bonds and wealth management
products from banks, the official Xinhua News Agency reported,
citing China Securities Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies will be allowed to use raised funds to
temporarily bolster working capital for 12 months, compared to 6
months previously, Xinhua reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty percent of the raised funds can be used within 12
months to permanently bolster working capital and pay bank
loans, up from 20 percent previously, Xinhua reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Scandal Sees U.K. Fines Triple Previous Record in 2012 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penalties against Barclays Plc (BARC) and UBS AG for their roles
in the Libor rate-rigging scandal helped the U.K. Financial
Services Authority more than triple its previous fines record in
2010 to at least 312 million pounds ($506 million) this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA&#8217;s penalties would have been even higher, at more
than 400 million pounds, without discounts granted in about two-
thirds of cases for cooperation with the regulator, London-based
law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain LLP said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA fined Barclays around 60 million pounds and UBS 160
million pounds this year for attempting to manipulate the London
benchmark interbank interest rate, known as Libor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global authorities are investigating claims that more than
a dozen banks altered submissions used to set benchmarks to
profit from bets on interest-rate derivatives or make the
lenders&#8217; finances appear healthier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K. Banks Seen Sacrificing Lending for BOE Capital Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. banks, under pressure from the Bank of England to
increase capital, may do exactly what the central bank doesn&#8217;t
want them to do: cut lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While trimming or delaying dividends, selling assets,
reducing pay or raising equity would also bolster capital, banks
such as government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) may be tempted to shrink lending, said
Paul Mumford, who helps manage about 350 million pounds ($569
million) including Barclays Plc, RBS and Lloyds shares at
Cavendish Asset Management Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s four-biggest banks may need as much as 60 billion
pounds in extra capital to meet future loan losses, compensate
customers and pay regulatory fines, according to the Bank of
England&#8217;s Financial Stability Report last month. Central bank
Governor Mervyn King is pressing banks to raise capital levels
without reducing lending to support an economy struggling to
avoid a triple-dip recession. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Said to Face First Enforcement Action on Whale Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. will be the target of a regulatory
enforcement order stemming from mistakes that led to at least
$6.2 billion in trading losses, according to a person briefed on
the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is preparing
to issue a cease-and-desist order requiring the largest U.S.
bank to fix internal risk controls that contributed to its
wrong-way bet on credit derivatives, according to the person,
who asked not to be named because the discussions aren&#8217;t public.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said in May that the
firm&#8217;s strategy was beset by &#8220;errors, sloppiness and bad
judgment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the enforcement is uncertain, the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, and Bryan Hubbard,
an OCC spokesman, declined to comment on any potential
enforcement actions, reported earlier in the Wall Street
Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faulty trades within the bank&#8217;s chief investment office
-- associated with London-based trader Bruno Iksil, widely known
as the London Whale -- may eventually cost more than $6.2
billion, Dimon has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investment office within JPMorgan&#8217;s national bank
suffered from &#8220;inadequate risk management, Comptroller of the
Currency Thomas Curry said during U.S. Senate testimony in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is
also probing the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Files Suit Against Former New Generation Biofuels Chairman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil
action against Lee S. Rosen, the former chairman of New
Generation Biofuels Holdings Inc. (NGBF), alleging he fraudulently
avoided reporting his ownership interest in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosen will settle with the SEC without admitting or denying
the allegations, according to an agency statement Dec. 21. Rosen
will pay a total of $911,484 in fines and will be barred from
serving as a company&#8217;s officer or director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint alleges that in addition to receiving
$666,000 in direct payments, he &#8216;&#8216;indirectly benefited&#8217;&#8217; from
using New Generation shares held in trusts as partial payment
for a yacht. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC earlier suspended trading of Columbia, Maryland-
based company, citing its lack of public disclosures since the
period ending June 30, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phone message left for Bryan McPhee, a company spokesman,
wasn&#8217;t returned. An e-mail sent to him couldn&#8217;t be delivered.
Previous filings said the company makes biofuels from oils and
animal fats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Barclays Staff Ask U.K. Court for Anonymity in London Libor Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc traders and employees who made submissions to
set interest rates applied to a U.K. court asking for anonymity
in the U.K.&#8217;s first civil lawsuit related to manipulation of the
London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether the
bank&#8217;s staff implicated in the suit, filed by Guardian Care
Homes Ltd. over a loss-making interest rate swap tied to the
benchmark, can remain anonymous, according to court spokeswoman
Rachael Collins in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays was ordered to give affiliates of Guardian Care
the identities of 208 employees named in the bank&#8217;s disclosure
to regulators over the Libor-rigging allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Roberts, a lawyer at Morrison  Foerster LLP
representing some of the workers, didn&#8217;t immediately return a
phone call and e-mail seeking comment. Jon Laycock, a Barclays
spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Graiseley Properties Ltd.  Ors. v. Barclays
Bank Plc, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division
Commercial Court, No. 12-1259. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mathew Martoma Indicted for $276 Million Insider Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathew Martoma, the former SAC Capital Advisors LP
portfolio manager accused in what prosecutors have called the
biggest insider-trading case, was charged in an indictment with
making $276 million for the firm on inside tips about a clinical
drug trial, a sign that he may not be considering a plea deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insider-trading indictment sets in motion a criminal
trial process that puts new pressure on him to cooperate with
the government&#8217;s investigation of the hedge-fund firm founded by
billionaire Steven A. Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue in the Martoma case is a 20-minute phone call
prosecutors said he had with Cohen after allegedly receiving
negative test results about a drug that was intended for use by
Alzheimer&#8217;s patients. The day after the call, SAC liquidated a
$700 million position in Elan Corp. (ELN) and Wyeth LLC, the companies
that were promoting the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government claims SAC netted $276 million in profits
and averted losses in the Elan and Wyeth trades. Cohen isn&#8217;t
alleged in Martoma&#8217;s indictment to have known Martoma had inside
information. Prosecutors have made no claims about precisely
what was said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-
based SAC, declined to comment on the indictment. Gasthalter has
said Cohen and SAC acted appropriately in making the trades.
Cohen hasn&#8217;t been charged criminally or sued by regulators in
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martoma was arrested at his Boca Raton, Florida, home on
Nov. 20 and charged in a criminal complaint. The indictment
charges him with one count of conspiracy and two counts of
securities fraud. If convicted, Martoma faces as many as 20
years in prison on the securities fraud charges and five years
on the conspiracy charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Though disappointing, today&#8217;s events come as no
surprise,&#8221; Martoma&#8217;s lawyer, Charles Stillman, said in a
statement Dec. 21. &#8220;The simple fact is that Mathew Martoma did
not trade on inside information, is innocent of all these
charges and we look forward to his ultimate vindication.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martoma, 12-cr-00973, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Anglo Irish Chairman Fitzpatrick Charged for Hiding His Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Anglo Irish Bank Corp. Chairman Sean Fitzpatrick was
charged with hiding personal loans of as much as 139.8 million
euros ($184.5 million) from the auditors of the now-nationalized
bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitzpatrick, 64, appeared in court in Dublin Dec. 21 after
being charged with breaches of Irish company law for providing
&#8220;misleading, false or deceptive&#8221; declarations to company
auditors, according to court documents filed by prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Fitzpatrick and two other one-time Anglo Irish
directors were ordered on Oct. 8 to stand trial in relation to
loans to 16 clients to buy shares in the bank in 2008. He said
at the time that while the transactions &#8220;were inappropriate and
unacceptable from a transparency point of view,&#8221; they did not
breach banking or legal regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitzpatrick was remanded on bail until March 1, when the
so-called book of evidence will be presented to the court. His
solicitor Michael Staines didn&#8217;t immediately return calls to his
office seeking comment on the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stone Resigns From Accounting Oversight Board After SEC Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Stone resigned from the Financial Accounting
Foundation&#8217;s board of trustees less than two weeks after she was
accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of violating
her responsibilities in overseeing Morgan Keegan  Co. mutual
funds during the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAF, which oversees the board that sets U.S. accounting
standards, expects to fill Stone&#8217;s spot next year, according to
a press release from the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
organization. Stone, an accounting professor at the University
of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, took a leave of absence on Dec. 10,
the day the SEC announced its claims against her and seven other
former directors of the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused the mutual funds&#8217; directors of allowing
assets backed by subprime mortgages to be overvalued as the
housing market collapsed in 2007. The action followed a related
$200 million settlement with Morgan Keegan, a subsidiary of
Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF), last year and sanctions against
two employees in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stone and five other directors acted &#8220;diligently and in
good faith&#8221; and intend to contest the SEC&#8217;s allegations, which
they &#8220;emphatically deny,&#8221; their attorney, Stephen Crimmins of
KL Gates in Washington, said in a Dec. 10 statement. Stone
didn&#8217;t return a call for comment Dec. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beswick Appointed SEC Chief Accountant by Agency&#8217;s New Chairman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul A. Beswick, who has served as the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission acting chief accountant for the past several
months, was named to the position of chief accountant at the
agency Dec. 21 by SEC Chairman Elisse Walter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment of Beswick was announced in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Victoria Slind-Flor" date="Dec 24, 2012  7:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-24/samsung-winnie-the-pooh-nfl-disney-intellectual-property-1-.html"><headline>Samsung, Winnie the Pooh, NFL, Disney: Intellectual Property</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world&#8217;s
biggest maker of smartphones, was sent an antitrust complaint
from the European Union accusing the company of abusing its
dominant market position in legal disputes with Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung&#8217;s use of court injunctions seeking to block Apple&#8217;s
products in relation to so-called standard-essential patents
violates antitrust rules in the 27-nation bloc, the European
Commission said Dec. 21 in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such injunctions can generally be challenged fairly
in court, Samsung may be violating EU rules by seeking them in
relation to essential patents when Apple has &#8220;shown itself to
be willing to negotiate,&#8221; the Brussels-based commission said in
the statement. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia
signaled that he would send the complaint by the end of this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are studying the statement and will firmly defend
ourselves against any misconceived allegations,&#8221; Samsung, based
in Suwon, South Korea, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will
continue to fully cooperate with the commission.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is &#8220;confident that in due course the
commission will conclude that we have acted in compliance with
European Union competition laws.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung failed to deflect the EU complaint when it
announced on Dec. 18 it plans to withdraw injunctions in Europe
that seek to block sales of Apple products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said that such a move wasn&#8217;t enough to prevent
regulators from sending a so-called statement of objections to
the company, a formal charge sheet that may precede antitrust
fines of as much as 10 percent of yearly sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is probing whether Samsung violated agreements to
license key patents to other mobile-phone manufacturers on fair
terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under phone industry agreements on standards, companies
owning the rights to essential technology must usually license
it to competitors on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms, known as FRAND. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the disputed mobile-phone technology was adopted in
Europe as a standard, Samsung &#8220;gave a commitment that it would
license the patents which it had declared essential to the
standard on FRAND terms,&#8221; the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung began seeking injunctions against Apple in courts
in EU member countries in 2011, based on alleged infringement of
patents for 3G technology, according to the Commission&#8217;s
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple in London, declined to
comment on the EU complaint against Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung is withdrawing injunction requests against Apple in
Germany, U.K., France, Italy and Netherlands involving key
patents it holds for wireless communications, citing &#8220;the
interest of protecting consumer choice.&#8221; The company will
continue litigation that seeks damages in intellectual property
disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cuban, Persson Donate $500,000 to EFF to &#8216;Fix&#8217; Patent System &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks National
Basketball Association team, and Swedish game developer Markus
&#8220;Notche&#8221; Persson have donated $500,000 to a digital rights
advocacy group to &#8220;fix&#8221; what Cuban says is a broken patent
system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation said
in a statement that the donations would provide &#8220;a major new
boost&#8221; to the organization&#8217;s patent work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuban&#8217;s donation funds the hiring of a new attorney
experienced in patent reform and high profile patent litigation
and a new title for EFF staff attorney Julie Samuels, &#8220;The Mark
Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persson&#8217;s donation is aimed at &#8220;the systematic problem
with software patents,&#8221; according to the EFF statement. The
organization has already developed its &#8220;Defend Innovation&#8221;
project, which promotes what the group says are seven
improvements to the American patent system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Defend Innovation projects aims to shorten the term for
software patents, allowing winning parties in litigation to
recover fees and costs, and protect inventors who independently
arrive at a patented idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Wins U.S. Appeals Court Ruling Over Pooh Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., (DIS) the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company,
won an appeals court ruling that protects its trademark rights
to the Winnie-the-Pooh characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was correct to throw
out challenges to the trademark ownership filed by Stephen
Slesinger Inc., which has waged a decades-long battle with
Disney over ownership of the Pooh characters, an appeals court
in Washington said Dec. 21. Slesinger had already litigated the
issue and lost in district court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit said in an opinion posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.A. Milne, who wrote the Pooh books, transferred
merchandising rights to Stephen Slesinger in 1930, and his widow
licensed the rights to Disney in 1961. The Slesinger company and
Disney have been fighting in court over royalties since at least
1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal court ruled that Slesinger had
transferred all of its rights in the Pooh works to Burbank,
California-based Disney. The Federal Circuit on Dec. 21 said
that, based on that 2009 ruling, the trademark office was right
to bar Slesinger from seeking to cancel the Disney trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Stephen Slesinger Inc. v. Disney Enterprises
Inc., 2011-1593, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFL&#8217;s Scouting Report Copyright Not Infringed, Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scouting arm of the National Football League lost a
copyright case against a Washington State resident who wrote
about its annual scouting reports for a sports-oriented website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Football Scouting Inc. filed suit in federal court
in Tacoma, Washington, in September 2011, objecting to Rob
Rang&#8217;s use of information from its Scouting Report for stories
he wrote that were published on a blog operated by Sports X-
change. The league also accused him of trade-secret
misappropriation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court rejected the copyright claims. While the reports
did constitute protectable subject matter, U.S. District Judge
Robert B. Leighton said Rang&#8217;s work fell into copyright law&#8217;s
area of permitted fair use. His use of the NFL information was
sufficiently transformative, the court found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL had argued that the information Rang used
constituted the &#8220;heart&#8221; of the reports. The court found it was
a small amount of copyright and he used it as a jumping off
point to provide original commentary on the players and their
draft prospects. His stories weren&#8217;t in any meaningful sense a
&#8220;market replacement&#8221; for the NFL reports, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL&#8217;s trade secrets claim wasn&#8217;t dismissed. The court
said a factual dispute exists over whether or not the NFL made
reasonable attempts to protect the secrecy of its scouting-

&lt;h2&gt;Disney Wins EU Approval to Buy &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; Producer Lucasfilm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. won European Union approval to buy George Lucas&#8217;s Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4.05 billion in cash and stock,
combining two of Hollywood&#8217;s most lucrative film franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator, said
overlaps were &#8220;very limited&#8221; for the two companies&#8217; activities
in home entertainment, gaming software, film production and
distribution and licensing for both broadcast rights and
merchandise, according to an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission therefore concluded that the transaction
would not significantly impede effective competition&#8221; in
Europe, the Brussels-based authority said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, announced in October, will add &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; and
&#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; to Disney&#8217;s roster of film hits including
&#8220;The Avengers&#8221; and &#8220;Finding Nemo.&#8221; The &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; films
have generated $4.54 billion in worldwide ticket sales, second
to Warner Bros.&#8217; &#8220;Harry Potter,&#8221; according to Box Office Mojo.
&#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; pictures have collected $1.95 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition complements Disney Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger&#8217;s focus on sequels and film franchises, fitting the
same profile as its purchase of Marvel three years ago. Disney
paid a combined $11 billion for Pixar and Marvel in the past
decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas, 68, the sole owner of Lucasfilm, will receive half
of the purchase price in cash and the balance in stock, becoming
a major investor in the film, theme-park and TV company,
according to an Oct. 31 statement from Burbank, California-based
Disney. Lucas will receive about 40 million Disney shares,
becoming the second-largest non-institutional shareholder with
about 2.2 percent of the company, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The largest is the trust of late Apple Inc. (AAPL) co-founder
Steve Jobs, who sold Pixar to Disney in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Designer Liable for Infringement, Appeals Court Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Swedish appeals court has found that the designer of the
now-defunct StudentBay website, through which book content was
shared without authorization, committed copyright
infringement, the TorrentFreak website reported . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site designer had previously been cleared of
infringement by the Sodertorn District Court in April, which
found there was no evidence that he had actually operated the
site, according to TorrentFreak, an anti-copyright website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said that even though he was only a
designer, he must have known that the intent of the site was to
infringe book publishers&#8217; copyrights, TorrentFreak reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designer was sentenced to 75 hours of volunteer work, a
fine of 42,000 Swedish krona ($6,410) and ordered to surrender
the money he made designing the site, according to TorrentFreak.

&lt;p&gt;OAO Lukoil, the Russian oil producer

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) at the West Qurna-1 field in Iraq, said Andrei Kuzyaev, head of Lukoil Overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukoil sees the additional risk as too great given that it
already operates the adjoining West Qurna-2 project without a

&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world&#8217;s
biggest maker of smartphones, was sent an antitrust complaint
from the European Union accusing the company of abusing its
dominant market position in legal disputes with Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung&#8217;s use of court injunctions seeking to block Apple&#8217;s
products in relation to so-called standard-essential patents
violates antitrust rules in the 27-nation bloc, the European
Commission said Dec. 21 in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such injunctions can generally be challenged fairly
in court, Samsung may be violating EU rules by seeking them in
relation to essential patents when Apple has &#8220;shown itself to
be willing to negotiate,&#8221; the Brussels-based commission said in
the statement. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia
signaled that he would send the complaint by the end of this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are studying the statement and will firmly defend
ourselves against any misconceived allegations,&#8221; Samsung, based
in Suwon, South Korea, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will
continue to fully cooperate with the commission.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is &#8220;confident that in due course the
commission will conclude that we have acted in compliance with
European Union competition laws.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung failed to deflect the EU complaint when it
announced on Dec. 18 it plans to withdraw injunctions in Europe
that seek to block sales of Apple products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said that such a move wasn&#8217;t enough to prevent
regulators from sending a so-called statement of objections to
the company, a formal charge sheet that may precede antitrust
fines of as much as 10 percent of yearly sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is probing whether Samsung violated agreements to
license key patents to other mobile-phone manufacturers on fair
terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under phone industry agreements on standards, companies
owning the rights to essential technology must usually license
it to competitors on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms, known as FRAND. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the disputed mobile-phone technology was adopted in
Europe as a standard, Samsung &#8220;gave a commitment that it would
license the patents which it had declared essential to the
standard on FRAND terms,&#8221; the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung began seeking injunctions against Apple in courts
in EU member countries in 2011, based on alleged infringement of
patents for 3G technology, according to the Commission&#8217;s
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple in London, declined to
comment on the EU complaint against Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung is withdrawing injunction requests against Apple in
Germany, U.K., France, Italy and Netherlands involving key
patents it holds for wireless communications, citing &#8220;the
interest of protecting consumer choice.&#8221; The company will
continue litigation that seeks damages in intellectual property
disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cuban, Persson Donate $500,000 to EFF to &#8216;Fix&#8217; Patent System &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks National
Basketball Association team, and Swedish game developer Markus
&#8220;Notche&#8221; Persson have donated $500,000 to a digital rights
advocacy group to &#8220;fix&#8221; what Cuban says is a broken patent
system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation said
in a statement that the donations would provide &#8220;a major new
boost&#8221; to the organization&#8217;s patent work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuban&#8217;s donation funds the hiring of a new attorney
experienced in patent reform and high profile patent litigation
and a new title for EFF staff attorney Julie Samuels, &#8220;The Mark
Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persson&#8217;s donation is aimed at &#8220;the systematic problem
with software patents,&#8221; according to the EFF statement. The
organization has already developed its &#8220;Defend Innovation&#8221;
project, which promotes what the group says are seven
improvements to the American patent system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Defend Innovation projects aims to shorten the term for
software patents, allowing winning parties in litigation to
recover fees and costs, and protect inventors who independently
arrive at a patented idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Wins U.S. Appeals Court Ruling Over Pooh Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., (DIS) the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company,
won an appeals court ruling that protects its trademark rights
to the Winnie-the-Pooh characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was correct to throw
out challenges to the trademark ownership filed by Stephen
Slesinger Inc., which has waged a decades-long battle with
Disney over ownership of the Pooh characters, an appeals court
in Washington said Dec. 21. Slesinger had already litigated the
issue and lost in district court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit said in an opinion posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.A. Milne, who wrote the Pooh books, transferred
merchandising rights to Stephen Slesinger in 1930, and his widow
licensed the rights to Disney in 1961. The Slesinger company and
Disney have been fighting in court over royalties since at least
1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal court ruled that Slesinger had
transferred all of its rights in the Pooh works to Burbank,
California-based Disney. The Federal Circuit on Dec. 21 said
that, based on that 2009 ruling, the trademark office was right
to bar Slesinger from seeking to cancel the Disney trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Stephen Slesinger Inc. v. Disney Enterprises
Inc., 2011-1593, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFL&#8217;s Scouting Report Copyright Not Infringed, Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scouting arm of the National Football League lost a
copyright case against a Washington State resident who wrote
about its annual scouting reports for a sports-oriented website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Football Scouting Inc. filed suit in federal court
in Tacoma, Washington, in September 2011, objecting to Rob
Rang&#8217;s use of information from its Scouting Report for stories
he wrote that were published on a blog operated by Sports X-
change. The league also accused him of trade-secret
misappropriation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court rejected the copyright claims. While the reports
did constitute protectable subject matter, U.S. District Judge
Robert B. Leighton said Rang&#8217;s work fell into copyright law&#8217;s
area of permitted fair use. His use of the NFL information was
sufficiently transformative, the court found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL had argued that the information Rang used
constituted the &#8220;heart&#8221; of the reports. The court found it was
a small amount of copyright and he used it as a jumping off
point to provide original commentary on the players and their
draft prospects. His stories weren&#8217;t in any meaningful sense a
&#8220;market replacement&#8221; for the NFL reports, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL&#8217;s trade secrets claim wasn&#8217;t dismissed. The court
said a factual dispute exists over whether or not the NFL made
reasonable attempts to protect the secrecy of its scouting-
report information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Football Scouting Inc. v. Rob Rang,
3:11-cv-05762-RBL, U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington (Tacoma). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two law firms announced plans last
week to move offices in their home cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP is relocating its Boston office to a
new waterfront high rise, while Kaye Scholer LLP is moving from
the east side to the west side of Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter signed a letter of intent to occupy all of
the commercial space in a half-million-square-foot tower at Fan
Pier on Boston Harbor. The firm&#8217;s 860 attorneys and professional
staff will move to the new space in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After closely examining a range of options, we believe
that Goodwin&#8217;s move to the &#8216;Innovation District&#8217; will bring
significant benefits to our employees, the city of Boston and
the firm,&#8221; Alex Randall, head of Goodwin&#8217;s real estate leasing
practice and lead partner on the project, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 100-year old firm is now at Exchange Place. The new
location is a 21-acre (8.5 hectare) site that spans nine city
blocks. It&#8217;s expected to have eight high-rise commercial and
residential towers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kaye Scholer is leaving its New York offices at
425 Park Avenue after 55 years for a new building on Manhattan&#8217;s
West Side. Founded in New York in 1917, the firm has more than
450 attorneys in nine offices in the U.S., U.K., Germany and
China. Its New York office remains the largest, with
approximately 285 attorneys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm signed a 20-year lease with Boston Properties for
the space at 250 West 55th Street, which is still under
construction, and expects to move into its new office in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaye Scholer managing partner Michael Solow said in a
statement: &#8220;We decided on this space because of its midtown
location; Boston Properties&#8217; reputation as a landlord that
understands the demands of the legal world; the flexible design
and efficiency of the building; quick access to a multitude of
top-level services and public transportation options; and close
proximity to Central Park, Time Warner Center, Lincoln Center,
Carnegie Hall and other arts facilities that help make New York
a cultural haven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mayer Brown Partner Durkin Confirmed as U.S. District Judge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayer Brown LLP partner Thomas M. Durkin, a Chicago-based
litigator, was unanimously confirmed by the U. S. Senate as a
U.S. district judge for the Northern District of Illinois. He
will be sworn in on Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durkin was nominated by President Barack Obama in May 2012
after being recommended by Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk of
Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Throughout his career, Tom Durkin has demonstrated strong
leadership in his community and a solid commitment to public
service,&#8221; Senator Durbin said in a statement. &#8220;The non-partisan American Bar Association awarded Mr. Durkin its highest
rating of &#8216;unanimously well-qualified.&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t agree more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bench of the Chicago-based Northern District, Durkin
will join four former Mayer Brown partners: District Judges
Robert Dow Jr., Gary Feinerman and John Tharp and Magistrate
Judge Sheila Finnegan. Durkin and Dow, Tharp and Finnegan spent
their entire careers in private practice at Mayer Brown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durkin has tried more than 55 federal and state jury trials
to verdict. Much of his trial work has focused on business
litigation, along with class action, products liability and
medical device defense, and patent litigation. He has also
handled white-collar criminal matters, especially in the fraud,
tax and public corruption areas. He was assistant U.S. attorney
in the Northern District of Illinois from 1980 to 1993. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While Tom will be greatly missed by all of us at Mayer
Brown and by the clients he has served so well and faithfully,
we all will benefit greatly from the wise choice made by
President Obama, Senators Durbin and Kirk and the Senate,&#8221;
Mayer Brown chairman Paul Theiss said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SouthGobi Chief Lawyer Cleared of Corruption in Mongolia Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (1878), controlled by a unit of Rio Tinto
Group, said its chief lawyer, Sarah Armstrong, has been cleared
in a probe by the Mongolian Independent Authority Against
Corruption and is free to leave the country after being
prevented since October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coal mining company, based in Vancouver, remains under
investigation for &#8220;the divestment of certain SouthGobi licenses
to third parties, and the involvement and conduct of government
officials in connection with this,&#8221; according to a statement to
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Dec. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SouthGobi fell 1.6 percent to HK$15.58 at the early
Christmas-eve close in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armstrong is the company&#8217;s chief legal counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers Vie With Chamber of Commerce on Damages Deduction: Taxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats in Congress are renewing an effort to repeal the
tax deduction companies are allowed to take when a jury slaps
them with punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debate over the issue, which pits trial lawyers against the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, may be rekindled in 2013 as part of
comprehensive legislation to overhaul the tax code, Bloomberg
BNA reported. Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat from
Vermont, introduced legislation last week to end the tax break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deduction became a target after the BP Plc (BP/) Deepwater
Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 prompted
speculation, which proved unfounded, that the company might reap
a tax benefit from the fallout. The Obama administration has
repeatedly proposed repealing the deduction, arguing that
allowing a tax break contradicts the idea of discouraging the
conduct that led to the awarding of damages in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think any corporation should get a tax break for
atrocious behavior,&#8221; said Christopher Scholl, communications
director for the American Association for Justice, which
represents trial lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Internal Revenue Code Section 162, businesses are
allowed to deduct punitive damages as ordinary and necessary
business expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislation to remove the deduction, which passed the
Democratic-controlled Senate in 2010, has hit resistance in the
Republican-led House, where Welch has introduced similar
legislation in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defenders of the writeoff, including the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, say that repeal would be the equivalent of creating an
additional federal fine, and that corporations would probably
pass along the added cost to their customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denying deductions for punitive damages &#8220;imposes increased
costs on businesses, forcing them to spend more money litigating
claims and thus forgoing their ability to use these funds to
stimulate job creation and economic growth,&#8221; U.S. Chamber of
Commerce Executive Vice President R. Bruce Josten wrote to
members of Congress in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bills are H.R. 6700 and S. 794. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Vanadium Parent Makes Buyout Offer of HK$2.06 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sullivan  Cromwell LLP led by partners Kay Ian Ng, in Hong
Kong and Gwen Wong in Beijing, advised China Vanadium Titano-Magnetite Mining Co. (893), the largest non-state-owned iron ore
producer in Sichuan province, which said its parent made a
buyout offer of as much as HK$2.06 billion ($266 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will delist if the offer of HK$1.93 a share in
cash is completed, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing Dec. 20. The buyout by Trisonic International Ltd. is
subject to shareholders&#8217; approval, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Vanadium said it will delist because of low trading
volume and poor share-price performance. The average number of
shares trading hands fell to 5.3 million in the six months
before the company first proposed the buyout on Nov. 1, from
13.7 million in the first half-year after the stock debuted on
Oct. 8, 2009. The shares have fallen 52 percent since listing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock gained 1.2 percent to close at HK$1.67 on Dec.
19, its last day of trading before suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Vanadium didn&#8217;t disclose its net asset value per
share in the filing. Its net assets attributable to shareholders
were 3.33 billion yuan as of June 30, according to the Dec. 20
filing, about HK$4.14 billion at today&#8217;s exchange rate. That
gives about a HK$2 NAV per share, based on its 2.08 billion
shares outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sapphire Corp. (SAPP) is acting together with Trisonic in the
buyout offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tax Attorney Joins White  Williams in New York &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawyers in $20 Million Facebook Accord Seek $7.7 Million Fee &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Facebook Inc. (FB) users who negotiated a $20
million settlement with the social network company over claims
that it used subscribers&#8217; names without their permission are
seeking $7.7 million in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California attorneys Robert Arns and Jonathan Jaffe, who
represented five Facebook users suing over the free service&#8217;s
practice of using subscribers&#8217; names without their permission to
advertise products in its &#8220;Sponsored Stories,&#8221; said the fee
was fair given relief provided in the settlement and the risks
they undertook to achieve it, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook users can claim a $10 payment and the company
agreed to make changes allowing subscribers to opt out of
sponsored stories, according to filings in federal court in San
Francisco. Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, also
agreed to revise its terms of use so subscribers can more easily
see when they&#8217;re being shown as endorsers of products and games
for which they clicked a &#8220;like&#8221; button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg gave preliminary
approval to the settlement. He refused to approve an earlier
settlement that included no money for users and $10 million in
fees for the attorneys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fraley v. Facebook Inc., 11-cv-01726, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, won a U.K. ruling invalidating Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s patent protection for technology synchronizing
message statuses across multiple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 patent owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility
unit shouldn&#8217;t have been issued because the technology was
obvious to experts in the field at the time, Judge Richard
Arnold said in a decision in London last week. A week-long trial
ended earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The patent is invalid and should be revoked,&#8221; Arnold
said during a 30-second hearing. Both companies had received the
written judgment in advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are locked in legal battles over patents for
smartphone technology and Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox gaming software in
the U.S. and Germany. Microsoft claims all devices that run on
Google&#8217;s Android operating system use its technology and is
seeking royalties from Motorola Mobility, which Mountain View,
California-based Google acquired in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, filed the lawsuit
against Motorola Mobility in London a year ago in a pre-emptive
bid to invalidate the patent before it could be sued for
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is running parallel to Motorola&#8217;s lawsuit against
Microsoft over the same patent in Germany, where the companies
are awaiting a decision. Google has said it bought Motorola
Mobility in part because of its patents and history of
innovation in mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased the court granted our request to invalidate
Motorola&#8217;s patent and welcome yet another step toward clarifying
the cases between our companies,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft&#8217;s
deputy general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola&#8217;s lawyer, Zoe Butler of Powell Gilbert in London,
didn&#8217;t respond to a call seeking comment on the ruling.
Motorola&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-
mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the patent in the U.K. trial related to pager
technology from the 1990s, the arguments centered on its
application to newer mobile devices and computers that also rely
on synchronizing messages statuses such as whether an e-mail has
been read by the user, or is unread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the patent were valid, Microsoft&#8217;s Live Messenger
instant-messaging system and Exchange ActiveSync protocol, used
by the company&#8217;s customers to synchronize e-mail statuses across
devices, would have violated the intellectual property,
according to the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent in the case had a so-called priority date of
Aug. 31, 1995, when Motorola was creating technology for the
first two-way pager system that would allow message recipients
to respond to communications on the devices for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Mobility Inc.,
case no. HC11C04536, High Court of London, Chancery Division
(London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nokia Signs Patent-Licensing Deal With RIM, Ending Disputes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK), the Finnish mobile-phone maker struggling to
reverse a slide in sales, agreed to a patent-licensing deal with
BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM), ending all legal
disputes between the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM will make a one-time and &#8220;ongoing&#8221; payments to Nokia,
the Espoo, Finland-based company said. Financial terms weren&#8217;t
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia is trying to add revenue from its patent portfolio as
sales at its unprofitable smartphone unit drop. It may get a
one-time payment of $150 million to $200 million, and about $50
million annually over the next 10 to 15 years, depending on when
the patents expire, according to estimates by Hannu Rauhala, an
analyst at Pohjola Bank Oyj in Helsinki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia has sold units and assets including its headquarters
to boost its cash position. Its cash reserves have shrunk by
about half in the past five years and will drop below 3 billion
euros by year-end, Standard  Poor&#8217;s estimated in August. Its
debt is at junk status at the three main rating companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Nokia said it filed patent-infringement lawsuits
against Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM, HTC Corp. (2498) and ViewSonic
Corp. over inventions in mobile devices including phones and
tablets. The RIM deal signals that the disputes with HTC and
ViewSonic could be settled within six months, Sarkamies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new agreement is less lucrative than the one Nokia
signed with Apple Inc. last year because RIM&#8217;s device volumes
are &#8220;so small and the BlackBerry maker is going through such
difficult times,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Nokia and RIM are struggling to compete with Apple&#8217;s
iPhone and smartphones using Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software,
including those from market leader Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)
Android and Apple accounted for 90 percent of global smartphone
shipments last quarter, compared with 4.3 percent for the
BlackBerry and less than that for Nokia, according to research
firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gunmaker Black Rain Sues Glockplates.com for Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Rain Ordnance Inc., a maker of semi-automatic rifles,
sued an online dealer of gun parts over trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glockplates.com of Brainerd, Minnesota, is accused of
infringing the &#8220;Let it Rain!&#8221; trademark used by Black Rain. In
a complaint filed Dec. 19 in federal court in Joplin, Missouri,
the Neosho, Missouri-based gun manufacturer says it used that
phrase to surround a biohazard symbol, and that Glockplates.com
is using it without authorization on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goods that are sold under its mark are &#8220;confusingly
similar&#8221; to authentic Black Rain products, according to court
papers. The public is confused, Black Rain claims, and is likely
to assume falsely that an affiliation exists between the two
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Missouri gunmaker claims it is harmed by
Glockplates.com&#8217;s actions and its reputation has been tarnished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court for an order barring further
unauthorized use of its marks, and for seizure of all allegedly
infringing promotional material. Additionally, it seeks an award
of all of Glockplates.com&#8217;s profits derived from the alleged
infringement, together with money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Rain also requested that the damages be tripled to
punish Glockplates.com for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glockplates.com didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed
request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Black Rain Ordnance Inc. v. Glockplates.com,
3:12-cv-05130-RED, U.S. District Court, Western District of
Missouri (Joplin). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Tobacco Directive Permits Nations to Require Plain Packs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission is proposing revisions to its
Tobacco Products Directive that permits member states to require
plain packaging on tobacco products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement from the commission, all cigarette
and roll-your-own cigarette packaging must contain a combined
picture and text warning that covers 75 percent of the front and
back of the package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia, which isn&#8217;t a member state of the European
Union, was the first nation to adopt a law requiring plain
packaging. The changeover began in October, and now cigarettes
sold in that country may bear photos of a gangrenous limb or a
cancer victim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Paramount, Puzo Agree to End Lawsuit Over &#8216;Godfather&#8217; Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount Pictures Corp. and Mario Puzo&#8217;s heirs agreed to
drop legal action that began when the movie studio sued estate
of the author of &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; to prevent the publication of
a sequel to the novel about a fictional Mafia family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, according to
a stipulation filed Dec. 20 in federal court in Manhattan. No
details of any settlement were given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The case is settled and we&#8217;re very happy about it,&#8221;
Bertram Fields, a lawyer for the Puzo estate with Los Angeles-
based Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman  Machtinger LLP, said in
a telephone interview. &#8220;Because of the confidentiality
provisions, I can&#8217;t disclose the terms of the settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIAB), sued Anthony Puzo,
Mario&#8217;s son and the executor of his estate, in February to stop
the publication of a new sequel to &#8220;The Godfather,&#8221; claiming
it wasn&#8217;t authorized. The heirs countersued in April to cancel
the contract between the studio and Mario Puzo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in September denied the
Puzos&#8217; bid to terminate the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount said in its complaint that after Puzo died in
1999, the company agreed to allow Bertelsmann AG&#8217;s Random House
to publish one Godfather sequel, &#8220;The Godfather Returns,&#8221;
which came out in 2004. The estate published another novel,
&#8220;The Godfather&#8217;s Revenge,&#8221; in 2006, without Paramount&#8217;s
approval, the studio said. Paramount sued after the estate
announced a plan to publish a third sequel, &#8220;The Family
Corleone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Kendall, a lawyer for Paramount, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a message seeking comment on the dismissal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequel, written by Ed Falco, was published in May by
Grand Central Publishing, a unit of Paris-based Hachette Livre
SA. The terms of an interim settlement reached earlier this year
between Paramount and Puzo stated that proceeds from the book
would be put in escrow pending the outcome of the litigation,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notice was mailed to the U.S. Register of Copyrights to
report the termination of the lawsuit, according to a court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &#8220;Godfather&#8221; film came out in 1972 and won the
Academy Awards for best picture and adapted screenplay, for
which Puzo shared the credit. Francis Ford Coppola directed the
three &#8220;Godfather&#8221; movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Paramount Pictures v. Puzo, 12-01268, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EFF Hires Daniel Nazer From Stanford&#8217;s CIS Fair Use Project &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation hired Daniel Nazer as a
staff attorney, the San Francisco-based digital rights advocacy
group said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hiring is funded as part of a $250,000 donation from
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban aimed at improvement of the
U.S. patent system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazer joins EFF from Stanford Law School&#8217;s Center for
Internet and Society where he was a non-resident fellow at the
Fair Use Project. Before that, he practiced IP law at San
Francisco&#8217;s Keker  Van Nest LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has served as a judicial clerk to Justice Susan Kenny of
the Federal Court of Australia and to Chief Judge William K. Sessions III of U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazer has an undergraduate degree in philosophy from the
University of Western Australia, a master&#8217;s degree in philosophy
from Rutgers University, and a law degree from Yale Law School. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America
Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch are among five firms that will pay $4.48
million to settle regulatory claims they used funds from
municipal and state bond deals to pay lobbyists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local authorities were unfairly asked to reimburse payments
that the firms made over five years to the California Public
Securities Association, a lobbying group, to help influence the
state, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which
oversees securities firms, said today in a statement. The firms
inadequately described the fees, wrapping them into bond-
underwriting expenses, Finra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriters that fund bond-authorization campaigns and
then collect fees from approved debt sales are among unresolved
pay-to-play issues in the $3.7 trillion municipal market. Hiring
an underwriter based on whether it supports a campaign rather
than its ability to market bonds can lead to mispricing, which
can hurt investors, as well as higher fees and borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The script remains the same,&#8221; said Marilyn Cohen,
founder of Envision Capital Management Inc. in Los Angeles,
which oversees about $210 million of munis. &#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised
-- my surprise is they found it. That&#8217;s just the cost of doing
business. It&#8217;s all pay-to-play.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY)&#8217;s blood thinner Eliquis was approved by U.S. regulators
after more than a year of review, giving the companies a new
potential blockbuster heart drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for
the prevention of blood clots that develop in patients with the
heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation, the agency said today
in a statement. The approval comes three months before the FDA&#8217;s
most-recent March deadline for a ruling on the drug, allowing
the two New York-based companies to start sales sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new anticoagulants are really exciting
developments,&#8221; William Zoghbi, president of the American
College of Cardiology, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;They
address some of the concerns that traditional warfarin has
offered.&#8221; Warfarin is the half-century-old drug that has been
the standard of care before new medicines like Eliquis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s sign-off ends several setbacks in the
efforts by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers to win sales clearance for
the blood thinner. The FDA delayed approval in March 2012 and
rejected the therapy in June, saying it needed more data from
the companies&#8217; clinical trials. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, and Bristol-Myers will split sales, which may total
$5.2 billion by 2020, Catherine Arnold, an analyst at Credit
Suisse in New York, said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose less than 1 percent in extended trading
to $24.99 at 4:57 p.m. New York time, after closing at $24.89.
Bristol-Myers rose 1.9 percent after closing at $31.90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common Condition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 2.66 million people in the U.S. have atrial
fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heart beat,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta. The disease becomes more common with age. Patients have
a higher risk of blood clots, which can cause strokes, and of
heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis will provide another option for the prevention of
blood clots and strokes, and the drug showed in clinical trials
that it was more effective than warfarin, the FDA said in its
statement. It is among a group of new blood thinners such as
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH&#8217;s Pradaxa and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and
Bayer AG (BAYN)&#8217;s Xarelto,  that are potential replacements for
warfarin, which requires regular blood monitoring by doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new drugs carry some risk of bleeding, as does
warfarin. Bleeding can happen in the stomach, under the surface
of the skin, or most dangerously, in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new blood thinners offer a better trade-off between
bleeding and stroke-prevention, said Andrew Epstein, a professor
of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
&#8220;One intracranial bleed is a small price for the great decrease
in morbidity and mortality,&#8221; Epstein said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t any free lunch.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis has been approved in Europe and Japan. Pfizer and
Bristol-Myers also want to gain approval for use in clots
elsewhere in the body, including the legs and lungs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and
Technology Co., China&#8217;s second-biggest construction equipment
maker by market value, offered $236 million to buy the remaining
41 percent stake in a unit from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
other investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoomlion (1157) will fund the purchase with its own cash, the
company said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange
today. The unit, Zoomlion CIFA (H.K) Holdings Co., was formed
after the Chinese equipment maker and investors including
Goldman acquired Compagnia Italiana Forme Acciaio SpA, known as
CIFA, in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will accelerate Zoomlion&#8217;s push for international
expansion,&#8221; the company said in a separate e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Zoomlion will better integrate CIFA&#8217;s business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoomlion bought its 60 percent stake in the Italian company
for 163 million euros ($215 million) as it sought advanced
technologies in concrete pump manufacturing. Zoomlion and bigger
rival Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) are stepping up overseas
acquisitions after demand at home slowed following Chinese
government curbs on the property market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman owns 12.8 percent of Zoomlion CIFA, while Chinese
private-equity company Hony Capital has 17.8 percent. Chinese-
Italian buyout fund Mandarin Capital Partners holds 8.9 percent.
The three investors had paid 108 million euros for the stake. In
2009, CIFA management bought a 1.1 percent holding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoomlion fell 1.4 percent to close at HK$11.52 in Hong Kong
trading. The city&#8217;s benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 0.2 percent.
The announcement was made after trading hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete machinery was the biggest revenue contributor to
Zoomlion last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company&#8217;s first-half profit rose 21 percent to 5.6 billion yuan
as the focus on concrete pumps helped offset slumping demand for
excavators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sany Heavy (631), China&#8217;s biggest maker of excavators, and a
partner paid 360 million euros for German concrete-pump maker
Putzmeister Holding GmbH in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) retained a $543
million federal contract to provide wireless tracking of medical
devices following International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s
protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM had challenged a June decision to give the five-year
Department of Veterans Affairs contract to HP. The U.S.
Government Accountability Office, which arbitrates contract
disputes, agreed with IBM&#8217;s argument that the VA didn&#8217;t properly
evaluate proposals from vendors seeking the contract. In
October, it directed the agency to reconsider the award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After re-evaluating the bids, the department decided to
stick with HP, according to Jo Schuda, a VA spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VA chose HP &#8220;again as the best value for the
government,&#8221; Schuda said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP, based in Palo Alto, California, beat five other
companies to win the work to provide veterans hospitals with
wireless tracking systems, according to VA documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology would help minimize lost equipment, track
whether medical devices are properly sterilized and identify
patients who may have received recalled products, according to
documents posted online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VA ordered HP to stop work on the project in June,
after Armonk, New York-based IBM protested the award. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s call for a
half percentage point interest-rate cut by India&#8217;s central bank
this month is gaining support in the swap market, where
borrowing costs fell for the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of derivative contracts that fix rates for a year
fell two basis points last quarter to 7.61 percent, taking the
drop since March to 42 basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. A similar measure rose 19 basis points to 3.34 percent in
China. Speculation that the Reserve Bank of India will ease
policy is strengthening after the government cut its estimate
for economic growth in the year through March to as little as
5.7 percent, the least in a decade, on Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said last month that policy
makers&#8217; focus needs to shift toward supporting the economy from
curbing inflation. Goldman Sachs forecasts the repurchase rate,
held at 8 percent since April, will be lowered to 7.5 percent at
the next review on Jan. 29, while BNP Paribas SA sees a 25 basis
point reduction. Eleven of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg see
a 50 basis point decrease by March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Indian markets are positioning for a rate-cutting cycle,
given the shift in RBI&#8217;s focus to growth from inflation,&#8221;
Nagaraj Kulkarni, a Singapore-based strategist at Standard
Chartered Plc, said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;We expect a 25
basis point reduction in the repo rate this quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-year swap rate has slid 67 basis points, or 0.67
percentage point, from its 2012 peak of 8.26 percent in
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure
declined seven basis points since Subbarao said Dec. 18 that
slowing inflation increases room for the central bank to ease
policy. Annual gains in the nation&#8217;s benchmark price index
slowed to 7.24 percent in November, the least since January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RBI has held its repo rate unchanged since April, when
it was lowered by 50 basis points in the first reduction since
2009. The benchmark was boosted by a record 375 basis points, or
3.75 percentage points, through 2010 and 2011 to contain the
fastest price increases among the largest emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In view of inflation pressures ebbing, monetary policy
has to increasingly shift focus and respond to the threats to
growth,&#8221; the RBI said in a statement on Dec. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Easing Cash &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap rates also declined as Subbarao took steps to ease a
cash squeeze at banks. Three-month interbank funding costs fell
by 92 basis points in 2012 to 8.92 percent as the RBI pumped
more than 2.7 trillion rupees into the financial system by
cutting lenders&#8217; reserve requirements and buying sovereign debt.
The monetary authority cut the proportion of deposits lenders
must set aside as reserves by 175 basis points last year to a
36-year low of 4.25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on 10-year government bonds slid 52 basis points
in 2012 as traders boosted rate-cut bets. The yield on the
benchmark 8.15 percent debt due June 2022 fell six basis points
today to 7.99 percent today, offering an extra amount of 629
basis points over U.S. Treasuries, while the rupee advanced 0.3
percent to 54.8150 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a constructive outlook on Indian government
bonds,&#8221; Standard Chartered&#8217;s Kulkarni said. &#8220;Bonds are lagging
the swap curve in pricing in forthcoming rate cuts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to insure the debt of government-controlled State
Bank of India (SBIN), a proxy for the sovereign, for five years slid
172 basis points last year to 223, according to data provider
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in privately negotiated markets. Credit-
default swaps for China fell 82 basis points to 65. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growth is a concern and expectations for a rate cut are
quite legitimate given that headline inflation is coming
lower,&#8221; Lakshmi Iyer, Mumbai-based head of fixed income at
Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. overseeing the equivalent of
$5.6 billion, said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;Markets are
pricing in a cut in the repo rate on Jan. 29 to 7.75 percent or
even 7.5 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accelerated
delivery of $65 million in stock awards to 10 executives,
including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, helping
them avoid higher tax rates that take effect this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awards are restricted stock granted for years prior to
2012, according to 10 separate filings made public at about 8
p.m. New York time on Dec. 31. Each executive surrendered 45
percent to 50 percent of their awards in order to pay taxes,
according to the filings. The firm&#8217;s stock climbed 41 percent in
2012, its first annual gain since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
typically delivers executives&#8217; restricted stock during January.
The decision to speed up the delivery came as the U.S. Congress
debated and ultimately passed a bill that would increase tax
rates on capital gains and on individuals who make taxable
income of $400,000 or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The December delivery of shares went to a wider group of
employees than the named executive officers&#8221; who were included
in the filings, said Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New
York-based firm. He declined to comment on the reason for the
accelerated delivery or on which other employees received stock
early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, has said he would be willing to pay higher
taxes if they were part of a fiscal compromise to reduce the
budget deficit. Today he praised the bill that passed the House
of Representatives yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Step Forward&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This agreement is a step forward to injecting growth and
investor confidence into the U.S. economy,&#8221; he said in an e-
mailed statement. &#8220;While more progress clearly will be needed,
particularly in regards to restraining the growth in government
spending, this measure lays the foundation for more economic
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein received 66,065 shares of restricted stock on
Dec. 31, worth $8.43 million at the closing share price that
day, according to a company filing. The filing shows that he
sold 33,245 shares for $126.24 apiece, although a footnote
explains that those shares were in fact retained by the company
&#8220;to satisfy withholding obligations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing Landscape &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Wall Street rivals took a different
approach to the changing tax landscape. Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF),
the investment bank that agreed in November to sell itself to
its biggest owner, Leucadia National Corp. (LUK), accelerated the
delivery of dividends to all shareholders, including executives,
on Dec. 31, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expedited the regular dividend payment for all
Jefferies shareholders in anticipation of increased rates,&#8221; the
New York-based firm said in a statement. &#8220;Our top executives
were treated identically to every other shareholder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the executives&#8217; dividends were awarded as deferred
stock, according to the filings. Those shares &#8220;will be taxed at
the higher rates when they ultimately vest,&#8221; the company said.
Jefferies CEO Richard Handler, 51, received 36,872 deferred
shares at $18.57 each, worth $684,713. Brian Friedman, 57,
chairman of Jefferies&#8217;s executive committee, got 9,321 shares at
that price, valued at $173,091. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary D. Cohn, 52, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s president and chief
operating officer, and David A. Viniar, 57, the firm&#8217;s chief
financial officer, received the same number of shares as
Blankfein and had the same amount withheld, according to
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surrendered Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other executives who received and surrendered shares
for withholding purposes were Vice Chairmen John S. Weinberg,
55, and J. Michael Evans, 55; Edith Cooper, the 51-year-old head
of human capital management; John F.W. Rogers, the firm&#8217;s 56-
year-old chief of staff; General Counsel Gregory K. Palm, 64;
Global Head of Compliance Alan M. Cohen, 62; and Chief
Accounting Officer Sarah Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is required to file disclosures of changes in
stock ownership by its 12 executive officers. The firm made no
disclosures of stock activity on Dec. 31 by Vice Chairman
Michael S. Sherwood, a 47-year-old British citizen based in
London, or by Mark Schwartz, the Hong Kong-based head of the
firm&#8217;s Asian business. Schwartz, a 58-year-old U.S. citizen,
rejoined the firm in June after 11 years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a table of stock delivered to each of the Goldman
Sachs executives and the amount surrendered for withholding
purposes, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and Barclays Plc (BARC) are among the first banks to
register swap-dealer divisions under the Dodd-Frank Act, which
requires higher capital, collateral and trading standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 65 trading units that have registered include the
biggest banks in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Switzerland
and Japan, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. The list, which is expected to grow, reflects
companies that had at least $8 billion in swap-dealing business
in October and had to register by the end of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is at the heart of financial reform: dealers
registering and coming under common-sense rules of business
practice, reporting, capital and margin and that the public gets
to see the actual transactions,&#8221; CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler
said in a telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank rules, more than two years in the making,
seek to improve oversight of a market that for three decades
largely escaped federal regulation. The law was enacted after
swap trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis and led to the
U.S. rescue of American International Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap dealers will eventually face the highest requirements
for capital and collateral to back their trades and will have
the stiffest reporting and trading standards. The financial
firms that dominate swap dealing generate more than $30 billion
in annual profit, according to an estimate from consulting firm
Oliver Wyman, a unit of Marsh  McLennan Cos. (MMC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full Force &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap dealers won&#8217;t immediately face the full force of Dodd-
Frank regulations, with capital and margin rules yet to be
completed by U.S. or international authorities. A requirement to
guarantee trades at central clearinghouses doesn&#8217;t take effect
in the U.S. until mid-March at the earliest for interest-rate
and credit trades. Rules governing swap-trading platforms have
yet to be completed. The CFTC also is still debating when Dodd-
Frank rules will apply to overseas trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their registration, swap dealers will begin reporting
interest-rate and credit trades to databases. &#8220;This is changed
market behavior,&#8221; Gensler said. &#8220;As of Monday, there was the
public seeing the transaction price and volume. We had never had
that before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of 65 entities includes the biggest U.S. swaps
dealers, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency. JPMorgan leads the list with $72 trillion in
derivatives contracts outstanding at the end of September,
according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) follows with $64 trillion and Citigroup Inc. (C) is
third-largest with $55 trillion. There&#8217;s no comparable ranking
for banks globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Six Divisions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list also includes six Goldman Sachs divisions,
including commodities trading arm J. Aron  Co. that was once
managed by Lloyd C. Blankfein, the bank&#8217;s CEO. Morgan Stanley
registered six entities, including London-based unit Morgan
Stanley  Co. International Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC had estimated that there would be about 125
entities registering as dealers. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s an initial list
and that there will be others,&#8221; Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies that lobbied on the swap dealer definition
including BP Plc, Shell Energy North America LP and Vitol Inc.
weren&#8217;t on the initial list. The CFTC in October delayed a
requirement to count energy trades guaranteed at clearinghouses
to determine if a company crossed the $8 billion threshold. &#8220;I
would anticipate over time that we would see some particularly
if people are transacting or dealing over $8 billion of swaps in
the bilateral world,&#8221; Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Traders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Parsons, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said he was surprised that Shell and BP weren&#8217;t on
the initial list because of the size of their derivatives-
trading businesses. &#8220;Presumably that will happen&#8221; as the list
grows, he said in a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;If it
doesn&#8217;t that will be very telling about the regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gensler said last March when the agency was preparing to
complete the rule defining swap dealers that it was &#8220;very
clear&#8221; the intent was to apply to financial and non-financial
firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the past some entities were left out of regulation
just because of what they called themselves,&#8221; Gensler said on
March 2. &#8220;I think it would be a mistake to end up with this
era&#8217;s Enron loophole, and something that might be a loophole for
others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, certain electronic markets were excluded from
commission oversight under the so-called Enron loophole, named
for the energy company that collapsed in late 2001. &#8220;I think it
would be a mistake to end up with what would be sort of this
era&#8217;s BP loophole,&#8221; Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s brokerage and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s asset-management division are among businesses ripe for divestiture if U.S. banks break up to improve stock prices, according to CLSA Ltd.&#8217;s Mike Mayo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s Latin America unit is another example of operations that have &#8220;unrealized value,&#8221; the analyst wrote in a note to clients today. Bank stock prices could double if risk and cost of capital at the firms were reduced, reversing past efforts to boost returns by taking on more risk, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The largest banks have underperformed not only on returns but also on efficiency, revenue, risk, transparency, reputation and stock price,&#8221; Mayo wrote. &#8220;When we ask, a large majority of investors indicate that breakups -- divestitures, downsizings and de-mergers -- would be good for stock prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal should be &#8220;orderly&#8221; scaling back to achieve &#8220;safe banks&#8221; that have less leverage and lower risk, Mayo said. Zurich-based UBS AG (UBSN)&#8217;s strategy of cutting costs by exiting most of its fixed-income business is a good example, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another approach would be de-mergers, Mayo wrote. After the introduction of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, which forced deposit-taking companies backed by government insurance to be separate from investment banks, price-to-book values surged, he said. The same thing could happen today, Mayo said, since many firms are trading below their book value. Book value represents the firm&#8217;s theoretical liquidation price, which is calculated by subtracting liabilities from assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Too Subsidized&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Time seems to be running out for managements to show that the valuation discounts in their stocks are only short term,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Investors are incentivized to act before the government, which can take action due to concerns that banks are too subsidized, too trouble prone, too big and too complex.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina- based Bank of America, declined to comment on the note, as did Citigroup&#8217;s Mark Costiglio and JPMorgan&#8217;s Joseph Evangelisti. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manuel Medina-Mora helps to oversee New York-based Citigroup&#8217;s Latin America division, which includes trading, consumer banking and transaction services businesses. Net income from continuing operations increased 7 percent to $2.66 billion for the first nine months of 2012 from a year earlier, according to a financial supplement. The unit had average assets of $169 billion at the end of September, according to the supplement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary Erdoes runs New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s asset-management unit, which oversaw about $1.4 trillion as of Sept. 30, according to a financial supplement. The division made a $1.22 billion profit for the first nine months of 2012, a 5.4 percent decline from the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Citi Holdings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investment and brokerage services at Bank of America, which includes Merrill Lynch, generated $8.5 billion of noninterest income in the first nine months of 2012, a 6.9 percent drop from the same period in 2011, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan has overseen the sale of more than $60 billion in assets since he took over in 2010. He has called his company the &#8220;poster child&#8221; of a financial firm that&#8217;s become smaller and less risky. The bank&#8217;s total assets at the end of September were $2.17 trillion, 2.4 percent less than a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank, had total assets of $1.93 trillion at the end of September, about the same as a year earlier. Assets at the lender&#8217;s &#8220;core&#8221; businesses increased 4 percent to $1.46 trillion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Citi Holdings division, which contains the firm&#8217;s unwanted investments, reduced assets to $171 billion at Sept. 30, a 31 percent decline compared to a year earlier. The firm also agreed last year to sell its portion of the brokerage joint venture it has with Morgan Stanley (MS) to the New York-based investment bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are each trading at a fraction of their tangible book value, while JPMorgan and New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are trading above those values, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matt Townsend" date="Jan 03, 2013  4:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-03/quiksilver-replaces-founder-and-ceo-with-disney-executive.html"><headline>Quiksilver Replaces Founder and CEO With Disney Executive</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Quiksilver Inc., the skate and surf
retailer, named Andy Mooney as president and chief executive
officer, replacing co-founder Bob McKnight after six years of
annual losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mooney, 57, recently was chairman of consumer products for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Huntington Beach, California-based Quiksilver
said in a statement. Mooney also spent two decades at Nike Inc.
in several roles, including chief marketing officer. McKnight,
59, who co-founded Quiksilver in 1976 and had been CEO since
1991, will become executive chairman, effective Jan. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiksilver, which sells products in 90 countries and has
more than 600 stores globally, has been posting annual net
losses since 2007 amid increasing competition. In the fiscal
year ended Oct. 31, sales rose 3.1 percent to $2.01 billion. The
net loss was $10.8 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 3.4 percent to $4.53 at the close in New
York. The stock has gained 21 percent during the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Steven Church" date="Jan 03, 2013  4:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-03/disney-seeks-to-halt-bankruptcy-sale-of-3-d-technology.html"><headline>Disney Seeks to Halt Bankruptcy Sale of 3-D Technology</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A Walt Disney Co. (DIS) unit asked a
federal judge to block a bankruptcy court ruling that would
allow another company to sell patents related to three-
dimensional movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production&#8217;s rights to
use the technology to convert traditional films into 3-D movies
will be harmed, the company said in its appeal yesterday in U.S.
District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute involves the shell company left in bankruptcy
by the collapse of Digital Domain Media Group Inc., the provider
of special effects for the movies &#8220;Transformers&#8221; and
&#8220;Titanic.&#8221; That shell, known as DDMG Estate, held an auction
for the patents last month that was won by RealD Inc. (RLD) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney claims it has the right to use the technology
because of agreements it signed with the original patent holder
in 2008 and 2009. The agreements allowed Disney to use the 3D
conversion patents on the films &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; and &#8220;G-
Force.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;G-Force&#8221; agreement granted Disney the right to keep
using the 3D patents, Burbank, California-based Disney claims in
its appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;In Perpetuity&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Dec. 10 ruling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Linehan Shannon disagreed with Disney&#8217;s position. The dispute raised the
question of whether Disney could &#8220;use that technology, gratis,
in perpetuity,&#8221; Shannon said in his ruling. He ruled the
company could not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his ruling, RealD won the auction with a bid of $5.45
million and Shannon later approved the sale, which hasn&#8217;t yet
closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sue L. Robinson agreed to hold a
telephone hearing tomorrow so Disney can try to persuade her to
overturn Shannon&#8217;s ruling and temporarily prevent DDMG from
closing the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDMG lawyer Debra Grassgreen, with the law firm Pachulski,

&lt;p&gt;Units of JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Barclays Plc (BARC) are among banks that
registered as swap dealers under the Dodd-Frank Act that
requires higher capital, collateral and trading standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of firms referred to as &#8220;provisionally
registered&#8221; included Societe Generale SA (GLE), Macquarie Bank Ltd.,
Newedge USA LLC, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Standard Chartered Bank (STAN),
according to the website of the National Futures Association. No
firms were listed as major swap participants, a lower threshold
under Dodd Frank for activity that may capture energy companies
or hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, more than two years in the making, will improve
oversight of a market that for three decades has largely escaped
federal regulation, Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Chairman Gary Gensler said Oct. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial firms that dominate swap dealing generate
more than $30 billion in annual profit, according to an estimate
from consulting firm Oliver Wyman, a unit of Marsh  McLennan
Cos. (MMC) Companies with $8 billion or more in dealing business must
register with the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest swaps dealer in the U.S. is JPMorgan, followed
by Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Too Big to Fail&#8217; Benefits Face Congressional Watchdog Scrutiny &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks&#8217; benefits from being &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; will be
examined by congressional watchdogs in response to a bipartisan
request from senators who say the government hasn&#8217;t done enough
to prevent future bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government Accountability Office said yesterday that it
plans to study the &#8220;economic benefit&#8221; banks such as JPMorgan
Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) in
response to a request from Senators David Vitter, a Louisiana
Republican, and Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitter and Brown made the request that the GAO look at bank
holding companies with assets more than $500 billion after
leaders in the Republican-controlled House refused to take up
their Senate bill, which passed unanimously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and regulators have said that Dodd-Frank, the
2010 measure enacted in response to the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression, ended too-big-to-fail by creating
ways to unwind complex banks without taxpayer assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study sought by Vitter and Brown would look at whether
the pricing of the banks&#8217; assets relative to their risk profile
results in a perception that they would get bailouts if needed,
whether they get favorable funding as a result of increased
credit ratings based on the view that they are too big to fail
and how they benefit from access to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s
discount window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine systemically important banks got a total of $125
billion in taxpayer aid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program
after a credit freeze following the September 2008 collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Egypt Religious Scholars to Review Draft Sukuk Law, MENA Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egypt&#8217;s Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar, Ahmed el-Tayeb, asked a
panel of senior religious scholars to issue its opinion about a
new draft law for sukuk, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported. President Mohamed Mursi has referred the draft to el-
Tayeb to determine how compliant it is with Islamic law, MENA
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry has asked for the quick implementation
of the law after it&#8217;s approved, according to MENA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSE&#8217;s Regulatory News Service Resumes Operation Following Glitch &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Stock Exchange Group Plc&#8217;s Regulatory News Service
resumed operation after a technical issue that disrupted
dissemination of company information to investors and traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Wisken, an RNS executive at LSE, described it
&#8220;connectivity issue.&#8221; RNS didn&#8217;t publish any release between 5
a.m. and 8:36 a.m. in London yesterday, the first trading day of
2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service carries almost 175,000 statements each year via
data vendors such as Thomson Reuters Corp. and Bloomberg LP, the
parent of Bloomberg News. LSE says it features more than 70
percent of price-sensitive U.K. announcements. Companies and
public-relations agencies pay to publish releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disruption yesterday came as LSE was considering
charging banks and brokers for the service. Data providers
already pay to redistribute it. As part of a consultation last
year on the workings of RNS, LSE asked to be provided with
users&#8217; details, sparking concern it will start charging them
because it&#8217;s unlikely to need the data for any other purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly listed companies in the U.K. must disseminate
statements through one of the seven approved Regulated
Information Services, or RISs, to ensure that investors receive
market-moving news at the same instant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RNS had a monopoly for regulatory statements until
2002, when the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority introduced
competition. At that point, LSE started to charge companies to
publish announcements, having previously provided the service
for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Niche Players and Big Banks Vie for Prepaid Debit Card Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allure of the fast-growing U.S. market for prepaid
debit cards is pitting niche players against financial giants
including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and American Express Co. (AXP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both factions want to sell more of the cards, a part of the
financial services business that holds as much as $1.7 billion
in potential fees for banks seeking new revenue streams as they
face growing competition and regulation. The Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau may write new rules for the cards. It sought
public input about the prepaid market in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myriad players, including a firm catering to recovering
drug addicts and alcoholics, are stepping up with their own
products on the theory that some consumers may pay a slight
premium for a card with novel functions, such as pictures of
celebrity investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players also face more regulation and small firms will
encounter pressure to consolidate as competition squeezes fees,
Madeline Aufseeser, senior analyst with the Boston-based Aite
Group, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and American Express are testing whether their
sheer size and efficiency can bring greater market share by
offering lower fees. Smaller players hope to fill smaller market
niches and leave the nuts and bolts of the cards to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepaid cards can take different forms, though they share
the quality that consumers usually can&#8217;t spend more than has
been deposited onto the cards. One type of prepaid card mimics a
checking account, allowing consumers to load and reload funds,
have paychecks deposited directly, make purchases and withdraw
money from ATMs. Employees can also get paid on a separate
employer-issued card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are projected to increase purchases made with
prepaid cards by 5.3 percent annually to $139.4 billion in 2017,
according to Beth Robertson, director of payments research at
Pleasanton, California-based Javelin Strategy  Research Inc.
Aufseeser of Aite said the market, including general purpose and
payroll cards, could reach $168 billion by 2016, with about 1
percent of that going to fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OFI AM Fined by AMF For &#8216;Madoff Risk,&#8217; CityWire Global Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFI Asset Management was fined EU300,000 by Autorite des
Marches Financieres, the French market regulator, for &#8220;failings
in its due diligence&#8221; leading it to hold funds linked to
convicted con artist Bernard Madoff, CityWire Global reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMF began an investigation in mid-2009 and found that at
the time the Madoff Ponzi scheme had been discovered in 2008,
&#8220;four funds from OFI&#8217;s alternative multimanagement division
were invested in Madoff vehicles,&#8221; the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator determined that AMF showed a &#8220;lack of
professionalism and diligence&#8221; in monitoring the funds,
according to CityWire. The AMF also fined two directors at the
time of the events, the paper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings/Executive Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Sped Up $65 Million in Stock Awards to Dec. 31 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. accelerated delivery of $65
million in stock awards to 10 executives, including Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, helping them avoid higher
tax rates that take effect this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awards are of restricted stock granted for years prior
to 2012, according to 10 separate filings made public at about 8
p.m. New York time on Dec. 31. Each executive sold between 45
percent and 50 percent of their stock in order to pay taxes,
according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
typically delivers executives&#8217; restricted stock during the month
of January. The decision to speed up this year&#8217;s awards came as
the U.S. Congress debated and ultimately passed a bill that
would increase tax rates on capital gains and on individuals who
make taxable income of $400,000 or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The December delivery of shares went to a wider group of
employees than the named executive officers&#8221; who were included
in the filings, Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-
based firm, said. He declined to comment on the reason for the
accelerated delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing included a table showing the stock delivered to
each of the executives and the amount sold for withholding
purposes, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) told clients
to bet on Citigroup Inc. (C) shares before fourth-quarter earnings
later this month as new Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat
cuts costs and withdraws from some markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy call options on shares in Citigroup
before the bank announces its results Jan. 17, Goldman Sachs
said today in a note to clients. Calls are contracts that
provide the right to buy shares at a certain price. The New
York-based firm also added Citigroup to its &#8220;conviction buy
list&#8221; and said shares could rise to $49 within a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbat, 52, who replaced Vikram Pandit in October, is
laying off thousands of workers and pulling out of some
countries as he seeks to reduce costs at Citigroup. His plans,
announced last month, make the New York-based bank the &#8220;best
large-cap restructuring story,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts led by
Richard Ramsden said in another note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under new CEO Michael Corbat, we believe Citi is poised
to improve returns and increase efficiency,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. &#8220;Citi shares are mispriced given the company&#8217;s core
earnings power, especially considering further restructuring
could generate additional upside for shares.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup climbed 2.5 percent to close at $42.43 in New
York, outpacing the 1.7 percent gain of the 24-company KBW Bank
Index. (BKX) The shares have increased 7.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
said Senior Vice President Mike Daniels is retiring after 36
years with the company, leaving two lieutenants in charge of
services, the company&#8217;s biggest division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels, 58, will leave Armonk, New York-based IBM on March
31. Instead of replacing him, Erich Clementi, senior vice
president for global technology services, and Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president for global business services,
will now report to the chief executive officer, said Ed Barbini,
a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels ran a business that accounted for about 60 percent
of revenue at IBM, the world&#8217;s largest provider of computer
services. He also was seen as a potential CEO candidate before
Ginni Rometty took the post a year ago. Daniels made his mark as
a cost cutter, helping boost IBM&#8217;s margins in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels joined IBM straight out of college, with a
trajectory similar to Rometty&#8217;s through experience in sales and
services. In 2005, when then-CEO Sam Palmisano split the
services business into consulting and technology units, Daniels
first took over only the latter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost Cutter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels fired thousands of employees and moved jobs to
lower-cost regions such as India to trim expenses and boost
profits. IBM has a five-year plan to reach annual operating
earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015, up from $13.44 in
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty took the reins at IBM in January of last year,
becoming the company&#8217;s ninth CEO and first female leader. In
October, she became chairman of IBM&#8217;s board, replacing
Palmisano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her tenure, she has filled two other senior
executive positions with internal candidates. Bruno Di Leo took
the head of sales job she held before becoming CEO. Van
Kralingen was promoted to head of business services a year ago,
replacing Frank Kern, who retired after 35 years at the company.
Kern in October became CEO at Aricent Group, a technology
consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 0.7 percent to $193.99 at the close in New
York. The stock climbed 4.2 percent in 2012, marking its fourth
straight year of gains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and four partners will spend about $14 billion to develop the Hebron oil field off the coast of Canada that has lain fallow since its discovery more than three decades ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The field, located about 350 kilometers (218 miles) southeast of St John&#8217;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, will produce more than 700 million barrels of crude during its lifespan, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today. At current prices, that oil would be worth about $77.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daily output from the field is expected to peak at 150,000 barrels after production begins in 2017, Exxon said. Discovered in 1980, Hebron is one of a string of multibillion-dollar projects Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is pursuing to reverse production declines. Exxon&#8217;s output has fallen five straight quarters, the longest run of declines since 2008-2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon has been growth-challenged for some time,&#8221; Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said in a telephone interview today. Hebron can &#8220;potentially help jump-start growth going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon is operator of the Hebron development and owns a 36 percent stake, according to the project&#8217;s website. Other partners include Chevron Corp. (CVX), Suncor Energy Inc. (SU), Statoil ASA (STL) and Nalcor Energy Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hebron field is located about 30 kilometers southeast of the Exxon-operated Hibernia development, the largest single source of crude in Newfoundland and Labrador province. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous plans to develop Hebron collapsed in 2006 amid a dispute with provincial officials over ownership stakes. Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, later ceded control of the project to Exxon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oil production from Newfoundland fields declined 29 percent during the first nine months of 2012, the provincial department of finance said on its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 0.5 percent to $88.96 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Tom Giles" date="Jan 04, 2013 12:42 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-04/microsoft-windows-notebook-sales-drop-during-holidays-npd-says.html"><headline>Microsoft Windows Notebook Sales Drop During Holidays, NPD Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Windows notebook
sales declined during the year-end holiday season as consumers
shunned traditional computers and flocked instead to other types
of electronics, according to NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows notebook holiday unit sales fell 11 percent,
according to the Port Washington, New York-based researcher.
Sales of Windows notebooks that cost less than $500 fell 16
percent, NPD said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the new Windows 8 software failed to
stoke much demand for notebooks boasting Microsoft&#8217;s flagship
operating system, NPD said. The figures released today exclude
tablets, such as Microsoft&#8217;s Surface and Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite the hype, and hope, around the launch of Windows
8, the new operating system did little to boost holiday sales or
improve the year-long Windows notebook sales decline,&#8221; the
researcher wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple MacBook sales also declined 6 percent during the
period, according to NPD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s inspector general has threatened to punish JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for failing to turn over documents to regulators investigating the bank&#8217;s ties to Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inspector General Eric Thorson gave the largest U.S. bank a Jan. 11 deadline to cooperate with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency probe or risk sanctions for impeding the agency&#8217;s oversight. JPMorgan, according to the Dec. 21 letter, contends the information is protected by attorney-client privilege. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thorson&#8217;s letter didn&#8217;t spell out what documents the OCC is seeking or the focus of its investigation. Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence after confessing to the fraud that once claimed to have $65 billion in customer assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The previously undisclosed OCC probe adds to the lender&#8217;s troubles in Washington, where several agencies and lawmakers are investigating the bank&#8217;s loss of at least $6.2 billion on botched derivatives trades. The losses have prompted regulators including the Federal Reserve to consider tightening proposed restrictions on proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said the bank &#8220;will of course continue to work together with our regulators&#8221; on the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA), the
Israeli maker of soda machines trading at the most expensive
level since February, will extend last year&#8217;s 37 percent climb
as its U.S. business grows, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company, based in Airport City, Israel,
climbed 12 percent last week in New York to $48.69, the highest
level since Aug. 15, 2011. It was the biggest gainer on the
Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN) of the largest U.S.-traded
Israeli companies, which rallied 1.6 percent in its first weekly
advance since November. Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) rose 3.2
percent Jan. 4, trimming its slide in the week to 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SodaStream, which sells its machines, gas canisters and
flavors in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), trades at 18.3 times estimated
earnings, the highest level since Feb. 29. The U.S. will
contribute 39 percent of SodaStream&#8217;s sales this year, according
to JPMorgan, from 29 percent in 2011. The company will post a 44
percent jump in adjusted net income in the first quarter, the
median of analysts&#8217; estimates shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the top line continues to grow, and more U.S. revenue
switches to canisters and flavors, the profitability in the U.S.
business will improve,&#8221; John Faucher, an analyst at JPMorgan
who rates SodaStream a buy, said by phone in New York Jan. 4.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a trend that benefits SodaStream.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index ended last week at
86.78. Israel&#8217;s TA-25 Index (TA-25) rose 0.7 percent to 1,218.84 at
10:57 a.m. in Tel Aviv. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Income &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SodaStream, which is counting on a commercial during next
month&#8217;s Super Bowl to boost U.S. sales, will post net income in
the first quarter of $14.6 million, according to the average of
four analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the
first quarter will rise 23 percent, according to the average of
five forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock is trading at its widest premium versus the
average valuation for companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index
since at least February, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SodaStream began to roll out its products in May at 2,900
stores owned by Wal-Mart, the world&#8217;s largest retailer, while
its machines have also been available since at least the second
quarter at Target Corp., Staples Inc. and Bed Bath  Beyond
Inc., as well as department stores owned by J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and
Macy&#8217;s Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the shares have soared, bets on its decline have
decreased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SodaStream&#8217;s 9.6 percent rally in the second half of 2012
came as short interest on the stock declined to 8.1 million
shares, or 45 percent of the company&#8217;s float, at the end of
December from 10.8 million shares in May, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fad Concerns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been shorting SodaStream on concern the
product, which carbonates tap water, is a fad and that revenue
growth will slow as copycat machines and products encroach on
market share, Faucher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellanox plunged last week in the U.S. to $52.31, after the
Yokneam Elit, Israel-based developer of data management
technology cut its fourth-quarter sales forecast to between $119
million and $121 million, compared with revenue guidance given
in October of $145 million to $150 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company rose Jan. 4 after Chief Executive
Officer Eyal Waldman said in an interview after markets closed
the day before that he expects $150 million in quarterly sales
to again become the &#8220;base line sometime in 2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellanox&#8217;s revenue in the third quarter reached a record
$156.5 million. The shares in Tel Aviv rose 3.7 percent to
197.4, or the equivalent of $52.32, this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT), which develops products to track
wireless traffic, tumbled 16 percent last week to $14.63 in New
York after Oppenheimer  Co. said fourth-quarter sales will miss
analysts&#8217; estimates. Shares of Hod Hasharon, Israel-based Allot
traded in Tel Aviv lost 8.7 percent this morning to 55.69
shekels, or the equivalent of $14.76, heading for the lowest
close since November 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ittai Kidron, a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer,
wrote in a Jan. 3 report that Allot will report fourth-quarter
sales of $28.6 million and net income of $5 million, missing the
mean for revenue of $31.09 million and profit of $5.5 million of
11 analysts&#8217; estimates collated by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
