&lt;p&gt;Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) is hiring Don Mattrick, the former head of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s entertainment division, as its new chief executive officer, seeking to reignite growth at the game developer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mattrick will succeed Mark Pincus, who will remain chairman of the board and chief product officer, Zynga said in a statement today. Mattrick, who will also join the board, starts July 8, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mattrick faces the challenge of turning around Zynga, which is suffering amid rising competition from upstarts such as King.com as well as a shift toward gaming on handheld devices. His experience in the industry, which includes stints at Microsoft and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA), may help San Francisco-based Zynga find new lines of revenue outside of Facebook Inc. (FB), where it is losing users, according to Michael Hickey, an analyst at National Alliance Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does potentially demonstrate that he believes they have a compelling growth profile,&#8221; Denver-based Hickey said in an interview. &#8220;He also adds credibility to an executive team that has been significantly compromised after their core Facebook business has deteriorated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pincus will take a diminished role at the company he founded, a sign that his hard-charging management style and negotiating prowess -- once described by Google Inc. (GOOG) Chairman Eric Schmidt as &#8220;fearsome&#8221; -- may have clashed with the needs of a large, publicly traded business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliquis, the blood thinner sold by
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), was as good as the
current standard of care in preventing blood clots and with
fewer bleeding complications, according to a study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a trial of 5,400 people, the drug was found to be
equivalent to the generic warfarin at preventing new clots and
death in patients who had a venous thromboembolism, or VTE. In
VTE, clots form in the body&#8217;s large arteries, often in the legs
or pelvis. The clots can then break off and travel into the
lungs, causing a potentially deadly pulmonary embolism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis is one of three in a new class of blood thinners
that may replace warfarin, a half-century old therapy that needs
regular monitoring and requires patients to avoid certain foods.
Bristol-Myers and Pfizer will use the results of the study to
apply to regulators for using Eliquis in short- and long-term
treatment of VTE. It&#8217;s already approved for stroke prevention in
patients with irregular heartbeat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have data to support a real change in clinical
practice,&#8221; said Giancarlo Agnelli, a professor of internal
medicine at Italy&#8217;s University of Perugia who led the trial.
Current therapy &#8220;has some limitations,&#8221; he said. With Eliquis,
&#8220;we have a new compound and a new way to give it that&#8217;s much,
much easier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers and Pfizer, both based in New York, sponsored
the trial. It is being published in the New England Journal of
Medicine and presented at the Congress of the International
Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $27.78 at the
close in New York. Bristol-Myers rose less than 1 percent to
$44.82. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Study Findings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study were given Eliquis or warfarin for
six months after being diagnosed with a VTE that came on
suddenly, instead of from an expected cause such as surgery or
childbirth. Of the patients on Eliquis, 2.3 percent died or had
another clot, compared with 2.7 percent on warfarin. The
warfarin patients also typically received heparin, another blood
thinner typically given in a hospital, in the early part of
treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This population is of very high risk of recurrence,&#8221;
Agnelli, referring to a deep-vein thrombosis, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;If you have deep-vein thrombosis after
surgery, the recurrence rate is much lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis was better than warfarin in terms of safety, the
trial also found. In the study, 0.6 percent of patients on
Eliquis had major bleeding -- for example inside the eye, skull,
gastro-intestinal tract or in other major organs -- compared
with 1.8 percent of patients on warfarin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competing Drugs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xarelto, a competing drug sold by Leverkusen, Germany-based
Bayer AG (BAYN) and New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson  Johnson (JNJ),
already is approved for VTE. Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s Pradaxa,
also one of the new wave of blood thinners, isn&#8217;t yet approved
in the U.S. for VTE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New treatments for VTE can help save money because they can
shorten the time patients are taking the heparin, often the
first treatment they get before warfarin, and staying in the
hospital, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann 
Co. &#8220;Venous thrombosis treatment with Xarelto is a big cost-saver for hospitals, driving incremental access and uptake,&#8221; he
said in an April 5 note to clients. &#8220;Success in VTE treatment
could be a major boon to BMY/PFE&#8217;s Eliquis,&#8221; Fernandez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 300,000 to 900,000 people in the U.S. have a venous
thromboembolism each year, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. About half of those occur
after a hospital stay or surgery, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), facing lackluster
sales of its Surface tablet, will begin selling the devices to
large businesses through resellers like CDW Corp. in a bid to
improve sales by targeting corporate customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will also start a new program called
AppsForSurface to provide corporate software makers with devices
and funding to get them to adapt their programs to Surface.
Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS) and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Co.
are among those who have signed up, Microsoft said in a blog
post today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to broaden the audience for Surface to
corporate and education customers after the tablet, released in
October, met poor demand from consumers. The company sold
900,000 Surfaces in each of the fourth and first quarters,
according to researcher IDC. Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG,
had initially projected Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
would sell 2 million units in the December quarter alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had expected greater initial sales as well.
While Microsoft didn&#8217;t give a forecast and hasn&#8217;t disclosed how
many Surface units have been sold, the company placed an initial
order for 3 million devices from the manufacturer, people
familiar with the matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s left Microsoft struggling to find groups and types
of customer who may be ripe targets for Surface. Last month the
company announced a price cut to $199 from a $499 starting price
for schools purchasing the Surface RT model directly from
Microsoft. That offer runs until the end of August and is
available in 26 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now Surface has been sold only in retail stores and
apps have focused on consumers and individual business users
rather than corporate programs, making the device less appealing
for wide-scale company use and harder to purchase if a
corporation wanted a large number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron stressed
that a U.K. proposal to levy bonds on &#8220;high-risk&#8221; migrants is
only at the trial stage after a backlash from countries
including India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans to make some migrants pay 3,000 pounds ($4,600)
before entering the U.K., announced by Home Secretary Theresa May last month, provoked an angry reaction in the countries that
would be affected. The proposal is designed to stop short-term
visitors from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Ghana and
Sri Lanka from overstaying in Britain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Tory-led coalition government wants to get net
migration to below 100,000, it is also seeking to boost trade
ties with economies such as India, set to overtake China as the
most populous nation, as key export markets in the euro region
remain mired in recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bonds will be a pilot scheme,&#8221; Cameron said at a
news conference today in Astana, Kazakhstan, alongside President
Nursultan Nazarbayev. &#8220;We want genuine students and visitors.
We don&#8217;t want to have people who are effectively economic
migrants. That was what we saw under the last government when
immigration got out of control.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) extended Robert Iger&#8217;s tenure as chief executive officer of the world&#8217;s largest
entertainment company to June 2016, a move that delays his
planned succession for 15 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 62, will now continue in both the chairman and CEO
positions until mid-2016, Burbank, California-based Disney said
yesterday in a statement. He was scheduled to relinquish the CEO
title on April 1, 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company cited a need for continuity and Iger&#8217;s record
of success. Analysts have long cited Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and Tom Staggs, who leads the parks and resorts division,
as probable replacements. The two swapped roles in January 2010.
This year, Disney amended its compensation plan to allow for the
creation of new senior positions, such as chief operating
officer or president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Either the company does not believe that its current CEO
candidates are ready to take the helm or that Iger is not ready
to step down,&#8221; said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer
of Lisle, Illinois-based OakBrook Investments LLC, which
reported owning about 441,000 Disney shares as of June 28. &#8220;I
doubt the Disney board would force Iger to retire at this point
anyway.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company credits Iger&#8217;s leadership for total shareholder
return of 193 percent during his tenure, beating the 54 percent
return for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, said Orin Smith,
Disney&#8217;s independent lead director. Iger was named CEO in
September 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now, Disney will continue to have the full benefit of Mr.
Iger&#8217;s leadership as CEO and chairman for the duration of his
tenure,&#8221; Smith said in the statement, adding that the board
remains focused on finding a successor when his term ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.1 percent to $63.26 at the close in New York.
The shares have risen 27 percent this year, compared with 13
percent for the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said there will be no change to the terms of
Iger&#8217;s compensation. He earned $40.2 million in 2012 in total
compensation last year, based on regulatory reporting rules, a
20 percent increase from the previous year. The company says 92
percent of his 2012 pay was performance based. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny Depp&#8217;s &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; opening in theaters tomorrow to negative reviews and tough competition, looks poised to become Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s biggest flop since last year&#8217;s $200 million loss from &#8220;John Carter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie, based on the 1930s radio show and 1950s TV series, is the type of project that&#8217;s worked well in Hollywood of late. It features well-known characters and a proven star in Depp, with potential for sequels and merchandise sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Disney will struggle to turn a profit, after the budget climbed to $225 million and the film earned mostly unfavorable early reviews. The task is more challenging because &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; opens on a competitive summer weekend, against Universal Pictures&#8217; animated &#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; and holdovers that include &#8220;Monsters University,&#8221; from Disney&#8217;s Pixar, and the zombie thriller &#8220;World War Z.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a huge gamble,&#8221; said Doug Creutz, an analyst with Cowen  Co. in San Francisco, who predicts a $100 million write-off for Disney. &#8220;You need the film to be really good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics have been harsh. Of 62 reviews compiled by the website Rottentomatoes.com, 79 percent were labeled negative. That compares with 49 percent &#8220;rotten&#8221; out of 218 reviews of &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; Disney&#8217;s March 2012 sci-fi fantasy about a Civil War veteran transported to Mars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the owner of Marvel Entertainment, acquired the rights to four Marvel superhero movies held by Viacom Inc. (VIAB)&#8217;s Paramount Pictures, the studio that released the films from 2008 to 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement covers the first two &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; movies, &#8220;Thor&#8221; and &#8220;Captain America: The First Avenger,&#8221; according to a statement today from Burbank, California-based Disney and Los Angeles-based Paramount. Terms weren''t given. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal gives Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, more control over Marvel&#8217;s film library as it seeks to expand those characters into television shows and theme-park attractions. Disney acquired the comic book and movie company in December 2009 for $4.2 billion in cash and stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney later purchased the distribution and marketing rights to 2012&#8217;s &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers&#8221; and this year&#8217;s &#8220;Iron Man 3.&#8221; Both were held by Paramount. Disney paid Paramount at least $115 million at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers&#8221; was the top-grossing film last year, with $1.5 billion in worldwide ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher. &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; leads this year with $1.2 billion in worldwide box office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp (SNE). makes &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221; movies under a longstanding agreement with Marvel. Amy Pascal, co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said in a May 22 interview with the fan website Ain&#8217;t it Cool News, that the studio had no intention of selling Spider-Man rights. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;21st Century Fox has made the &#8220;X-Men&#8221; and &#8220;Wolverine&#8221; films under a similar arrangement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.1 percent to $63.26 at the close in New York. The stock is up 27 percent this year. Viacom, based in New York, declined 0.4 percent to $67.54 and is up 28 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jonathan Browning" date="Jul 02, 2013  4:42 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-02/goldman-sachs-names-hitchner-as-asia-president-replacing-ryan.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Names Hitchner as Asia Head, Replacing Ryan</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top
underwriter of share sales in Asia excluding Japan this year,
said Ken Hitchner will become president for the region after
David Ryan retires later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitchner, who currently runs health-care banking and is co-head of the technology, media and telecommunications group, will
be based in Hong Kong, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an
e-mailed statement. Ryan, 43, will become a senior director, the
bank said, without providing a reason for his retirement after
two years in the role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm, which this year ceded its position as
the top mergers adviser for Asia excluding Japan, hired Kate Richdale from Morgan Stanley (MS) in March to strengthen investment
banking services. Hitchner will also work with Mark Schwartz,
who rejoined the firm last year as chairman of the Asia-Pacific
business, and Masa Mochida, who oversees Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs has been pretty good at regularly rotating
people through the top positions,&#8221; said Philippe Espinasse, a
Hong Kong-based former equity capital markets banker at UBS AG
and Nomura Holdings Inc. Hiring someone with mergers experience,
&#8220;is probably a function of the maturity of the Asian market
now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Navy Pilot &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue for Goldman Sachs in Asia climbed 16 percent to
$5.39 billion last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitchner, a 53-year-old former U.S. Navy pilot, has been
with Goldman Sachs since 1991. As a banker in the health-care
industry for more than 15 years, he has advised clients
including Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) on its $19.7 billion takeover of
Synthes Inc. in 2012. He will oversee the day-to-day operations
of Asia-Pacific businesses, excluding Japan, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser for equity and
equity-linked offerings in Asia, excluding Japan, this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s up from No. 5
last year, the data show. The bank slipped to fourth in Asian
MA advisory this year, excluding Japan, after having held the
top spot for the past two years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan, a former head of the Asian financing group, was named
co-president of the bank&#8217;s Asian operations in 2011, along with
Yusuf Alireza, who has since left the firm. During his tenure,
the bank exited its seven-year investment in Industrial 
Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest lender by
market value. He has been with the firm since 1992. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission dropped an investigation of a key witness in its
fraud case against former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive
Fabrice Tourre, according to a lawyer for the witness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre faces a July 15 trial on the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit over his
role in structuring a collateralized debt obligation known as
Abacus 2007-AC1. His lawyers are seeking information from former
ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. executive Laura Schwartz about an
SEC notice she received earlier this year that the regulator may
bring an action against her unrelated to Abacus. She is expected
to testify against Tourre, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, in a June 27 letter, told Schwartz&#8217;s lawyer that
its New York field office completed its investigation and didn&#8217;t
intend to recommend action against her, the lawyer, Robin
Alperstein, said in a letter to the judge overseeing the Tourre
case yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC says Tourre misled ACA and other investors in
Abacus, claiming he didn&#8217;t disclose that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. Inc. helped pick the securities underlying the CDO with the
intention of betting against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds packaged
into new securities. Interest payments on the underlying bonds
or loans are used to pay investors. The Abacus entity was a
synthetic CDO, meaning its cash flow came from derivatives that
referenced mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in 2010 agreed to pay $550 million to settle
SEC claims against it in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will have
another two years to separate derivatives trading from units
that get federal backing, according to a letter to the bank
posted on the Federal Reserve website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed said in the letter that the New York-based bank
must determine whether to kill the swaps activity or move it to
properly capitalized affiliates. Under the Dodd-Frank Act rule
requiring the swaps push-out, interest-rate and some credit
swaps can still be traded inside the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The potential impact of granting a 24-month transition
period is less adverse than the potential impact of denying the
transition period,&#8221; Robert Frierson, secretary of the board,
wrote in the letter dated yesterday. Giving Goldman Sachs the
transition time lowers &#8220;the probability of operational problems
and market disruption,&#8221; Frierson wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank overhauled swaps trading in an effort to make
the industry less vulnerable to a crisis such as the one that
struck in 2008. The law requires equity, some commodity and non-cleared credit derivatives be pushed out of bank units with
access to deposit insurance and the Fed&#8217;s discount window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on the extension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, formerly one of JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s top merger advisers, said the bank cleared him in
an internal investigation before the U.K. finance regulator
fined him for disclosing inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan believed that I had not done market abuse,&#8221;
Hannam testified at a London court today, where he is fighting
the 450,000-pound ($687,000) fine. &#8220;They carried out this very
serious investigation and I assure you that if they had found I
had&#8221; broken any regulatory rules, &#8220;I would not have been an
employee there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two e-mail messages form the basis of a proposed civil
market-abuse fine against Hannam by the U.K. Financial Conduct
Authority, which considers the content insider information.
Hannam, formerly JPMorgan&#8217;s global chairman of equity capital
markets, said the notes were in the &#8220;best interest&#8221; of his
client, Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL), and is challenging the sanction at a
court hearing at the Upper Tribunal in London that started
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam, who resigned from the New York-based bank after the
fine, is one of the highest-profile finance workers the
regulator has targeted. Hannam was among the bankers advising
Xstrata Plc before it was acquired by Glencore International

BlackBerry''s Stumble Gives Microsoft a Leg Up in Smartphones</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Companies usually don''t aspire to be in third place. But in the competitive smartphone market, Microsoft will happily occupy that spot instead of BlackBerry, which is stumbling with its new touch-screen handset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my colleague Peter Burrows reported, Google and Apple''s dominant positions in the mobile market have left corporate IT departments wondering which company -- BlackBerry or Microsoft -- will be the third option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That question may have been answered last week, when Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry disclosed weaker-than-expected sales of the Z10. The new model was designed to take on high-end devices such as the iPhone and Samsung''s Galaxy S4, which runs on Google''s Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete Devenyi, senior vice president of enterprise software for BlackBerry, said corporate adoption of software for managing BlackBerry phones has been "very much in accordance with our expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry''s latest struggles boost the likelihood of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone becoming a credible third alternative, according to Bob Tinker, CEO of MobileIron, which makes smartphone-management software used by 5,000 companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of our customers have been planning to support three mobile operating systems -- iOS, Android and either Windows Phone or BlackBerry,&#8221; Tinker said. &#8220;The recent results indicate that BlackBerry is not going to be the third.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, the bronze medal never looked so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wizz Air, Eastern Europe&#8217;s biggest budget carrier, has appointed Barclays Plc (BARC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. to manage an initial public offering in London, according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sale of the carrier, created in 2003, may happen as early as the second half of this year, one of the people said, asking not to be named as the plans aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies including state-run U.K. postal service Royal Mail Group Ltd. and vodka maker Stock Spirits Group are lining up IPOs in London as global investors return to the market. The carrier faces heightened competition in some of its markets as Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA), Europe&#8217;s biggest discount airline, adds more bases in the east of the continent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Wizz Air in Geneva declined to comment on the proposed sale. Spokesmen for Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wizz Air has a fleet of more than 40 Airbus SAS single-aisle planes, with an average age of about three years, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Issuers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa raised about $12 billion in IPOs this year, more than double what they sold in the same period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elisa Martinuzzi" date="Jul 04, 2013  8:46 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-04/deutsche-bank-needs-capital-amid-higher-leverage-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Deutsche Bank Needs Capital Amid Higher Leverage, JPMorgan Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) may face a capital
shortfall of 12.3 billion euros ($16 billion) under a proposal
on leverage by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel proposal, which is designed to include assets
that are off banks&#8217; books, would lead to a 33 percent average
increase in the balance sheet among the global investment banks
tracked by JPMorgan, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein in London
wrote in a report to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank &#8220;needs to raise capital in our view&#8221; or
reduce assets by 409 billion euros to reach the 3 percent
leverage ratio target set by Basel, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Streckert, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank, said the company generally doesn&#8217;t comment on
analyst research notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global regulators are increasingly looking at leverage, in
addition to measures based on risk weightings assigned to
different assets, to gauge banks&#8217; financial strength. Their
focus intensified after some banks improved capital ratios
following the financial crisis by altering internal models or
cutting risk-weighted assets without correspondingly shrinking
their balance sheets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the same Basel measure, Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain&#8217;s third-biggest lender by market value, will have a leverage ratio of
3.5 percent by 2015, the analysts estimated. Still, the bank may
also need to raise capital to meet the U.K.&#8217;s Prudential
Regulation Authority&#8217;s leverage requirements, according to
JPMorgan. The bank may need 7 billion pounds ($10.6 billion), or
a 240 billion-pound asset reduction, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG), Europe&#8217;s second-biggest carmaker, rose the most in almost seven weeks after
analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the unprofitable
company is likely to beat a goal of reducing cash consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peugeot jumped as much as 8.1 percent to 6.73 euros as of
and was trading up 8 percent at 10:59 a.m. in Paris, the
steepest intraday increase since May 17. Volume was 89 percent
of the three-month daily average. The stock has gained 23
percent this year, recovering from a 23-year low in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reorganization measures taken by Paris-based Peugeot and
its Faurecia (EO) car-parts unit may lead to negative operational
free cash flow of 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion), narrower
than the manufacturer&#8217;s forecast of cash consumption at 1.5
billion euros, Stefan Burgstaller, a London-based analyst at
Goldman Sachs, said in a note to clients dated yesterday.
Europe&#8217;s economy may be improving, helping revive industrywide
car sales, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised its recommendation on Peugeot shares
to buy from neutral and added it to the bank&#8217;s &#8220;conviction
list.&#8221; Burgstaller also increased the stock-price estimate by
8.4 percent to 9 euros a share from 8.30 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of the Peugeot 308 hatchback and Citroen DS
models is struggling to return to profit as the European car
market heads into a sixth consecutive year of contraction.
Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin, who started his
second four-year term in June, is seeking to end cash burn at
the company by the end of 2014, after the carmaker consumed 200
million euros a month last year. The strategy includes expanding
sales outside Europe, eliminating 11,200 jobs in France by 2015
and shutting a factory near Paris. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the third-largest manager of Japanese equity offerings this year, is
urging companies to sell shares and meet renewed investor demand
for the nation&#8217;s stocks under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makoto Ito, co-head of the bank&#8217;s financing group in Tokyo,
plans to visit senior executives at more than 15 Japanese firms
this week to propose that they consider raising funds, he said
in an interview on July 1. Ito met global investors last week in
Hong Kong and Singapore who manage more than 100 trillion yen
($1 trillion) in assets, he said, declining to name any of the
companies or investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentsu Inc. (4324) and Suntory Beverage  Food Ltd. (2587) are among
Japanese companies that are funding expansion abroad by issuing
shares. The nation&#8217;s equity offerings more than quadrupled to
2.7 trillion yen in the first half of 2013, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Ito, who was pessimistic on the market after
stocks plunged since May, now says second-half sales will top
the 1.5 trillion yen raised in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Global investors still have the appetite and a
constructive view of Japan even under turbulent and uncertain
circumstances,&#8221; Ito said after meeting with U.S. and Asian
sovereign funds, hedge funds and asset managers on June 27 and
28. &#8220;Japanese firms are becoming more decisive to raise funds
for investment and acquisitions for growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for gay marriage by companies as varied as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) is gathering steam to change policies in states that bar same-sex couples from tying the knot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two U.S. Supreme Court decisions on June 26 heartened supporters of the cause while showing an increased willingness of business to back the effort. In one case, more than 200 companies signed a brief against a federal law that denied benefits to same-sex couples. Five years ago, only a handful had lobbied against California&#8217;s Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriages, the target of the high court&#8217;s other decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;State legislators stand to feel the heat as more businesses speak out against laws in states including Texas, Florida and Michigan that recognize only heterosexual marriage. While fewer than half the companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 (SPX) are based in states that allow gays to wed, most already have policies that ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies do have the choice where they locate, where they set up shop,&#8221; said Kellie McElhaney, founding faculty director of the Center for Responsible Business at the University of California Berkeley. Local policies on sexual orientation &#8220;will eventually become part of the choice process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is the latest
international bank after Citigroup Inc. (C) and Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN) to expand business in Iraq as OPEC&#8217;s second-largest producer
boosts crude oil output and rebuilds its economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan signed a one-year agreement yesterday to help the
Trade Bank of Iraq finance imports of goods and services, John Gibbons, managing director and EMEA regional executive for the
New York-based bank, said in an interview in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our focus is to open more letters of credit through the
Trade Bank of Iraq on behalf of the government and its
ministries,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq, with the world&#8217;s fifth-largest proven oil reserves,
is modernizing its infrastructure and energy industry after
decades of sanctions, war and neglect. It produced 3.2 million
barrels a day of crude in June, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, and targets output of 3.5 million barrels by the end
of the year. The government is boosting spending by 18 percent
in 2013 to $118 billion, and the International Monetary Fund
forecasts an annual economic growth rate of 9 percent, the
fastest after Libya among 18 countries in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials are in talks with international banks about
the opening of offices and branches in the country, Abdul-Basit Turki, acting governor of Iraq&#8217;s central bank, said today in an
interview in Baghdad. &#8220;It is a rich market and the investment
opportunities are huge,&#8221; Turki said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banking Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign banks were barred from the country until after the
2003 U.S.-led invasion ousted the government of Saddam Hussein.
Today, 15 international banks operate in Iraq, competing with
seven state banks, 23 private lenders and nine banks operating
under Islamic rules, according to the central bank&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup plans to open representative offices and branches
in Baghdad and the cities of Basra and Erbil to benefit from an
estimated $1 trillion of infrastructure spending, Mayank Malik,
the U.S. bank&#8217;s chief executive officer for Jordan, Iraq, Syria
and the Palestinian territories, said in a June 27 interview.
The lender is among international banks seeking to finance a
pipeline to export Iraqi oil and natural gas through Jordan,
Nateq Balasem Khalaf, deputy director general of Iraq&#8217;s State
Company for Oil Projects, said July 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered has said it will open branches this year
in Baghdad and Erbil, followed by a third office next year in
Basra, a southern oil hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Import Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with JPMorgan will help the Trade Bank of
Iraq &#8220;open more letters of credit that we&#8217;re in need of,&#8221;
TBI chairman and president Hamdiyah Al Jaff said in an interview
in Baghdad yesterday. JPMorgan helped set up TBI, the country&#8217;s
largest bank for trade finance, to facilitate imports needed for
Iraq&#8217;s postwar reconstruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in the country are set for growth in earnings and
assets as a surge in lending in Iraq outpaces much of the Middle
East, according to Singapore-based Sansar Capital Management
LLC, which runs a fund with $30 million invested in Iraqi
equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s rising oil exports and a drop in the prime lending
rate to 6 percent from 17 percent in 2008 are feeding the
expansion. The five largest privately owned banks boosted their
combined net income by 207 percent from 2010 to 2012 and more
than doubled earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s stock exchange drew investors in February when
mobile operator Asiacell Communications PJSC listed after a $1.3
billion share sale, in the Middle East&#8217;s biggest initial public
offering since 2008. The country&#8217;s two other mobile operators,
Zain Iraq and Korek Telecom, plan to sell shares in IPOs to
comply with their license requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq is the biggest oil producer, after Saudi Arabia, in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit&#8217;s
$100 million settlement with MF Global Inc. liquidators won
court approval, paving the way for the return of more money to
the failed brokerage&#8217;s former customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement will allocate $100 million for the return of
customer property, according to an order entered today in
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The agreement resolves claims
against JPMorgan arising from transfers of customer property in
the days before MF Global entered bankruptcy, as well as its
actions as one of the brokerage&#8217;s primary banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The motion is granted in all respects and the settlement
agreement is authorized,&#8221; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn
said in the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former customers sued MF Global, New York-based JPMorgan
and other parties over the firm&#8217;s collapse and James W. Giddens,
trustee for the liquidating brokerage, joined the lawsuit. U.S.
District Judge Victor Marrero is overseeing the class-action
case while Glenn is handling the bankruptcy wind-down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giddens seeks to return an additional $200 million to
customers from the settlement, which also recoups $29 million in
MF Global funds held at the bank and completes a previous return
of $417 million by JPMorgan. The bank will pay an additional
$7.5 million to cover plaintiffs&#8217; legal fees, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Lender &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd., the parent company once run by
former New Jersey Governor and ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Co-Chairman Jon Corzine, filed for bankruptcy in 2011 after a $6.3
billion trade on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe&#8217;s
most indebted nations. Most MF Global client funds were held in
JPMorgan accounts, and the bank was a key lender to the parent
before it collapsed in the eighth-largest U.S bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement resolves all outstanding matters between
JPMorgan and the MF Global estate, its customers and creditors.
JPMorgan will get a $60 million general unsecured claim in the
brokerage liquidation and the companies won&#8217;t pursue any other
claims against each other, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was agent for a $1.2 billion loan to MF Global&#8217;s
parent company before it failed and also loaned money to the
brokerage and other affiliates, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holding company&#8217;s Chapter 11 case is In re MF Global
Holdings Ltd., 11-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The broker liquidation is In
re MF Global Inc., 11-02790, same court. The class-action case
is 11-cv-7866, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index may extend the
advance that took it to a three-year high, confirming a &#8220;deeper
rally phase&#8221; for the U.S. currency, if it breaks through key
technical levels, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustained break by the benchmark gauge above a resistance
level at 84.50 would clear the way for an advance to 84.90 to
84.95, Niall O&#8217;Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at
JPMorgan, wrote today in a client note. If the index increases
beyond that, it may rally to 86.07, a level not reached since
July 1, 2010. The Dollar Index touched 84.588 today, the highest
since July 6, 2010, after a report last week showed stronger-than-forecast employment gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have this bullish macro-fundamental backdrop for the
dollar, and certainly we&#8217;ve seen that in the price action,&#8221;
O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone interview. &#8220;But now we have these
next technical hurdles in play that I think we&#8217;ll still need to
break through to really confirm what we&#8217;re seeing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, declined 0.2 percent to 84.268 today in New
York after touching 84.588. It reached a four-month low of
80.498 on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 84.90-84.95 level is the 76.4 percent Fibonacci
retracement from the Dollar Index&#8217;s 2010 high, according to
O&#8217;Connor. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that
securities tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after
reaching a high or low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance is a level on a chart where sell orders may be
clustered. In technical analysis, investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a
security currency or index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar surged after the Labor Department reported July
5 that U.S. payrolls added 195,000 workers in June for a second
month, spurring bets the Federal Reserve may begin dialing back
unprecedented monetary stimulus that tends to debase the
currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dana El Baltaji" date="Jul 08, 2013  4:33 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-08/jpmorgan-touts-nakheel-saying-default-doubtful-islamic-finance.html"><headline>JPMorgan Touts Nakheel Saying Default Doubtful: Islamic Finance</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is advising
clients to buy Nakheel PJSC&#8217;s Islamic bonds after last month&#8217;s
record slump as new projects boost the Dubai developer&#8217;s
earnings, while government backing makes a default improbable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-run Nakheel&#8217;s 4.27 billion dirhams ($1.2 billion) of
sukuk yielded 9.88 percent at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai, down seven
basis points this month, after surging 179 basis points in June.
That&#8217;s more than twice the average gain in yields on corporate
Islamic debt tracked by HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai indexes. JPMorgan
listed Nakheel in a July 4 research note as its &#8220;top overweight
recommendation&#8221; among Dubai real-estate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel will manage to pay or refinance as much as half of
the $3 billion of debt due in 2016 as it generates at least $1
billion from new projects and land sales, JPMorgan said.
Investors have demanded higher yields to hold Nakheel&#8217;s bonds
since the company drove Dubai to the brink of default in 2009,
prompting the government to extend a bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government is quite unlikely to let Nakheel default
on its bond obligations in 2016 after supporting the company
under much more difficult circumstances,&#8221; JPMorgan analyst
Zafar Nazim wrote in the note. &#8220;Nakheel has been a beneficiary
of real-estate recovery in Dubai. We believe that new project
launches and plot sales were not baked in the original
restructuring plan that was agreed in 2010.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel, known for building an island shaped like the frond
of a palm tree and another like a world map off Dubai&#8217;s coast,
has received at least $8 billion of cash from the government
since announcing a standstill agreement with creditors in 2009,
JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real estate industry in Dubai, one of seven sheikhdoms
of the United Arab Emirates, has started recovering from a crash
that sent prices plunging more than 65 percent. New projects
such as the world&#8217;s biggest Ferris wheel, a new district with
100 hotels and the world&#8217;s largest mall were unveiled in the
past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sale prices for residential units have risen 28 percent
from a trough in January 2011, according to an index tracked by
Jones Lang LaSalle. Dubai&#8217;s economy grew 4.4 percent in 2012,
the fastest pace in five years. Against this backdrop, JPMorgan
also recommends Islamic debt of Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR), developer
of the world&#8217;s tallest tower, and Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority
FZE, which leases commercial real estate in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Averting Default &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Emaar&#8217;s 6.4 percent securities due in July
2019 has declined 25 basis points this month to 5.59 percent
today, while Jafza&#8217;s 7 percent sukuk due a month earlier yielded
5.43 percent, down 30 basis points. The yield on HSBC/Nasdaq
Dubai&#8217;s Corporate U.S. Dollar Sukuk Index advanced 73 basis
points last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dubai was able to avert bond default in all of its
government-related entities and its economy has recovered to
pre-crisis levels,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &#8220;Nakheel has been a
beneficiary of real-estate recovery in Dubai.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai&#8217;s credit risk returned this year to levels it hasn&#8217;t
seen since late 2008 amid the global credit crisis, after state-linked companies paid or refinanced at least $3.75 billion since
the start of 2012. Five-year credit default swaps, which protect
investors against non-payment of debt, dropped 130 basis points
in the past year to 220 on July 5, according to CMA. Middle East
contracts fell 13 basis points, on average, to 302 in the
period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Risky Sector&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, property prices in Dubai are likely to ease &#8220;due to
high levels of future supply, limited debt availability and more
mature market regulations,&#8221; Alan Robertson, chief executive
officer for the Middle East and North Africa at Jones Lang
LaSalle, said by e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors dumping emerging-market assets sold debt of Dubai
property companies last month amid an emerging-market rout
triggered by Federal Reserve plans to trim its bond-buying
program. Nakheel&#8217;s debt isn&#8217;t rated, while Emaar&#8217;s bonds non-investment grade at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard 
Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dubai&#8217;s real estate is still considered a risky sector,&#8221;
said Montasser Khelifi, Dubai-based senior manager for global
markets at Quantum Investment Bank Ltd. &#8220;When there&#8217;s turmoil
in the bond market, investors sell the debt, even though new
projects in Dubai are announced regularly these days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel&#8217;s business prospects are improving. The company
said in May it sold 471 villas valued at almost 1.9 billion
dirhams. The developer also expects to sign an agreement with
banks to extend the maturity by eight years from 2015 on 8
billion dirhams of debt, a spokeswoman said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in Nakheel&#8217;s sukuk may be a risk worth taking,
Khelifi said. &#8220;While its very possible Nakheel won&#8217;t have the
money to repay the bonds, it&#8217;s good news that they&#8217;re seeking to
refinance their debt,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas will average $3.85
per million British thermal units in the third quarter and $4.25
in the fourth quarter, below earlier forecasts as supply
increases, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Debottlenecking&#8221; at the Marcellus shale sites in West
Virginia and Pennsylvania are among the drivers of supply gains,
Goldman Sachs analysts led by Damien Courvalin in New York said
in an e-mailed report today. Goldman previously forecast U.S.
natural gas prices would be $4.50 in the third and fourth
quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production gains may be &#8220;temporary&#8221; because the number of
gas rigs operating is low, Goldman said. Natural gas prices need
to increase to $4.25 per million Btu by 2014 to bring rigs back
into active production and keep the market balanced, Courvalin
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Temasek
Holdings Pte agreed to buy a minority stake in China&#8217;s Cloudary
Corp. (READ) at a 25 percent lower valuation than in a previous funding
round, said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private placement values the operator of literary
websites at about $600 million, less than an earlier valuation
of $800 million, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. Cloudary is controlled by
Shanda Interactive Entertainment Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudary, which filed for a U.S. initial public offering
more than two years ago, has yet to start the share sale. A
gauge of Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. last month traded at
the widest discount since 2008 to the Nasdaq Composite Index as
measured by price-to-earnings ratios, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity funds managed by Orbis bought 1.875 percent of
Cloudary in May 2012 for $15 million, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission last year. The deal
valued the company at $800 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#8217;t clear exactly how the investment in Cloudary will
be carried out. Officials at Temasek, Goldman Sachs and Shanda
declined to comment or weren&#8217;t immediately available. Sina.com
reported on the investment by Goldman Sachs and Temasek earlier
today, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudary, based in Shanghai, applied for a $200 million New
York IPO in May 2011. Goldman Sachs had been named to help
manage the listing in July 2011 though is no longer involved in
the process. The company, led by former Bank of America Corp.
banker Robert Chiu, hired Bank of America, Citic Securities Co.
and CICC HK Securities as underwriters, according to a filing
last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don Mattrick, the former head of
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s entertainment division who takes the reins as
chief executive officer of Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) today, has been hankering
to run all or part of the social-gaming company for at least
three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Mattrick negotiated with Zynga founder Mark Pincus
about buying the maker of such popular games as &#8220;FarmVille,&#8221;
according to people with knowledge of the matter. The idea was
to bolster Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox lineup with social games that then
were adding millions of users on Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s network each
week. The discussions ultimately fell apart, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Mattrick, 49, is taking over Zynga from Pincus after
the company lost its spot as the top game maker on Facebook to
King.com. Its games have lost steam even as the social network&#8217;s
membership has swelled, and players are shifting to mobile apps
played on smartphones and tablets. Zynga is also grappling with
a talent drain, a stock price that has plunged around 66 percent
since a December 2011 initial public offering, and an ownership
structure that ensures Pincus will continue having the final say
even as he cedes the top job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a recruiter called former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Vern Brownell in 2009 about heading up D-Wave Systems Inc., a Canadian startup in the nascent field of quantum computing, he almost hung up the phone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brownell, who had spent 11 years at Goldman Sachs (GS) as the New York bank&#8217;s chief technology officer, had grown cynical from startups pitching for a sliver of the billion dollars a year Goldman spends on technology. A quantum computer, which uses the building blocks of matter itself to drive calculations, sounded like science fiction. Yet D-Wave was about to build one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once I came out here and saw what they were doing, I said &#8216;I&#8217;ve got to do this,&#8217;&#8221; Brownell said in a recent telephone interview. &#8220;I had never seen anything that had the potential to disrupt the computing industry the way this had.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four years later, Brownell is D-Wave&#8217;s chief executive officer, the firm has secured more than C$100 million ($95 million) in investment from backers including Goldman (GS) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN). founder Jeff Bezos and counts Lockheed Martin Co. (LMT), and a lab run by Google Inc (GOOG). and NASA as its customers. Along with BlackBerry smartphone inventor Mike Lazaridis, who has poured nearly half a billion dollars into quantum science in Waterloo, Ontario, D-Wave is creating a second act for a Canadian technology sector known more recently for Nortel Networks Corp (NRTLQ).&#8217;s bankruptcy and BlackBerry&#8217;s struggles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the largest
Spanish-language TV producer, rose the most in more than a year
as cable and satellite subscriptions helped increase second-quarter profit by 31 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa jumped 5.5 percent to 65.68 pesos at the close in
Mexico City, the biggest one-day increase since November 2011.
The shares have fallen 3.8 percent this year, compared with 8
percent for the benchmark IPC index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pay-TV services have become Televisa&#8217;s biggest growth
engine, its broadcasting advertising showed signs of recovery
despite lower government spending since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. The company has also benefited
from increased revenue from its cable channels, such as sports
station Televisa Deportes and music-video network Bandamax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These results will be positive for Televisa&#8217;s stock
price,&#8221; said Gregorio Tomassi, an analyst at Itau BBA SA in
Mexico City, in a research note today. &#8220;They show higher-than-expected profitability in key business lines -- content, and
cable and telecom.&#8221; He has the equivalent of a neutral rating
on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to 1.83 billion pesos ($142 million)
from 1.4 billion pesos a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
company said yesterday in a filing. Leaving out some items,
profit was 7.46 billion pesos, beating the 6.98 billion-peso
average of five analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cable-TV customers rose by 41,000 to 2.41
million, while satellite subscribers rose by 233,000 to 5.65
million, Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on commercials on Televisa&#8217;s Mexican broadcast
networks rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier to 5.91 billion
pesos, bounding back from a 7.2 percent first-quarter decline,
the company said. Cable-network subscription revenue rose 9.5
percent to 882 million pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising by government agencies at the federal and state
level has yet to return since the election, Televisa Executive
Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said today on a conference
call. The broadcast business will also be hurt this year by a
new law that requires it to offer its over-the-air programming
for free to all pay-TV carriers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Televisa hasn&#8217;t been able to estimate the impact of
those items, it will stop providing a forecast for its content
business this year, de Angoitia said. It had previously forecast
a &#8220;mid-single digit&#8221; percentage increase in sales for the
unit, which includes broadcast advertising, cable-network
subscriptions and licensing and syndication fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total second-quarter sales climbed 6.4 percent to 18.1
billion pesos. The company reported that losses from joint
ventures, mostly from mobile-phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA, in
which it has a 50 percent stake, reduced earnings by 461.8
million pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cocaine output in the Andes region
fell 10 percent last year as Colombia and Peru increased efforts
to eradicate production and enforce the law, the U.S. government
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure cocaine production in Bolivia fell 18 percent to 155
metric tons (341,717 pounds) in 2012, the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy said today in an e-mailed
statement. Colombian output dropped 7.9 percent to 175 metric
tons and Peru&#8217;s production slid 4.9 percent to 290 metric tons,
according to the statement. The three nations are the world&#8217;s
biggest producers of the drug, while the U.S. is its top
consumer. Cocaine production has dropped 41 percent in the past
decade, the U.S. report says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reductions can be traced to factors including the
strengthened partnership between the U.S. and Colombia and
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala&#8217;s increased commitment to
counter-narcotics cooperation and security, the office said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Inc., the auto lender
majority-owned by U.S. taxpayers, dropped JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
from the list of underwriters for its planned initial public
offering, saying rival banks were more committed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Barclays Plc (BARC) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) were listed as underwriters in
an amended filing today by Detroit-based Ally. A filing in
October included JPMorgan in addition to those five banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lineup of global coordinators is a reflection of the
investment the various banks have made in the Ally relationship
over the last year,&#8221; Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for the auto
lender, said in an e-mail today. Tasha Pelio of New York-based
JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department has paid lower underwriting
fees than other sellers as it exits investments in firms bailed
out during the financial crisis. Underwriting fees were less
than 1 percent for the sale of stock in firms such as General
Motors Co. and American International Group Inc., compared with
an average of more than 3 percent for additional equity
offerings in the U.S. this year and about 5.5 percent for IPOs,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is seeking to exit its 74 percent stake in Ally
after previously getting rid of holdings in Citigroup and AIG.
Ally has sold units and worked to limit liabilities from its
bankrupt mortgage business as Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter seeks to repay a $17.2 billion bailout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A debt-collection firm backed by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s private equity unit agreed to pay $3.2
million to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint that it
illegally harassed consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine, the largest levied by the FTC against a third-party debt collector according to an agency news release today,
stems from charges that it used tactics including calling
consumers multiple times a day, calling them early in the
morning or late at night, and calling at consumers&#8217; workplaces.
The company, Expert Global Solutions Inc., was also accused by
the FTC of continuing to call consumers who denied owing a debt
to its clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement, if a consumer disputes the validity
of the debt, the company must either end collection efforts or
suspend them until they&#8217;ve conducted a &#8220;reasonable
investigation&#8221; to establish the debt&#8217;s validity. The agreement
also prohibits the company from treating consumers in the manner
outlined in the FTC&#8217;s charges, according to the agency&#8217;s
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Hoy, a spokesman for the Expert Global, did not
immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC news
release describes the company as &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest debt
collection operation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s stake in the firm  is held by its private
investment arm, One Equity Partners. According to the JPMorgan
investment unit&#8217;s website, Expert Global is based in Horsham,
Pennsylvania, and has revenues of about $2 billion dollars, and
40,000 employees in 14 countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. bond yields suggest investors
anticipate the Federal Reserve will announce a reduction in
asset purchases at its September policy meeting, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Heather Loomis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapering &#8220;does appear to be baked in,&#8221; with as much as 80
percent of the market expecting it, Loomis, director of fixed
income in San Francisco for JPMorgan Private Bank, said during a
television interview with Sara Eisen and Erik Schatzker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke &#8220;has effectively said
tapering will being and end within a year,&#8221; said Loomis, who
helps oversee $909 billion in assets. &#8220;The market is looking at
2014 as the start of rates hikes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year notes, the benchmark for everything from
home mortgages to car loans, have risen about 45 basis points to
2.64 percent since June 19, when Bernanke said policy makers may
begin reducing asset purchases this year and end them in 2014.
His comments were followed by two U.S. employment reports that
showed higher-than-forecast job gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
bonds every month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs.
Policy makers have also kept their target rate for overnight
loans between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to
support the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the longer term, interest rates are moving higher,&#8221;
Loomis said. &#8220;If you see changes in yields as a result of true
healing and true growth in both GDP and employment within the
economy,&#8221; both Treasury yields and the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index &#8220;can move up in tandem,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credicorp Ltd. (BAP), owner of Peru&#8217;s
largest bank, may gain 32 percent by the end of the year as the
Andean nation&#8217;s economy grows, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan included Lima-based Credicorp, owner of Banco de
Credito del Peru, in its list of top picks for the region after
a 27 percent fall since April 1, saying economic growth will
keep supporting earnings in the country&#8217;s banking industry,
according to an e-mailed note to clients dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We like the long-term secular growth story for financial
services penetration in Peru,&#8221; Saul Martinez, an analyst at
JPMorgan, said in the note. &#8220;Credicorp will sustain healthy
profitable levels, on average, in the coming years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan maintained a year-end 2013 price target of $158
per share for Credicorp, according to the note. The stock rose
50 cents to $120 at 11:03 a.m. today in Lima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credicorp is trading at 11.4 times its estimated earnings
for the current year, 15 percent below its average estimated
price-to-earnings ratio of the last four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru&#8217;s gross domestic product will grow 5.75 percent in
2013 and 6 percent in 2014, the fastest of any major Latin
American country after Panama, according to economists&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief market strategist at
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world&#8217;s biggest underwriter of
corporate bonds, says the worst first half of the year on record
for the securities may only deepen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes have lost 3.7 percent on average since May 22
when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress the
central bank may begin curtailing its unprecedented stimulus
program if economic conditions warrant, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. The losses compare with a drop of 2.9
percent for government securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance is a shock to bulls who expected the extra
yield offered by corporates relative to government bonds to
cushion any selloff that stemmed from the prospects for higher
interest rates and a stronger economy. Instead, diminished
dealer inventories of the securities brought on by regulatory
changes has caused liquidity to drop, exacerbating the price
declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through a whole set of new, post-crisis regulations, the
potential buyers do not have the same capacity to absorb credit
risk,&#8221; said Jan Loeys, who heads a global asset allocation
strategy team at JPMorgan in New York, in a telephone interview.
&#8220;The banks don&#8217;t have the same ability to absorb this
anymore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Data Corp., led by former

hired the New York-based bank&#8217;s former Chief Information Officer
Guy Chiarello as president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiarello, 53, will receive an annual base salary of $1
million and a bonus of no less than $2.5 million for 2013,
Atlanta-based First Data said today in a regulatory filing. He
will also be granted a signing bonus of $6.5 million that can be
clawed back if he quits or is terminated for cause within two
years, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Data, owned by private-equity firm KKR  Co.,

&lt;p&gt;Chiarello was CIO of JPMorgan for about five and a half

for 23 years, according to the filing. The Wall Street Journal
reported in May that Chiarello was leaving JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology and security were among Bisignano&#8217;s
responsibilities as co-COO, and he held executive roles within
the payments industry earlier in his career. Bisignano, 53, was
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s CEO of global transaction services from 2002 to
2005 and executive vice president of consumer lending in the
early 1990s for First Fidelity Bancorp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Zames became JPMorgan&#8217;s sole COO when Bisignano left
the bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCMP Capital Advisors LLC, the former private-equity unit of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), gathered $1.1 billion in the first stage of fundraising for its latest private-equity pool, which has a $3.5 billion target, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initial closing for CCMP Capital Investors III LP includes a $200 million commitment from the New York-based firm, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Alberta Investment Management Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS). are among investors who have committed money to the fund, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brooke Gordon, a spokeswoman at Sard Verbinnen  Co., declined to comment on behalf of CCMP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CCMP Capital, which was founded in 2006 by professionals who spun off from the buyout unit of JPMorgan Chase, is competing for capital in a crowded fundraising market. About 1,958 private-equity funds are seeking $770 billion, according to data from London-based research provider Preqin Ltd. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CCMP Capital makes buyout and growth-equity investments in the U.S. and Europe. Sectors of focus include consumer and retail, industrial, health care and energy, according to the firm&#8217;s website. The firm typically invests $100 million to $500 million of equity in companies. CCMP Capital earlier this year agreed to acquire Pure Gym Ltd., a gym operator in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s prior fund closed in 2007 with $3.4 billion in commitments. CCMP Capital Investors II LP was producing a 14 percent net internal rate of return and a 1.5 times multiple on invested capital as of June 30, according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ney Hayashi" date="Jul 10, 2013  9:58 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-10/brazilian-indonesian-stocks-lowered-to-underweight-at-jpmorgan.html"><headline>Brazilian, Indonesian Stocks Lowered to Underweight at JPMorgan</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian (IBOV) and Indonesian (JCI) stocks were
cut to the equivalent of sell by JPMorgan Chase  Co. on concern
slower growth in China will hurt exports in the Latin American
country and a weaker rupiah will curb earnings growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s economic recovery may be hindered by higher
spending by the government, JPMorgan analysts including Adrian Mowat wrote in a research note today. Protesters took to the
streets last month to demand better public services in the
country&#8217;s biggest demonstrations in two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The response to the current unrest is policies that we
believe add to fiscal deterioration,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts
wrote. &#8220;Add to that the impact of higher global bond yields on
a country with a current account deficit and China economic
risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its recommendation on Russian (INDEXCF) and South
Korean stocks to the equivalent of hold. Russia will benefit
from higher oil prices, which boosts the outlook for producers
and also strengthens the country&#8217;s currency and fiscal position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, local borrowing costs are expected to
increase, benefiting life insurers and banks, even as policy
makers hold the target lending rate for the rest of 2013,
according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer unveiled his biggest reorganization since 2002 to speed development of hardware and services at a company plagued by anemic growth and competition in mobile computing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The software maker reduced the number of business units to four and said Windows chief Julie Larson-Green will oversee all hardware, including the Surface tablet and Xbox console and related games. Windows Phone software head Terry Myerson will add responsibility for the Windows and Xbox operating systems. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer is concentrating divisions around hardware and Internet services to appeal to customers who increasingly use mobile devices for tasks once done on desktop machines. As demand for Microsoft&#8217;s flagship Windows software ebbs amid a global personal-computer slump, Ballmer needs to slice away management layers that have hampered product development. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;First and foremost this is an attempt to address the fact that they are behind in tablet and mobile,&#8221; said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. &#8220;They&#8217;re effectively saying, &#8216;We have some problems we need to address and we need to make radical changes to accomplish it.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares rose 2.8 percent to $35.69 in New York, the highest closing price since 2007.

&lt;p&gt;Michael Eisner, who ran Walt Disney
Co. for 21 years, said his successor, Robert Iger, should
continue as chief executive officer beyond his recently extended
term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I had my choice I would have him stay even longer, God
knows, maybe he will,&#8221; Eisner said in an interview yesterday
with Bloomberg Television at the Allen  Co. conference in Sun
Valley, Idaho. &#8220;The longer he stays, the better it is for the
shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisner minimized the financial fallout from &#8220;The Lone
Ranger,&#8221; a summer box-office failure for Disney. The company
also produced 2013&#8217;s top picture, &#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; which has sold
$1.2 billion in tickets worldwide, according to industry
researcher Box Office Mojo. Both men are attending the annual
gathering of entertainment, technology and finance executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The great thing about Disney (DIS) is this is such a big
company, as opposed to what it was when I went to it, that a
stumble like &#8216;Lone Ranger&#8217; is going to have no effect,&#8221; Eisner
said. &#8220;Their parks are strong, they have all those Marvel and
Pixar, Star Wars movies coming out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 62, has been CEO of the world&#8217;s largest entertainment
company since succeeding Eisner in 2005. Burbank, California-based Disney said on July 1 it extended his term another 15
months to June of 2016, citing the 193 percent total return to
shareholders during his tenure. Iger is also chairman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM). Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned investors that higher interest rates could lead to a &#8220;dramatic reduction&#8221; in the bank&#8217;s profits by eroding demand for mortgage refinancing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The surge in 30-year home-loan rates to 4.46 percent at the end of June from 3.51 percent in mid-May caused second-quarter mortgage-fee revenue to decline 20 percent, the New York-based bank reported today. Refinancing volume could fall as much as 40 percent in the second half if rates remain elevated, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told analysts on a call today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The environment in late May and June drove mortgage rates up significantly,&#8221; Lake, 43, said. &#8220;This pressure continued into July, and we expect it could have a significant impact on the refinance market side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Long-term borrowing costs climbed in the second quarter after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated on May 22 that the central bank may be preparing to slow its purchases of government and mortgage bonds, a program that has helped suppress rates. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, might speed up its planned 19,000 job cuts &#8220;given what&#8217;s going on in the market,&#8221; Lake told journalists on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon praised his traders&#8217; handling of a plunge in
emerging-market assets last month and cautioned that other banks
may not have fared as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our folks in emerging markets also did a spectacularly
good job, because I think you might see some real
differentiation there from some other folks on how their numbers
come out,&#8221; Dimon said today on a conference call with analysts
after the New York-based bank reported second-quarter earnings.
&#8220;Obviously, when spreads widen out, certain businesses are more
at risk than others. In emerging markets, we probably saw the
most volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk premiums on emerging market debt widened after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated the central bank
might taper its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, which
have boosted demand for higher yielding assets. Prices of
emerging-market government and corporate bonds fell 6.23 percent
in the quarter, according to Bank of America Corp. data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks also fell as manufacturing in China contracted and
protests erupted in Brazil and Turkey. The MSCI Emerging Markets
Index dropped 16 percent from May 21 to June 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose emerging-markets trading is overseen by
London-based James Kenny, generated $4.08 billion in revenue
from fixed-income trading during the quarter, up 17 percent from
a year earlier. That topped the 5 percent increase expected by
Deutsche Bank AG analyst Matt O&#8217;Connor and the 4 percent rise
predicted by Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)&#8217;s Matt Burnell. Equity-trading
revenue rose 24 percent from a year earlier to $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Dimon warned about divergence among banks&#8217; trading
performance, some analysts took the firm&#8217;s better-than-expected
revenue as a good sign for the industry, including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), which reports results on July 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Traders know how to manage money in a volatile fixed-income environment -- nothing really blew up,&#8221; Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said on &#8220;The Hays
Advantage&#8221; Bloomberg Radio program. &#8220;So I&#8217;m optimistic about
Goldman going forward, because if Jamie did well, this is
usually a good sign that the other trading house did well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s results in June weren&#8217;t as strong as those in
April and May, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. That
month featured declines in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and
corporate and Treasury bonds after Bernanke said the Fed would
consider cutting back stimulus efforts if economic growth
improves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s value-at-risk, an estimate of potential trading
losses, fell to $40 million in its corporate and investment bank
during the quarter, the lowest since JPMorgan bought Bank One
Corp. in 2004. The drop in the measure, which climbed in June,
was driven by lower volatility in asset prices and a reduction
in JPMorgan&#8217;s own risk appetite, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The client flows, they held up,&#8221; Lake said on the call.
&#8220;So if you surround that with robust and strong trading risk
discipline, that&#8217;s pretty much how it panned out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s (MSFT) Julie Larson-Green body-slammed a 6-foot-6 colleague who was blocking her exit one day in 2001 when the largest earthquake to hit Washington state in a half century rattled her office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I have a direction I want to go, it doesn&#8217;t matter who&#8217;s in my way,&#8221; said Larson-Green, 51, who started at Microsoft 20 years ago and is the company&#8217;s highest-ranking female engineering executive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larson-Green&#8217;s obstacles are about to get bigger, now that she&#8217;s been put in charge of all hardware at the world&#8217;s largest software company. As head of the devices and studio engineering group, she is responsible for Microsoft&#8217;s push into gadgets such as tablets, which so far is faltering as consumers and businesses shun the company&#8217;s nine-month-old Surface computer in favor of the iPad from Apple Inc. and mobile machines from Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larson-Green is at the center of a sweeping overhaul by Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, unveiled yesterday, which is intended to streamline management and rev up growth in areas like mobile devices. The task is urgent as Microsoft, with its Office and Windows software products dominant on personal computers, deals with a PC slump caused by consumers&#8217; increasing preference for mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s ratio of
capital to total assets falls short of a proposed U.S. minimum
that Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon criticized for
diverging from the standard other nations&#8217; lenders face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s so-called leverage ratio at its holding company
is 4.7 percent, below the 5 percent proposed U.S. minimum, the
New York-based bank said today in a presentation. The ratio at
its deposit-taking subsidiary is even lower, creating a wider
gap to the 6 percent proposed standard for those units, Chief
Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. plan goes beyond the 3 percent global minimum
requirement that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
approved to help prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.
The changes would make lenders fund more assets with capital
that can absorb losses instead of using borrowed money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If one is 3 percent and one is 6 percent, that becomes
just too big, and over time it can have huge competitive
effects,&#8221; Dimon said on the conference call with analysts. &#8220;We
always ran with higher capital and liquidity than most of our
competitors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it plans to be in line with the holding
company standard by the first quarter of 2015. The company plans
to bring the federally insured bank subsidiary into compliance
by the end of that year, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dividends &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said it can increase its holding company leverage
ratio by 60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage points, with capital
generated from earnings through the next six quarters if it
keeps payouts to shareholders constant. JPMorgan could also
boost the ratio as much as 1 percentage point by issuing
preferred shares and making adjustments such as unwinding
derivative bets, according to the bank&#8217;s presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the company can achieve the new ratios and
accelerate share buybacks and dividends over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed U.S. rule will add unfunded commitments and
some derivatives exposure to banks&#8217; stated assets. That will
increase JPMorgan&#8217;s total assets by about $1 trillion from the
$2.4 trillion on its balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel committee has proposed additional increases to
asset calculations, which Lake said could have a &#8220;not
insignificant&#8221; impact on the ratio. Lake also said there is a
&#8220;strong argument&#8221; that the firm&#8217;s more than $450 billion of
cash and highly liquid assets should be excluded from the
calculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leverage ratio provides an additional measure of
capital to Basel III ratios that weight assets based on risk,
which results in an asset figure that is half of that under the
leverage ratio. The firm said its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio
climbed to 9.3 percent and plans to reach 9.5 percent by the end
of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the leverage ratio is an appropriate
complement to a Tier 1 common ratio, if properly calibrated,&#8221;
Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar may fall to
its lowest level in almost three years after breaching a key
level of support, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co., citing
technical indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aussie may decline to 87.70 U.S. cents, its weakest
level since July 22, 2010, after falling below minor support at
90, according to Niall O&#8217;Connor, a New York-based technical
analyst at JPMorgan. Australia&#8217;s currency weakened to less than
90 today for the first time since September 2010. The Aussie has
been the worst-performing major currency over the last six
months, decreasing 14 percent versus the U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s decline suggests a higher risk for new lows into
next week,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;Deeper targets enter
at the 87.70-to-88.80 zone. It should try to bounce from
there.&#8221; The target zone represents the 76.4 percent Fibonacci
retracement from the 2010 low, O&#8217;Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s currency depreciated 1.4 percent to 90.61 U.S.
cents at 10:51 a.m. in New York after earlier falling as much as
2.1 percent to 89.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
may be buy orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low. &lt;/p&gt;

division&#8217;s revenue climbed 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit&#8217;s $6.36 billion in first-half compensation costs
amounted to 33 percent of revenue, excluding accounting
adjustments, down from 34 percent in the prior year, according
to figures posted today on the New York-based firm&#8217;s website.
The amount is equal to $122,926 for each of the division&#8217;s
51,771 employees in the six months. The unit had 52,336
employees a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, combined its
investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and
securities-services units last year under co-heads Mike Cavanagh, 47, and Daniel Pinto, 50. The group has more than
twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
years. Figures for average pay don&#8217;t represent what individuals
actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), the Frankfurt-based bank that&#8217;s courting wealthy clients, hired Caroline Kitidis from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), according to two people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitidis, 38, will work with wealth-management clients in
the U.S., said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the bank hasn&#8217;t announced her appointment. She&#8217;ll be
part of a push by continental Europe&#8217;s biggest bank to boost
profits from advising the rich and to catch up with UBS AG and
Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain, facing
stricter capital requirements that make some investment banking
operations unprofitable, promoted Michele Faissola, one of his
investment-banking lieutenants, to run wealth and asset
management last year. Jain said in June he&#8217;s meeting with top
clients himself to help meet the goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitidis ran a team at Goldman Sachs that created
derivatives for private and institutional clients, according to
a biography on a Bentley University alumni page. The item says
she was in the class of 1997 at the school in Waltham,
Massachusetts. She joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 1998,
according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records.
Kitidis was named a managing director in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InterOil Corp. (IOC), the explorer in
talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to develop natural gas discoveries
in Papua New Guinea, said negotiations are progressing with the
world&#8217;s largest energy company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s moving along nicely,&#8221; said Michael Hession, the
former Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) executive named yesterday as
InterOil&#8217;s chief executive officer. &#8220;I&#8217;m not disturbed in any
way, shape or form. I&#8217;d emphasize that Exxon and this
negotiation are going to be my number one priority.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil said in May that it started exclusive discussions
with Exxon to develop the gas fields in Papua New Guinea. Exxon
is interested in the assets because they may help expand the oil
producer&#8217;s $19 billion liquefied natural gas project in the
country, Mark Nolan, vice president for the Middle East and
Australia, told reporters in Brisbane in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hession, who brought PetroChina Co., Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) and
Mitsui  Co. into Woodside&#8217;s Browse LNG project in Australia in
agreements reached last year, said he carried out extensive
research into InterOil before joining the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in discussions with InterOil for some months,
since before I left Woodside,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has been a careful
and measured courtship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil has been searching for international partners to
help fund a Papua New Guinea natural gas project since 2009,
when Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch sold its 35 percent
stake in the venture. Phil Mulacek, who founded the company,
retired as chief executive officer in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partnership Proposals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil said in 2011 that it hired Morgan Stanley, UBS AG
and Macquarie Group Ltd. to evaluate partnership proposals.
Mulacek said in an October 2011 interview that he expected to
sign a partner by the end of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the discussions with Exxon is the potential
sale of a stake in a license that comprises the Elk and Antelope
fields, InterOil said. Hession declined to provide more
information about the talks or say when he expected the
negotiations to be completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hession left his position overseeing Woodside&#8217;s Browse
venture in May after Australia&#8217;s second-biggest oil and gas
producer scrapped a plan to build the project at an onshore site
in Western Australia because it was too expensive. Woodside now
is considering using floating LNG technology to develop the
Browse project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil is incorporated in Canada&#8217;s Yukon, has offices in
Cairns, Australia and Singapore, and is traded in New York. Elk
and Antelope hold an estimated 9 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, InterOil said in its 2012 annual report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. filed a lawsuit July
12 accusing U.S. Customs officials of refusing to follow a trade
agency&#8217;s order to block imports of phones made by Google Inc.&#8217;s
Motorola Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington
issued the import ban in May 2012 after deciding that Motorola
Mobility devices infringed a Microsoft patent for a way mobile
phones synchronize calendar events with other computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection, after secret meetings
with Google, continued to let the Motorola Mobility phones enter
the country even though Google has done nothing to remove the
feature at the heart of the ITC case, Microsoft said in its
complaint. The case illustrates what Lexmark International Inc. (LXK)
and Lutron Electronics Co. in May called &#8220;increasingly
ineffective and unpredictable enforcement&#8221; of import bans
imposed by the trade agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility convinced the agency that the order
didn&#8217;t apply to syncing through Google rather than Microsoft
servers, and to give it a grace period to allow changes to take
effect. Both of those requests had previously been rejected by
the ITC, according to Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC order is in effect until Microsoft&#8217;s patent expires
in April 2018. An appeal in the case is scheduled to be heard
Aug. 6 in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings between Mountain View, California-based Google and
Customs were held in secret in April, with Microsoft not privy
to their existence until after the Customs decision June 24
allowing the continued importation of the phones, according to
Microsoft&#8217;s filings asking the court to halt the Motorola
Mobility shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC&#8217;s job is to protect U.S. markets from unfair
competition, including infringement of patents or theft of trade
secrets. It has become a key forum for disputes between
smartphone makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the import bans are ordered, it&#8217;s common for both
patent owners and importers to lobby Customs and neither side is
told what the other is saying for fear of exposing trade
secrets, lawyers involved in ITC cases said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade agency is compiling information on how well its
orders are being enforced and President Barack Obama last month
called for a review of procedures within the ITC and Customs. In
their joint letter to the ITC, Lexmark and Lutron said the
&#8220;current problems with enforcement of orders requires immediate
attention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Department of Homeland
Security, 13-cv-01063, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Faro, Nikon Metrology Settle Suit Over Scanning Technology &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faro Technologies Inc. (FARO) and Nikon Metrology NV settled a
five-year-old lawsuit over two patents related to scanning
apparatus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by Nikon Metrology, formerly Metris USA
Inc., in July 2009. The companies compete in the business of
computer-aided three-dimensional measurement technology. In a
July 12 filing in federal court in Boston, Faro said it reached
a settlement with Nikon Metrology and withdrew its motion for
attorney fees. No other details were given &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, a jury in Boston found that Lake Mary, Florida-based Faro hadn&#8217;t infringed patent 7,313,264. The court
previously found, on a motion by Faro, that patent 6,611,617
wasn&#8217;t infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikon Metrology, based in Leuven, Belgium, asked the court
to overturn the verdict or grant a new trial. When both those
requests were rejected, the company turned to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Washington-based court that
hears appeals of patent disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faro said in a statement that the parties to the settlement
agreement agreed to keep the terms confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Metris U.S.A. Inc. v. Faro Technologies, 08-cv-11187, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BSkyB Says M7 Group&#8217;s Skylink Service Infringes &#8216;Sky&#8217; Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) is challenging
Luxembourg&#8217;s M7 Group&#8217;s use of &#8220;Skylink&#8221; for its direct-to-home satellite television program in the Czech Republic and
Slovakia, the Advanced Television news website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.-based British Sky claims the term infringed its
&#8220;sky&#8221; trademark used with its BSkyB TV services, according to
Advanced Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier a U.K. court found that Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s use of
&#8220;Skydrive&#8221; for its cloud storage system infringed British
Sky&#8217;s U.K. and European Union trademarks, the website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for British Sky told Advanced Television that
the Middlesex, U.K.-based company regarded any unauthorized use
of &#8220;Sky&#8221; as an infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namco Bandai Seeks European Registration for &#8216;Lost Swords&#8217; Mark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namco Bandai Holdings Inc. (7832)&#8217;s Namco Bandai Games unit has
applied to register &#8220;Lost Swords&#8221; as a trademark in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese maker of computer games said in its
application that the name would be used for video-game machines,
amusement-park services, and games and related software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the games produced by the Tokyo-based company are
Ultimate Ninja, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, Dark Souls
and Armored Core Verdict Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company produces games for consoles produced by Sony

&lt;h2&gt;Orthodox Group Sues Israeli Company Over Use of Kosher Mark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations in America&#8217;s OU
Kashruth unit filed a trademark infringement suit against
Israeli food manufacturer Better  Different Ltd., Jewish
Business News reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, which was filed in Israel, claims that Better 
Different of Maale Edummim used the Union&#8217;s trademark
designating kosher food -- the letter U circled by the letter O
-- without paying licensing fees, according to Jewish Business
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Union said Better  Different continued to use the mark
during 2012 and 2013, Jewish Business News reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Union has asked the court to order the destruction of
infringing packaging, the recall of products bearing the mark
without authorization, licensing fees for the allegedly
unauthorized use of the mark for the past three years and money
damages, according to Jewish Business News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Marilyn Monroe Photo Auction to Include Copyrights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 3,700 unpublished black-and-white and color
negatives and slides from photographer Milton H. Greene&#8217;s images
of the late Marilyn Monroe are going up for auction in Los
Angeles on July 27, the Associated Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the auction unusual is that in addition to the
images themselves, the copyrights are also being sold, making it
possible for the buyer to create additional prints and sell or
license them, AP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greene shot more than 5,000 images of the actress, who died
in August 1962. He didn&#8217;t commercialize his work and only a
handful of pictures were published in his lifetime, Joseph
Madelena told AP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madelena is the owner of Profiles in History, the auction
house that is holding the sale, AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vatican Should Use Creative Commons for Encyclical, Blogger Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blogger who made downloadable copies of Pope Francis&#8217;s
recent encyclical -- &#8220;Lumen Fides&#8221; -- available on his website
is calling for new guidelines for the release of papal documents
after being warned he was infringing the Vatican&#8217;s copyright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon Vogt, author of &#8220;The Church and New Media:
Blogging Converts, Online Activists, and Bishops Who Tweet,&#8221;
put the text to the encyclical on BrandonVogt.com July 5, the
date the Vatican released this papal letter to the Roman
Catholic Church and to the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vogt had converted the text to multiple formats for
downloading, including for Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad, Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s
Kindle e-reader and Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS)&#8217;s Nook. The letter is
unusual in that it&#8217;s the work of both Pope Francis and his
immediate predecessor, the recently retired Pope Benedict XVI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vogt said that within hours he heard from both the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Vatican, who accused him
of violating &#8220;both civil and moral law&#8221; and &#8220;stealing from
the pope.&#8221; They ordered him to remove the document from his
blog immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a response on his blog, he said that while he was clear
the Vatican and the bishops&#8217; conference weren&#8217;t wrong to assert
their copyright to the encyclical, there must be a better way to
make the text available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vogt suggested that all such church documents be released
under a Creative Commons license. That would protect the
integrity of the document, while allowing people free access to
share it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that under a Creative Commons license, people &#8220;may
copy, distribute, display, and perform only verbatim copies of
the work&#8221; and that according to the Creative Commons website,
more than 400 million licenses have deployed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said price
risks for Brent crude in the second half of the year have
changed &#8220;to the upside&#8221; amid production losses in some OPEC
nations and political threats to supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductions in output from Libya, Iraq and Nigeria have the
potential to limit availability, the bank said today in an e-mailed report. Even so, increased production outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will probably keep
global markets adequately supplied this year, said Goldman,
which forecasts Brent crude to average $105 a barrel in the
second half. Brent futures traded at about $108 a barrel in
London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risks have shifted more to the upside over the short
term due to the possibility of continuing OPEC production
shortfalls and increased geopolitical risks,&#8221; Jeff Currie, the
head of commodities research in New York, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC output fell by 370,000 barrels a day in June amid
unrest and violence in Libya, Iraq and Nigeria, the
International Energy Agency said in its most recent monthly
market report on July 11. The losses come just as increasing
seasonal demand for motor fuels is pushing up global oil
consumption, Goldman said. OPEC supplies about 40 percent of the
world&#8217;s crude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told investors last week that rising interest rates could trigger a &#8220;dramatic reduction&#8221; in the bank&#8217;s mortgage profits. According to its own analysts, the U.S. housing market will extend its recovery regardless. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rate for 30-year home loans jumped to 4.51 percent last week from a near record-low of 3.35 percent in early May after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated the central bank may slow its purchases of government and mortgage bonds. Refinancing, which has slumped to the lowest in two years, may drop by as much as 40 percent in the second half of this year, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said July 12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Home prices rising at the fastest pace since 2006 can withstand higher rates as lenders ease underwriting standards, job growth fuels demand and the supply of distressed properties dwindles, JPMorgan analysts led by John Sim wrote in a July 10 report. The New York-based researchers increased their forecast for price appreciation to 10.1 percent this year from 7 percent in March. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been widespread concern that rising rates may hurt the housing recovery,&#8221; the analysts said. &#8220;We do not think that the recent market move will change the broader story of increased homebuyer activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernanke said last month that rates have risen in part because of optimism about the economy and &#8220;perceptions of the Federal Reserve.&#8221; Home prices rose 12.1 percent in April from the prior year, according to the SP/Case-Shiller Index, with increases in each of the 20 cities in the measure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Optimistic&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are more optimistic about housing. They expect house prices to continue to rise,&#8221; he said. That &#8220;compensates to some extent for a slightly higher mortgage rate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growth has been driven by a lack of housing stock coupled with demand from institutional investors, including private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX), which has purchased more than 30,000 single-family homes to rent. The number of homes for sale fell 5 percent to 1.74 million in January from the year-earlier period, the fewest since December 1999, according to the National Association of Realtors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For banks, including Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the nation&#8217;s largest home-loan lender, and No. 2 JPMorgan, rising rates may be more detrimental after the lenders benefited from record profit margins in the mortgage business in 2012. Refinancing accounted for 76 percent of last year&#8217;s $1.75 trillion in loan originations. Originations may fall 10 percent this year, the Mortgage Bankers Association forecast in a June 20 report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Relatively Robust &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;For most mortgages outstanding now, the rate does not provide an incentive for refinancing,&#8221; said Walt Schmidt, a mortgage strategist at FTN Financial. &#8220;These margins have remained relatively robust for the banks and they&#8217;re not going to be making that money anymore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the housing recovery, originated almost 1 in 3 mortgages in 2012, helping it post a third straight year of record profit. The firm said last week that it made $2.8 billion from mortgage banking in the second quarter, 3 percent less than a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New home loans fell rapidly after Bernanke&#8217;s comments and probably slowed Wells Fargo&#8217;s mortgage business, Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP, wrote in a June 12 report. Mortgages comprised about 14 percent of total revenue last year, a contribution that may plunge by more than a third this year to $7.5 billion, from $12.2 billion last year, and to $4.8 billion in 2014, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Change&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see a big change in mortgage profits in the second half of this year compared to what you&#8217;ve seen in 2012 and the first half of this year,&#8221; said Kevin Barker, an analyst at Washington-based Compass Point Research  Trading LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, has led JPMorgan to record earnings over the past three years as the Fed&#8217;s stimulus boosted the economy and bank profits. Mortgage fees and related revenue at the bank dropped 20 percent to $1.82 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2.27 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the recent increase in interest rates holds, homeowner refinancing could be reduced by 30 percent to 40 percent in the second half of this year, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to be clear with you that this would be a significant event,&#8221; she said on the conference call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It definitely could be that severe,&#8221; Barker said. &#8220;2012 and the first half of this year have been historically good quarters for mortgage banking so I would argue that the market was already generous for mortgage banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan may accelerate a job-cut program announced earlier in the year. The bank said in February it&#8217;s eliminating as many as 19,000 jobs in its mortgage and community-banking divisions through 2014 as Dimon trims expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company reported a 31 percent increase in second-quarter net income to $6.5 billion, or $1.60 a share, as a 10 percent jump in trading and investment banking revenue outweighed a 3 percent drop at the consumer and community banking unit. Its shares have gained 52 percent in the last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rising rates and a decline in refinancing could expand credit availability that&#8217;s been restricted following the housing crash by forcing lenders to compete more aggressively for homebuyers, said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Washington-based Fannie Mae. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks, &#8220;if they want to stay in business, they&#8217;re going to compete,&#8221; he said last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Historic Lows &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mortgage costs are also still near historic lows, with the rate down from 6.8 percent in 2006, more than 10 percent in 1990 and 18.63 percent in 1981. Housing affordability in January reached its highest level in records dating to 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors, and prices are still 26 percent below their peak seven years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. homebuilders have rallied 4.8 percent this month and are up 30 percent in the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As long as home price appreciation, job growth and easing of lending standards &#8220;continue to move in a positive direction as expected,&#8221; most of the negative effect on housing demand would be offset, the JPMorgan analysts wrote. Under those circumstances, homes sales would stay above 4.8 million even with a 2 percentage point rise in mortgage rates from 2012 levels, creating the highest level of net demand since 2006, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The next two months of existing and new home sales will be critical to see if higher rates will affect the economy,&#8221; said Schmidt. &#8220;The current standard view of affordability is still pretty high and it will take more than 100 basis points to change that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- With assistance from Dakin Campbell, Megan Hickey and Dawn Kopecki in New York and Prashant Gopal in Boston: Editors: Pierre Paulden, Dan Kraut &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sherine El Madany" date="Jul 15, 2013  7:17 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-15/goldman-buy-rating-spurs-air-arabia-to-5-year-high-dubai-mover.html"><headline>Goldman Buy Rating Spurs Air Arabia to 5-Year High: Dubai Mover</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) surged to the
highest level in almost five years as volume jumped after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) upgraded the Middle East&#8217;s biggest no-frills carrier to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the airline jumped 5.1 percent to 1.23 dirhams,
the strongest since October 2008, at the close in Dubai as
volume increased to 122 million shares, 4.9 times the stock&#8217;s
three-month daily average. Air Arabia was the biggest gainer in
percentage terms on the benchmark DFM General Index (DFMGI), which rose
0.7 percent, taking an eight-day rally to 8.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Arabia&#8217;s stock has advanced 7.9 percent in the two days
since Goldman Sachs raised the shares to buy from neutral with a
price estimate of 1.54 dirhams, a 25 percent premium to today&#8217;s
closing price. Nine out of 13 analysts have a buy rating on the
carrier, which is based in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.A.E. and Qatar
were upgraded to emerging-market status last month by MSCI Inc. (MSCI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the rating upgrade and the MSCI emerging-markets
inclusion spurred the shares today, according to Amer Khan, a
Dubai-based director at Shuaa Asset Management. Dubai&#8217;s bid to
host the World Expo 2020 may be the next catalyst, which &#8220;would
bode particularly well for the likes of Air Arabia,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai plans to double the number of visitors to 20 million
by 2020 and triple annual revenue from the industry to 300
billion dirhams ($82 billion) amid an economic recovery, the
government said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Arabia&#8217;s first-quarter passenger traffic rose to a
record 1.45 million, the airline said in April. The company said
last month it plans to start flights to the capital of Armenia
in August, the fifth new route in 2013 and its 86th globally
from Sharjah, Egypt and Morocco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airline may post a 9 percent increase in full-year
profit to 457 million dirhams, according to the mean estimate of
eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as they battle in courts over smartphone and video technology, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG) have discovered a common foe: patent owners who try to sue their customers or go after an entire industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both companies are seeking to curb the litigation practices of firms that buy patents with the sole purpose of demanding royalties from as many end-users as they can, even if it means suing a pizza parlor or non-profit. Anger has united a cross section of retailers, finance companies, public-transit operators and hotels, and even caught the attention of President Barack Obama, who last month announced corrective measures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Focusing on that core issue could create pressure in Congress for legislation and action by U.S. courts -- as long as companies avoid the squabbling that marred the previous effort to change patent law. That took almost a decade and pitted industries, and even technology companies, against each other. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Going after bad litigation behavior is an approach we can all agree on,&#8221; said Tim Molino, director of government relations for Washington-based BSA - The Software Alliance, whose members include Microsoft and Oracle Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google spokesman Matt Kallman referred questions about patent legislation to the Coalition for Patent Fairness, a Washington-based lobbying group backed by Google, Cisco Systems Inc. and Intel Corp. Each month, the group has a meeting with an increasing number of organizations to discuss ways to get legislative change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s civil racketeering
case against Ecuadoreans it accuses of fabricating evidence to
win a $19 billion verdict in a pollution lawsuit will go to
trial on Oct. 15, a judge said in rejecting a defense request
for a delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron sued Ecuadoreans who had earlier claimed the San
Ramon, California-based company was responsible for pollution in
the Amazon rainforest. The company said the Ecuadoreans and
their New York-based lawyer, Steven Donziger, made up evidence
in the initial case. The trial will be held in Manhattan federal
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan today denied Donziger&#8217;s
request to delay the trial in order to find a new attorney.
Kaplan said Donziger has had four months to hire a new lawyer
since his prior counsel, John Keker, asked to leave the case
because he hadn&#8217;t been paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is unclear whether he has money to pay counsel but
chooses not to spend it, or whether he in fact does not have&#8221;
money, Kaplan said of Donziger in a written opinion. Donziger
&#8220;has offered no competent evidence of his financial
situation,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered by an Ecuadorean court in 2011 to pay
as much as $18.2 billion in damages for Texaco&#8217;s alleged dumping
of toxic drilling waste in the jungle from 1964 to about 1992.
Chevron acquired Texaco in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$19 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment came in an 18-year lawsuit decided by a judge
in Lago Agrio, a provincial capital near the Colombian border.
With interest, the judgment is now worth $19 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron denied wrongdoing, saying Texaco cleaned up its
share of pollution at oil fields that were later taken over
PetroEcuador, Ecuador&#8217;s state-owned oil company. Chevron says it
was released from liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In denying the defense request to postpone the October
trial, Kaplan today said the Ecuadorean plaintiffs are still
financing litigation in courts around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger and the plaintiffs claim they &#8220;are out of
money,&#8221; Kaplan said. &#8220;To the contrary, the record establishes
that they have raised millions of dollars in exchange for shares
of any recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Claims Influence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron accuses Donziger of improperly influencing a court
expert whose findings were relied upon by the judge in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger denies wrongdoing, and plaintiffs in the pollution
case said the company is attacking him to avoid paying damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Hamilton of Fenton Communications, a spokesman for the
Ecuadorean plaintiffs, declined to comment on Kaplan&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to detailing the extent of fraud and
misconduct carried out by the plaintiffs and their U.S.-based
lawyers at trial in October,&#8221; Morgan Crinklaw, a Chevron
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 1:11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The case in Ecuador is Aquinda v. Chevron,
002-2003, Superior Court of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese stock futures fell,
signaling the Nikkei 225 Stock Average may retreat from an
eight-week high, after the yen rose, Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s profit
dropped and a Federal Reserve official called for cuts to U.S.
stimulus. Australian equity futures declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp. (7203), a
Japanese carmaker that gets 31 percent of its sales in North
America, dropped 1.1 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s
biggest lender, fell 1.1 percent. ADRs of Woodside Petroleum
Ltd. (WPL), Australia&#8217;s second-largest oil and gas producer, declined
0.2 percent after crude fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 expiring in September closed
at 14,515 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 14,600 in Osaka,
Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 14,510 in Osaka at
8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia&#8217;s SP/ASX 200 Index
slipped 0.1 percent. New Zealand&#8217;s NZX 50 Index was little
changed. Futures on Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng Index and the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies trading in
Hong Kong both climbed 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Share markets in Japan and the U.S. are overheating and
need a quick correction,&#8221; said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities
manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of
Japan&#8217;s second-biggest lender by market value. &#8220;Investors are
paring back their optimistic outlook for U.S. earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stimulus Debate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.4 percent in New York yesterday,
halting its longest rally since January, as Coca-Cola reported
profit fell 4 percent, the second quarterly decline in a row, as
sales were sapped by economic weakness in China and Europe,
shifting tastes in the U.S. and unseasonable weather in places
such as India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Bank of Kansas City President Esther George said
yesterday the U.S. was on the &#8220;right path&#8221; for economic
recovery and that cuts in the pace of stimulus are
&#8220;appropriate.&#8221; Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will deliver his
semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress this week,
starting today at the House Financial Services Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen gained 0.8 percent to 99.10 per dollar yesterday
before trading at 99.15 at 7:50 a.m. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery slid 32
cents to settle at $106 a barrel on the New York Mercantile

&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 5.1 percent this year
through yesterday. The Asian benchmark traded at 13.3 times
estimated earnings, compared with 15.2 times for the SP 500 and
13.2 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. gained 0.5 percent to 88.77
yesterday, the strongest level since June 10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), addressing
persistent concerns that it has helped the U.S. government
gather customer information, said it doesn&#8217;t provide direct
access to e-mails, instant messages or Skype calls and refuses
to grant agencies the ability to break its encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter today to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the
company asked for permission to share more information on its
communication with government agencies, saying it has a
constitutional right to do so. Microsoft said such permission
has been delayed and asked Holder for personal help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and technology companies Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook
Inc. (FB) and Yahoo! Inc. have come under scrutiny since a former
U.S. National Security Agency contractor said publicly last
month that the NSA is collecting user data. Microsoft said that
while it&#8217;s limited in what it can disclose about communications,
the company doesn&#8217;t grant access to servers and only provides
governments with specific information about requests. That
includes data from its SkyDrive cloud service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not provide any government with the ability to
break the encryption, nor do we provide the government with the
encryption keys,&#8221; Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in
a blog post today. &#8220;When we are legally obligated to comply
with demands, we pull the specified content from our servers
where it sits in an unencrypted state, and then we provide it to
the government agency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, Holder&#8217;s spokesman, didn&#8217;t have an immediate
comment on the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guardian Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Guardian reported that Microsoft has helped
the NSA get around the company&#8217;s own encryption, citing
documents obtained by the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, also said
that when it receives a request for information held by a
corporate customer, the company redirects the government to the
client, unless prohibited from doing so. The Redmond,
Washington-based company said it has never provided information
on a corporate customer for national security purposes and
complied with four requests in 2012 related to criminal law
enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the NSA documents were leaked, Microsoft has held
talks with the Justice Department, Federal Bureau of
Investigation and others in the intelligence community about
which issues the company can publicly address, Smith wrote in
the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 0.3 percent to $36.27 at the close in New
York and has gained 36 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YPF SA rose the most among major
Argentine stocks on speculation the state-run energy company
will sign the first binding partnership to develop shale oil and
natural gas since its nationalization a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares gained 3.5 percent to 137.50 pesos in Buenos
Aires, the highest closing price since March last year.
Argentina&#8217;s benchmark index rose 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF, the best performer this month among 15 global peers
tracked by Bloomberg, will sign today an accord with Chevron
Corp. (CVX) in a ceremony to be attended by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer John Watson, newspaper El Cronista reported, citing a
government official it didn&#8217;t identify. Yesterday the government
said it will offer energy companies incentives if they invest $1
billion or more over a five-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock is rallying on the Chevron agreement and the
government decree,&#8221; Carlos Aszpis, an equity strategist at
Schweber  Cia. Sociedad de Bolsa SA, said by telephone from
Buenos Aires. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a nice combination of headlines
driving the move.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A definitive deal with Chevron, the world&#8217;s second-biggest
oil company, would help YPF tap the world&#8217;s second-largest shale
gas deposit and fourth-largest shale oil reservoir as the
country struggles to lift output and pare fuel imports. In a
preliminary arrangement, the ventures&#8217;s initial investments were
estimated at $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Independence Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson will travel to Argentina to sign the deal between
July 15 and July 16, Jorge Sapag, governor of Neuquen province
where the Vaca Muerta shale formation is located, said on June
26. Jim Craig, a spokesman for Chevron, couldn&#8217;t immediately be
reached by phone for comment today. A YPF official who isn&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly said he didn&#8217;t have any information
on when the agreement will be signed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernandez&#8217;s government seized a 51 percent stake in YPF
from Spain&#8217;s Repsol SA (REP) in April 2012 to stem fuel imports that
doubled to $9.4 billion in 2011 and are expected to rise to as
much as $15 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s investment will help make Argentina energy
independent, Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s head of Latin America,
Middle East and Africa, said May 16, after touring the shale
formation in southwestern Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta, Spanish for dead cow, may hold at least 23
billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to a report by
independent auditor Ryder Scott released in February 2012 by
YPF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF&#8217;s American depositary receipts rose 2.3 percent to
$16.27 in New York, the highest since Feb. 20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) said profit fell 4 percent last quarter, the second decline in a row, as sales were sapped by economic weakness in China and Europe, shifting tastes in the U.S. and unseasonable weather in places such as India. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has long touted its broad geographic reach and ability to make up for sluggish sales in one market with increases elsewhere. The second-quarter results show there&#8217;s a limit to that strategy, especially when Mother Nature and global economic forces refuse to cooperate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a confluence of events,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said today during a conference call. &#8220;The portfolio effect of our global business did not work in our favor in this particular case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To counter slower growth, Kent said he&#8217;s speeding up efforts in China and other emerging markets to expand Coca-Cola&#8217;s reach by adding smaller, more affordable package sizes. He said the company has not pulled back on marketing and advertising to blunt losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is more of an anomaly, we should not see this as a trend or a systemic issue,&#8221; Kent said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In India, for example, monsoons swamped sales, especially given unusually high growth one year ago after the monsoon season came late, Kent said. In Brazil, consumer spending was depressed by a credit crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that generates most of its revenue from trading,
sold $2.5 billion of five-year bonds after reporting second-quarter profits that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2.9 percent notes, expected to be rated A3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service, yield 155 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold $2.75 billion of 2.375 percent
debentures due 2018 in January that were priced to yield 165
basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. Those
securities traded yesterday at 98.8 cents on the dollar to yield
2.66 percent, or a 127.7 basis-point spread, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that earnings doubled on a surge
in underwriting revenue and gains from the firm&#8217;s own
investments. Second-quarter net income rose to $1.93 billion, or
$3.70 a share, from $962 million, or $1.78, a year earlier. That
beat the $2.89 average estimate of 27 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who
asked not to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) shares fell 14
percent, the most in more than 18 months, after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. set a target price more than 30 percent lower than
the electric-car maker&#8217;s close yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla plunged to $109.05 at the close in New York, the
biggest one-day decline since Jan. 13, 2012. Shares of the Palo
Alto, California-based company have more than tripled this year,
compared with an 18 percent increase in the Russell 1000 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Archambault, a Goldman Sachs auto analyst, set a
Tesla target price of $84, the average of three scenarios. That
compares with Tesla&#8217;s close of $127.26 yesterday and its record
$129.90 close on July 12. The report&#8217;s best-case scenario was a
target price of $113. Goldman Sachs cited &#8220;sustainability of
demand longer term&#8221; as among the risks for Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla shares have surged as the popularity of its $69,900
Model S sedan helped generate a first-quarter profit, the
company&#8217;s first. The automaker is ramping up production of the

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said earnings doubled, beating analysts&#8217; estimates on a surge in underwriting revenue and gains from the firm&#8217;s own investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income rose to $1.93 billion, or $3.70 a share, from $962 million, or $1.78, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $2.89 average estimate of 27 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains from debt investments almost tripled and fixed-income trading climbed 12 percent as Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, led Goldman Sachs through a drop in bond prices sparked by indications in May that the Federal Reserve may ease economic-stimulus measures. The bank has said it will benefit from expense cuts completed last year and a rebound in the U.S. economy that could fuel stock gains. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Look ahead, and the opportunity is really on risk-taking moving from debt to equity, and that plays very much into Goldman&#8217;s strengths,&#8221; Kenneth Leon, an analyst at Standard  Poor&#8217;s Capital IQ unit, told Erik Schatzker and Sara Eisen in an interview on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Directionally Goldman looks good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell $2.76, or 1.7 percent, to $160.24 at 4:04 p.m. in New York. The stock had gained 28 percent this year through yesterday after advancing 41 percent in 2012. The shares are still below their pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InsideClimateNews.org -- The 1940s-era construction process that ExxonMobil said caused an oil pipe to rupture in Arkansas earlier this year is a common and well-documented problem the pipeline industry has battled for decades&#8212;and one the industry believes can be detected and controlled with appropriate vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With proper inspection and maintenance, these catastrophic events can be prevented," said Mohammad Najafi, a pipeline construction expert and engineering professor at the University of Texas at Arlington. "As pipelines exceed their design lives, they need more maintenance and a proper asset management strategy to prevent or minimize these ruptures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves the public and regulators with two critical questions: Did Exxon manage and test its broken Pegasus pipeline according to established guidelines? And, if it did, is the Arkansas accident a warning that other pipelines might be at risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, the repercussions would be nationwide, since many of the nation''s liquid fuel and natural gas pipelines are of similar vintage and were built using the same inferior construction techniques. The gas line that ruptured in San Bruno, Calif. in September 2010, killing eight people and destroying 38 homes, included segments made with the same process as the Pegasus pipe. Investigators foundthat the pipeline''s owner, Pacific Gas  Electric, had neglected to properly inspect and repair the line and that regulators issued testing exemptions and placed "blind trust" in the company''s assurances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent maintenance and testing records for the Pegasus, as well as the metal analysis report that blamed the accident primarily on a 65-year-old manufacturing defect, would offer important insight into why the pipeline failed. Those documents, however, are being withheld from the public as well as from a Congressional committee, two Arkansas Congressmen and a water utility worried that the pipeline could foul drinking water for nearly half a million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has given pertinent data to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), the federal agency that regulates the nation''s pipelines, and to Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel (in response to a subpoena). But Exxon says the two most recent inspections it conducted on the Pegasus are proprietary and confidential, so they shouldn&#8217;t be shared with the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InsideClimate News has filed a formal request with PHMSA for the metallurgy report, along with a Federal Freedom of Information Act request for additional documents connected to the spill investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMSA hasn''t responded to the Freedom of Information Act request, which was filed in early June, and has refused to release the metallurgy report, citing the agency''s ongoing investigation of the accident. Exxon spokesman Aaron Stryk said the company is concerned only about keeping the inspection reports private. As far as the metallurgy report is concerned, "it is up to PHMSA when to make that publicly available," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Phillips, senior policy adviser for the House Natural Resources Committee, rejects the notion that the records should be kept from public view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is information about the chance of this becoming a pattern, then it is information that should be made known," he said. "Without that information, how do you know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"You can only play the secrecy card for so long."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon tested the Pegasus just a few weeks before the spill by sending a sophisticated inspection device called a pig through the line to look for flaws from the inside. Pipeline owners and regulators rely on pigs to detect corrosion, and specialized pigs are increasingly used to find potentially dangerous seam weld and other pipeline cracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the pigs used by Exxon in 2010 and 2013 both failed to detect the crack that turned into a 22-foot breach, it will cast doubt on their reliability for seam weld inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Weimer, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit watchdog organization based in Bellingham, Wash., said Exxon&#8217;s February test should have flagged the defect that ripped open the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it wasn''t detected, then that says maybe there is no way of finding these flaws," Weimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section that failed was constructed using low frequency electric resistance welded (ERW) pipe to create long seams down the length of the pipe. The technique was discontinued by 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all the pipelines of that vintage and built that way have defects, but they are all suspect and require constant monitoring to avoid disaster, experts say. Several industry reports offer step-by-step guidelines for monitoring and maintaining pipelines with these specific flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Kuprewicz, president of the pipeline consulting firm Accufacts Inc., said the known pipe manufacturing defects is like being predisposed to a grave illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may be a dormant gene or it may be an active gene," Kuprewicz said. Depending on how you treat and test the pipeline, "It may go to cancer, or you could live your entire life and it''s not a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worrisome Regulatory Gap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in the information being withheld from public view is keenest in Mayflower, Ark., where the Pegasus pipeline split open on March 29, sending an estimated 5,000 barrels&#8212;or 210,000 gallons&#8212;of sticky oil-like Canadian diluted bitumen, or dilbit, into a nearby lake and neighborhood, sickening residents and forcing 22 families to flee their homes. It''s also been a longtime concern for Central Arkansas Water, because more than 13 miles of the Pegasus line cross through a utility watershed that serves 400,000 people in the Little Rock area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to know what factors led to the rupture, and [have] assurances that those factors do not exist in the watershed," said John Tynan, watershed protection manager for Central Arkansas Water. "We want to do this through our own third party evaluation of the information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Central Arkansas Water asked to review Pegasus inspection records, but the request was rebuffed. The water utility wants the pipeline re-routed around the watershed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pegasus pipeline stretches 850 miles from Illinois to Texas, and carries up to 90,000 barrels per day of dilbit from Alberta&#8217;s landlocked tar sands. Its unusually long outage&#8212;four months so far&#8212;is already costly for Exxon, and threatens to become more so as its actions are scrutinized by regulators, the public and theEnvironmental Protection Agency, which has sued Exxon alleging that it violated the Clean Water Act. A second lawsuit, filed by the state of Arkansas, accuses the company of violating state environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Canadian oil producers, the idled pipeline is exacerbating a costly gap between pipeline capacity and booming production. What''s more, the Pegasus rupture gives more ammunition to those who oppose construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry dilbit from Canada to Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Exxon said the metallurgy report from an independent laboratoryfound that "original manufacturing defects" caused the Pegasus pipe seam to break apart in Arkansas. The lab also found that the pipeline was especially brittle, which limits the metal''s ability to flex with changes in pressure or flow inside the line. Exxon said the report included "no findings that indicate internal or external corrosion contributed to the failure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and PHMSA are conducting further tests to determine what else might have contributed to the pipeline''s failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section of the pipeline that burst was built in the late 1940s and originally ferried crude oil from the Gulf northward. After joining together with segments built in 1954 and 1973, the Pegasus carried oil from Nederland, Texas north to Patoka, Ill. For four years, from 2002 to 2006, the pipeline went unused. Then Exxon reversed the pipeline&#8217;s flow so it could carry a different product, Canadian dilbit, to Gulf Coast refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, in 2009, Exxon reactivated and upgraded pumping stations and other equipment so it could push 50 percent more dilbit through the 20-inch Pegasus line. The capacity expansion would have included a significant jump in operating pressure and stress on the pipeline, according to Najafi, the engineering professor at University of Texas-Arlington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That series of changes did not trigger any regulatory reviews or special testing. PHMSA merely requires pipeline operators to conduct tests at least every five years. The testing methods are at the discretion of pipeline owners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it''s sound pipe, and you''ve got a good handle on the threat, [reversing flows or increasing pressure] won''t make a difference," said Kuprewicz. "But if you''ve lost control of the anomalies, either by assumptions or you just don''t get it, you are increasing the risk that the pipeline will fail. Is it illegal? No. It''s a judgment call by the pipeline operator."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That regulatory gap might become more of an issue as more pipeline operators repurpose aging pipelines by reversing the flow and converting natural gas pipelines to carry oil and dilbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by the National Petroleum Council for the Department of Energy noted that "integrity issues will become more common dues to a number of age-related issues" such as corrosion and weld seam failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pipelines operating outside of their design parameters such as those carrying commodities for which they were not initially designed, or high flow pipelines, are at the greatest risk of integrity issues in the future due to the nature of their operation," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be special risks for pipelines moving dilbit. In a presentation to the petroleum council earlier this year, PHMSA''s Jeffrey Wiese said a thorough review is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the slides presented by Wiese, the agency''s associate administrator for pipeline safety, said: "We strongly support a rigorous analysis of the unique risks associated with dilbit transportation. Threats posed by this different commodity require thorough understanding. Risk controls for these threats must be robust."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, when Exxon reversed the Pegasus line to carry dilbit, it completed a hydrostatic test of the line that caused 12 pipe failures before it passed. The test is designed to force failures to eliminate vulnerabilities that could cause spills when the pipeline is in use. The company&#8217;s tests in 2010 and 2013 used the pipeline inspection tools known as pigs, which got their nickname from early models that squealed as they passed through pipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several industry reports have found that seam failures similar to the Pegasus rupture were caused by "pressure cycle-induced fatigue," a condition that develops when there are large and frequent swings in a pipeline&#8217;s internal pressure and flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pipelines carrying dilbit are prone to more pronounced pressure swings that can activate and accelerate pipeline flaws, according to Kuprewicz. That''s because the chemical composition and viscosity of the product varies by the batch, depending on how much and what type of diluent is mixed into the tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Exxon''s case, the Pegasus failed while operating below its allowed operating pressures, Kuprewicz said. "Which means this seam anomaly grew to a point where even normal operations put it at risk to rupture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the pipeline accident, PHMSA issued an order that prohibits Exxon from restarting the pipeline until the cause of the rupture is fully understood and adequate protections are in place. Once shipments resume, the pipeline must operate at a lower pressure, PHMSA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at SMU Cox School of Business in Dallas, said the government and Exxon will need to investigate everything about the pipeline in the coming months, beginning in 1948 when the pipeline was first installed. He likened it to a CSI&#8212;crime scene investigation&#8212;for pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have to look at every little detail because in those details might be the clues to what happened," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They should be looking at the product that has been put through the line over the years, the operating pressures and checking for any anomalies noted; those kinds of things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuprewicz said that as the investigation proceeds the public and outside experts should have access to the pertinent reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can only play the secrecy card for so long," he said. By denying public access to key information, "all you''re doing is adding suspicion to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republished with the permission of InsideClimate News, a Pulitzer Prize-winning non-profit news organization that covers energy and climate change issues.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the firm is &#8220;very
comfortable&#8221; with its ability to meet a proposed U.S. minimum
ratio of capital to assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, speaking on a conference call with analysts and
investors today, declined to estimate where the leverage ratio
stands for the parent company or the bank subsidiary. Under the
U.S. plan, the company would need capital equal to 5 percent of
assets and the bank unit must have 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will wait to see how the U.S. proposal
changes before taking action, Schwartz said. Earlier this year,
he told investors the New York-based bank had benefited from not
acting on a proposed rule on risk weighting for mortgages, a
regulation that was later softened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a proposed rule, so let&#8217;s see how the dialogue
goes with regulators,&#8221; Schwartz said. &#8220;Predicting rules and
responding can be incredibly costly, you can get wildly
misdirected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed leverage ratios for the biggest U.S. banks go
beyond the 3 percent global minimum requirement that the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision approved to help prevent
another financial crisis. The changes would make eight lenders
fund more of their assets with capital that can absorb losses
instead of with borrowed money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain&#8217;s second-largest bank by assets, hired Tushar Morzaria from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) to replace Chris Lucas as chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morzaria, CFO of corporate and investment banking at New
York-based JPMorgan, will join Barclays in the autumn before
Lucas retires on Feb. 28, the London-based bank said in a
statement today. JPMorgan said in a memorandum to employees it
will name a successor to Morzaria, 44, in coming days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a good choice,&#8221; said Chirantan Barua, an analyst at
Bernstein Research in London with an outperform rating on
Barclays. His &#8220;investment banking background helps because
that&#8217;s the one we want to invest in Barclays for, and that&#8217;s the
area which comes under risk every time from politicians.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony Jenkins, who took over as chief executive officer in
August, is trying to reduce costs and rebuild regulators&#8217;
confidence in the company following the lender&#8217;s 290 million-pound ($438 million) fine for rigging benchmark interest rates.
Lucas, 52, is the last of ex-CEO Robert Diamond&#8217;s senior
executives to depart. The investment bank generated about half
of the bank&#8217;s 2012 revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock slipped 0.5 percent to 308.15 pence in London
trading for a market value of 40 billion pounds. The shares are
up 17 percent this year, making it the second best-performing
U.K. bank stock this year after Lloyds Banking Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank that gets most of its revenue from trading, set aside a smaller portion for staff pay in the first half and cut 300 jobs in the second quarter as it seeks to pare expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation, which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, rose 10 percent to $8.04 billion in the first six months, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Revenue in the same period increased 13 percent to $18.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, is controlling expenses to boost return on equity, a measure of profitability, above last year&#8217;s 10.7 percent. Compensation was 38 percent of revenue in 2012, the second-lowest since Goldman Sachs has been a public company. The ratio of pay to revenue fell in the first half to 43 percent from 44 percent in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The culture around compensation is really making sure that we continue to attract and retain all the best people,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said at an investor conference in May. &#8220;The firm now is running with 75 percent more capital now than it was before the crisis, and so we want to make sure that we do our best to get the balance right for our shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first-half compensation expense is enough to pay each of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 31,700 employees $253,691 for the first six months of the year. The firm set aside $7.29 billion in the same period of 2012, equal to an average $225,789 for each of the 32,300 people employed by Goldman Sachs at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation for corporate and investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. lender, was almost unchanged in the first half from a year earlier. The $6.36 billion represented 33 percent of revenue at the unit, which was created last year when the company combined its investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Figures for average pay don&#8217;t represent what any employee actually receives and are calculated by dividing the total compensation expense by the number of workers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Victoria Slind-Flor" date="Jul 16, 2013  7:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-16/microsoft-green-mountain-weather-intellectual-property.html"><headline>Microsoft, Green Mountain, Weather: Intellectual Property</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Even as they battle in court over
smartphone and video technology, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG)
have discovered a common foe: patent owners who try to sue their
customers or go after an entire industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies are seeking to curb the litigation practices
of firms that buy patents with the sole purpose of demanding
royalties from as many end-users as they can, even if it means
suing a pizza parlor or nonprofit. Anger has united a cross-section of retailers, finance companies, public-transit
operators and hotels, and even caught the attention of President
Barack Obama, who last month announced corrective measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the issue could create pressure in Congress for
legislation and action by U.S. courts -- as long as companies
avoid the squabbling that marred the previous effort to change
patent law. That took almost a decade and pitted industries, and
even technology companies, against each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Going after bad litigation behavior is an approach we can
all agree on,&#8221; said Tim Molino, director of government
relations for Washington-based BSA - The Software Alliance,
whose members include Microsoft and Oracle Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google spokesman Matt Kallman referred questions about
patent legislation to the Coalition for Patent Fairness, a
Washington-based lobbying group backed by Google, Cisco Systems
Inc. and Intel Corp. Each month, the group has a meeting with an
increasing number of organizations to discuss ways to get
legislative change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased political attention is due to patent owners
who started going after product end-users, demanding cheap
settlements from a large number of companies. A White House-commissioned report estimated that more than 100,000 companies
were threatened last year, including members of politically
connected Washington trade groups like the National Retail
Federation and Financial Services Roundtable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress have proposed legislation to limit some
patent owners from seeking product import bans at the U.S.
International Trade Commission, expand reviews of business
method patents and force certain patent owners who lose at trial
to pay legal fees of those they accused of infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courts have also been trying to curb abuses. The ITC, a
quasi-judicial agency in Washington, set up a program to resolve
certain patent cases more quickly. The chief judge of the
federal appeals court that specializes in patent law co-wrote a
New York Times opinion piece advocating sanctions for litigation
abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a consensus could mean avoiding more controversial
issues such as curbing software patents, and ensuring that any
changes don&#8217;t have unintended consequences that hurt
universities needing legal protection for their research and
patent-reliant businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Samsung Gets Patent on Mobile Phone That Docks With Tablet
Device &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the Korean maker of smartphones
and other electronic devices, received a patent for a mobile
telephone that docks into a tablet device, according to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent D685774, issued July 9, is described as &#8220;a terminal
for wireless communication.&#8221; According to the patent drawings,
the mobile phone appears to have a USB port and a jack for a
headphone. The phone flares at the top and has rounded lower
edges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seocho-gu, South Korea-based Samsung applied for the patent
in June 2012, with the assistance of NSIP Law of Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a statement yesterday that it was
seeking the cause of an explosion of one of its mobile phones.
Samsung said it was focused on quality control and customer
safety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Green Mountain Unit Seeks Trademark for Home Soda Machine &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)&#8217;s Keurig unit filed an
application to register a trademark to be used with soda
machines, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application, filed July 3, is to register &#8220;Karbon&#8221; as
a trademark for &#8220;machines for the production of cold water,
soda, still, carbonated and sparkling beverages.&#8221; A second
application filed that day is to register &#8220;Bolt,&#8221; to be used
for carafes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keurig&#8217;s soda machine would compete with those made by
Israel&#8217;s SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not going to comment on this specific trademark,&#8221;
Suzanne DuLong, a spokeswoman for Waterbury, Vermont-based Green
Mountain, said in an e-mail. &#8220;As we continue to grow, we are
likely to seek any number of trademarks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipboard Sued by Company Seeking to Use &#8216;Flowboard&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipboard Inc., a maker of software for use on mobile
devices, was sued over a trademark by a Seattle-based software
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed July 11 in federal court
in Seattle, Treemo Inc. is seeking a court declaration that its
&#8220;Flowboard&#8221; mark doesn&#8217;t infringe Flipboard&#8217;s trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treemo said it has been contacted by counsel for Flipboard
threatening legal action over the trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court papers, Treemo said that during the process of
applying to register Flowboard as a trademark, the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office &#8220;found no conflicting marks that would bar
registration.&#8221; The company is also arguing that the two marks
are used for different purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flowboard is used for a software product &#8220;for the creation
of side-scrolling presentations with images, text, video links
and photo galleries,&#8221; according to the complaint. Flipboard is
used with social networking services, something Treemo says it
doesn&#8217;t offer under its Flowboard mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Treemo argued that the patent office database
contains almost 600 registrations or pending applications that

the respective marks -- Flow and Flip --&#8220;connote substantially
different images in the minds of ordinary consumers,&#8221; Treemo
said in its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipboard, based in Palo Alto, California, sent a statement
to the TechCrunch website saying that it had wanted to resolve
the dispute with Treemo amicably and that it&#8217;s concerned about
the likelihood of confusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goodreads Sued for Copyright Infringement Over Boy Band Photo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodreads Inc., whose website lets readers share book
recommendations, was sued for copyright infringement by a
company that owns and licenses celebrity photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed July 5 in federal court in Los Angeles, is
one of more than 20 brought since March 1 by BWP Media USA Inc.
of Los Angeles. The company is represented in all these suits by
Sanders Law Pllc of Garden City, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BWP said in its complaint that photos of a member of the
boy band IM5 were posted on Goodreads without authorization and
in willful violation of its copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodreads, based in Santa Monica, California, didn&#8217;t
respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment on the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BWP asked the court money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets Case Against Weather Channel to Proceed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather Channel LLC, the television network owned by Bain
Capital LLC, Blackstone Group LP and NBC Universal International
Ltd., failed to persuade a federal court to dismiss a trade-secrets case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events Media Network Inc. of Shamong, New Jersey, sued
Weather Channel in Pennsylvania state court in March 2012,
claiming it violated a confidentiality agreement with respect to
its events database. The database had been licensed to Weather
Channel through May 1, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather Channel used this confidential information both
after the license expired and for purposes not covered by the
agreement, Events Media said in its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was moved to federal court in Pennsylvania in May
2012 before heading to a New Jersey federal court in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weather Channel asked that the case be dismissed,
saying that the database didn&#8217;t qualify for trade-secrets
protection because it contained information that was publicly
available and that Events Media didn&#8217;t take enough care to
protect its secrecy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert B. Kugler in Camden, New Jersey,
on July 12 rejected Weather Channel&#8217;s arguments. He said the
trade-secrets claims were made under Georgia law, which
specifically covers compilations of what may be available to the
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge also concluded that Events Media took care to
protect the confidentiality of the database and found that the
license agreement with Weather Channel specifically limited the
ways the information could be disclosed. The agreement also
required reporting any inadvertent or improper use of the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Events Media Network Inc. v. Weather Channel
Interactive Inc., 13-cv-00003, U.S. District Court, District of
New Jersey (Camden). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, is near a deal with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to settle allegations that the lender rigged
electricity markets, the Wall Street Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which would resolve claims that the bank
manipulated power prices in California and the Midwest, could
require the largest payout in the agency&#8217;s history, according to
the report, which cited people familiar with the discussions.
Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, and
Mary O&#8217;Driscoll, a FERC spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous negotiations between JPMorgan and the regulator
involved a payout figure close to $1 billion, according to the
Wall Street Journal. A deal could cost the bank $500 million,
the New York Times reported today, citing people briefed on the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC warned JPMorgan in March that its personnel and two
subsidiaries may face claims stemming from a probe into its
bidding practices, according to a regulatory disclosure from the
bank in May. Claims may include &#8220;alleged violations of FERC
rules and the rules of certain independent system operators,&#8221;
the lender said at the time, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has stepped up scrutiny of
corporations as the agency wields policing powers that were
expanded in the wake of Enron Corp.&#8217;s 2001 collapse.
Wellinghoff, whose term was due to expire June 30, submitted his
resignation in May. President Barack Obama asked him to stay
until a new commissioner is confirmed by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the regulator ordered Barclays Plc (BARC) and four
former traders to pay a combined $487.9 million in fines and
penalties for engaging in what the agency said was a scheme to
manipulate energy markets in the Western U.S. from November 2006
to December 2008. London-based Barclays said it would
&#8220;vigorously&#8221; fight the penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agency investigators may seek to hold JPMorgan traders and
commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters &#8220;individually liable,&#8221;
the New York Times reported in May, citing a 70-page document
the watchdog sent the bank in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC revoked a JPMorgan unit&#8217;s right to trade power for
six months in November after accusing the firm of providing
misleading information to a California energy authority. The
suspension, which took effect in April, marked the first such
sanction for an active market participant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG is among companies that have settled with
FERC. The Frankfurt-based lender agreed on Jan. 22 to pay $1.6
million to resolve FERC claims that an energy-trading unit
manipulated markets in 2010. The bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest, didn&#8217;t
admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s hard for a company that&#8217;s
improved a pilloried product to announce to the world, &#8220;Hey, we
stink less than we used to.&#8221; So, Apple (AAPL), ATT (T) and Microsoft, I&#8217;m
here to do it for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With relatively little fanfare, the three tech giants have
significantly improved offerings that, in their earlier forms,
earned scathing criticism and damaged reputations: ATT&#8217;s voice
service, Apple Maps and Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing that ever happened to ATT Mobility was also
the worst: the four years it held exclusive U.S. rights to
Apple&#8217;s iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a business standpoint, it was undoubtedly a winner,
bringing millions of customers. From a user standpoint, it was a
disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT&#8217;s network was overwhelmed by the bandwidth-munching
hordes of iPhone users, giving it a well-deserved reputation for
uncompleted and dropped calls and making it the butt of late-night TV humor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT &#8220;literally got crushed by the iPhone, and public
perception was even worse,&#8221; says Bill Moore, president and
chief executive officer of RootMetrics, a Bellevue, Washington-based firm that uses crowd-sourced data to help measure wireless
carriers&#8217; performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carrier Choice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, ATT has poured tens of
billions of dollars into improving its network. Meanwhile, the
2011 end of its exclusive deal gave iPhone users a choice of
carriers. Verizon Wireless, Sprint (S) and most recently T-Mobile US
now offer the iPhone to their customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith Olbermann, a TV host with a
history of drawing viewers and battling his bosses, will return
to Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ESPN sports network to host a nightly show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olbermann, 54, comes back to the network starting Aug. 26
with a daily late-night program airing at 11 p.m. New York time,
Bristol, Connecticut-based ESPN said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Olbermann&#8221; will air on ESPN 2, focusing on relevant
sports topics through a mix of commentary, interviews, panel
discussions and highlights. Olbermann, who hosted liberal-leaning shows on MSNBC and Current TV, won&#8217;t discuss politics,
except as it relates to sports, he said on a conference call
with reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If George W. Bush wants to talk baseball, I&#8217;d be happy to
have him,&#8221; Olbermann said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olbermann had been a popular host on &#8220;Sports Center,&#8221;
ESPN&#8217;s nightly newscast, in the 1990s. The network is bringing
him back as it braces for competition from Fox Sports 1, a 24-hour channel from Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s 21st Century Fox Inc. that
begins next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly the timing of some of what we&#8217;re doing is
intended to put us in a competitive position,&#8221; ESPN President
John Skipper said on the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olbermann left ESPN in 1997 after falling out with
executives. Then after three years with Fox Sports Networks,
Olbermann landed at NBCUniversal&#8217;s MSNBC. The political show
&#8220;Countdown With Keith Olbermann&#8221; ran for eight years and ended
with the host leaving in January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, Olbermann joined Al Gore&#8217;s Current TV cable
channel in February 2011. The 13-month stint ended with lawsuits
and insults between Olbermann and the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no way to forecast my career path,&#8221;  Olbermann
said on the call. &#8220;I&#8217;ve given up trying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he appreciates the &#8220;fresh start&#8221; at ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.5 percent to
$65.36 at the New York close. The stock has climbed 31 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options (IBM) traders are paying the most
since 2005 to protect against stock swings in International
Business Machines Corp. relative to its peers on concern profit
will trail analyst estimates for a second quarter as sales drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied volatility for contracts with an exercise price
closest to the company&#8217;s stock was 1.44 times the Technology
Select Sector SPDR Fund, the highest since September 2005,
according to three-month data compiled by Bloomberg. IBM shares
have slumped 8.6 percent over the past three months, the most in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has pushed the
company into faster-growing markets like data analysis and
repurchased shares, IBM is contending with sluggish demand for
hardware and consulting work. IBM missed earnings estimates in
April for the first time in eight years and will probably say
today that second-quarter revenue fell 2 percent, based on
analysts&#8217; estimates tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to meet these earnings numbers, otherwise you
get penalized,&#8221; Edward Painvin, chief investment officer of
Chase Investment Counsel Corp., said by phone from
Charlottesville, Virginia, on July 15. His firm oversees $500
million and doesn&#8217;t own IBM shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to do for a
name of this size with very, very little top line growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
agreed to sell a majority stake in Redi, a unit that provides
trading technology, to a group of Wall Street firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyers include Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch
unit, Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA (BNP), Citadel LLC and Lightyear
Capital LLC, according to a statement today. New York-based
Goldman Sachs will keep a &#8220;significant minority equity stake&#8221;
in the company. Financial terms were not disclosed. Rishi
Nangalia, who previously co-managed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s electronic
trading business development group, will serve as the company&#8217;s
chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diversification of Redi&#8217;s ownership may make the unit
more attractive to clients compared with being controlled by a
single brokerage, according to Jamie Selway, head of electronic
brokerage and sales at Investment Technology Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is heading toward a consortium approach,&#8221; Selway
said in a phone interview. &#8220;Clients are more comfortable with
broker neutrality in the context of independent technology
providers or consortium of broker dealers. The operation of
these systems requires a technology culture and can be
expensive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired the software that formed the basis
for Redi when it purchased New York Stock Exchange specialist
Spear, Leeds  Kellogg LP in 2000 and has expanded it to handle
trades in asset classes such as currencies and interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RealTick &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s plans come about two years after London-based Barclays Plc (BARC) sold the RealTick trading platform, which
lets customers access services from multiple brokers, to New
York-based ConvergEx Inc. Barclays said in December 2010 that it
planned to use the system within its investment banking unit and
offer the platform to customers. The bank got RealTick when it
acquired parts of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co., Knight Capital Group
Inc. and other securities firms bought execution-management
systems starting in the mid-2000s to give mutual funds and other
clients access to exchanges and algorithms, or trading
strategies that allow them to process larger orders in small
pieces over a preset period, along with other transaction
services. Some platforms were open to the algorithms of multiple
brokers or technology providers while others focused on those
from a single firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Technology Group (ITG) and Instinet Inc., a subsidiary
of Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., offer execution platforms
to customers. Both firms are execution-only brokers that don&#8217;t
trade with their own money. Bloomberg LP, the parent of
Bloomberg News, offers similar systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Asian stocks rose as material
producers advanced ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke&#8217;s address to the U.S. Congress today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton Ltd. added 2.3 percent in Sydney after the
world&#8217;s biggest mining company said fourth-quarter iron-ore
production gained 17 percent. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. jumped 11
percent in Tokyo on a report the carmaker will pay its first
dividend in 16 years. China Resources Power Holdings Co. slumped
10 percent after a Xinhua News Agency reporter said the power
generator and the chairman of its state-owned parent
intentionally overpaid for a 2010 acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent to 135.89 as
of 7:56 p.m. in Hong Kong, after rising as much as 0.2 percent
and falling 0.4 percent. About five stocks rose for every four
that fell on the measure, which closed yesterday at the highest
level since May 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The primary positive driver for the global share market
is sustained U.S. recovery,&#8221; said Matthew Sherwood, head of
investment markets research in Sydney at Perpetual Investments,
which manages about $25 billion. The recovery &#8220;has removed a
lot of downside risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relative Value &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asia-Pacific measure rose 5.1 percent this year through
yesterday, with consumer discretionary stocks leading the gain
and energy shares falling the most among the 10 industry groups
on the measure. The Asian benchmark gauge traded at 13.3 times
estimated earnings, compared with 15.2 times for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and 13.2 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Topix index added 0.2 percent. South Korea&#8217;s Kospi
index climbed 1.1 percent. Australia&#8217;s SP/ASX 200 Index fell
0.1 percent, while New Zealand&#8217;s NZX 50 Index gained less than
0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng Index (HSI) added 0.3 percent, while the
Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China&#8217;s
stock exchanges, declined 1 percent. Taiwan&#8217;s Taiex Index was
little changed and Singapore&#8217;s Straits Times Index lost 0.5
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the SP 500 were little changed. The measure
dropped 0.4 percent in New York yesterday, halting its longest
rally since January, as Coca-Cola Co. reported that profit fell
4 percent, the second quarterly decline in a row. Sales were
sapped by economic weakness in China and Europe, shifting tastes
in the U.S. and unseasonable weather in places such as India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bernanke Testimony &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke will deliver his semi-annual monetary policy
report to Congress this week, starting today at the House
Financial Services Committee. Fed Bank of Kansas City President
Esther George said yesterday the U.S. was on the &#8220;right path&#8221;
for economic recovery and that cuts in the pace of stimulus are
&#8220;appropriate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material producers gained the most among the 10 industry
groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. BHP Billiton was the
biggest support to the group, rising 2.3 percent to A$34.19 in
Sydney after saying iron-ore output was 47.7 million metric tons
in the three months ended June 30, from 40.9 million tons a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd
added 6 percent to A$3.71 and Anhui Conch Cement Co., a Chinese
cement maker, rose 6.1 percent to HK$23.40 in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mitsubishi Motors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Motors jumped 11 percent to 160 yen in Tokyo
after the Nikkei newspaper reported the carmaker&#8217;s dividend may
exceed 10 yen for the current fiscal year, which would be the
first dividend in 16 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Resources Power slumped 10 percent to HK$17.98 in
Hong Kong after the official Xinhua News Agency posted a letter
online from one of its reporters, Wang Wenzhi, saying that Song
Lin, chairman of parent China Resources (Holdings) Co., overpaid
for a 2010 acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Shenhua Energy Co., the nation&#8217;s biggest coal miner
by market value, jumped 5.3 percent to HK$21.80 in Hong Kong
after revenue rose last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billabong International Ltd. (BBG), a global surfwear maker,
surged 34 percent to 33.5 Australian cents in Sydney after its
chief executive officer stepped down yesterday amid a
refinancing deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks and payment card providers
would face caps on the transaction fees they can demand from
retailers under European Union plans to rein in charges that
have been attacked by regulators as anticompetitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the 28-nation EU&#8217;s executive arm,
will propose that interchange fees paid by retailers on card
transactions should be capped at 0.2 percent for debit card
payments and 0.3 percent for credit cards, according to draft
plans obtained by Bloomberg News. The caps would initially apply
to cross-border transactions, and then be expanded to also cover
domestic payments after two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers have long opposed the extra costs associated with
accepting credit and debit cards. Unlike with checks, banks
charge fees, known as interchange, to process card payments. The
amounts are set by MasterCard Inc. (MA) and Visa Inc. (V), which own the
payment networks and pass the money to the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fees &#8220;restrict competition as they inflate the cost of
card acceptance by merchants without leading to benefits for
consumers,&#8221; according to the document. They result in &#8220;higher
final prices for goods and services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission proposal, by seeking to use legislation to
limit such fees, marks an expansion in the EU&#8217;s assault against
the practice. The agency has said that it will publish the plans
on July 24. They would require approval by governments and the
European Parliament before they take effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International
AG, the nationalized Austrian lender burdened with bad debt,
chose Sachsen Asset Management GmbH and Bankhaus Lampe KG to
draft a plan for spinning off its bad-assets unit, said two
people with knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypo Alpe, based in Klagenfurt, Austria, told the two
German advisers to come up with a plan for the unit with at
least 12 billion euros ($16 billion) in assets that minimizes
the burden for the Austrian government&#8217;s budget, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn&#8217;t
public. A decision won&#8217;t be made before Austria&#8217;s national
elections on Sept. 29, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klaus Liebscher, the former central bank governor who leads
the government agency dealing with bank aid, known as Fimbag,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Hypo Alpe,
SachsenAM and Bankhaus Lampe officials declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria is accelerating Hypo Alpe&#8217;s breakup to gain
European Union approval for the 2.2 billion euros in state aid
the lender received in the last five years. Once its operating
units are sold, it will end up with the non-performing and
unsellable assets, which include Croatian hotel project loans,
leasing contracts across eastern Europe and seized loan
collateral ranging from shopping malls to yachts and tractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debt Fears &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Maria Fekter opposed Hypo Alpe&#8217;s plans to
spin off a &#8220;bad bank&#8221; on concern its liabilities may add to
Austria&#8217;s government debt and drive it beyond 80 percent of
gross domestic product. Chancellor Werner Faymann and Vice
Chancellor Michael Spindelegger told her to revisit the plans
after the non-performing assets caused losses and capital needs
at Hypo Alpe that have burdened Austria&#8217;s budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bad bank set up as a company without a banking license
would require it to hold less capital, lowering the need for
additional state injections. Austrian banks have softened their
opposition to taking a role in a bad bank, opening the
opportunity to involve private investors in a similar way as in
Spain or Ireland. That would avoid the need for the state to
recognize the liabilities on its balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit SpA (UCG)&#8217;s Bank Austria unit may drop its opposition
to the plan if a bank levy is cut in return, Chief Executive
Officer Willibald Cernko said last month. Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI)&#8217;s new CEO, Karl Sevelda, said last week that he
would look at the proposal according to the principle &#8220;do ut
des,&#8221; citing a Latin phrase meaning &#8220;I give in order that you
may give.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said U.S. retailers
sold 140,000 Xbox 360 units in June, helping it retain the top-selling spot for game consoles for the 30th straight month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June spending on all Xbox products, including the console,
Kinect motion-sensing peripheral and software, totaled $197
million, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today in an e-mail, citing NPD Group Inc. data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of the console fell 46 percent compared with a year
earlier, when it sold 257,000 consoles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq 100 Index futures dropped
after Google Inc.&#8217;s second-quarter results fell short of
estimates and Microsoft Inc.&#8217;s profit missed projections, adding
to disappointing results from big technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Nasdaq 100 slid 1 percent to 3,047.50 at
5:11 p.m. in New York. The index slipped 0.2 percent today even
as the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose to records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are some chinks in the armor out there,&#8221; Daniel Genter, who oversees about $4 billion as president and chief
executive officer of Los Angeles-based RNC Genter Capital
Management, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Though is it priced
for perfection, it isn&#8217;t perfection. Investors are becoming more
discerning with regards to individual stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google slid 3.8 percent to $876. The owner of the world&#8217;s
most popular search engine reported second-quarter sales and
profit that fell short of analysts&#8217; estimates as advertising
tied to mobile devices crimped average prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plunged 6.1 percent to $33.28 as profit missed
analysts&#8217; projections after Windows sales were hurt by shrinking
demand for personal computers amid an unexpected writedown of
unsold Surface tablet inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results from Google and Microsoft came after technology
stocks fell 0.3 percent during regular trading, the second-worst
performance among 10 groups in the SP 500 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. fell the most in the Dow today after
forecasting sales that may fall short of some analysts&#8217;
estimates. EBay Inc. tumbled 6.7 percent, the most since August
2011, after its third-quarter sales forecast missed estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 gained 0.5 percent to 1,689.37 at 4 p.m. in New
York, as earnings from Morgan Stanley and UnitedHealth Group
Inc. beat estimates and jobless claims fell. The index surpassed
its previous intraday high of 1,687.18 set on May 22. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average added 78.02 points, or 0.5 percent, to
15,548.54, also a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 futures were up 0.3 percent at 5:15 p.m. in New

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services company, raised its annual
forecast after second-quarter earnings topped analysts&#8217;
estimates, lifted by cost cuts and share buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding a $1 billion restructuring expense, profit was
$3.91 a share last quarter, the Armonk, New York-based company
said yesterday in a statement. That beat the $3.78 that analysts
projected on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
IBM now expects to earn at least $16.90 a share in 2013, up from
the $16.70 it forecast earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has managed to increase profit by shifting away from
low-margin businesses, cutting jobs and repurchasing stock --
even as revenue declines. The company is betting that faster-growing areas such as cloud computing and data analysis can
offset a broader slowdown in information-technology spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to take them at their word that they&#8217;re going to
see some productivity improvements due to the workforce changes,
and some strength in software and services,&#8221; said Josh Olson,
an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres, Missouri.
&#8220;They&#8217;re getting a benefit from software growing at a faster
pace than the other businesses, and that&#8217;s contributing to the
profit beat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares climbed 1.8 percent to $197.99 at the close in
New York. The stock is up 3.4 percent this year, trailing an 18
percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Shortfall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By beating earnings estimates, IBM rebounds from a rare
stumble in the previous quarter, when its profit missed
projections for the first time in eight years. Even so, revenue
continued to decline, falling 3.3 percent to $24.9 billion from
a year earlier. Analysts had expected $25.3 billion. Sales
declined in every IBM business division other than software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a slump in demand, currency changes took a
toll on IBM&#8217;s results last quarter. In Japan, where the company
made about 10 percent of its sales last year, the yen fell 5
percent versus the dollar in the second quarter. The company was
&#8220;significantly impacted&#8221; by the yen&#8217;s weakness, Chief
Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because our business in Japan is more heavily skewed to
local services, we have less ability to hedge cross-border cash
flows as compared to most other countries,&#8221; Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intel, Accenture &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other technology companies are suffering as well. Intel
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker, reported its fourth
straight revenue decline yesterday as customers shunned personal
computers, choosing tablets and smartphones instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accenture Plc (ACN), the world&#8217;s largest technology-consulting
company after IBM, gave a sales forecast last month that missed
analysts&#8217; estimates. Accenture blamed customers deferring
decisions on long-term contracts. Oracle Corp. (ORCL), meanwhile, has
missed sales estimates for two straight quarters, hurt by
slumping hardware revenue and a shift by customers to
applications delivered online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said today that one recent deal with UniCredit SpA is
indicative of how it aims to transform its business. The 10-year
outsourcing deal, worth multiple billions, will employ analytics
and cloud computing to devise new ways for the bank to do
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM prioritizes earnings over revenue growth in its five-year road map, which is targeting profit of $20 a share by 2015,
up from the $15.25 earned last year. The plan calls for a
combination of buybacks, acquisitions and investments in faster-growing markets to reach that goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware Shakeup &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the previous quarter&#8217;s earnings shortfall, Chief
Executive Officer Ginni Rometty shook up the management of IBM&#8217;s
struggling hardware division. She replaced Rod Adkins with Tom Rosamilia, who had been overseeing corporate strategy. That
division saw a 12 percent decrease in sales last quarter, an
improvement from the 17 percent drop in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also embarked on a restructuring program last quarter,
cutting jobs globally. More than 3,300 workers were dismissed in
the U.S. and Canada alone, according to Alliance@IBM, an
employee group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in April that divestitures would help
offset the $1 billion cost of the restructuring. At the time,
IBM was in talks to sell parts of its server division to Lenovo
Group Ltd. (992), according to people familiar with the discussions.
The negotiations broke down in early May due to disagreements
over price, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Active Discussions&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the company said it was reducing its expectations
for second-half gains from a divestiture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The substantial second-half gain that we were counting on
in our view of EPS will not likely close at the end of this
year, but we&#8217;re still in active discussions,&#8221; Loughridge said.
&#8220;We have a very disciplined MA process. We&#8217;re not going to
underprice or rush a divestiture simply to close within 2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income fell 17 percent to $3.23 billion,
or $2.91 a share, from $3.88 billion, or $3.34, a year earlier.
The company paid $1 billion in dividends and made $3.6 billion
in stock buybacks in the period, boosting earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is seeing growth in high-margin businesses and
bookings look promising, Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re exiting the quarter stronger than we entered,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is eliminating perks including executive car allowances as the world&#8217;s biggest entertainment company looks to further boost profitability. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re phasing them out,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said of the car allowances in an interview at last week&#8217;s Allen  Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney has been reducing costs by firing hundreds of workers, closing offices and outsourcing duties like video-game development as it looks to widen profit margins and extend a more than doubling of the stock price in the past five years. Rasulo, who has been conducting a company-wide review of expenses, said he&#8217;s seeking to modernize operations at Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We looked at the way technology is changing our businesses,&#8221; said Rasulo, who didn&#8217;t discuss specifics. &#8220;We&#8217;re removing vestigial parts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has focused on efficiency since becoming CEO in 2005, said Robin Diedrich, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis who recommends the stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Operating margin, a measure of profitability, widened to 21 percent of sales in the most recent fiscal year from 13 percent in fiscal 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income has more than doubled to $5.68 billion, outpacing the 35 percent gain in sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
employee who ran the firm&#8217;s mortgage correlation trading desk
testified that Fabrice Tourre failed to tell investors about the
role of Paulson  Co. in the deal at the center of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud case against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Egol, now a Goldman Sachs managing director, told
jurors in Manhattan federal court today that he is &#8220;not aware
of any&#8221; disclosures to investors that Paulson, the New York
hedge fund that stood to make money from the failure of Abacus
2007-AC1, a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, helped
select the mortgage-backed assets underlying it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egol said Tourre did make sure to tell a superior that
Paulson helped pick the portfolio of 90 subprime mortgage-backed
securities when Goldman&#8217;s money was at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Tourre and Goldman Sachs in 2010 over the
Abacus transaction. Paulson, run by billionaire John Paulson,
used the deal to bet against mortgage-backed securities.
Investors on the other side of the bet lost more than $1
billion. Goldman Sachs, based in New York, paid a then-record
$550 million to settle the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Tourre after dropping a plan to file claims
against Egol, according to interviews with SEC enforcement staff
conducted by the agency&#8217;s inspector general, which were made
available to Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act
request. Egol testified yesterday that Tourre was the Goldman
Sachs employee primarily responsible for the Abacus transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Four Hours &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egol testified for about four hours, yesterday and today,
under questioning from SEC lawyer Matthew Martens. He&#8217;s being
questioned by Tourre&#8217;s lawyers this afternoon. The SEC told U.S.
District Judge Katherine Forrest yesterday that after Egol, it
plans to call former Goldman Sachs saleswoman Gail Kreitman as a
witness and play a Jan. 17, 2007, recorded call between Kreitman
and ACA Financial Guaranty Corp.&#8217;s Lucas Westreich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claims Kreitman told Westreich that Paulson was
taking a long, rather than a purely short, position in Abacus,
passing along false information she got from Tourre. The agency
says ACA, which lost money in a long bet on the transaction,
would have refused to serve as portfolio selection agent and
wouldn&#8217;t have invested in the transaction if it had known that
Paulson stood to gain from its failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said it expects Kreitman to testify that she
doesn&#8217;t recall who told her Paulson was buying the equity
tranche in Abacus, but that she generally recalls Tourre was the
most likely source of the false information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streamlining Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC had planned to call David Gerst, another one of
Tourre&#8217;s former Goldman Sachs colleagues, after Egol. SEC
lawyers told Forrest they moved up Kreitman as part of an effort
to streamline their case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in the SEC witness list came after Martens spent
most of yesterday battling with Paolo Pellegrini, the former
Paulson executive who helped Paulson&#8217;s fund make more than $15
billion shorting subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pellegrini frequently argued with Martens and claimed the
SEC tricked and intimidated him in its investigation into the
Abacus transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Susanne Walker" date="Jul 18, 2013  2:36 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-18/treasuries-may-post-losses-for-3-years-goldman-s-beinner-says.html"><headline>Treasuries May Post Losses for 3 Years, Goldman&#8217;s Beinner Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries may produce negative
returns over the next two to three years as the Federal Reserve
winds down its bond-buying program and interest rates rise,
according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The benefits of owning long-term government bonds have
been eroded,&#8221; Jonathan Beinner, co-head of global fixed-income
and liquidity management at the unit of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., said to reporters in New York. There&#8217;s &#8220;very little
cushion. Expected returns are likely to be less than cash, and
are likely to be negative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke reiterated before Congress
today that the bond purchases could be reduced more quickly or
expanded as economic conditions warrant. Bond market measures
such as overnight index swaps project that the Fed&#8217;s target rate
for overnight loans may be increased by 25 basis points in the
first quarter of 2015, after being kept in a range of zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should &#8220;limit the amount of U.S. interest-rate
risk in a portfolio,&#8221; Beinner said. If the yield on the 10-year
Treasury note rises to 4 percent to 5 percent over the next two
to three years, returns will be negative, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the 10-year note was 2.5 percent today, after
touching an almost two-year high of 2.75 percent on July 8. The
yield is forecast to end the year at 2.63 percent according to
the median forecast of 67 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries have lost 2.4 percent this year, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, amid speculation that the
Fed may begin to slow asset buying under its quantitative-easing
strategy. U.S. government debt gained 2.2 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s the &#8220;opportunity to own other markets,&#8221; Beinner
said, adding that Goldman Sachs Asset Management is &#8220;favorably
disposed&#8221; to fixed-income securities of emerging markets,
including Brazil and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refuge demand for Treasuries has declined, Beinner
said, adding that Goldman Sachs Asset Management has &#8220;an
optimistic outlook&#8221; on the U.S. economy and favors high-yield
securities and credit returns, floating-rate assets, bank loans
and leveraged-loan assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product should climb between 2.54 percent to
3 percent in 2014 with the U.S. economy on &#8220;relatively strong
footing,&#8221; Beinner said. A median forecast of 96 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey estimate GDP should rise by 2.7 percent in
2014, up from an estimate of 1.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Fed ends QE in mid-2014, then the first rate
increase may be in &#8220;earlier 2015, rather than later,&#8221; said
Beinner, who also serves as chief investment officer at Goldman
Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Mary Childs" date="Jul 18, 2013  5:02 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-18/liquidity-myth-seen-by-jpmorgan-as-trading-gains-credit-markets.html"><headline>Liquidity Myth Seen by JPMorgan as Trading Gains: Credit Markets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Rising corporate-bond trading 
signals that liquidity is robust even as Wall Street&#8217;s biggest
banks cut their inventories of the securities in response to new
rules and regulations, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average daily trading volumes in U.S. investment-grade
corporate bonds has increased 18 percent since the end of April
from the same period last year, while dealers pared holdings of
the debt by 54 percent in the five weeks ended July 3, data from
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Federal
Reserve show. The so-called bid-ask spread that dealers charge
in bond trades grew 3 basis points in the period, less than half
the increase in 2011 amid Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., credit markets are becoming better oiled to
withstand stress, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a July 12 note. Rather than driving
liquidity by taking big positions, banks are simply acting as
the go-between for buyers and sellers, while the number of
market makers increases and electronic systems emerge to
facilitate trading, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Buffers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only way for the market to work when dealers can&#8217;t
act as a buffer is if you&#8217;re able to match a seller from a
mutual fund with a buyer from an institutional investor, and so
far that has worked,&#8221; Bank of America Corp. credit strategist
Hans Mikkelsen said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Back in the old
days, dealers were able to act as buffers in the market: they
would accumulate bonds on their balance sheets, and that&#8217;s not
happening anymore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds lost 5 percent
in the two months ended June, the biggest declines since the
2008 financial crisis, as concern mounted that the Fed was
preparing to scale back stimulus measures that have bolstered
debt prices, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent volatility episode has not significantly
affected either trading volumes or the bid-ask spreads of the
largest U.S. high-grade corporate bonds,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts
wrote. &#8220;Broker-dealers have become a lot more efficient and can
sustain a high volume of trading with a smaller inventory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors snapping up a record pace of new corporate-bond
sales may have muted trading of existing debt earlier this year,
Alexander Sedgwick, head of research at MarketAxess Holdings
Inc., said in a telephone interview. &#8220;With low volatility,
there hasn&#8217;t been as much of an impetus up until the last couple
weeks to move any money around,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A MarketAxess index that tracks the bid-ask spreads, or the
difference between where bonds are bought and sold, for the
1,000 largest and most actively traded issues widened to 10.5
basis points on July 15 from 7.5 on April 29, according to the
data from the electronic bond-trading platform owner. Over a
five-month period ended Sept. 19, 2011, as markets were being
roiled by concern a Greece default would jeopardize Europe&#8217;s
common currency, the spread widened to 15.6 from 8.5, the data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since the crisis, we&#8217;ve generally run portfolios with
higher levels of liquidity, knowing that the markets were going
to be more volatile and we want to be able to be nimble,&#8221; said
Ashish Shah, the head of global credit at AllianceBernstein
Holding LP, which oversees $257 billion in fixed-income assets.
&#8220;That lesson still holds. You can&#8217;t give up that liquidity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Benchmarks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost to protect against
corporate-bond losses in the U.S. fell to a seven-week low after
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said central bank plans to curtail
stimulus could be delayed if the economy weakens. Honda Motor
Co. sold $1.5 billion of bonds backed by auto loans after
increasing the offering&#8217;s size by $500 million. Harbor Freight
Tools USA Inc. set the rate it will pay on a $1 billion
covenant-light term loan it&#8217;s seeking to refinance debt and
support a dividend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were the most actively
traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers
yesterday, accounting for 4 percent of the volume of dealer
trades of $1 million or more, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets sold $2.5 billion of
2.9 percent, five-year notes on July 16, Bloomberg data show.
The securities rose 0.2 cent from the issue price to 100.1 cents
on the dollar to yield 2.87 percent, according to Trace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt-market stress, increased 0.4 basis point to 17.45 basis
points. The gauge typically widens when investors seek the
perceived safety of government securities and narrows when they
favor assets such as company debentures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, declined 2.1 basis points to a
mid-price of 75.9 basis points, the lowest since May 28,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s $85 billion of monthly asset purchases that have
been bolstering credit markets aren&#8217;t on a &#8220;preset course,&#8221;
Bernanke said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be responding to the data,&#8221; the Fed
chairman said in testimony before the House Financial Services
Committee. &#8220;If the data are stronger than we expect, we&#8217;ll move
more quickly&#8221; to reduce purchases, he said. If data &#8220;don&#8217;t
meet the kinds of expectations we have about where the economy&#8217;s
going, then we would delay that process or potentially increase
purchases for a time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honda Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Europe Index, tied to 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings, dropped 1.1 to 104.2 at 9:59 a.m. in
London. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Markit iTraxx Asia index
of 40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan slid 4 to 133. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-swaps indexes typically fall as investor
confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A top-ranked $458 million portion of Honda&#8217;s offering
maturing in 2.1 years yields 27 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index
rose for an eighth day, climbing 0.07 cent to 98.18 cents on the
dollar. That&#8217;s the longest stretch of increases for the measure,
which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien
leveraged loans, since it rose for 17 days ended May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Harbor Freight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harbor Freight, the tool and equipment retailer, is
proposing to pay interest at 4 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, with a 1 percent minimum on the
lending benchmark, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction who asked not to be identified because terms are
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In emerging markets, relative yields narrowed 6 basis
points to 336 basis points, or 3.36 percentage points, according
to JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI Global index. The gauge has fallen from a
one-year high of 395.3 on June 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary dealers cut their holdings of securities including
corporate bonds, commercial paper, and mortgage-backed debt by
76 percent to $56 billion at the end of March from a peak of
$235 billion in October 2007, New York Fed data show. The banks
pared positions in investment-grade corporate bonds to $6.3
billion as of July 3, from $13.5 billion on May 29, according to
data the Fed started releasing in a reformatted version in
April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paring Positions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks pared the holdings as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in
the U.S. seeks to limit the risks lenders take with their own
money and the 27-country Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
raises minimum capital standards. The Fed figures overstate how
much banks were keeping in inventories to facilitate trading,
according to the JPMorgan analysts, who attributed most of the
decline to proprietary trading desks scaling back or closing to
comply with the new rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broker-dealers are now focused on trading on behalf of
clients, rather than taking positions wagering on the direction
of the market, JPMorgan&#8217;s Panigirtzoglou said. While the total
number of dealers has declined since the crisis, new market
participants from electronic trading platforms to non-bank
trading firms have balanced the pool, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Electronic Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is not only traditional broker-dealers who provide
inventory for market making, but other non-traditional players
are now providing their own inventory,&#8221; Panigirtzoglou said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are turning to electronic platforms to &#8220;access
more fragmented liquidity&#8221; and reach more trading partners,
Richard Prager, BlackRock Inc.&#8217;s head of trading and liquidity
strategies, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest money manager, teamed with
MarketAxess to create a unified bond-trading platform, routing
trades on their Aladdin Trading Network through MarketAxess.
About 12 percent of high-grade corporate bonds tracked by Trace
were traded on MarketAxess in the first quarter, up from less
than 6 percent in the same period of 2009, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An investor&#8217;s expectation of what they can move has
changed,&#8221; Prager said. &#8220;You have to work harder now to get
trades done; and the bigger amounts, you have to be more patient
because the liquidity isn&#8217;t there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Paradigm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market rout last month was fueled largely by sales of
the easiest-to-trade securities as investors hewed to what
Prager calls the &#8220;new liquidity paradigm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You buy something because you think it&#8217;s really very
liquid, and you actually end up suffering in a selloff because
investors end up selling what they can,&#8221; said Bank of America&#8217;s
Mikkelsen. &#8220;If interest rates rise too rapidly again, you don&#8217;t
want to hold the most liquid stuff because that&#8217;s what gets
liquidated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank bonds, the most liquid corporate debt, were sold first
by investors, exacerbating losses in that corner of the market,
Mikkelsen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold bank bonds
rather than similar-maturity government securities widened as
much as 48 basis points to 187 basis points on June 24 from a
more than five-year low on May 22, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Banking Corporate index. That compares with
a 31 basis-point increase to as high as 172 for the average
high-grade corporate bond, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
U.S. Corporate Index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was reassuring to see the amount of liquidity that was
actually available,&#8221; largely offered by institutional money
managers, said AllianceBernstein&#8217;s Shah. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting paid
to provide liquidity as an investor in the same way that dealers
used to be paid to provide liquidity, just to put up their own
capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co., the largest
U.S. bank, said Ellen V. Futter and David M. Cote, two of the
firm&#8217;s four risk-committee members, left the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural
History, is leaving after 16 years with the bank, while
Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Chief Executive Officer Cote, 62,
is retiring after more than five, the New York-based firm said
yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote and Futter were among three risk committee members who
narrowly won re-election to the board in May, overcoming
opposition from some shareholders after a London unit&#8217;s loss of
more than $6 billion exposed risk-management failures. None of
the three had worked at a bank or as financial risk managers,
Bloomberg News reported in May 2012. A fourth was added to the
committee after the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am proud to have served as a member of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s
board during such a historic time,&#8221; Futter, 63, said in the
statement. She was the only director who didn&#8217;t attend the
annual shareholder meeting in May. She was re-elected with 53
percent of the vote, the smallest margin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think she just got tired of the criticism,&#8221; John H. Biggs, who served as a JPMorgan director with Futter until 2007,
said in an interview. &#8220;She was long on judgment but short on
technical knowledge, and that&#8217;s OK by me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, giving the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index a fourth straight week of gains, as better-than-forecast results from General Electric Co. (GE) offset disappointing earnings from Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GE surged 4.6 percent to the highest in almost five years, pacing gains among industrial shares. Pfizer Inc. advanced 2.1 percent to boost health-care stocks. Technology shares sank 2 percent. Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, plunged 11 percent and Google, owner of the most popular Internet search engine, lost 1.6 percent. Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

About 5.9 billion shares traded hands on U.S. exchanges today, or 7.3 percent below the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings have held up reasonably well,&#8221; said Henk Potts, who helps oversee $282 billion as an equity strategist at Barclays Plc&#8217;s wealth unit in London. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen some winners and some losers coming through. There has been disappointment around technology, but we don&#8217;t necessarily think that is going to be a long-term trend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Eike Batista&#8217;s loss of
control of MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) to Germany&#8217;s EON SE is making the
Brazilian power producer a buy to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which had not rated Rio de Janeiro-based MPX&#8217;s
shares since March, set its price target for the utility at 10
reais. The stock rose 1.2 percent to 6.99 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo. The shares have fallen 31 percent in the
past year, the least among the six publicly traded companies
founded by Batista, which have declined as much as 91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batista, who rode a surge in Brazilian stocks to become the
world&#8217;s eighth-richest person in March 2012, quit as MPX&#8217;s
chairman earlier this month after EON increased its stake to 36
percent. A selloff of shares in Batista&#8217;s energy, commodities
and cargo companies erased more than $30 billion of his fortune
after they failed to meet output targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect a gradual de-risking of MPX shares,&#8221; Bruno Pascon, the Goldman Sachs analyst who took over primary coverage
from Felipe Mattar, wrote in a research note dated yesterday.
&#8220;EON&#8217;s controlling stake and MPX&#8217;s contracted revenues should
meaningfully reduce any overhang related to concerns over the
EBX Group.&#8221; EBX is Batista&#8217;s holding company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Not Compatible&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credibility crisis that started with his flagship oil
producer OGX Petroleo  Gas Participacoes SA is obscuring the
achievements of companies like MPX, Batista wrote in an opinion
piece published in the newspaper Valor Economico today. MPX&#8217;s
current market value &#8220;is not compatible&#8221; with what the company
has to offer, he said. MPX&#8217;s market value is $2.2 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MPX has the biggest portfolio of licensed projects in the
country,&#8221; he wrote. The company &#8220;has become a model&#8221; for
thermal power producers along the coast, and generates enough
electricity to power the city of Rio de Janeiro, according to
Batista. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Pascon said MPX has a &#8220;solid&#8221; balance sheet and
will have &#8220;above average&#8221; free cash flow starting in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPX has five buy recommendations from analysts, four holds
and one sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman had rated MPX a buy from May 2012 through March,
when it changed the stock&#8217;s designation to &#8220;not rated.&#8221; The
New York-based investment bank includes stocks on that list when
it&#8217;s &#8220;acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic
transaction involving this company and in certain other
circumstances,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s yuan may fall versus the
dollar on slowing economic growth and a current-account
financing shortfall may spark further rupee weakness, while
South Korea&#8217;s currency has &#8220;supportive buffers,&#8221; according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product in China may expand about 7.4
percent this year and 7.2 percent in 2014, compared with a
previous forecast of 7.6 percent and 7.7 percent, JPMorgan said
today in a report. The world&#8217;s second-biggest-economy&#8217;s currency
may &#8220;end mostly flat if not even slightly weaker than current
levels,&#8221; on export weakness and slowing growth, the New York-based firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yuan rose 0.04 percent to 6.1385 per dollar today in
Shanghai, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show. That
is up from 6.2306 at the end of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s $25 billion current-account-deficit &#8220;has emerged
because of a likely permanent worsening of the emerging-market
funding landscape,&#8221; JPMorgan said. The gap developed as the
U.S. Federal Reserve has debated winding down its asset purchase
program that has driven down interest rates and pushed investors
into higher yield assets, including those of emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While policy makers in India have sought to stem currency
depreciation through intervention and regulatory changes,
&#8220;policy options are largely limited to helping manage a more
orderly depreciation trend of the rupee rather than being able
to stop or reverse the trend,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Materially Stronger&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee rose 0.6 percent to 59.35 per dollar after
touching a record low of 61.2125 on July 8. The currency
rebounded as the Reserve Bank of India announced measures to
curb speculation and boost returns on local-currency assets. The
currency may weaken to 62 by the end of the year, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of outflows from South Korea&#8217;s won &#8220;is
considerably lower compared to other Asian peers,&#8221; according to
the JPMorgan report. The nation&#8217;s 12-month, rolling current-account surplus doubled, reaching its highest since 1999, the
bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won, which trades at about 20 percent below the average
of its Asian peers, will end the year &#8220;materially stronger&#8221;
versus the dollar and yen, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency rose 0.4 percent to 1,121.75 per dollar in
Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led at least $30 billion of corporate bond
sales in the U.S. this week, the busiest period in almost two
months, as relative yields narrowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, sold $2
billion of 10-year securities and New York-based Goldman Sachs
issued $2.5 billion at its lowest relative yield for five-year
debt since the financial crisis, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offerings increased from $24.6 billion last week and
were the most since $36.8 billion in the five days ended May 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own company bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 219 basis points
yesterday from 227 basis points on July 12, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch US Corporate  High Yield index.
Yields decreased to 3.99 percent from 4.13 percent, and compare
with a record low 3.35 percent on May 2, index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America sold $2 billion of 4.1 percent debt due
July 2023 at a relative yield of 157 basis points, Bloomberg
data show. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender will use
proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction, who
asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly. The debt is rated A- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds Gain &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds rose 0.9 cent today from the issue price to 100.8
cents on the dollar to yield 4 percent, or a spread of 148.9
basis points, at 9:09 a.m. New York time, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold 2.9 percent debentures due July 2018 at
a relative yield of 155 basis points, its lowest spread on five-year securities since it sold $2 billion of 5.45 percent notes
at a 110 basis-point spread in October 2007, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities climbed 0.9 cent since the July 16 sale to
100.8 cents on the dollar to yield 2.72 percent, or a 139.9
basis-point spread at 9:18 a.m. in New York, Trace data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures rose to at least $25
billion from $23.1 billion last week and above a 2013 weekly
average of $21.9 billion, the data show. Offerings of
speculative-grade bonds reached at least $5.3 billion, compared
with $1.5 billion last week and a 2013 weekly average of $7.3
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuers planning sales include tobacco processor Alliance
One International Inc. with a $790 million sale of eight-year
notes, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibovespa futures dropped, a sign the
stock gauge may pare its biggest weekly gain in 10 months, as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. reaffirmed its sell recommendation on
Brazilian equities, citing &#8220;disappointing&#8221; growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPX Energia SA (MPXE3), the energy company controlled by
billionaire Eike Batista, may be active after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. recommended buying the stock. Homebuilder Helbor
Empreendimentos SA (HBOR3) may move after saying booked sales dropped 20
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August fell 0.4
percent to 47,330 at 9:21 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The gauge is up 4.7
percent this week, the most since the week ending on Sept. 14.
The real climbed 0.2 percent to 2.2233 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disappointment remains the norm&#8221; when it comes to
Brazil&#8217;s growth outlook, JPMorgan strategist Emy Shayo wrote in
a note to clients today. &#8220;We don&#8217;t expect much improvement
going forward as neither the global scenario nor the local
economic policy guidance is likely to change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts covering Brazil have reduced their 2013 growth
forecast for nine straight weeks, most recently cutting it to
2.31 percent in a bank survey of about 100 economists released
earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ibovespa has slumped 22 percent this year through
yesterday, wiping out $230 billion from the value of Brazilian
equities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil&#8217;s main
equity gauge trades at 11.9 times analysts&#8217; earnings estimates
for the next four quarters, compared with 10.3 for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations&#8217; equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 5.91 billion
reais yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.78
billion reais this year through July 17, according to data
compiled by the exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
whose senior advisers include former Prime Minister Tony Blair,
as it accelerates efforts to reduce its stakes in Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan Cazenove will provide ad hoc input which will
complement UKFI&#8217;s expertise in devising strategies for realizing
value for the government&#8217;s shareholdings in the banks,&#8221; U.K.
Financial Investments Ltd., the body that oversees the
government&#8217;s stakes in the lenders, said in a statement today.
&#8220;This appointment does not involve any commitment in relation
to other roles at any other time and UKFI intends to review this
appointment on a periodic basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UKFI also named a panel of 11 banks including Barclays Plc (BARC)
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. eligible to be selected as
bookrunners in future stock offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said last month
the U.K. government is &#8220;actively considering&#8221; selling shares
in Lloyds. RBS&#8217;s return to private ownership is still some way
off because it&#8217;s weighed down by too many poor assets, he told
financiers in his Mansion House speech in London on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds shares exceed the level at which the government says
it will break even on its 39 percent holding after providing a
20 billion-pound ($30 billion) rescue almost five years ago. The
stock was down 1 percent at 69.34 pence by 11:26 a.m. in London,
surpassing the 61 pence break-even price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osborne said last month the first block of government
shares in Lloyds will probably be sold to institutional
investors as &#8220;the most effective way of managing risk and
getting value.&#8221; The government will consider an offering to
individual investors at a later stage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS is trading at 336.8 pence, below the 407 pence the
Treasury says it will break even on its 45.5 billion-pound
investment in the 81 percent government-owned lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry Ltd. (BB), the Canadian maker
of wireless communication devices, didn&#8217;t infringe patents
belonging to a Michigan company, a federal appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants Inc. sued
BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd., in
federal court in Delaware in June 2008, alleging that four
patents related to digital cameras in mobile telephones were
infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court entered a judgment against St. Clair in September
2012. St. Clair appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed
the trial court&#8217;s ruling in a judgment delivered without
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellate case is St. Clair Intellectual Property v.
Matsushita Electrical Industries, 12-1652, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit. The lower court case is St. Clair
Intellectual Property v. Research In Motion Ltd.,08-cv-00371S,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney&#8217;s Marvel Off the Hook for Spiderman Toy Patent Royalties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Marvel Enterprises unit didn&#8217;t have to
continue pay royalties to an Arizona inventor after his patent
expired, a federal appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Kimble, whose patent 5,072,856 covers a toy web-shooting glove, sued Marvel for patent infringement in 1997,
claiming that the Spiderman Web Blaster infringed his patent. In
2001, the parties settled that dispute, granting Kimble an
initial cash payment and a percentage on future sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Marvel entered into an agreement with toymaker
Hasbro Inc. to produce the toy. Kimble and Marvel then disputed
the issue of further payment, and he filed another suit. The
court found that under his royalty agreement with Marvel, the
payments would stop when the patent expired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimble appealed that ruling, claiming the agreement covered
both patent and non-patent rights and that his compensation
should continue. The appeals court in a July 16 ruling said that
a license that covers both patent and non-patent rights is
unenforceable after the patent expires unless the agreement
provided for a discount for the non-patent rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a discount, the court said the post-expiration royalty payments were &#8220;an improper extension of the
patent monopoly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kimble v. Marvel Enterprises Inc., 11-15605,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark Case Against VF&#8217;s Vans Can Go Ahead, Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VF Corp. (VFC)&#8217;s Vans unit failed to persuade a U.S. court to
dismiss a trademark lawsuit brought by Airwair International
Ltd., a U.K.-based shoe manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airwair sued in federal court in San Jose, California, in
September claiming that Van&#8217;s Gibson line of shoes infringed
trademarks and trade dress related to shoe design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vans asked the court to dismiss the case in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 17 order, U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila
said that Airwair&#8217;s complaint satisfied the requirements for the
case to go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Airwair International Ltd. v. Vans Inc., 12-cv-05060, U.D. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diller&#8217;s Vimeo Seeks to End Vivendi Music Copyright Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vimeo, the video-sharing website owned by Barry Diller&#8217;s
IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI), said federal law protects it against a
Vivendi SA (VIV) copyright lawsuit over music that includes recordings
by the Beatles and the Beach Boys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams heard arguments yesterday
on Vimeo&#8217;s motion to throw out the case. She said at the end of
the three-hour hearing in Manhattan that she would rule later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi labels including Capitol Records sued Vimeo in 2009
claiming that the website &#8220;induces and encourages its users to
upload&#8221; copyrighted videos and songs it wasn&#8217;t authorized to
display. The songs include the Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Let It Be,&#8221; the Beach
Boys&#8217; &#8220;Surfin&#8217; USA&#8221; and Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;High and Dry.&#8221; Users
post homemade videos in which they lip-synch to the infringed
songs, the labels said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vimeo, based in New York, denied infringing copyrights and
said that it&#8217;s protected by the safe-harbor provision of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. The safe-harbor rule
applies if a site removes infringing material when informed
about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has more than 14 million registered
users, gets its revenue from subscription fees and advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels said that Vimeo can&#8217;t be protected by law
because it knew that the uploaded videos contained unlicensed
copyrighted material and that it benefited financially from
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels asked the judge to deny Vimeo&#8217;s motion and grant
them partial summary judgment. If Abrams rejects the motions,
the case may go to trial by jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation had been on hold pending a ruling in a
similar case, in which Viacom Inc. (VIAB) sued Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube
for displaying Viacom&#8217;s copyrighted television and movie content
on the web without authorization. The Second Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed a lower-court ruling in favor of YouTube and
sent the case back to district court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton then dismissed Viacom&#8217;s
suit in April, saying YouTube was protected from liability by
the Copyright Act&#8217;s safe-harbor provision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Capitol Records LLC v. Vimeo LLC, 1:09-cv-10101, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outdated Mail Rule Helps Pangang, Kolon Elude U.S. Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Pangang Group Co. and Korea&#8217;s Kolon Industries Inc. (120110)
have eluded U.S. criminal charges of trade-secret theft for
months. Unlike fugitive security contractor Edward Snowden, they
aren&#8217;t hiding from authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pangang and Kolon can&#8217;t be forced yet to face the
accusations in court because federal rules dating to the 1940s
require prosecutors to issue a summons the old-fashioned way --
by mailing it to a U.S. address. The companies said they don&#8217;t
have offices, employees or agents in the U.S. and can&#8217;t be
served. Federal judges in California and Virginia have mostly
agreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors must file papers this week telling a judge in
San Francisco how they will proceed with Pangang while a judge
in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled to hear arguments in Kolon&#8217;s
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue threatens to derail the case against Pangang. The
company was charged in San Francisco last year with conspiring
to steal secrets from DuPont Co. (DD) about titanium dioxide, a white
pigment used in paint, plastics and paper. Kolon and five of its
executives were charged in October with stealing trade secrets
from DuPont related to the manufacture of Kevlar, the anti-ballistic fiber used in police and military gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are required to serve summonses on defendants
by delivering copies to officers or legal representatives and
mailing copies to the defendants&#8217; last known U.S. address,
according to federal rules of criminal procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department, saying the procedures have fallen
behind the &#8220;new reality&#8221; of a global economy and electronic
communications, recommended the committee allow the serving of
summonses outside the U.S. by agreed-upon delivery methods with
foreign jurisdictions, according to an October letter from then-Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer to the committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Kolon Industries, 12-cr-00137, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond). The
Pangang case is U.S. v. Liew, 11-cr-00573, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers at a Brampton, Ontario-based
bottling plant operated by Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soda maker, ended a three-week strike after approving a three-year contract, the Canadian Auto Workers Union said in a
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production at the plant will resume tomorrow after the deal
was approved by 83 percent of workers, according to the
statement. Workers will receive pay increases in the second and
third years of the contract and won an agreement &#8220;that would
end demands to outsource existing work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real fight here was over the defined benefit pension
plan, with Coca-Cola pushing us to move to a defined
contribution plan,&#8221; Jerry Dias, assistant to the CAW National
President, said in the statement. &#8220;We were ultimately
successful in keeping the defined benefit pension plan and
improving upon it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union also negotiated a weekend-worker program that
includes two 12-hour premium shifts to allow for 24-hour, seven
day-a-week production, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Kent Landers, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Auto Workers Union represents about 700
employees at the bottling plant, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), Pfizer Inc. and
Novartis AG (NOVN) are among the suitors preparing bids for Onyx
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX), the drugmaker that snubbed an unsolicited
offer from Amgen (AMGN) Inc., said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies, which signed confidentiality agreements and
hired advisers, may make first-round bids this week, according
to the people, who asked not to be named because the process is
private. Onyx disclosed last month that it&#8217;s working with
advisers on finding bidders following its rejection of Amgen&#8217;s
bid of $120 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amgen is still interested and is doing due diligence, said
three people with knowledge of the process. Shares of South San
Francisco, California-based Onyx have consistently traded at
more than that price since the proposal from Thousand Oaks,
California-based Amgen surfaced in June, indicating the
successful suitor may have to beat that offer by a wide margin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx rose 2.3 percent to $129.25 at the close in New York,
giving the company a market value of about $9.4 billion.
Representatives for London-based AstraZeneca, Amgen, New York-based Pfizer, Novartis and Onyx declined to comment. There&#8217;s no
guarantee any of the companies will bid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franz Haniel  Cie GmbH, a family-owned holding company in Germany, is exploring options including
a sale of its entire stake in German pharmaceutical retailer
Celesio AG (CLS1), according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haniel has hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to advise on the sale
of a full or partial stake or a partnership with another
company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
talks are private. The process remains at an early stage and
Haniel could decide against a sale of its 50 percent stake in
the Stuttgart-based company, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celesio shares surged 9.3 percent to 17.70 euros at the
close in Frankfurt, the biggest gain in a month. The stock has
climbed 36 percent so far this year, giving the company a market
value of 3 billion euros ($4 billion), amid speculation the
company could be sold. Celesio Chief Executive Officer Markus Pinger was fired this month after he hired Citigroup Inc. to
advise on a potential deal, people familiar with the situation
said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Walgreen Co. (WAG), the largest U.S. drugstore chain,
agreed in 2012 to buy a 45 percent stake of U.K. pharmacy owner
Alliance Boots, drug wholesalers have been examining their
positions in Europe and ways to reduce costs. A possible Celesio
sale comes as medical expenses rise and governments cut spending
in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Suitors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celesio has attracted interest from at least three
companies, one of the people said. McKesson Corp. (MCK), the largest
U.S. drug distributor, and U.S. competitor Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH)
are among potential buyers, one of the people said. Celesio and
CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) have held talks on a possible collaboration,
including purchasing pacts, rather than an acquisition, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Haniel spokesman in Duisburg, Germany, said it&#8217;s company
policy not to comment on market speculation. Representatives of
Celesio, JPMorgan and CVS Caremark declined to comment. McKesson
and Cardinal Health couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks around the world are stepping
up bond sales, with lenders from Bank of America Corp. to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accounting for the biggest share of
dollar-denominated investment-grade deals in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offerings by lenders from the U.S. to Europe and Asia rose
62 percent to $26.4 billion last week from $16.3 billion in the
period ended July 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Almost 60 percent of high-grade sales in the U.S. this month are
from banks, the biggest proportion in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in the U.S. are attracting bond buyers with second-quarter earnings beating analyst estimates by 8.7 percent, the
widest margin of any industry. The yield on the Bloomberg U.S.
Corporate Bond Index Financials has declined to 2.84 percent
from an 11-month high of 3.18 percent reached June 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reporting season is done and dusted and interest-rate
volatility has stabilized,&#8221; said Norval Loftus, chief
investment officer at Allegra Investment Management (U.K.) Ltd.
in London, an asset manager specializing in bond investments for
large family offices. &#8220;So it&#8217;s a good two-part combination for
an issuance window and for banks to increase their issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg financial index has gained 1.3 percent this
month versus a 1.15 percent return for industrial borrowers.
That&#8217;s pared this year&#8217;s loss for bonds of borrowers from
Citigroup Inc. to JPMorgan Chase  Co. to 0.47 percent,
following a 4 percent loss in May and June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviation luggage-handling service
company Swissport International Ltd. is in exclusive talks to
buy baggage-handler Servisair for an undisclosed sum, the
companies said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of Servisair, owned by Paris-based maintenance
and recycling group Derichebourg SA (DBG), would be the latest
transaction by Swissport since it was purchased by private-equity firm PAI Partners SAS in November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swissport, which is based in Glattbrugg, Switzerland,
announced in March it would buy the majority of the ground-handling operations from Nordic airline SAS Group AB. In
September 2012, it purchased Flightcare Spain and Flightcare
Belgium from Madrid-based FCC Versia SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of Servisair would add about 15,000 people
to the company&#8217;s 40,000 employees, Swissport said in the
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas SA (BNP) and Sycomore Corporate Finance SAS acted as

&lt;p&gt;London financiers will swap suits for Lycra today as two teams race rowing boats from Barcelona to Ibiza in a campaign to include boys in vaccinations for a cancer-causing virus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bankers, commodities traders and one Olympic rower will brave searing heat and shipping lanes for three days in an effort to raise money and change public health policy on human papillomavirus. One aim of the 10-strong group is to lobby to change the U.K. vaccination program, which only treats girls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Men in 10 years&#8217; time are more likely to have HPV-related cancer than women,&#8221; said Tristan Almada, a hedge fund executive who founded the campaign and is president of the HPV and Anal Cancer Foundation. &#8220;This is a gender-neutral virus that requires a gender-neutral vaccine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For two of the men, HPV is personal. Almada&#8217;s mother died of the virus-related anal cancer in 2010, and fellow rower Pierre Andurand&#8217;s mother is undergoing treatment. Their mothers&#8217; names, Isabel and Danielle, have been given to the boats. HPV also causes cervical and penile cancer and may trigger 5 percent of all cancers, according to the NoMan is an Island campaign. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cause is attracting senior figures from the finance world. Andurand founded hedge fund Andurand Capital Management LLP. Other rowers include Pierre Lacaze, chief executive officer of LCM Commodities, and executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Urgent Issue &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;HPV-related cancer can be prevented through vaccination. Yet stigma surrounding sexually-transmitted disease and HPV&#8217;s characterization as a woman&#8217;s issue, because of its links to cervical cancer, have prevented universal inoculation, Almada said. He has petitioned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. since 2010 and has reported to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, a body of the U.K. department of health, though policy remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 200-mile Row to End HPV is designed to get people engaged with the issue, and &#8220;convey the urgency that got the world behind polio and smallpox,&#8221; said Almada, whose day job is at derivatives hedge fund Taurosso Capital, which he co-founded. The event will also raise money for grants and to collaborate with the medical profession in research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rowers range in age from 28 to 41, and while they include veterans of Ironman competitions and mountain climbing, all but two are novices on water. Even Mark Hunter, who won a gold medal for the U.K. in Beijing, confesses to having little experience of rowing at sea. Teams of two will row in two-hour shifts and navigate themselves. A support boat will be on standby. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The teams had raised about $700,000 toward their $1 million target on Friday. The race will be an annual event, Almada said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Richter and Agnieszka Troszkiewicz" date="Jul 23, 2013  7:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-23/goldman-sachs-lme-dispute-beer-maker-on-aluminum-price.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs, LME Dispute Beer Maker on Aluminum Price</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS) Sachs Group Inc., the owner
of the one of the biggest U.S. aluminum-warehouse networks, and
the London Metal Exchange say commodity prices fell in recent
years, countering claims of rising costs by beverage companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Delivered aluminum prices are nearly 40 percent lower
than they were in 2006,&#8221; Goldman said yesterday in a statement,
and the LME said there is no &#8220;reported shortage&#8221; of the metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MillerCoors LLC, a SABMiller Plc (SAB) and Molson Coors Brewing
Co. venture, said at a Senate subcommittee hearing yesterday
that unfair LME rules used by Goldman, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
other warehouse owners boost costs and delay shipments. Senator
Sherrod Brown, the committee chairman, plans to ask the Federal
Reserve to explain why it allows banks to control raw-material
supplies while trading in commodity markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real question isn&#8217;t whether prices have fallen the
past few years, but whether prices are a true reflection of
supply-and-demand conditions,&#8221; Jorge Vazquez, a managing
director at Harbor Intelligence, an Austin, Texas-based research
company, said in a telephone interview after the hearing.
&#8220;Looking at the warehouse-business model is relevant.
Significant changes in the system could improve fairness and
efficiency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a metallurgical-coal producer, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent from 12.5
cents as a condition for amending a $2.73 billion credit pact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move was among changes to covenants agreed with
lenders, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said today in a

&lt;p&gt;Walter&#8217;s net senior secured leverage will rise to more than
5.5 times this quarter, the level needed to remain in compliance
with the debt agreement, Benjamin Nelson, a New York-based
analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, said in a June 19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter metallurgical coal output was about 2.9
million metric tons, about 7 percent more than in the preceding

costs fell more than 10 percent in the same comparison, it said.
The company didn&#8217;t provide year-earlier numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pared its
12-month commodity return forecast to almost flat after oil
rallied, keeping a neutral recommendation on raw materials while
predicting losses for gold and gains for base metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will
return 0.1 percent over the period, the New York-based bank said
in a report dated yesterday. That compares with a forecast gain
of 2.3 percent over 12 months in a report on June 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called strategic case for holding commodities
remains strong, partly because raw materials are a hedge against
geopolitical risks, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in the
report. Commodities as tracked by the enhanced index advanced to
the highest level since February last week as West Texas
Intermediate crude oil traded at the highest price in 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our current outlook is extremely benign with returns
expected to be mostly flat over the next 12 months,&#8221; the
Goldman analysts wrote. Precious metals and agricultural
commodities may drop 8 percent over the period, while base
metals advance 6 percent, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude in New York rallied 11 percent this month through
yesterday, and settled at $108.05 a barrel July 19, the highest
since March 2012. Political upheaval in Egypt spurred concern
that unrest may spread, potentially disrupting shipments from
the Middle East. The U.S., the largest oil consumer, also showed
signs of recovery, helping to boost prices as inventories fell.
WTI traded at $106.89 a barrel today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UBS&#8217;s Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neutral recommendation from Goldman contrasts with the
position from UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank, which rated
commodities as underweight, according to a report on July 2.
Slow economic growth in the U.S. will boost equities more than
raw materials, according to UBS, which is bearish on gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion is heading for the first annual drop in 13 years
amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will rein in stimulus
as the largest economy improves. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will
trim monthly bond buying to $65 billion in September from $85
billion, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold in New York may decline to $1,050 an ounce at the end
of 2014, Goldman said, restating a forecast from June 24. Gold
for December delivery traded at $1,335.60 an ounce today. Most-active prices have declined 2 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn will decline this half as increased U.S. acreage
boosts output, bolstering reserves, said Goldman. The 12-month
estimate is $4.75 a bushel, 1.6 percent lower than today. Prices
have retreated 31 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) won a
U.S. appeals court ruling in a case of a former university
researcher who claimed his patents covered some of the
Internet&#8217;s most basic interactive functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two patents owned by Eolas Technologies Inc. of Tyler,
Texas, and the University of California are invalid, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington ruled
yesterday. The decision, issued without a formal opinion,
upholds a jury verdict won by Google, Amazon.com, JC Penney Co.
and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year in Tyler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eolas founder Michael Doyle claimed functions including
music clips, search features, maps and embedded applications
used his inventions. Tim Berners-Lee, the British computer
scientist credited with inventing the World Wide Web, was among
those testifying against him in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eolas, in court papers, claimed the patents covered
inventions that &#8220;took the Web from a primitive and static world
to today&#8217;s seamlessly interactive environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its own filing with the court, Mountain View,
California-based Google and Plano, Texas-based JC Penney said
Eolas&#8217;s claim was a &#8220;fantastic assertion&#8221; rejected by the jury
&#8220;after hearing from the scientists who are actually responsible
for that achievement, including the father of the World Wide
Web.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen companies had been named in the original
complaint, including Apple Inc., EBay Inc. (EBAY) and Citigroup Inc.
Most settled before the trial. Cases against Facebook Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Walt Disney Co. (DIS) were stayed pending appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Eolas won a $521 million verdict against Microsoft
Corp. that was thrown out on appeal for a retrial on the
validity of the patents. The two companies settled before a new
trial could be held. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Eolas Technologies v. Amazon.com Inc., 12-1632,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower court case is Eolas Technologies Inc. v. Adobe Systems
Inc. (ADBE), 09-cv-00446, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Novozymes Loses Appeals Court Bid to Revive Danisco Verdict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novozymes A/S (NZYMB) lost its appeals court bid to revive an $18
million patent-infringement verdict against DuPont Co.&#8217;s Danisco
unit over an enzyme used in biofuel production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Novozymes patent for an enzyme that remains active in
high temperatures is invalid because it doesn&#8217;t describe what
the company claims to have invented, the Washington-based U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in an opinion
posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute was patent 7,713,723, which was issued in May
2010, the same month in which Novozymes filed the infringement
suit in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court affirmed a trial judge&#8217;s decision to
throw out the jury verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Novozymes A/S v. Danisco A/S, 3:10-cv-00251-BBC, U.S. District Court, Western District of Wisconsin
(Madison). The appeal is Novozymes A/S v. DuPont Nutrition
Biosciences, 12-01433, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Castel Group Loses Chinese Trademark Fight Over &#8216;Kasite&#8217; Mark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castel Group, the French beverage maker, registered a new
Chinese trademark after losing a trademark dispute with a
Chinese wine distributor, Decanter reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French company had used &#8220;Kasite&#8221; as a Chinese
translation of its name on labels for wine it began bottling in
China in 1999, according to Decanter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998 Panati Wine, the company owned by Chinese
entrepreneur Li Daozhi, registered &#8220;Kasite&#8221; as a Chinese
trademark and sued Castel for trademark infringement in 2009,
according to Decanter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zhejiang Provincial Higher people&#8217;s Court barred
Castel&#8217;s use of &#8220;Kasite,&#8221; levied a fine of 33.73 million
Chinese renminbi ($5.5 million), and ordered the company to
issue a public policy through a Chinese business publication,
Decanter reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taiwan District Will Use Folk Icon to Promote Regional Identity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A district in Taiwan&#8217;s Kaohsiung region has registered the
name of a Taoist folk icon as a trademark as a way to promote
the area, which lacks the kind of specialty agricultural
products often identified with a region, the Taipei Times
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saimin District registered &#8220;Third Happy Prince&#8221; as a
trademark and then sponsored a public competition for the
creation of a modern image of the character, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cartoon figure was selected and his image includes the
district&#8217;s landscape as a background, the Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s Ministry of Economic Affairs Intellectual Property
Office approved the mark July 19, and the image will be used for
school bags, clothing and related items, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russian Patent Office Says Nyet to Boozy Trademark for Vodka &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian officials rejected a trademark application for a
new brand of vodka because it alludes to heavy drinking, the
Moscow Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Vyp/Buhalo&#8221; mark sought by Rusinvest &#8220;contravenes
public interest and moral principles,&#8221; the Russian Patent
Agency said in its rejection notice, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8216;Vyp&#8221; sounds like a colloquial Russian expression
meaning &#8220;bottoms up,&#8221; and &#8220;Buhalo&#8221; resembles a Russian word
for &#8220;booze,&#8221; according to the Moscow Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent agency previously refused to register a phrase
that colloquially means &#8220;delirium tremens.&#8221; That brand --
&#8220;Belochka. Ya prishla&#8221; -- got so much media attention over the
refusal that it was named the brand of the year in May, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Artist Prints 3D Mickey Mouse, Challenges Disney IP Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artist and researcher at the U.K.&#8217;s Goldsmith College is
using 3D scanning and printing to challenge the intellectual
property policies of the Walt Disney Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Plummer-Fernandez &#8220;uses scanning, digital
fabrication and computational approaches to making artifacts,
both physical and digital, that blur the distinction between the
two, referencing the digitization of the everyday,&#8221; according
to the biography posted on his website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has created several small figures of Disney&#8217;s iconic
Mickey Mouse, using a powder composite and tinted binder. The
figures are fabricated by scanning and remixing the data derived
from the scan, according to his artist&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plummer-Fernandez said he deliberately chose Mickey Mouse
as his subject in order to raise &#8220;issues of potential clashes
with big copyright holders that could potentially choose to
lobby for legislation against 3D scanning.&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney was a company of particular interest, he said, for
&#8220;paradoxically pioneering remix culture by creating their own
versions of public domain characters such as Snow White and
Cinderella, and yet the company take a hostile approach against
any attempts to copy their own creations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his figures -- &#8220;sekuMoi Mecy&#8221; -- is a distorted
figure covered in small geometric patterns in red and blue. The
name of his Mickey Mouse pieces comes from a computer-generated
anagram, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other figure is &#8220;sekuMoi Mecy 3; Smooth() Operator,&#8221;
generated using what he called a &#8220;mesh smoothing technique
pushed to the extreme.&#8221; That piece&#8217;s contours are deliberately
much less detailed than the first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Blurring images has become both a widely recognized
cultural aesthetic,&#8221; he said. It is &#8220;also used to obscure the
identity of persons photographed or filmed,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seagate Technology Wins Back $630 Million Trade-Secrets Award &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seagate Technology LLC won reinstatement of a $630.4
million arbitration judgment against Western Digital Corp. (WDC) over
allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arbitrator awarded Dublin-based Seagate $525 million
plus interest in 2011 against Irvine, California-based Western
Digital and a Western employee, Sining Mao, who previously
worked at Seagate. Some of the defendants&#8217; evidence was
fabricated on three trade secrets, the arbitrator found,
entering a judgment against Western and Mao as a sanction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state court judge set aside the award in October, finding
that the arbitrator didn&#8217;t consider any evidence by the
defendants countering the allegations. Minnesota&#8217;s Court of
Appeals reinstated the arbitrator&#8217;s judgment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The district court erred by determining that the
arbitrator did not have authority to impose sanctions,&#8221; the
appellate court said. &#8220;The district court should not have
reviewed the merits of the arbitrator&#8217;s decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellate case is Seagate Technology LLC v. Western
Digital Corp., A12-1944, Minnesota Court of Appeals (St. Paul).
The lower-court case is Seagate Technology LLC v. Western
Digital Corp., 27-cv-06-1900, District Court, Hennepin County,
Minnesota (Minneapolis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
price forecast for arabica coffee futures traded in New York,
citing a surplus that will take stockpiles to a five-year high
at the end of the 2013-14 season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee will be at $1.30 a pound on the ICE Futures
U.S. exchange in three, six and 12 months, the bank said in a
report e-mailed today. That&#8217;s down from a previous forecast of
$1.45 a pound. The beans fell 12 percent this year to $1.263 a
pound by 4:26 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global coffee production will exceed demand by 4.46 million
bags in 2013-14, from a 10 million-bag surplus a year earlier,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Inventories
will reach a five-year high of 30.53 million bags, the USDA
predicts. A bag of coffee weighs 132 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The expected 2013-14 surplus that would bring stocks to
their highest level in five years is leading us to lower once
again our three- to 12-month forecasts,&#8221; Damien Courvalin, an
analyst at the bank, wrote in the report. &#8220;Potential for prices
to rebound from their current levels include weather risks in
Brazil, the potential for further cuts to Central American
production and short covering flows of near-record short net
speculative positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee gained 2.8 percent last week as a forecast
for a cold front that may bring freezing temperatures to some
coffee areas in Brazil, the world&#8217;s top producer, resulted in
speculators closing bets on lower prices. Some coffee growing
areas may get freezing temperatures today and tomorrow,
forecaster Somar Meteorologia said on July 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Net-Short Positions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large and small speculators excluding index funds reduced
their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, on arabica
coffee to 28,452 contracts in the week ended July 16, data from
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission compiled by
Bloomberg showed. That&#8217;s down from a net-short position of
32,941 lots a week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of raw sugar traded in New York will also be lower
than previously forecast, the bank said, citing a record crop in
Brazil&#8217;s center south, the main growing region of the world&#8217;s
leading producer, and a &#8220;promising start&#8221; to the monsoon in
second-ranking India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar will be at 16.50 cents a pound on ICE in three
months, down from a previous forecast of 17.50 cents a pounds.
Prices will gain to 17.50 cents a pound in six months and to 19
cents a pound in 12 months, the bank said, adding that it sees
&#8220;downside&#8221; to its medium-term forecast. Raw sugar was down 16
percent this year to 16.39 cents a pound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential support to prices could come either from rain in
Brazil or weather and, or production disappointments in India
later this year, according to the Goldman Sachs report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazard Ltd. (LAZ), the largest independent
merger-advisory firm, hired Lachlan Edwards from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to head its Australian capital structure advisory
business, said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards, who was Goldman&#8217;s head of Asia-Pacific
restructuring, will start with Lazard in Sydney on Oct. 1, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private. He will report to John Wylie, managing director  head
of corporate advisory for Australia, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazard bought Sydney-based independent advisory firm
O&#8217;Sullivan Partners in September as it seeks to expand its
business in the South Pacific nation. Former Prime Minister Paul
Keating is the firm&#8217;s chairman of  corporate advisory, according
to Lazard&#8217;s Australian website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Hayley Morris declined to comment
on Edwards&#8217;s departure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geodynamics Ltd. (GDY), an explorer
seeking to produce power from hot underground rocks, said Santos
Ltd. (STO) and Chevron Corp. (CVX), developers of shale gas projects in
central Australia, are interested in becoming customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those discussions have commenced,&#8221; Geoff Ward, chief
executive officer of Brisbane-based Geodynamics, said today in a
phone interview. &#8220;I&#8217;ve spoken to those operators, and they are
very positive about acting as initial customers for us. They see
the interest in this as a long-term supply resource.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geodynamics expects to sign a customer in six months to 12
months, Ward said. The company is also planning to apply for
funding from Australia&#8217;s A$10 billion ($9.3 billion) Clean
Energy Finance Corp. and looking for a new partner after Origin
Energy Ltd. (ORG) withdrew from a joint venture this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geodynamics, trying to become the first company in
Australia to operate a commercial geothermal plant, expects to
start with a 5-megawatt to 10-megawatt project in central
Australia&#8217;s Cooper Basin. The company plans to use data from a
1-megawatt pilot plant, which started producing power earlier
this year, to form a development proposal for the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company, entered
the Australian shale industry in February with an agreement to
pay as much as $349 million to join Adelaide-based Beach Energy
Ltd. (BPT) in a project in the Cooper Basin. Adelaide-based Santos is
also among shale gas explorers in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical Setbacks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santos and Chevron-Beach ventures are the &#8220;key
targets&#8221; in the search for a customer, Ward said. &#8220;If we can
continue to develop it into a material asset play, then it would
be a natural fit with their operations in the Cooper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geodynamics shares are down 86 percent in the past four
years in Sydney trading, even with an 18 percent increase in
2013. Geodynamics closed unchanged today at 13 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry has struggled to overcome technical setbacks
and delays, with geothermal power unlikely to deliver much more
than a &#8220;handful&#8221; of pilot projects and possibly some plants
with a capacity of as much as 10 megawatts before 2020,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a June 28 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geothermal developers in Australia are using technology
that circulates water through cracks as deep as 5 kilometers
(3.1 miles) underground, turning it to steam to run a turbine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice president facing civil fraud claims over a $1 billion mortgage bond debacle, said today that one of his e-mail that&#8217;s part of the government&#8217;s case &#8220;wasn&#8217;t accurate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tourre, now a 34-year-old graduate student, appeared before a jury in Manhattan federal court to speak about his role in structuring and selling a 2007 mortgage-backed investment that lost a group of investors about $1 billion when the mortgage market crashed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The testimony comes near the end of two weeks of evidence against him by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency&#8217;s lawyers will try to show Tourre misled investors about the role of Paulson  Co., the hedge fund run by John Paulson, in helping select the assets behind the investment, which the fund then bet against. He took the stand after Laura Schwartz, a participant in the deal and a key SEC witness against Tourre. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, who headed ACA Management LLC&#8217;s asset management business in early 2007, has testified that Goldman and Paulson led her to believe that the hedge fund wanted to invest, rather than take a short position in the mortgage-backed investment, known as Abacus. Instead, she helped construct an investment vehicle that Paulson made $1 billion betting it would fail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the biggest bank-card
network, reported a fiscal third-quarter profit that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates as worldwide spending on credit and debit
cards climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $1.23
billion, or $1.88 a share, compared with a loss of $1.84
billion, or $2.74, a year earlier that included a litigation
expense, the Foster City, California-based company said today in
a statement. The average estimate of 33 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.80 a share. Profit excluding
special items from the third quarter of 2012 climbed 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf is seeking to
bolster Visa&#8217;s business outside the U.S., where it gets more
than half its revenue, as consumers worldwide continue to
migrate from cash and checks to electronic payments. The company
has returned more than $15 billion to shareholders since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a longer-term perspective, we continue to believe
that Visa is the single best way&#8221; to harness returns amid the
shift away from cash, Greg Smith, an analyst at Sterne Agee 
Leach Inc., wrote in a July 21 report. &#8220;We expect the company
to consistently generate at least mid-teens&#8221; earnings-per-share
growth, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), owner of the world&#8217;s
most popular search engine, introduced a device that sends
YouTube and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) videos from phones, tablets and laptops
to televisions, bolstering competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromecast, a small $35 dongle that plugs into a TV&#8217;s HDMI
input, lets customers watch and control online videos without
their remote control. The gadget, unveiled at an event today in
San Francisco, works with Android devices as well as Apple&#8217;s
iPhone, and enables users to continue using their phone for
other activities while streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course people would want to watch YouTube and Netflix
on the device with the biggest screen, but the user experience
on the TV has been so difficult,&#8221; said Rishi Chandra, a
director of product management at the Mountain View, California-based company, in an interview after the event. &#8220;If you have to
stop using your phone just to watch something on TV, it&#8217;s not a
viable solution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement of Chromecast came after Google introduced
an updated Nexus 7 tablet, which has a sharper screen and is
being made in partnership with Taiwan&#8217;s Asustek Computer Inc. (2357) In
tablets, devices running Android software have been gaining
share versus Apple&#8217;s iPad. The move into televisions follows
previous unsuccessful efforts for Google, including a media-streaming device called Q that never shipped based on poor
initial feedback, and the Google TV set-top box that has lagged
the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai said in an
interview that the company would continue pushing Google TV,
which turns TV into an Android device capable of playing apps
and other content, &#8220;in a big way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content Partners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromecast, which looks like a USB stick, wirelessly syncs
video being watched on a customer&#8217;s mobile devices and TV.
Pichai said the device will also work with Pandora Media Inc. (P)&#8217;s
music-streaming service and other content partners in the
future. It goes on sale today through Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Best Buy
Co.&#8217;s website and the Google Play store. Google said that
through a partnership with Netflix, Chromecast customers will
get three free months of the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple TV in its current iteration is a $99 set-top box,
though Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company is
considering other television products. Apple also has AirPlay,
which lets consumers stream pictures and videos from iPhones and
iPads to Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tablet Shipments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgraded Nexus 7 is Google&#8217;s latest effort to parlay
its success in smartphones to larger devices. Tablet shipments,
benefiting from consumer migration away from personal computers,
are expected to grow 68 percent this year, outpacing a 4.3
percent increase for mobile phones, according to research firm
Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tablets are going to be part of the next era,&#8221; said
Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Gartner. &#8220;It means eyeballs
and it means accounts and it means knowing what the consumers
are doing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google develops the Android operating system and offers it
for free to makers of phones and tablets, as well as using the
software in its own devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nexus 7 ranges in price from $229 for a Wi-Fi version
to $349 for a device with more memory that also works over
cellular networks. The new Nexus 7 is 50 grams lighter than its
predecessor with the same screen size and a high resolution
display, said Hugo Barra, vice president of Android product
management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a much more comfortable grip and fits easily into
your purse or jacket pocket,&#8221; Barra said. For the screen,
&#8220;having a crisp and bright display makes all the difference,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upbeat Reviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nexus, which sports a 7-inch screen, received positive
reviews last year for its sleek design and intuitive software.
The gadget offers the best value among its rivals, CNET said in
a review last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With its excellent design, useful software features, and
low starting price, the Nexus 7 is the cheapest way to
experience the best that the Android&#8221; operating system has to
offer, CNET said. &#8220;The Nexus 7 is still the overall best small
tablet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nexus 7 goes up against Apple&#8217;s iPad Mini, which is 7.9
inches, and Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire, which also has a 7-inch screen
and uses a version of Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google also announced today that it&#8217;s making textbook
purchases and rentals available on the new tablet. Books from
all five major publishers will be in Google&#8217;s store in time for
the coming school year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google fell 0.1 percent to $902.90 at the close in New
York. The stock has gained 28 percent this year, compared with a
17 percent drop in shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) had the biggest
U.S. fixed-income market share as trading clients expand the
number of dealers they do business with, Greenwich Associates
said in an annual survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which held the top spot in a similar survey in
2011 before dropping to third last year, has an 11.4 percent
market share, Greenwich Associates said today, citing a study it
conducted based on interviews with 1,027 active institutional
investors in the U.S. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) dropped to fifth
from second last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy-side clients are spreading their business as Wall
Street banks are scaling back in product areas in which they
aren&#8217;t leaders, Greenwich said. Banks including Morgan Stanley (MS)
and UBS AG (UBSN) are shedding assets in fixed-income trading and
seeking to cut costs amid sluggish revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For many institutional investors, these strategic shifts
have resulted in disruptions in sell-side coverage and a
reduction in market liquidity as dealers pull back capital,
consolidate desks, reduce headcount and replace senior fixed-income professionals with younger, less experienced and cheaper
talent,&#8221; Stamford, Connecticut-based Greenwich said in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
had the three largest market shares behind JPMorgan. Greenwich
said the four firms were in a statistical tie for first. The
study focused on activity with clients, rather than trading
revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Up &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine largest banks generated about $90 billion in
fixed-income trading revenue globally in 2012, excluding some
accounting charges, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That was up 14 percent from 2011, and accounted for more than
half of all revenue from trading and investment banking at the
firms, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, has the largest market
share in trading rate products such as government bonds and
interest-rate derivatives, according to Greenwich. Deutsche
Bank, JPMorgan and Citigroup (C) joined the Swiss bank in a
statistical tie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) had the biggest share in
credit products, such as corporate bonds and leveraged loans.
Barclays Plc (BARC), Credit Suisse and Bank of America had the largest
share in securitized products, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup was the share leader in municipal bonds, with New
York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup leading in emerging-market
trading, Greenwich said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study took place between February and April, Greenwich
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar may fall to
its lowest level in almost three years against its U.S.
counterpart after failing to breach key technical levels of
resistance, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aussie may decline to 87.75 per U.S. dollar, its
weakest level since Aug. 25, 2010, after bouncing off the
resistance zone from 93.05 to 93.45, according to Niall O&#8217;Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan.
Australia&#8217;s legal tender increased to 93.20 today before erasing
its gain. The Aussie has been the worst-performing major
currency over the past three months, decreasing 11 percent
versus the greenback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that we held that area near 93 today highlights
the potential risk of additional weakness,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We could see some downside follow-through. The overall setup is still bearish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s currency depreciated 1.7 percent, the most in a
month, to 91.39 U.S. cents at 1:37 p.m. in New York after
earlier gaining as much as 0.3 percent to 93.20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aussie may appreciate to 94.40, a more than one-month
high, if it breaks through resistance at 93.45, O&#8217;Connor said.
That would be the currency&#8217;s strongest level since June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it happened to rally to about 93.45, that would be a
positive short-term development,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;But it does
look like that&#8217;s unlikely to happen given what we&#8217;ve seen in
recent price action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aussie&#8217;s 8.8 percent decline this year trails just the
yen&#8217;s 11 percent depreciation as the worst performing currency
among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has gained the most with
a 5 percent climb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
may be buy orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Weixin Zha" date="Jul 24, 2013 10:55 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-24/heidelberg-gains-as-jpmorgan-cites-u-s-market-presence.html"><headline>Heidelberg Gains as JPMorgan Cites U.S. Market Presence</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;HeidelbergCement AG (HEI), the world&#8217;s
third-largest maker of cement, rose the most in more than two
months after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said the company&#8217;s presence in
Europe and the U.S. may protect it from emerging-market
&#8220;headwinds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HeidelbergCement increased as much as 4 percent to 55.43
euros, the steepest intraday gain since May 7, and was trading
up 2 percent at 4:30 p.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the company at
10.2 billion euros ($13.5 billion). Trading volume exceeded the
three-month daily average by 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cement producer, which is based in Heidelberg, Germany,
generated more than half of revenue in 2012 from Western
economies, with 30 percent from northwestern Europe and 25
percent from North America. The World Bank cut its global
economic-growth forecast for 2013 last month after emerging
markets from China to Brazil slowed more than projected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Heidelberg is our preferred play in the cement sector,&#8221;
as competitors Holcim Ltd. and Paris-based Lafarge SA (LG) are
&#8220;largely exposed to emerging markets,&#8221; Elodie Rall, Emily Biddulph and Rajesh Patki, London-based analysts at JPMorgan,
wrote in a research report published late yesterday.
HeidelbergCement is &#8220;rightly positioned through its U.S.
exposure and western Europe to deliver&#8221; on estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its recommendation on HeidelbergCement to
overweight from neutral and estimate the stock will reach 57.30
euros. The bank rates Holcim and Lafarge as neutral, saying
more-optimistic industry analysts are &#8220;relying too much on
cost-saving deliveries to offset the current headwinds from
weakening emerging markets&#8221; that confront the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidelberg&#8217;s stock has gained 19 percent this year, beating
gains of 0.7 percent at Lafarge and 3 percent at Jona,
Switzerland-based Holcim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;d better cash in while you can&#8221;
is the mantra that defines our times says George Packer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His new book, &#8220;The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New
America,&#8221; takes a close look at people trying to cope with
accelerating change as institutions and traditions crumble
around them, interspersed with portraits of the rich and famous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke at Bloomberg world headquarters in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: You point out that in 1997, lobbying was still
called &#8220;selling-out,&#8221; but by 2009 it was known as &#8220;cashing in.&#8221;
What changed? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer: Partly what I&#8217;m writing about is the way taboos get
toppled. And once they do, everybody rushes through because
you&#8217;re a sucker if you don&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, a senator who had statesman-like aspiration didn&#8217;t
then become a lobbyist. One little data point that&#8217;s stuck in my
head is that Al Gore, who used to be the born-to-the-manner
patrician-politician, made $100 million a few months ago, $70
million by selling his TV network to Qatar. That&#8217;s an
inconvenient truth, if there ever was one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lying Quants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: You wrote: &#8220;On Wall Street, to succeed you just
had to be somewhat comfortable with math or else with bullshit.
The former went into trading and the latter into sales. And a
quant who could lie made the big money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange
Commission asked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to disclose how much
products such as mortgages and commodities contribute to its
trading revenue to give investors more clarity on how the firm
makes most of its money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it will give &#8220;additional qualitative
disclosure&#8221; of the revenue by product types, according to
correspondence with the regulators released today about the New
York-based firm&#8217;s 2012 annual filing. The SEC indicated it was
satisfied with that response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s institutional client services division,
which includes stock and fixed-income trading, generated 53
percent of the firm&#8217;s revenue last year. Like most of its
competitors, Goldman Sachs only provides a single revenue line
for fixed-income trading, which includes products ranging from
Treasuries to distress bonds and uranium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC noted that the firm produced a third of its revenue
from market-making and made the request &#8220;in light of its
significance.&#8221; Goldman Sachs said that its quarterly filings
includes a breakdown of some revenue by product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data include market-making and &#8220;other principal
transactions&#8221; revenue reported through the firm&#8217;s investing and
lending unit, which houses the company&#8217;s own investments. It
excludes trading commissions and net interest income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $4.37 billion from interest rates,
$5.51 billion from credit and $5.8 billion from equities,
according to the data. It lost $1 billion from currencies, while
producing $575 million from commodities and $1.97 billion from
&#8220;other.&#8221; The breakdown doesn&#8217;t reflect how the firm runs its
business, Goldman Sachs said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Patricia Laya" date="Jul 25, 2013 12:49 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-25/repsol-seeks-to-block-chevron-deal-with-ypf-through-world-bank.html"><headline>Repsol Seeks to Block Chevron Deal With YPF Through World Bank</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Repsol SA (REP) is asking a World Bank
panel to help prevent Argentina&#8217;s YPF SA from developing assets
seized from the Spanish oil producer after Chevron Corp. agreed
to invest $1.24 billion in a shale venture in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request was filed yesterday to the Washington-based
International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes,
asking the arbitrator to instruct Argentina to abstain from
developing strategic YPF assets such as the Vaca Muerta shale
formation, Repsol spokesman Kristian Rix said. The filing
couldn&#8217;t immediately be verified on the ICSID website and the
center didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mailed request to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s plan to tap Vaca Muerta in an accord with YPF
this month comes as Repsol disputes the seizure of its 51
percent stake in the Argentine company by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner&#8217;s government last year. Repsol has another
lawsuit at the ICSID demanding fair compensation for the seizure
of its YPF stake, which came shortly after the Argentine company
announced Vaca Muerta discoveries of at least 23 billion barrels
of oil equivalent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need fair compensation, which is something that, after
15 months, we haven&#8217;t seen,&#8221; Repsol&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer
Miguel Martinez said today in a call with analysts. Chevron is
interfering with Repsol&#8217;s compensation by investing in what it
considers illegally confiscated assets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims lack any judicial basis because Repsol never
owned rights over Vaca Muerta, YPF said in an e-mailed response
to questions. Chevron didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol has separately filed unlawful competition suits
against Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Bridas Group that are set to be judged
in Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s investments in Vaca Muerta may reach as much as
$15 billion under the accord with YPF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina holds the world&#8217;s second-largest shale gas
reserves and the fourth-largest for shale oil, according to U.S.
Energy Information Administration data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) gained the most since May
after reporting fiscal third-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217;
estimates as consumers stepped up use of credit and debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa rose 4.6 percent to $195.33 at 10 a.m. in New York,
the second-best performer on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Information Technology Index. The shares gained 29 percent this
year, outpacing the 9.4 percent advance of the 70-company index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $1.23
billion, or $1.88 a share, compared with a loss of $1.84
billion, or $2.74, a year earlier that included a litigation
expense, the Foster City, California-based firm said yesterday
in a statement. The average estimate of 33 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.80 a share. Profit excluding
special items from the third quarter of 2012 climbed 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf is seeking to
bolster Visa&#8217;s business outside the U.S., where it gets more
than half its revenue, as consumers worldwide continue to
migrate from cash and checks to electronic payments. The company
has returned more than $15 billion to shareholders since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The opportunity to move transactions from cash to
electronic means is still huge,&#8221; Scharf, 48, said yesterday in
a conference call with analysts. &#8220;This is true in both the
developed and the developing parts of the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Repurchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company repurchased $981 million of its stock during
the quarter at an average of $176.75 a share and may buy back an
additional $1.5 billion through next July, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter operating revenue climbed 17 percent to $3
billion, beating the $2.89 billion average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue will increase about 13 percent
this fiscal year, according to the statement. Earnings per share
will rise by more than 20 percent, the company said, after an
earlier forecast of &#8220;around&#8221; 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide spending on Visa cards climbed 13 percent to
$1.09 trillion, adjusted for currency fluctuations, according to
the statement. Processed transactions rose 14 percent to 15
billion. Cross-border purchases, or spending by cardholders
outside their home countries, advanced 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., debit-card purchases advanced 12 percent to
$300 billion, and credit-card spending increased 10 percent to
$270 billion, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA) agreed last year to
a $7.25 billion settlement over the fees charged to merchants
when consumers pay with credit cards. Visa sued Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. last month to stop the biggest U.S. retailer from filing a
lawsuit that would prolong the eight-year legal battle the
settlement seeks to end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), the New York-based card issuer that
also runs the third-largest U.S. bank-card network, said July 18
that second-quarter profit rose 4.9 percent to $1.41 billion as
customer purchases increased. Riverwoods, Illinois-based
Discover Financial Services (DFS), the No. 4 network, said yesterday
that quarterly net income climbed 15 percent to $602 million.
MasterCard is set to report results July 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
executive Fabrice Tourre denied he misled ACA Management LLC
into backing a mortgage bond deal that later made Paulson  Co.
$1 billion as part of a massive bet against the housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testifying yesterday in his own defense in a federal civil
fraud trial in Manhattan, Tourre said an e-mail of his sent to
an ACA executive in the 2007 transaction at the center of the
case against him &#8220;was not accurate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Schwartz, the ACA executive who&#8217;s a key witness in
the case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
testified that the e-mail helped persuade her that Paulson was
going to invest in the equity of the deal, a collateralized debt
obligation known as Abacus, rather than sell it short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The statement was false?&#8221; SEC lawyer Matthew Martens
asked Tourre just after he took the witness stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was not accurate,&#8221; said Tourre, 34, who&#8217;s now
studying for a doctorate in economics at the University of
Chicago. &#8220;It was not an attempt to try to confuse anyone, it
was not accurate at that time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martens questioned Tourre for almost two hours, trying to
prove that he was the source of the misinformation about Paulson,
a Goldman client that initiated the deal, helped choose the
portfolio of 90 residential mortgage-backed securities
underlying it, and then made a huge profit when Abacus failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purple Tie &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martens asked Tourre about the Jan. 10, 2007, e-mail that
was forwarded to ACA, the portfolio selection agent, showing the
planned capital structure of the deal, including a
&#8220;precommitted first loss&#8221; or equity tranche. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and purple tie,
testified in French-accented English. Early in his testimony, he
knocked a closed water carafe off the witness box, and grinned
with embarrassment after it crashed to the floor. Martens walked
over to retrieve it, unsmiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Sabino, who teaches law at St. John&#8217;s University in
New York, said Tourre&#8217;s statement that he sent an inaccurate e-mail may alienate jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems evasive,&#8221; said Sabino. &#8220;When a jury of regular
New Yorkers hears a highly educated, highly compensated Wall
Street figure say something is &#8216;inaccurate,&#8217; they normally
interpret that in the worst possible way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is covering the fees for Tourre&#8217;s
lawyers and public relations team, agreed to pay $550 million in
2010 to settle SEC claims stemming from the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, run by billionaire John Paulson, made $15 billion
on short bets against the residential mortgage market in 2006
and 2007. Paulson hasn&#8217;t been charged with any wrongdoing in
connection with the Abacus deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good, Not Too Good &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre frequently disagreed with how Martens characterized
aspects of the transaction. He said that ACA, in selecting
mortgage-backed securities for the Abacus portfolio, wanted
securities that were good, but not too good. Abacus had to
attract short investors to balance the investors who were
betting the assets would perform well, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the portfolio is just too good, then there&#8217;s no
transaction,&#8221; Tourre said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who graduated from an elite engineering school in
his native France, came to the U.S. to earn a master&#8217;s degree
from Stanford University. He spent time before the trial
volunteering in Rwanda and is now a student at Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talking Latin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point in today&#8217;s testimony, Tourre explained the
abbreviation &#8220;i.e.,&#8221; which he used in an e-mail: &#8220;It stands
for &#8216;id est&#8217; in Latin.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre followed Schwartz to the witness stand and will
continue tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, who headed ACA&#8217;s asset management business in
early 2007, testified she didn&#8217;t know Paulson was taking a
short-only position in Abacus. The misimpression led ACA to lend
its prestige to the deal and to make a disastrous bet that the
portfolio would perform well, the SEC says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Paulson never corrected ACA&#8217;s
misimpression through e-mails, phone conversations and meetings,
including a chance encounter between Schwartz and a top Paulson
executive in a Jackson Hole, Wyoming, hotel bar, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under questioning today by Tourre&#8217;s lawyer, John &#8220;Sean&#8221;
Coffey, Schwartz said she can&#8217;t recall any specific conversation
or meetings in which she was told that Paulson was investing in
the equity of Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slender Reed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been no direct evidence tying Fabrice Tourre to
any fraud against ACA,&#8221; said Michael Santoro, a lawyer and
professor at Rutgers Business School who&#8217;s been attending the
trial. &#8220;At the moment, we have only the slenderest reed to even
believe he misled ACA that Paulson was long.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz said that Tourre failed to correct an e-mail she
sent referring to &#8220;Paulson&#8217;s equity perspective&#8221; on the deal.
Tourre testified today that he can&#8217;t remember reading the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz testified she is sure she was never told that
Paulson planned to make a short-only bet on Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A pure short was a bet against something that was
designed to fail,&#8221; Schwartz testified. &#8220;It would have been a
shock if I had learned that they were only short in the AC1-Abacus transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the biggest bank-card
network, reported a fiscal third-quarter profit that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates as worldwide spending on credit and debit
cards climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $1.23
billion, or $1.88 a share, compared with a loss of $1.84
billion, or $2.74, a year earlier that included a litigation
expense, the Foster City, California-based firm said yesterday
in a statement. The average estimate of 33 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.80 a share. Profit excluding
special items from the third quarter of 2012 climbed 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf is seeking to
bolster Visa&#8217;s business outside the U.S., where it gets more
than half its revenue, as consumers worldwide continue to
migrate from cash and checks to electronic payments. The company
has returned more than $15 billion to shareholders since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The opportunity to move transactions from cash to
electronic means is still huge,&#8221; Scharf said in a conference
call with analysts. &#8220;This is true in both the developed and the
developing parts of the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa rose 2 percent to $190.50 in extended trading in New
York yesterday after results were announced. The shares climbed
23 percent this year through the close of regular trading,
outpacing the 9.3 percent advance for the 70-company Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Information Technology Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Repurchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company repurchased $981 million of its stock during
the quarter at an average of $176.75 a share and may buy back an
additional $1.5 billion through next July, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter operating revenue climbed 17 percent to $3
billion, beating the $2.89 billion average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue will increase about 13 percent
this fiscal year, according to the statement. Earnings per share
will rise by more than 20 percent, the company said, after an
earlier forecast of &#8220;around&#8221; 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide spending on Visa cards climbed 13 percent to
$1.09 trillion, adjusted for currency fluctuations, according to
the statement. Processed transactions rose 14 percent to 15
billion. Cross-border purchases, or spending by cardholders
outside their home countries, advanced 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., debit-card purchases advanced 12 percent to
$300 billion, and credit-card spending increased 10 percent to
$270 billion, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. agreed last year to
a $7.25 billion settlement over the fees charged to merchants
when consumers pay with credit cards. Visa sued Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. last month to stop the biggest U.S. retailer from filing a
lawsuit that would prolong the eight-year legal battle the
settlement seeks to end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scharf, 48, has pledged to be more flexible in responding
to the demands of Visa&#8217;s business partners and in February the
company reached agreement with JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. card issuer, to let the lender tailor payment solutions for
merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co., the New York-based card issuer that
also runs the third-largest U.S. bank-card network, said July 18
that second-quarter profit rose 4.9 percent to $1.41 billion as
customer purchases increased. Riverwoods, Illinois-based
Discover Financial Services, the No. 4 network, said yesterday
that quarterly net income climbed 15 percent to $602 million.
MasterCard is set to report results July 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan (JPM)
Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley are among Wall Street banks
continuing to trade with SAC Capital Advisors LP after U.S.
prosecutors indicted the hedge fund for insider trading,
according to four people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms are still providing trading and prime brokerage
services to the hedge fund founded by Steven A. Cohen, said the
people, who asked not to be identified talking about a specific
client. The government has no plan to freeze fund assets,
prevent redemptions or affect interests of SAC counterparties,
Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC said yesterday after the
government&#8217;s criminal charges were made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have been grappling with the reputational and
financial consequences of continuing their dealings with SAC,
one of Wall Street&#8217;s largest trading clients. The $14 billion
hedge fund was indicted for perpetrating what prosecutors called
an unprecedented insider-trading scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re always between a rock and a hard place when you&#8217;re
the credit guy trying to decide to what to do,&#8221; said James Rickards, senior managing director at Tangent Capital Partners
LLC and former general counsel at Long-Term Capital Management
LP, which was one of the world&#8217;s biggest hedge funds before
losing $4 billion in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have to ask themselves &#8220;what is the risk that I lose
money? What is the risk that they get into stress and I don&#8217;t
get paid? What is the risk that the regulator criticizes me or
my reputation is tarnished?&#8221; Rickards said. &#8220;The other side is
I like the commissions and I want to be a stand-up guy, and I
don&#8217;t want to be perceived as a guy who cut and run.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protective Measures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s unclear whether other lenders including Goldman Sachs (GS)
Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Citigroup Inc. (C) had changed any
of their dealings with SAC. Spokesmen for the banks declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks may continue to deal with the hedge-fund firm while
protecting themselves by reducing credit limits, requiring more
collateral and halting trades in over-the-counter products, said
Rickards, who was a credit officer at Greenwich Capital Markets
when junk-bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. collapsed
in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of things you can do between doing nothing
and cutting them off completely to improve your position,&#8221; said
Rickards. &#8220;If everyone hangs together, and everyone does some
common-sense things, it&#8217;s business as usual. But if one domino
falls, the rest of them will fall very quickly, and that&#8217;s why
everyone is on eggshells.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allegations Denied &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC denied it encouraged or tolerated insider trading and
said it will continue to operate as it works through the
allegations. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an
administrative complaint against Cohen last week, seeking to ban
him from overseeing investor funds for allegedly failing to
supervise employees and prevent them from engaging in insider
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No major financial-services firm has survived a criminal
indictment in the U.S. While Cohen has vowed to keep open the
most successful equity hedge-fund manager, clients have already
pulled billions from its funds. SAC Capital said in a regulatory
filing this week that it managed $13.9 billion of net assets as
of July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund has been among the largest trading clients
for New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs, according
to people with knowledge of the relationships. SAC has used
those firms, along with JPMorgan, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
Barclays Plc (BARC), as prime brokers, Reuters reported in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reputational Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the world&#8217;s biggest banks have been emphasizing
their efforts to behave ethically, put clients first, cooperate
with regulators and temper risk-taking after reputations were
damaged during the credit crisis, government-funded bailouts and
scandals throughout the financial industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is definitely reputational risk at this point that
didn&#8217;t exist before as a result of the indictment,&#8221; Rickards
said. &#8220;I know we&#8217;re innocent until proven guilty, and I respect
that, but there&#8217;s no requirement that a counterparty be good to
the last drop. You&#8217;re allowed to make sensible business
decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activist Bill McKibben, who helped turn an obscure oil pipeline project into a high-profile political fight, has a new target for his effort to curb global warming: energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McKibben&#8217;s group, 350.org, is asking colleges, cities and churches to divest their financial holdings from a group of 200 companies that produce coal, oil or natural gas. So far six schools, 16 cities and 11 religious institutions have agreed to divest from those companies, according to his group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know we can&#8217;t bankrupt Exxon,&#8221; McKibben said in a meeting with Bloomberg News in Washington. &#8220;But we think we can politically bankrupt them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McKibben&#8217;s group has modeled its campaign after the 1980s divestment effort aimed at companies working with the apartheid regime in South Africa. Unless these companies can be persuaded to leave 80 percent of the available fossil fuels in the ground, climate change will proceed at a pace that would be catastrophic for the planet, they say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Students at more than 300 campuses, including the eight Ivy League schools, have joined the movement, which got a mention from Obama during his climate speech last month. They are demanding that over the next five years schools purge their endowments of investments in 200 publicly traded companies with the largest reserves of oil, gas and coal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exxon Reacts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon says divestment is the wrong approach to deal with greenhouse-gas emissions. &#8220;We take great offense to being compared to an apartheid regime,&#8221; Alan Jeffers, a company spokesman, said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an effective part of the debate&#8221; to focus on divestment, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McKibben should instead be trumpeting the growth of natural gas, which emits half the carbon-dioxide as coal when burned for electricity, he said. &#8220;We are surprised the environmental community doesn&#8217;t embrace natural gas more,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The effort is a shift in approach for McKibben, who started 350.org in 2008, focusing much of its energy on defeating the TransCanada Corp. (TRP)&#8217;s application to build the Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline would carry the oil produced from the tar sands of Alberta to U.S. refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. That oil is especially carbon-heavy, and locking in production of the tar sands for the next 40 years is especially problematic, McKibben says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we can bottle up this stuff, then we can buy some time,&#8221; McKibben said. &#8220;If we can block Keystone, then the tar sands is basically a dead letter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What&#8217;s not clear is if President Barack Obama will agree with McKibben. A State Department analysis found that the tar sands will be developed with or without the pipeline, as producers will use other pipelines or trains to transport the product to refineries. And lawmakers from both political parties are pressing Obama to green-light the application. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a major climate speech, Obama said Keystone would not be in the U.S. national interest if it will, &#8220;significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If that is applied in good faith, there is no way this thing could be approved,&#8221; McKibben said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Don Jeffrey" date="Jul 26, 2013 12:46 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/exxon-mobil-s-105-million-mtbe-defeat-upheld-by-u-s-court-1-.html"><headline>Exxon Mobil&#8217;s $105 Million MTBE Defeat Upheld on Appeal</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. jury&#8217;s $104.7 million damage
award against Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) for contaminating New York City
wells with the gasoline additive MTBE was upheld by a federal
appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award for compensatory damages to clean up contaminated
wells was proper, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan said in
a ruling today, denying Exxon Mobil&#8217;s challenge to the 2009
verdict. The Irving, Texas-based company said it plans to appeal
the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We reject Exxon&#8217;s argument that the jury&#8217;s verdict
conflicts with and is therefore pre-empted by the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990,&#8221; the appeals panel said, adding that the
jury properly offset the award by amounts attributed to cleanup
of other contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued Exxon Mobil and other oil companies in 2003,
alleging that they knew the gasoline additive methyl tertiary
butyl ether, or MTBE, would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil
argued that state laws are pre-empted by the Clean Air Act,
which required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce
air pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE
to make it burn more thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MTBE has not been used for seven years, cleanup
successfully continues and the myriad of data shows MTBE
detections decreasing,&#8221; Todd Spitler, a spokesman for Exxon
Mobil, said in an e-mail. The company &#8220;will be filing an appeal
to the United States Supreme Court,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidated Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is one of scores around the country by
municipalities, states and individuals against oil refiners,
distributors and retailers over MTBE. Many, including New York
City&#8217;s, were consolidated in New York federal court for
evidence-gathering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state appeals court in Maryland in February reversed two
jury awards totaling $1.65 billion against Exxon Mobil over MTBE
contamination, ruling that the company hadn&#8217;t made fraudulent
statements and the property owners who sued hadn&#8217;t demonstrated
physical harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in New Hampshire state court in April ordered Exxon
Mobil to pay $236 million in damages for contaminating
groundwater with MTBE. The company has appealed that verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York jury determined that it would cost
$250.5 million to treat the water and remove MTBE, which can
give water a bad odor and taste and cause cancer in rodents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Punitives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that Exxon Mobil
shouldn&#8217;t be liable for the entire cleanup cost because the
wells contained pollutants not from gasoline. She also denied
punitive damages because the company hadn&#8217;t recklessly
disregarded risks. The wells hadn&#8217;t been used for drinking
water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court today rejected cross-appeals by the city.
It said the lower court was correct both in ordering that the
damage award take into account pollution from other sources and
in denying punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court rejected Exxon Mobil&#8217;s request for a
retrial on the ground of juror misconduct. The company argued
Scheindlin should have declared a mistrial after one juror
complained that she was threatened by another. The threatened
juror was released while the one who allegedly made the threat
was not. Exxon Mobil claimed the dismissed juror was harassed
because her opinion differed from fellow jurors&#8217;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial lasted 11 weeks and the jury deliberated for 11
days. It focused on a representative sample of five wells in the
New York City neighborhood of Jamaica, Queens. All other
defendants had settled with the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Products
Liability Litigation, 10-4329, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TT Electronics Plc (TTG), a British maker
of components for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG,
advanced for a second day after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
upgraded its recommendation to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock climbed 3.3 percent, taking the two-day gain to
7.2 percent, the biggest such advance since May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect modest progression in autos volumes, supported
by encouraging recent data for Europe,&#8221; Will Wyman, an analyst
at Goldman Sachs, said in a note to investors today.
Restructuring programs &#8220;will support further margin
expansion.&#8221; Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction
list with a six-month price target increased to 240 pence from
190 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe accounted for 66 percent of Weybridge, England-based
TT Electronics&#8217; 476.9 million pounds ($734 million) of revenue
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock closed at 170.50 pence in London, taking the
advance to 18 percent this year and giving the company a market
value of 269.7 million pounds ($415 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among six analysts who review the company and share their
findings with Bloomberg, five recommend buying the stock and one
suggests holding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., which operates the
world&#8217;s biggest electronic-payments network, was sued by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)&#8217;s Asda unit, William Morrison Supermarkets Plc
and Arcadia Group Plc over payment-processing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three companies sued Visa and its former European
affiliate Visa Europe Ltd., at a London court on July 23,
according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union proposed caps this week on such levies,
known as interchange fees, that banks can demand from retailers
at 0.2 percent for debit card payments and 0.3 percent for
credit cards. MasterCard Inc. (MA) is also being sued by more than a
dozen companies over the fees in the U.K., including Asda and
Morrison, the U.K.&#8217;s fourth-largest grocery store chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have not seen this claim,&#8221; a spokesman for Visa
Europe, Mark Hooper, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We are surprised that
a case might be brought and, if it was, would strongly contest
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tania Foster-Brown, a spokeswoman for Arcadia, Russell Craig, a spokesman for Asda, and James French, a spokesman for
Morrison, declined to comment beyond confirming the subject of
the lawsuits. Comet Group Ltd., Iceland Foods Group Ltd., and
six others also filed lawsuits on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s antitrust regulators have been reviewing credit
and debit card fees for over a decade, warning that the way the
charges are agreed is anti-competitive. The bloc&#8217;s agency said
in 2007 that MasterCard&#8217;s fees for cross-border card payments
violated antitrust rules, unfairly inflating the fees paid by
retailers for processing payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While interchange fees can be agreed on by banks, card
companies such as Visa and MasterCard provide default ones that
are used unless lenders comes to their own bilateral
arrangements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe split from Visa Inc. (V) before the U.S. card
company&#8217;s initial public offering in early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre previewed his defense against civil fraud claims over a failed $1 billion investment, telling jurors about his former life as a 28-year-old Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice president, working until midnight, six days a week on a vast trading floor, supervising no one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would say there were thousands of vice presidents at Goldman,&#8221; Tourre, now 34, testified late yesterday in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims Tourre intentionally misled participants in a 2007 deal known as Abacus about the role played by Paulson  Co., the hedge fund run by John Paulson. The SEC claims Tourre hid that Paulson helped choose the portfolio of subprime mortgage-backed securities underlying Abacus, then made a billion-dollar bet it would fail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tourre&#8217;s lead lawyer, Pamela Chepiga, began questioning her client yesterday afternoon, seeking to minimize Tourre&#8217;s responsibility for the transaction by showing it was reviewed by dozens of people at Goldman Sachs. Tourre&#8217;s testimony continues today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abacus, which closed in April 2007, turned worthless when the housing market crashed, losing $1 billion for investors who bet the subprime mortgage bond portfolio would perform well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s ReNew
Wind Power Pvt. said an Indian rule requiring wind farms to
predict output will lead to penalties that will wipe out profits
in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReNew joins Tata Power Co. (TPWR), both among India&#8217;s largest
renewable-energy utilities, in voicing concern as wind-farm
developers seek a court injunction against the directive
ordering day-ahead forecasts for generation. India&#8217;s electricity
regulator will fine developers if predictions aren&#8217;t correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The level of accuracy they&#8217;re asking for isn&#8217;t
possible,&#8221; said Sumant Sinha, chief executive officer of ReNew,
which is backed by a $385 million investment from Goldman Sachs.
&#8220;Most people will end up paying very significant charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission imposed the
order this month. The directive, applying to farms built since
May 3, 2010, will affect developers including ReNew, Tata, CLP
Holdings Ltd. (2) and Morgan Stanley-backed Continuum Wind Energy
Pte, which have added some of the largest projects in that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penalties may amount to as much as 15 percent of revenue,
destroying profitability in an industry that has attracted about
$10 billion of investment since 2011, Sinha said. ReNew, which
doesn&#8217;t disclose its operating capacity, will find it &#8220;tough&#8221;
to meet its own target of adding 200 megawatts a year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Court Injunction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wind Independent Power Producers Association has filed
for an injunction at the Delhi High Court, Sunil Jain, the
lobby&#8217;s president, said in a July 25 e-mail. Another industry
body, the Chennai-based Independent Wind Power Association, is
considering doing similar, said Chairman K. Kasthurirangaian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objections from the industry have already delayed the order
by two years and developers have had sufficient time to prepare,
Rajiv Bansal, the regulator&#8217;s secretary, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecasting of wind generation, an intermittent energy
source, is carried out in parts of Europe and the U.S. to help
stabilize the grid. In India, scheduling will allow wind power
to be sold across states and help authorities prepare network
upgrades to accept more clean energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind farms of 10 megawatts or more will predict their
generation for the following day every 15 minutes. Missing
estimates by more than 30 percent will incur penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign wind-forecasting specialists such as GL Garrad
Hassan and AWS Truepower can&#8217;t guarantee that kind of precision,
Sinha said. In the low-wind season, generation would only have
to swing by a 3 percent margin to incur fines because of
seasonal variations in turbine efficiency, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nowhere else do they do it at this granular level,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure is necessary for the industry&#8217;s long-term
growth, said V. Subramanian, chairman of the Indian Wind Energy
Association. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of possible or impossible,&#8221;
he said in an e-mail. &#8220;The Indian power sector works with
scheduling of generation and consumption at 15-minute intervals.
Renewable energy cannot be different from other sources of
energy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) manipulated power markets in California and the Midwest from September 2010 to June 2011, obtaining tens of millions of dollars in overpayments from grid operators, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission alleged today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agency said in a Notice of Alleged Violations that it had preliminarily determined a JPMorgan trading unit had engaged in eight manipulative bidding strategies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank has agreed to sanctions including a fine of about $400 million in a settlement that may be announced as early as tomorrow, according to a person familiar with the case who asked not to be identified because the terms aren&#8217;t yet public. Other sanctions may include forfeiting profits, this person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment on the FERC action. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case marks another setback for the biggest U.S.-based bank, which sailed through the 2008 financial crisis without a single quarterly loss. Last year JPMorgan lost more than $6.2 billion from wrong-way derivatives bets placed by traders in London. The incident prompted a U.S. Senate investigation, the departure of two senior executives and a debate over whether Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon should keep his chairman role. In May shareholders re-elected him as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services provider, raised $2.15
billion in a two-part bond sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information technology business issued $650 million of
two-year floating-rate notes to yield 3 basis points more than
the three-month London interbank offered rate and $1.5 billion
of 3.375 percent, fixed-rate securities due 2023 priced to yield
83 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds, the first to be
offered by the company since May 2, may be rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s $1 billion of 1.875 percent, 10-year debentures,
which it issued in July 2012 to yield 65 basis points more than
government bonds, traded on July 25 at 89.99 cents on the dollar
to yield 3.16 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said it will split up its three major internal
businesses and shuffle the management that leads them, part of
the company&#8217;s preparation for a further break up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in 2012 sold its infant nutrition business to Nestle
SA (NESN) for $11.9 billion and this year spun off its $4.3 billion-a-year animal-health unit. The latest reorganization divides
what&#8217;s left of the company into two brand-name drug units and a
generics business, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ian Read is positioning the New
York-based drugmaker for a potential breakup that may leave just
two units intact: A brand-name drug business with higher margins
and growth, and a cash-generating &#8220;value&#8221; business composed of
the company&#8217;s off-patent products. Such a split could happen in
two to three years, Read has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This represents the next steps in Pfizer&#8217;s journey to
further revitalize our innovative core,&#8221; Read said in the
statement. &#8220;Our new commercial operating model will provide
each business with an enhanced ability to respond to market
dynamics, greater visibility and focus, and distinctive
capabilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose less than 1 percent to $29.54 at 4 p.m.
New York time, after jumping 24 percent over the last 12 months.
The company reports second-quarter earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Leaders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes will give investors a detailed look at the
financial results of each segment to help them assess a split.
Geno Germano, who previously ran Pfizer&#8217;s specialty and oncology
units, will head one, the company said. Amy Schulman, the
company&#8217;s top lawyer who also ran the drugmaker&#8217;s consumer unit,
will head another. John Young, who ran Pfizer&#8217;s primary care
business, will head the generics business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germano&#8217;s business unit will have drugs in inflammation and
immunology, cardiovascular disease, rare disease, men&#8217;s and
women&#8217;s health, pain and neurosciences, and rare diseases. That
would include new potential blockbusters Eliquis, a blood
thinner, and Xeljanz, a rheumatoid arthritis drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schulman&#8217;s business will include vaccines and cancer drugs,
as well as consumer products. Palbociclib, an experimental
therapy being studied in breast and other cancers, has the
potential to be one of Pfizer&#8217;s biggest future products. It
would also include Prevnar, a pneumococcal disease vaccine that
was the company&#8217;s fourth-biggest product in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago fuels strengthened relative
to New York futures after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reduced rates at the
238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet, Illinois, refinery, the fifth-largest plant in the U.S. Midwest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel in Chicago
narrowed 0.5 cent to 4.5 cents a gallon versus New York
Mercantile Exchange futures at 12:43 p.m. The spread trimmed for
a fifth day, the longest such streak since Nov. 16, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differential for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or
CBOB, narrowed by 4.75 cents to 6 cents a gallon below futures,
the strongest position since July 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuels rallied after regulatory filings showed that
Exxon&#8217;s Joliet refinery shut an &#8220;east co&#8221; boiler and cut rates
on July 26. The plant produces about 9 million gallons of
gasoline and diesel a day, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricia Simpson, a spokeswoman for Exxon, said the
information in the filings with the U.S. National Response
Center and Illinois Emergency Management Agency was accurate.
She declined to comment on day-to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cut in production at the plant may contribute to lower
supply of refined products in the area, where the Energy
Information Administration reported distillate stockpiles fell
to 28.8 million barrels on July 19. Gasoline inventories were
49.1 million barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, widened $1.33 to
$19.20 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EON SE (EOAN), Germany&#8217;s largest utility,
sold a stake in its Anacacho wind farm in Texas to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. for $76.6 million and a commitment for future
funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank bought a &#8220;partial interest&#8221; and will make
further capital contributions, EON Climate  Renewables North
America, a subsidiary of the Dusseldorf-based company, said in a
statement today. Matt Tulis, an EON spokesman, declined to say
how large a stake was sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax-equity financing gives JPMorgan a share of the
project&#8217;s 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour production tax credit, Tulis
said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 99-megawatt project, located in Kinney County, Texas,
consists of 55 Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) 1.8-megawatt turbines and
started operating in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) and
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) will borrow $1.2 billion from banks for
expansion of their joint venture petrochemicals project in the
kingdom, two people familiar with the deal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Jubail Petrochemcial Co., known as Kemya, will raise a
total of $2.2 billion through a mix of shareholder loans and
bank debt, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. The funding will have a
tenor of 10 years, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kemya is building a specialty-elastomer plant on the
kingdom&#8217;s Persian Gulf coast that will produce 400,000 tons of
rubber products a year, which will be sold in Saudi Arabia and
exported to the Middle East and Asia. Construction contracts
were awarded in June 2012 with production expected to begin in
the second half of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $900 million loan from 10 local and international banks
will be backed by Sabic, while Exxon Mobil will guarantee a $100
million facility from non-Saudi banks. Kemya will also borrow
about $200 million in Saudi riyals in a non-guaranteed loan, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the financing, Exxon Mobil will also provide a
shareholder loan of $900 million, while Sabic will contribute
$100 million, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Sabic wasn&#8217;t immediately available for
comment, while a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil in Qatar didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a phone message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insider trading evidence against SAC
Capital Advisors LP includes court-authorized wiretaps, a U.S.
prosecutor said at the $14 billion hedge fund&#8217;s arraignment in
federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The discovery will be voluminous, including a large
number of electronic recordings, including electronic messages,
instant messages, court-authorized wiretaps and consensual
recordings,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Antonia Apps told U.S.
District Judge Laura Taylor Swain Friday about the pretrial
evidence-gathering process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors didn&#8217;t specify whether the wiretaps were
directed at SAC founder and owner Steven A. Cohen or any other
SAC employee. Cohen wasn&#8217;t in court Friday for the hearing that
lasted about 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the crowded courtroom, the defense table was lined
with six criminal lawyers for SAC. Peter Addison Nussbaum, SAC&#8217;s
general counsel, entered a not guilty plea on behalf of each of
the four SAC business entities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. alleges that the four units are culpable for
allowing insider trading to become institutionalized as a way of
doing business at the Stamford, Connecticut-based hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nussbaum declined to comment after the hearing, as did
Martin Klotz, another SAC lawyer from Willkie Farr  Gallagher
LLP. Also representing SAC is Theodore &#8220;Ted&#8221; Wells from Paul
Weiss Rifkind Wharton  Garrison LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the criminal case, each of the SAC units charged
faces a maximum of at least $25 million or twice the profits
made or losses avoided on each of the alleged crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC last week told investors, employees and counterparties
that it will stay open for business as the U.S. presses its
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP, 13-00541, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tourre Says &#8216;I Haven&#8217;t Done Anything Wrong&#8217; at Testimony&#8217;s End &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre made one final attempt to convince jurors in
Manhattan that he didn&#8217;t defraud investors in a 2007 mortgage
bond-backed investment that lost them $1 billion when the U.S.
housing market crashed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, as I&#8217;m here literally to
tell the truth and to clear my name,&#8221; Tourre, 34, said Friday
as he wrapped up his testimony in the trial of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s civil fraud case against
him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claims Tourre, a former vice president at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), hid the involvement of the hedge fund Paulson
 Co. in selecting the mortgage bonds underlying the investment,
known as Abacus 2007-AC1, and then made a $1 billion bet it
would fail. The agency plans to rest its case against Tourre
when the trial reconvenes July 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre testified he made $1.7 million in salary and bonus
in 2007. If found liable for fraud, he faces money penalties and
a possible ban from the securities industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre told jurors Friday that he learned in April 2010 the
SEC was suing him and Goldman Sachs over Abacus from a news
headline scrolling on his Bloomberg terminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, a French citizen, said he voluntarily testified
before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in 2010. After that he &#8220;had
to take a step back and think about what to do,&#8221; as his career
had been &#8220;effectively destroyed&#8221; by the allegations. Tourre
was placed on paid leave by Goldman Sachs for one year, at his
base salary of about $750,000. He said he hoped he&#8217;d be able to
return to the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was hoping I could make the SEC understand this
transaction,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre told jurors he did volunteer work in East Africa and
is now pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of
Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre&#8217;s lead lawyer, Pamela Chepiga, sought to minimize
Tourre&#8217;s responsibility for the Abacus transaction by
highlighting his relatively junior status and showing that the
transaction was reviewed by dozens of people at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre was called as a witness by the SEC and was
questioned by both sides. He isn&#8217;t expected to testify again
when his defense team presents its case this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GMAC Will Pay Borrowers $230 Million on Faulty Foreclosures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMAC Mortgage, part of the home lending unit owned by Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY), will pay $230 million to compensate borrowers
for improper handling of foreclosures, the Federal Reserve said
July 26 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMAC Mortgage will pay about 232,000 borrowers to settle
claims it improperly seized homes, the Fed said. In a deal
similar to those regulators struck with 13 other mortgage
servicers this year, the money goes to borrowers who faced
foreclosure in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlements reached since January with 14 of the largest
U.S. mortgage servicers, total more than $3.8 billion and will
close the books on mishandled foreclosures after the 2008 credit
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re relieved to be able to distribute these funds
directly to borrowers rather than spend the time and money with
consultants to complete the file review,&#8221; Tammy Hamzehpour, a
spokeswoman for Residential Capital -- part of the Ally mortgage
unit placed into bankruptcy last year -- said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;That process would not have returned anywhere near
as much money, to as many potentially harmed borrowers, as will
this settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company settled without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. The payments will come from the Residential Capital
estate, Hamzehpour said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;France Blocks Mercedes Compact Registrations in Coolant Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler AG (DAI), the world&#8217;s third-biggest maker of luxury
vehicles, is barred from registering its Mercedes-Benz compact
models in France because regulators have stopped accepting a
coolant fluid used in the vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mercedes A- and B-Class as well as the CLA coupe can&#8217;t
be registered in the country as they use a refrigerant that no
longer meets to European Union environmental regulations, the
Ministry of Ecology, Development and Energy said in a statement
July 26. Daimler said Friday that it plans legal action against
the move, which it called a misreading of EU law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler has been in talks for about a year with European
authorities over a newer refrigerant, R1234yf, that regulators
say meets stricter standards on greenhouse gas emissions. The
Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer has held off from
switching to R1234yf, saying the new fluid is susceptible to
catching fire in car crashes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler sold 15,745 compact vehicles in France in the first
six months of 2013, accounting for about 2 percent of its global
car deliveries in the period, Ulrike Bless, a spokeswoman, said
by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carmaker was in &#8220;discussions with all the relevant
institutions in order to reach rapid clarification of the
situation,&#8221; Daimler said in its second-quarter report published
July 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks Should Shed Commodities and Focus on Banking, Chilton Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks that own, trade or warehouse commodities should
consider going back to being banks, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission member Bart Chilton said July 26 after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) announced it was considering selling its
physical commodities business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This whole area of banks owning the physical, warehousing
and delivery mechanisms of commodities is one that policy makers
need to thoughtfully consider, and soon,&#8221; Chilton said in an e-mail. &#8220;Banks getting back to being banks and making loans to
businesses and individuals seems like the best course of action.
Perhaps that will happen without any policy changes, although I
have definite doubts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said it may sell or spin off its physical
commodities business three days after a congressional hearing
examined whether banks are using their ownership of raw
materials to manipulate markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm plans to continue running the commodities unit
&#8220;as a going concern and fully support ongoing client
activities&#8221; while it considers its options, JPMorgan said. One
possibility is a strategic partnership, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators including the Federal Reserve are under pressure
to explain why they allow banks to run trading operations while
also owning mines, oil fields, railroads and warehouses. A
reversal of those regulatory policies could put commodity units
of JPMorgan as well as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley (MS) in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat whose
subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee held hearings on
the industry this week, has called on the Fed to give clear
guidance on what non-bank activities should be allowed &#8220;and
consider placing limitations on those that expose banks and
taxpayers to undue risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Mobil&#8217;s $105 Million MTBE Defeat Upheld by U.S. Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. jury&#8217;s $104.7 million damage award against Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) for contaminating New York City wells with the
gasoline additive MTBE was upheld by a federal appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award for compensatory damages to clean up contaminated
wells was proper, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan said in
a ruling July 26, denying Exxon Mobil&#8217;s challenge to the 2009
verdict. The Irving, Texas-based company said it plans to appeal
the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We reject Exxon&#8217;s argument that the jury&#8217;s verdict
conflicts with and is therefore pre-empted by the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990,&#8221; the appeals panel said, adding that the
jury properly offset the award by amounts attributed to cleanup
of other contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued Exxon Mobil and other oil companies in 2003,
alleging that they knew the gasoline additive methyl tertiary
butyl ether, or MTBE, would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil
argued that state laws are pre-empted by the Clean Air Act,
which required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce
air pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE
to make it burn more thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MTBE has not been used for seven years, cleanup
successfully continues and the myriad of data shows MTBE
detections decreasing,&#8221; Todd Spitler, a spokesman for Exxon
Mobil, said in an e-mail. The company &#8220;will be filing an appeal
to the United States Supreme Court,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is one of scores around the country by
municipalities, states and individuals against oil refiners,
distributors and retailers over MTBE. Many, including New York
City&#8217;s, were consolidated in New York federal court for
evidence-gathering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state appeals court in Maryland in February reversed two
jury awards totaling $1.65 billion against Exxon Mobil over MTBE
contamination, ruling that the company hadn&#8217;t made fraudulent
statements and the property owners who sued hadn&#8217;t demonstrated
physical harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in New Hampshire state court in April ordered Exxon
Mobil to pay $236 million in damages for contaminating
groundwater with MTBE. The company has appealed that verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Products
Liability Litigation, 10-4329, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Texas Loses Bid to Stop EPA Takeover of Greenhouse Gas Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas&#8217;s bid to keep control of its own greenhouse gas
permitting program was rejected by a divided federal appeals
court in a decision that supports a takeover by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
said July 26 that Texas, Wyoming, Peabody Energy Corp. and
industry groups aren&#8217;t in a legal position to challenge federal
rules governing the revision of state implementation plans,
known as SIPs. The ruling follows the court&#8217;s holding last year
that the EPA&#8217;s limits on greenhouse gas emissions are lawful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties cannot show harm because &#8220;the permitting
requirements are self-executing&#8221; under the Clean Air Act, U.S.
Circuit Judge Judith Rogers wrote in a majority opinion joined
by Judge David Tatel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas sued the agency in 2010 to prevent the EPA from
taking control of the state&#8217;s regulation of carbon-emissions
from stationary sources. States were required to regulate
greenhouse gases as pollutants in their permitting programs by
January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan Shaw, chairman of the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality, said in an emailed statement that the
&#8220;EPA has effectively rewritten the Clean Air Act to impose its
new standards, imposed severely restrictive timelines on the
states to implement its new requirements, and then twisted the
act to immediately impose its agenda on Texas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a dissent, Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh argued that
under EPA regulations the states should have three years to
revise their plans before any federal intervention. He said the
regulation also doesn&#8217;t impose a construction moratorium during
those three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of Texas v. Environmental Protection
Agency, 10-1425, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MF Global Reaches Settlement With JPMorgan Unit on Recovery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd. reached a settlement giving it a
share of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s recovery on a $60 million claim
against the holding company&#8217;s brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a prior settlement with the brokerage, MF Global
Inc., JPMorgan agreed to hand over $100 million in customer
property and in return received the $60 million unsecured claim.
As part of a new settlement, JPMorgan will give a percentage of
its recovery on the claim to the holding company, according to
court papers filed July 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigations of the bank &#8220;concluded that, while there
are potential claims against JPMorgan, it is not at all clear&#8221;
that plaintiffs would prevail in litigation seeking to recover
money on the claims, lawyers for MF Global Holdings wrote in the
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s settlements with the brokerage have so far
resulted in a total of $1 billion being made available to
distribute to former customers, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holding company&#8217;s Chapter 11 case is In re MF Global
Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The broker liquidation is In
re MF Global Inc., 11-bk-02790, same court. The class-action
case is 11-cv-7866, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald J. Mulvihill, a Goldman Sachs (GS)
Group Inc. managing director who started the firm&#8217;s asset-management business in Japan and created tax-focused funds in
the U.S., has died. He was 56. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died on July 19 at Loyola University Medical Center in
Maywood, Illinois, 15 months after being diagnosed with
leukemia, according to his wife, the former Jill Kane. A
resident of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, he retired from New York-based
Goldman Sachs on July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 33-year career with Goldman, the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, Mulvihill became a specialist on pension and
retirement planning, introducing new investment products in the
U.S. and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don will be remembered not only for his commercial
contributions, but also for his commitment to our people,&#8221;
Timothy J. O&#8217;Neil and Eric S. Lane, co-heads of Goldman&#8217;s
Investment Management Division, wrote in a company e-mail on
July 19. &#8220;Don was known throughout the firm for his kindness
and thoughtfulness. He has been, and will continue to be, an
inspiration for us all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As president of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Japan Ltd.
from 1992 to 1997, he dealt first-hand with Japan&#8217;s &#8220;lost
decade&#8221; of recessions following the collapse of the nation&#8217;s
asset bubble in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) energy traders
who avoided individual penalties in a $410 million settlement
with a federal regulator may face action by other agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal and state agencies are free to pursue penalties
against the bank&#8217;s employees if they choose, Jon Wellinghoff,
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said today
in an interview. He said the FERC would cooperate with other
agencies, which he didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have had some discussions with some agencies that I
can&#8217;t disclose at this time,&#8221; Wellinghoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by market value, agreed
today to pay $410 million to resolve FERC accusations that its
traders manipulated power markets in California and the Midwest
from 2010 to 2012. The agency decided not to pursue sanctions
against individuals, though it named them in the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision was made to move forward in this case from a
standpoint of expeditiously settling the matter&#8221; not to punish
individuals, Wellinghoff said. The FERC has previously reached
agreements to end an investigation without sanctioning
individuals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked in a separate interview with Bloomberg Television
today if he was aware of any investigations being conducted by
other agencies, the FERC chairman said he knew of none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan traders Francis Dunleavy, Andrew Kittell and John
Bartholomew are still employed with the bank, according to the
FERC settlement documents. They worked in JPMorgan&#8217;s commodities
unit, run by Blythe Masters, the FERC order showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawful Conduct &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunleavy, Kittell and Bartholomew didn&#8217;t settle with the
commission. The agency decided not to sanction them after they
explained to the commission that their conduct was lawful,
according to a statement from Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher LLP, the
law firm representing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission&#8217;s decision to voluntarily settle with
JPMorgan and not proceed against the individuals can only be
read as the commission correctly concluding that no case or
findings against the individuals could be sustained in a court
of law,&#8221; William Scherman, their lawyer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to comment on Wellinghoff&#8217;s interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Greenlee, a spokesman for the California Independent
System Operator, declined to comment whether the state grid
authority was conducting its own investigation or has received
any inquiries from government agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC on July 16 announced $18 million in civil penalties
for four former traders for Barclays Plc (BARC), over allegations of
market manipulation. The sanctions were part of $488 million in
fines and penalties levied at Barclays and the individuals,
which the bank has vowed to fight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) sold $853 million
worth of Surface tablets in its latest fiscal year, as the maker
of Windows software struggles to capitalize on a shift by
consumers toward handheld devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft disclosed Surface sales, which weren&#8217;t specified
in the company&#8217;s latest earnings report, in a regulatory filing
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings in the period that ended in June were hit by a
$900 million writedown of inventory related to Surface, a mobile
touch-screen computer introduced by Microsoft in October to
compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad and tablets running Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows sales have been besieged by poor demand for PCs,
reflected in five consecutive quarters of declining shipments,
according to researcher IDC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s two new brand-drug
units will operate on a separate basis, reporting independent
profits and losses, under the leaders that Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read elevated to head them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The businesses, along with an established products line
that could be split from the company after 2017, will report
separate results that will show investors how each line of
drugs, and the leaders managing them, are performing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wanted to focus great executive talent on both of those
segments of the business,&#8221; Read said in a telephone interview
today after the New York-based company reported second-quarter
earnings. The units, led by Geno Germano and Amy Schulman, have
different needs and strategies, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is in the middle of a transition that may see the
world&#8217;s largest drugmaker broken up into a brand-medicine
company, which Read calls the &#8220;innovative core,&#8221; and a
generics business. Such a split almost certainly wouldn&#8217;t happen
until at least 2017, in part because Pfizer needs three years of
audited financial statements, as well as time to get the
businesses running smoothly on a separate basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our current thinking is that this is about getting all
three of these businesses to hum internally,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said today on a conference call. D&#8217;Amelio
said it would be difficult to split the company before 2017 if
Pfizer decides to take that ultimate step. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will pay $410 million to settle U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allegations that the bank manipulated power markets, enriching itself at the expense of consumers in California and the Midwest from 2010 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to pay a U.S. civil penalty of $285 million and return $125 million in ill-gotten profits to electricity ratepayers, according to a FERC order today. JPMorgan also agreed to give up claims to $262 million worth of disputed payments from California&#8217;s grid operator, the state authority said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to have this matter behind us,&#8221; Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by market value, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case marks another setback for JPMorgan, which sailed through the 2008 financial crisis without a single quarterly loss. Last year JPMorgan lost more than $6.2 billion from wrong-way derivatives bets placed by traders in London. The incident prompted a U.S. Senate investigation, the departure of two senior executives and a debate over whether Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, should keep his chairman role. In May shareholders re-elected him as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marathon Asset Management LP, a
hedge-fund operator that oversees more than $10.5 billion of
assets, hired JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co.&#8217;s Jason Gold as it bolsters
its emerging-markets trading effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold, who focused on Latin American sovereign debt as a
senior trader at JPMorgan, will join Marathon in September,
according to Andrew Rabinowitz, the company&#8217;s chief operating
officer. Gold will be a senior trader based in New York and
report to Gabriel Szpigiel, a partner and senior portfolio
manager, Rabinowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. Gold couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon was founded in 1998 and specializes in global
credit, including high-yield, bank, distressed and emerging-market bonds, along with structured finance, debt transactions
and real estate. JPMorgan is the second-most-active underwriter
of Latin American overseas bonds this year, managing about $7.5
billion in offerings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of dollar-denominated debt from emerging-market
countries such as Russia, Mexico and Brazil has swelled by 69
percent since 2008 to $444.2 billion outstanding, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Emerging Markets External
Debt Sovereign Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index has declined 6.4 percent this year after
returning 77 percent in the four years after 2008, as central
banks globally suppressed borrowing costs through bond purchases
to ignite economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised
selling shares of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., saying the company&#8217;s
diversification strategy will reduce profit margins and may
cause the exchange operator to miss earnings forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Blostein cut his rating on
the second-largest U.S. exchange operator to sell from neutral
and reduced his price estimate to $28 a share from $30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Street is too optimistic on the firm&#8217;s operating
margin outlook as NDAQ&#8217;s business mix continues to shift toward
lower-margin revenue streams, creating risks to 2014 and 2015
EPS estimates,&#8221; Blostein wrote in a research note today, using
the company&#8217;s ticker symbol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq shares fell 2.8 percent to $32.10 as of 9:31 a.m. in
New York. They have gained 29 percent this year, almost double
the 17 percent advance in the Bloomberg World Exchanges Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s stock has fallen 2.5 percent since the July
23 close, before it reported second-quarter earnings the next
day that missed analyst estimates. It was the first time profit
came in below expectations in five quarters and only the second
time in 13 quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were hurt by costs associated with acquisitions
that are part of Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld&#8217;s
strategy to diversify the company. In recent months, Nasdaq has
bought U.S. Treasury trading platform eSpeed and Thomson Reuters
Corp.&#8217;s shareholder-relations business. It also took a 25
percent stake in Dutch alternative trading system The Order
Machine, which focuses on options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Businesses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moves into new business won&#8217;t make up for shortcomings
in other areas, said Blostein, because of the smaller margins.
In the wake of the eSpeed and Thomson Reuters deals, he
estimates a 39 percent margin compared with 45 percent in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the firm&#8217;s information services, market services
and listings businesses, which together comprise 83 percent of
Nasdaq&#8217;s 2012 sales, have been flat over the last two years,
Blostein wrote, citing &#8220;challenging trading trends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other businesses have a blended profit margin of 58
percent, the former Thomson Reuters unit acquired by Nasdaq
means &#8220;the firm&#8217;s Tech Solutions business continues to gain
share of the overall revenue pie, with only 7 percent operating
margin.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blostein said Goldman Sachs&#8217;s models suggest Nasdaq&#8217;s
expenses in 2014 will be on average 3 percent higher than
current analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blostein&#8217;s call is the only sell rating on the stock among
18 analyst opinions compiled by Bloomberg. Nine rate the stock a
buy and eight have hold ratings. The average 12-month price
estimate is $34.57 a share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FERC announced the settlement with the New York-based

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised
A$750 million ($680 million) in its biggest Australian bond sale
in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year debt transaction was priced to yield 170
basis points more than swaps, according to Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman Hayley Morris. The bank sold A$450 million of fixed-rate notes and A$300 million of floating-rate securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street lender that generates most of its revenue
from trading last sold similar debt in November, when it priced
A$600 million of bonds with the same tenor at a 195 basis-point
spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It sold A$1.25 billion
of notes in May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. was the last U.S. bank to sell bonds
in Australia, pricing A$850 million of 2018 notes on May 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Following record debt
sales in May, issuance in the South Pacific nation dropped to
the least since December 2011 last month as concern the Federal
Reserve will reduce stimulus roiled global markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average spread for financial-company bonds in Australia
spiked to as high as 130 basis points more than swaps on July 2
before narrowing to 114 yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. While the premium is nearing its level before
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke spoke about tapering at his June 19
news conference, issuance has remained muted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs holds the seventh-highest credit rating at
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. Bank of America
carries the same A- ranking as Goldman Sachs at SP and is
graded two levels lower at Moody&#8217;s. The 5-1/4 year paper it sold
in May was priced at a spread of 190 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s Goldman Sachs transaction was managed by the lender

&lt;p&gt;Albert Marais is racing against the
threat of rain. The 100-degree heat and soft wind is ideal
wheat-cutting weather, and Marais is moving fast across a
Colorado field in his Deere  Co. (DE) combine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We cut 360 acres with this one machine yesterday, that&#8217;s
a pretty good day,&#8221; said Marais, 31, working a farm east of
Aurora. &#8220;It&#8217;s flat, easy to cut out here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marais and his three-man crew have come from South Africa,
following a migratory route based on harvests in each
hemisphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Plains wheat-cutting teams, once filled by U.S. farm
kids, now rely on foreigners for about one-third of the workers
who cut grain sold to Cargill Inc. and others, according to
trade group U.S. Custom Harvesters Inc. The highly skilled
itinerant workers, a little-noted component of the immigration
overhaul struggling through Congress this year, have become
essential to the nation&#8217;s $17.9 billion wheat crop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wheat has a relatively short window to be harvested, so
you need to have enough people available at the right time,&#8221;
said Terry Kastens, a retired economics professor at Kansas
State University in Manhattan, Kansas, who surveys combine
operators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals in both houses of Congress to impose a cap on the
number of work visas available to agricultural laborers may
leave harvesters out of luck if the quota is already filled
before they arrive for the season that begins in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rural Economies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs would go up without the harvesters, harming rural
economies, Kastens said. One cutting crew will serve dozens of
farms, helping to keep smaller operations in business by saving
capital costs for farmers who then don&#8217;t need to buy their own
combines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afrikaners -- South Africans of mostly European ancestry --
have a special advantage because the U.S. summer months coincide
with their winter, meaning they can harvest at home and then hit
the road. And they speak English. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They bunk with crewmates in a mobile trailer and earn a
little more than $20 an hour, hauling combines that can cost
$350,000 in semi-tractor trailers across the Plains with stops
in dozens of fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work starts once the morning dew has dried and may continue
for 16 hours until nightfall makes the wheat too wet. Harvesters
work nearly continually to keep a combine moving cross-country
from farm to farm, following the fields as they mature. After
Aurora, Marais&#8217;s team was scheduled to head to Loveland, then
the Dakotas and Kansas to start the fall crops of sorghum,
canola, corn and peas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hispanic Immigration &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While their numbers pale in comparison to what may be more
than one million mostly Hispanic and sometimes undocumented
immigrants in agriculture, a migrant cutter&#8217;s economic impact is
significant because of mechanization. The U.S. wheat crop was
worth almost double that of grapes, oranges and strawberries
combined in 2012, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike visa programs for tech workers, there&#8217;s currently no
cap on the number of visas set aside for farmworkers. That would
change under the immigration proposals pending in Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africans are the largest contingent among the
English-speaking immigrant combiners, sending 1,122 workers to
the U.S. on H-2A visas last year, up from none 15 years earlier,
State Department figures show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a distant second to Mexico&#8217;s 61,324 visas, South
Africa outpaces Peru and Guatemala, the next two nations on the
list of countries that provide workers under the H-2A program.
U.K., New Zealand and Australian cutters dot the crews, with
occasional harvesters from South America or Ukraine, regions
where farming can be highly mechanized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kansas Harvester &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wheat harvest began internationalizing in the 1990s,
when the skills required for a crew increased and the
availability of U.S. labor declined, said Jim Deibert, who
operates JKD Harvesting Inc., based in Colby, Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combines have grown more sophisticated and expensive and
longer school years have pulled U.S. students out of fields
earlier. That, and tight job markets in Plains states, have
prompted employers to turn to foreign workers, said Deibert, a
professional harvester for 42 years who started using immigrants
in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of his workers come through a student exchange program
with Ohio State University, though he still employs the
occasional American: &#8220;This year I have Australia, New Zealand,
England, Ireland -- and Indiana. One Hoosier,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Harvest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marais is working with his 27-year-old brother Jannie, and
another South African on his first U.S. harvest, 29-year-old
Janus Naude. The income helps them finance their farm near
Bethlehem, South Africa, 166 miles (267 kilometers) south of
Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I like Oklahoma,&#8221; says Jannie Marais, preparing to move
the combine to another field outside Denver. &#8220;It&#8217;s more like
back home.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harvesters speak English over their CB radios, in part
to reassure eavesdropping police officers (called &#8220;voet,&#8221;
meaning &#8220;foot,&#8221; in Afrikaans slang) who can&#8217;t understand their
language. They revert to their own language when speaking among
one another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the harvest workers come to the U.S. on temporary
H-2A visas. Employers are concerned that visa limitations
proposed in Congress may cut off their supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Senate approval of a comprehensive immigration law in
June, the Republican-led U.S. House said earlier this month it
will delay consideration until this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Immigration Bills &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans to replace the H-2A program may cut into the
availability of visas for the harvesters, who all arrive around
March and April, potentially after a cap could already be
filled, said Frank Gasperini, chief executive officer of the
National Council of Agricultural Employers, a Vienna, Virginia-based trade group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may put the cutters at a disadvantage in a flood of
applications from workers in fresh produce who have larger
employers and more political clout because of their bigger
numbers, Gasperini said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we hit the caps early in the season, then we&#8217;re frozen
out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The cutters are really worried that the
program is going toward the needs of groups that have more
workers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re following the rules, and we&#8217;re making the program
work as best we can for us, but the government keeps wanting to
tweak it,&#8221; Deibert said. &#8220;The guys who have been doing it
right need to be treated right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rugby-team Caps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combiners say they&#8217;ll find a way to get back for the
next harvest. Workers in Johannesburg rugby-team caps have
become part of the fabric of the Plains, where the wheat harvest
remains part of a common language, even though its accent has
changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think that without them, I might have to quit,&#8221; said
Leo Stephens, owner of Leo Stephens Harvesting based in Colby,
Kansas, and the South African crew&#8217;s U.S. boss. &#8220;I&#8217;d at least
have to cut back on my number of combines. I love having these
guys. They want to be a part of America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), facing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into how it reports revenue from offsite cloud services, said it stands by its accounting methods. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM is cooperating with the SEC in the probe, which it learned about in May, it said today in a filing. The company books its revenue from cloud services, such as storing customers&#8217; data and software applications remotely, under generally accepted accounting principles, said Ed Barbini, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM&#8217;s reporting of cloud revenue is the result of a rigorous and disciplined process, and we are confident that the information we have provided has been consistently accurate,&#8221; Barbini said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has identified cloud computing as one of IBM&#8217;s chief sources of growth amid a slowdown in demand for hardware and for consulting services. The investigation at the company, known for consistently meeting analysts&#8217; earnings estimates, underscores confusion about how cloud revenue should be booked, said Michael Cusumano, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of Management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a murky area where the rules aren&#8217;t really established,&#8221; Cusumano said. &#8220;Companies treat cloud-computing revenue in different ways.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About half of publicly traded software companies since 1990 have had to restate revenue because of misclassification of sales and product returns, or because they categorized ongoing payments for tech-support services as a sale of a product license, Cusumano said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Disciplined Process&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While IBM doesn&#8217;t disclose its revenue from cloud services, it said the sales rose 70 percent in the first half of 2013 from a year earlier. In its filing today, the company didn&#8217;t provide details on what information the SEC was seeking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM has robust systems and controls to identify and validate what products and services count as cloud revenue,&#8221; Barbini said. &#8220;IBM accounts for cloud transactions exactly the same way as it would account for those transactions if they were not cloud -- in accordance with GAAP.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Florence Harmon, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM has beat analysts&#8217; earnings expectations in 32 of the past 33 quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the other hand, it has missed sales estimates in seven of the past eight quarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More Probes? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investigation may be the first in a series of probes into companies in the same industry as the SEC tries to clear up confusion and differences in standards, said Jack Ciesielski, owner of investment firm R.G. Associates Inc. in Baltimore and the publisher of the Analyst&#8217;s Accounting Observer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has a goal of reaching $7 billion in cloud revenue by 2015, with about $3 billion from new business and the rest from current contracts shifting over to the cloud category. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s 70 percent growth rate for cloud-computing services in the first six months of 2013 was a slowdown from 80 percent last year. IBM has also said cloud revenue, which is spread across several divisions, tripled in 2011 from 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 1 percent to $195.04 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 1.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disclosure of the probe comes days after IBM won court approval for a $10 million settlement with the SEC for accusations of bribery in China and South Korea. IBM said earlier this year it&#8217;s the subject of a U.S. Justice Department bribery investigation related to contracts in Poland, Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Autonomy Writedown &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), IBM&#8217;s archrival in the computer-services business, took an $8.8 billion charge last year to write down the value of Autonomy, a software company it acquired, amid allegations of accounting improprieties within the unit. Autonomy, whose products organize corporate customers&#8217; data, had used aggressive tactics to inflate its results, a former executive told Bloomberg News last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, IBM acquired SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a cloud-computing storage provider. IBM paid almost $2 billion for Dallas-based SoftLayer, according to a person familiar with the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Market researcher IDC estimates the cloud-computing market may more than double to $105 billion by 2016 from last year. SoftLayer specializes in public clouds -- data-center networks that manage computing and software for businesses remotely. IBM is pairing those capabilities with private-cloud operations, building dedicated systems for individual customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore and Agnieszka Troszkiewicz" date="Jul 31, 2013  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-31/goldman-sachs-offers-aluminum-to-clients-stuck-in-queue.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Offers Aluminum to Clients Stuck in Queue</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) offered to
speed up delivery of aluminum to users of the metal and proposed
changes to industry rules amid claims that its warehouse unit
created shortages and drove up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far no client has accepted the bank&#8217;s offer to swap
their metal stuck in queues for immediately available aluminum,
Goldman Sachs President Gary D. Cohn, 52, said today in a CNBC
interview. Consumers should have priority over other clients in
getting aluminum out of warehouses and the London Metal Exchange
system needs more transparency, Goldman Sachs said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We feel horrible for consumers if they can&#8217;t get metal,&#8221;
Cohn said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that to be the fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beverage industry has complained that banks and other
warehouse owners are manipulating aluminum supplies and slowing
deliveries to drive up the price. Goldman Sachs said that while
longer queues in recent years have been a factor in the premium
of physical metal over the spot price, the waits are not driving
up the price of aluminum, which has fallen since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a recognition of a longstanding problem in the
market that needs to be solved,&#8221; said Diego Valiante, head of
capital markets at the Center for European Policy Studies in
Brussels. &#8220;Clearly there is also the understanding of the
urgency in solving this issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Premiums Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detroit, New Orleans, the Dutch port of Vlissingen, the
Belgian city of Antwerp and Malaysia&#8217;s Johor have the longest
waits for metal, according to Barclays Plc. Detroit is dominated
by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Metro International Trade Services LLC, while
Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN)&#8217;s Pacorini Metals has the most storage
units in Vlissingen, New Orleans and Johor. In Antwerp, it is
NEMS, a unit of Trafigura Beheer BV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum for delivery in three months fell 13 percent this
year on the LME as stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the
exchange neared a record. The premiums added to the LME price
surged to a record 12 cents to 13 cents a pound in June, almost
double the 6.5 cents in the summer of 2010, according to data
from Austin, Texas-based researcher Harbor Intelligence. The
surcharge fell for the first time this year in the week ending
July 19, according to Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore, the largest owner of LME warehouses, declined to
comment through a spokesman. Trafigura continues to offer prompt
delivery of metal to its customers, an official at the
Singapore-based commodities trader said. Henry Bath warehouses,
owned by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), don&#8217;t currently have queues,
according to a person familiar with the business who wasn&#8217;t
authorized to comment and requested anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Costs Inflated &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s offer is &#8220;great news and any pricing
manifestations due to warehousing issues will hopefully resolve
going forward,&#8221; said Bart Chilton, a member of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. &#8220;This entire matter continues to
raise the larger issue of banks owning physical commodities,
warehousing and delivery mechanisms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs were inflated by $3 billion worldwide in the past
year because of the backup in aluminum supplies, Tim Weiner, a
global risk manager at brewer MillerCoors LLC, told a U.S.
Senate panel last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has secured metal directly from producers to
be able to swap with end-user clients, Cohn said. The firm has
made the offer at the LME spot price with no premium, according
to a person briefed on the talks who asked not to be named
because the offers were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Considered Selling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are consulting with the metals trade and industry on a
proposal to amend the delivery out obligations of warehouse
companies with long queues, and we encourage market users to
contact us with their views,&#8221; Miriam Heywood, a spokeswoman for
the LME, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2010, Goldman Sachs bought Romulus, Michigan-based Metro International Trade Services LLC, which as of July
11 operated 34 out of 39 storage facilities licensed by the LME
in the Detroit area, according to exchange data. Goldman Sachs
said in today&#8217;s statement that it isn&#8217;t involved with the daily
management of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earlier this year considered selling Metro,
according to a person briefed on the discussions. The bank must
sell the company within 10 years of its purchase, it said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last week that it plans to get out of the
business of owning and trading physical commodities ranging from
metals to oil, days after a Senate panel questioned whether
banks are abusing their ownership of raw materials to manipulate
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Incentives Offered &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn said that while his firm will sell Metro at the
&#8220;appropriate time,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t have plans to exit other
commodity businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodity hedging is a core competency and one of the
most important things we do in the firm, and our clients really
need us to be in that business,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;We are staying in
the commodity-hedging business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low interest rates have encouraged some investors to buy
and store aluminum with the intent of selling it at a later
date, Goldman Sachs said in its statement. Warehousing
companies, which don&#8217;t own the metal they hold, offered
incentives to attract supply, according to research from Societe
Generale SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many market participants have sought to move metal to non-LME warehouses, where storage rates are lower, prompting the
longer queues, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said his firm continues to do business with SAC
Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund that was indicted on charges
of insider trading last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re an important client to us, they have been an
important client to us,&#8221; Cohn, 52, said today in an interview
on CNBC. &#8220;We continue to trade with them, and they&#8217;re a great
counterparty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which gets more than half its revenue from
trading, is the first Wall Street firm to comment publicly on
its dealings with the $14 billion hedge fund company founded by
Steven A. Cohen. Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Morgan Stanley (MS) were among firms that were continuing to trade
with SAC Capital after the indictment, four people briefed on
the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC Capital denied it encouraged or tolerated insider
trading and said it will continue to operate as it works through
the allegations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filed an administrative complaint against Cohen, seeking to ban
him from overseeing investor funds for allegedly failing to
supervise employees and prevent them from engaging in insider
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund has been among the largest trading clients
for New York-based Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according
to people with knowledge of the relationships. SAC Capital,
based in Stamford, Connecticut, has used those firms, along with
JPMorgan, Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc, as prime
brokers, Reuters reported in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glencore Xstrata Plc, the biggest
publicly traded raw-materials supplier, became the largest owner
of warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange as banks
pull back amid increased scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacorini Metals, owned by Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore,
added 14 warehouses this year, taking its total to 178, or two
more than C. Steinweg Handelsveem BV, according to LME data
compiled by Bloomberg. The expansion contrasts with a drop in
listed warehouses held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), the third and fourth-largest owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. financial regulators told a Senate hearing yesterday
they will boost scrutiny of banks&#8217; commodities holdings and the
Federal Reserve said this month it will review a decade-old
decision to let them trade raw materials. The LME, which handles
about 80 percent of trading in industrial metals futures, is
reviewing storage rules that buyers say helped accumulate
inventory in fewer sites, distorting supply and raising prices
for consumers even as global production outpaces demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would hope regulators would take a holistic approach as
they consider LME warehouses, not solely those owned by banks,&#8221;
Nick Madden, a senior vice president and supply-chain officer at
Novelis Inc., an Atlanta-based aluminum parts maker whose
customers include The Coca-Cola Co. and Ford Motor Co., wrote in
an e-mail. &#8220;Our major concern is over the ownership of
warehouses by banks and trading companies. It creates an
imbalance in the marketplace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
payment network, fell the most in two years after a judge ruled
that the Federal Reserve had erred by inflating the debit-card
fees that banks can charge retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa fell as much as 11 percent in New York trading before
dropping 5.9 percent to $180.15 at 12:43 p.m., the most since
August 2011. Swipe, or interchange fees, are set by Foster City,
California-based Visa and MasterCard (MA) Inc., which collect the
money and remit it to card-issuing member banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon in Washington ruled
today that the Fed considered data it wasn&#8217;t allowed to use in
setting a 21-cent cap on debit-card fees under the Dodd-Frank
Act of 2010. The decision handed a victory to retailers who
challenged the fees as being too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the second-biggest U.S. network, slid as much
as 5.7 percent before falling 0.2 percent to $600.38. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $195
million of structured notes tied to an index of commodity
futures, the largest such note in more than three and a half
years after the size was increased twice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-year securities, $40 million of which were issued
on July 23, yield the gains and losses of the Dow Jones-UBS
Commodity Index 3 Month Forward Total Return minus a fee with
all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank originally
sold $65 million of the notes on Nov. 18, 2010, and an
additional $90 million on Feb. 28 this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones-UBS benchmark, which tracks natural gas and
19 other commodities, declined 9.4 percent this year to 546.7 at
the close of trading yesterday. The index would have to rise
more than 8 percent from the day the securities were most
recently issued in order to reach the initial level from
November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;America&#8217;s power needs are only increasing with

colder states to the Sun Belt,&#8221; said Aaron Calder, senior
market analyst at Gelber  Associates in Houston. U.S.
regulations could decrease coal production, boosting prices for
other energy sources, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have bought $760.5 million of commodity-tied
notes this year, the slowest period since Bloomberg started
collecting data on the securities in 2010. Globally, banks have
sold about $2 billion of the securities this year, the least
since 2004, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg started collecting comprehensive data on the
securities in January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siena prosecutors accused JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and at least one of its employees of obstructing
regulators as part of a wider probe into Banca Monte dei Paschi
di Siena SpA&#8217;s purchase of Banca Antonveneta SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege an unidentified person at JPMorgan
Securities Ltd., a unit of the New York-based bank, withheld
information from regulators about a 1 billion-euro ($1.3
billion) financing arranged for Monte Paschi&#8217;s takeover of
Antonveneta in 2008, a July 30 court filing obtained by
Bloomberg News showed. The U.S. bank failed to oversee its
employees properly, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan arranged a sale of bonds exchangeable into shares
of Monte Paschi to finance the deal. The lender, which benefited
from the alleged crime by earning commissions, didn&#8217;t inform the
Bank of Italy that it signed a so-called indemnity agreement
with Monte Paschi, protecting JPMorgan from potential losses
linked to the securities, according to prosecutors. By hiding
the agreement, Monte Paschi (BMPS) was able to count the funding as
equity instead of debt and boost capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents mark the final stage before the authorities
can request formal indictments, and it brings them a step closer
to reconstructing how Monte Paschi&#8217;s former managers allegedly
colluded to misrepresent the lender&#8217;s finances in the years
before it sought a government bailout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese banks&#8217; profits may decline
in the next three years as a government crackdown on industrial
overcapacity slows lending and sours loans, said JPMorgan
Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit growth may slow to the mid-teens over the next 18
months, from the 20 percent to 25 percent gains in recent years,
Josh Klaczek, head of Asia financial services, told reporters in
Hong Kong today. Klaczek didn&#8217;t specify which bank could see
earnings drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to curb overcapacity, which
the government blames for driving down prices of goods, eroding
company profits and generating pollution. Industrial 
Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398), China Construction Bank Corp. (939),
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (3988), and Bank of China Ltd. were
among the world&#8217;s five most profitable lenders last year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growth and profits would be increasingly challenged,&#8221;
Klaczek said. &#8220;Given the pressures we are seeing right now in
terms of asset quality, in terms of slower revenue growth versus
rising costs, and then on top of that potential interest rate
liberalization, that&#8217;s a recipe for earnings falling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China this month eliminated the lower limit on lending
rates offered by the nation&#8217;s financial institutions as Li seeks
to expand the role of markets in the economy, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social Financing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine mainland banks trading in Hong Kong have been
reporting consecutive annual profit growth since 2009 as the
nation&#8217;s stimulus program created a $2.7 trillion credit boom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total social financing, which includes bank loans, bond and
equity sales, as well as shadow banking, was 1.04 trillion yuan
($170 billion) in June, 13 percent less than the previous month,
data from the People&#8217;s Bank of China show. That compared with a
56 percent gain in January, when credit increased by 2.5
trillion yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly social financing may be about 1 trillion yuan for
the rest of 2013, Klaczek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad loans climbed by 33.6 billion yuan in the three months
ended March 31, a sixth straight quarter it increased, data from
the China Banking Regulatory Commission show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China two years ago had way more capital than everyone
else,&#8221; Klaczek said. &#8220;I no longer think it&#8217;s a case of
overcapitalized. I think they are actually just at the line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion of non-performing loans will depress profit
and curb the ability of banks to increase dividends, Klaczek
said. If more loans sour, lenders may need to raise capital, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Chinese banks
as earnings may beat projections for the MSCI China Index while
reforms to interest rates fail to crimp profit margins,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese lenders may have high single-digit earnings growth
this year compared with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 4 percent estimate for
companies in the MSCI China Index, Helen Zhu, the bank&#8217;s chief
China strategist said yesterday. A measure of financial
companies that accounts for 40 percent of the MSCI China has
slumped 13 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a
35 percent surge by information-technology shares and 17 percent
rise by utilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese listed banks may see net-income growth slowing to
around 8 percent this year, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported yesterday, citing a report released by the China
Banking Association. While the People&#8217;s Bank of China scrapped a
floor on borrowing costs on July 19, the central bank said the
country isn&#8217;t ready to do the same with a cap on what banks can
pay for deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for banks&#8217; earnings to grow faster than the
overall market-earnings growth this year,&#8221; said Zhu. Banks&#8217;
preparation for a cyclical downturn, sufficient coverage ratios
and a slower loosening of interest-rate controls for deposits
may support their earnings, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations that deregulation of rates would compress net
interest margins -- the difference between what banks pay for
deposits and charge for loans -- may be misplaced, Zhu said.
Lenders hadn&#8217;t previously taken advantage of leeway they had to
charge less, suggesting that even more freedom won&#8217;t translate
into lower profit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lending Statistics &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter of 2013, about 11 percent of bank
loans were made below the benchmark rate, and about 64 percent
above it, PBOC data show. The central bank currently sets the
one-year lending rate at 6 percent, with a one-year deposit rate
of 3 percent, which banks aren&#8217;t allowed to exceed by more than
10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s two biggest lenders, Industrial  Commercial Bank
of China Ltd. (601398) and China Construction Bank Corp. (939), reported first-quarter profit growth of 12 percent and 16 percent,
respectively, while net income at the third- and fourth- largest
banks increased 8.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four largest lenders, which include Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd. (1288) and Bank of China Ltd. (3988), traded at 5.21 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with their five-year
average of 8.24 times and MSCI China&#8217;s 11.6 times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s 12-month forward target for MSCI China is 59,
according to Zhu. That&#8217;s 3.5 percent higher than yesterday&#8217;s
close. The target for the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) is
10,200, a 5.5 percent increase from yesterday. Previous targets
for the indexes were 69 and 12,400. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key driver of the trend is not going to be beta but
it&#8217;s going to be alpha, it&#8217;s going to be looking for
structurally appealing areas and stocks that will have reform-driven upside,&#8221; Zhu said. &#8220;A lot of these potential reform
impacts are not currently reflected in the earnings consensus so
we see a lot of opportunity for earnings to be revised.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Aug 01, 2013  5:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-01/televisa-agrees-to-745-million-deal-to-buy-mexico-s-cablecom.html"><headline>Televisa to Acquire Mexico&#8217;s Cablecom in $745 Million Deal</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) agreed to a $745
million transaction that would give it control of Mexico&#8217;s
Cablecom, strengthening its grip on the growing pay-TV market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is acquiring 7 billion pesos ($549 million) in
debt that&#8217;s convertible to a 95 percent stake in Tenedora Ares
SAPI, which owns 51 percent of Cablecom, according to a filing
today. Ares also has an option to acquire the rest of Cablecom.
As part of the deal, Mexico City-based Televisa said it also
bought about 2.5 billion pesos in Ares debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is part of a strategy by Televisa, the
world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster, to reduce its
dependence on over-the-air TV advertising as more Mexicans sign
up for cable and satellite. In the past six years, Televisa has
spent billions to snap up stakes in two cable carriers, a
telecommunications company and a wireless provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it turns the convertible debt into control of Cablecom,
Televisa would be adding about 840,000 pay-TV customers in
Mexico, on top of its current base of 7.9 million cable and
satellite users -- the most in the nation. The company would
need regulatory approval to acquire the Cablecom stake, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose less than 1 percent to 69.72 pesos at the
close in Mexico City trading. The shares have climbed 2.2
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablecom, officially known as Grupo Cable TV SA, also has
about 360,000 other connections to customers, comprising
Internet and phone lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deal Valuation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option Ares owns to acquire the rest of closely held
Cablecom would value the company at 9.3 times earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the 12 months
preceding the transaction, Televisa said. Cablecom expects 1.6
billion pesos in Ebitda for 2014, on sales of 3.9 billion pesos,
Televisa said. At that level of profit, the option would value
Cablecom at 14.9 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 10 pay-TV merger deals announced in the past 12 months
around the world, companies have paid an average of 6.5 times
Ebitda, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking control of Cablecom, Televisa would be snatching
up one of the few remaining large cable operators operating
independently in Mexico. Megacable Holdings SAB is the biggest,
with 2.1 million video subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Hevi, the closely held owner of Mexico&#8217;s Telecable TV
service, hired Barclays Plc to explore a sale, people familiar
with the matter said earlier this year. The company has about
350,000 subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Transactions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, which already held stakes in Empresas Cablevision
SAB and satellite provider Sky, acquired 50 percent of cable
company Television Internacional SA in 2006 for about 800
million pesos. It won approval the following year to buy a 49
percent stake in Cablemas SA for $258 million, agreeing to make
its broadcast channels available to rival pay-TV providers. It
took full control of Cablemas in 2011 for about $400 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Televisa acquired Bestel, a long-distance phone
carrier, for $256 million. And last year, Televisa got a 50
percent stake in mobile-phone provider Grupo Iusacell SA in a
$1.6 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s government passed a law this year seeking to boost
competition in telecommunications, in part by creating a new
regulator that act as the industry&#8217;s antitrust agency. The new
government entity is still being put together, and its
commissioners haven&#8217;t yet been appointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Televisa deal is the second announced this week in
Mexico&#8217;s telecommunications industry. Yesterday, Paris-based
Eutelsat Communications SA (ETL) said it would acquire Satelites
Mexicanos SA, which provides satellite services to companies
including Televisa, for $831 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light SA (LIGT3), the Brazilian power
utility, plans to build a 90 million-real ($39 million)
cogeneration plant at a Coca-Cola factory by December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light will operate the plant in Rio de Janeiro state for 15
years, Marco Donatelli, director of the company&#8217;s energy-efficiency unit Light Esco, said today at a conference in Sao
Paulo. The facility will turn natural gas into power, steam,
carbon dioxide and nitrogen for soft-drink production, he said.
It may include a boiler that will run on wood pellets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Pegasus pipeline
failed because of original manufacturing defects that may have
worsened, according to a report paid for by Exxon and released
by regulators today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is highly probable that some micro-cracking within the
upset/heat-affected zones might have occurred immediately
following the pipe manufacturing,&#8221; Hurst Metallurgical Research
Laboratory of Euless, Texas, said in the report. &#8220;The micro-cracks then likely would have merged by further cracking through
the adjacent areas&#8221; during service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon doesn&#8217;t have a timetable for restarting the line,
David Rosenthal, vice president of investor relations, said
today on a conference call to discuss second-quarter earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line, which was built in the 1940s and delivers 96,000
barrels a day to Gulf Coast refineries from Patoka, Illinois,
was shut March 29 after spilling 5,000 barrels of oil in
Arkansas. Exxon said on July 11 that the report showed the line
failed because of original manufacturing defects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,
released the Hurst report and has finished an initial review of
it, said Damon Hill, a spokesman based in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The (Hurst) study is one part of our overall ongoing
investigation, as we continue working to identify the underlying
cause of the failure,&#8221; Hill said by e-mail today. &#8220;The
pipeline will remain shut down until PHMSA is convinced it can
be restarted safely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failed seam was electric resistance-welded, Exxon said
in its statement. ERW seams in pipelines built before 1970 are
known to have defects, according to a 1989 federal report, and
the process was changed in the 1960s to use higher-frequency
current. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, hired John &#8220;Jay&#8221; Mann from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as head of index trading within credit markets, according to two people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mann will report to Brian Archer, head of global credit trading at New York-based Citigroup, according to one of the people, who didn&#8217;t want to be identified because the move isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup is hiring for the credit-index trading unit after former global head Gabriel Roberts left in February for hedge fund Saba Capital Management LP. Alexis Serero, who worked at Deutsche Bank AG, will join Citigroup&#8217;s London office in September as European head of credit-index trading. The business buys and sells credit derivatives tied to bundles of corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mann joined Goldman Sachs in 2002, according to records from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Aug 01, 2013  8:11 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-01/exxon-second-quarter-profit-declines-on-lower-oil-prices.html"><headline>Exxon Second-Quarter Profit Declines On Lower Oil Prices</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said second-quarter
profit fell for the first time in four years as crude oil prices
declined along with returns from its gasoline and diesel
manufacturing business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was $6.86 billion, or $1.55 a share, compared
with $15.9 billion, or $3.41, a year earlier, the Irving, Texas-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. The year-earlier quarter included a $7.5 billion net gain from tax-related items and divestments including the sale of part of its
stake in a Japanese refining business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, a global benchmark, averaged $103.35 a
barrel during the second quarter, down 5 percent from $108.76 a
year earlier. The average margin from processing crude into
transportation fuels narrowed by 12 percent during the April-to-June period as gasoline demand and prices declined in the U.S.
market that burns one of every five barrels of the world&#8217;s crude
supply, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
has been steering exploration to Russia, Liberia and the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico to revive crude production after $52 billion in
natural gas investments during the past three years floundered
amid depressed prices for the furnace and power plant fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded energy company,
said in March that its combined oil and gas output will fall for
a second straight year as the company constructs new platforms
and pipelines to bring recent discoveries online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Production vs. Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson reduced the full-year capital projects budget by
4.5 percent this year to $38 billion. The company has
underperformed its biggest U.S. rival, Chevron Corp. (CVX), and the
broader market this year, with shares advancing 8.3 percent.
During that period, Chevron increased 16 percent and the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 18 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global oil prices declined during the second quarter as
crude production growth outpaced the expansion in demand by an
almost 6-to-1 margin, according to data from the International
Energy Agency in Paris. The world&#8217;s oil supply increased by an
average of 590,000 barrels a day, overshadowing the 100,000-barrel rise in daily demand, the IEA said in a July 11 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising natural gas prices in the U.S. failed to offset all
of the impact on profit from weaker crude and motor fuel prices
for Exxon, the largest U.S. gas producer. Benchmark New York
Mercantile Exchange gas futures jumped 71 percent to an average
of $4.018 per million British thermal units in the quarter, from
$2.354 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas comprised more than 48 percent of Exxon&#8217;s overall
output in 2012, up from 41 percent before the company acquired
XTO Energy Inc. for $34.9 billion in 2010 to tap into the North
American shale drilling revolution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee fell on concern
outflows from stocks may intensify after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended cutting holdings amid the slowest growth in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India tightened the cash supply last
month to buoy the rupee and said July 30 the measures will be
rolled back as the currency stabilizes, leaving its key policy
rate unchanged the same day. The monetary authority also lowered
its growth forecast to 5.5 percent for the year through March
2014 from 5.7 percent. Goldman yesterday cut its rating on
Indian shares to underweight, and said it sees &#8220;increasing risk
of a potential flow reversal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee declined 0.4 percent to 60.58 per dollar as of
10:18 a.m. in Mumbai, after dropping as much as 0.8 percent
earlier, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank probably sold dollars today to
support the rupee, according to two traders with knowledge of
the matter, who asked not to be named as the information isn&#8217;t
public. The Indian currency fell 2.5 percent this week and
touched a record low 61.2125 on July 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman report was a disturbing factor,&#8221; said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB) in Mumbai.
&#8220;Possible RBI intervention is a risk for the exchange rate
today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas investors pulled $3 billion from Indian stocks and
bonds last month on concern the Federal Reserve will pare
stimulus that drove demand for emerging-market assets. While
data in the U.S. showed gross domestic product grew more than
economists estimated in the second quarter, the Fed said
yesterday persistently low inflation poses a risk. The European
Central Bank and the Bank of England review interest rates today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 17 basis points,
or 0.17 percentage point, to 13.63 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month onshore rupee forwards declined 0.1 percent to
61.98 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts rose 0.5 percent to 62.07. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) said Microsoft (MSFT) Corp.
acted too hastily in suing U.S. customs officials in a patent
dispute over whether Motorola Mobility phones should be blocked
at the border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, in a court filing today, asked a federal judge to
throw out a lawsuit brought by Microsoft that accused the U.S.
Customs and Border Protection of failing to enforce an order to
ban imports of the phones. Microsoft should instead have taken
its complaint back to the trade agency that issued the ban,
Google argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft won an order from the International Trade
Commission that prevents Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility from
shipping Asian-made phones that have a feature that synchronizes
calendars between phones and computers. Google convinced customs
that it was no longer infringing the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s suit is &#8220;an unprecedented attempt&#8221; by
Microsoft to circumvent the administrative process, Google said,
seeking to intervene in the case. &#8220;Customs noted that the ITC
has yet to consider, much less resolve, the issue Microsoft asks
this court to decide: whether Motorola&#8217;s use of Google&#8217;s
synchronization protocol infringes Microsoft&#8217;s patent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC in Washington issued the ban in May 2012 after
deciding that Motorola Mobility devices infringed the Microsoft
patent. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, in a complaint
filed July 12, said that order isn&#8217;t being enforced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Appeal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, is appealing
the infringement finding, while Microsoft is challenging the
ITC&#8217;s decision that four other patents weren&#8217;t infringed. The
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes
in patent law, is scheduled to hear arguments in both appeals
Aug. 6 in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing today, the U.S. asked the court to deny
Microsoft&#8217;s request, arguing the company &#8220;entirely fails to
establish entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of compelling
government to action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Cuddy, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to comment
immediately on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Department of Homeland
Security, 13-1063, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allstate Corp. (ALL)&#8217;s 2011 lawsuit against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over the alleged fraudulent sale of
residential mortgage-backed securities has been discontinued,
court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer sued Goldman Sachs in state court in Manhattan
over the sale of more than $100 million of residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages including the lost market
value of the investments. The parties agreed to the suit&#8217;s
dismissal, according to a filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allstate, based in Northbrook, Illinois, the largest
publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, filed similar suits
against lenders including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.,
Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley in the same court, also in
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Eileen Bransten in March denied bids by Morgan
Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America to dismiss the cases.
The insurer and Citigroup agreed to a settlement in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allstate said this week that second-quarter profit climbed
on investment gains and reduced costs tied to natural disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a voice-mail
message left on its media line seeking comment on yesterday&#8217;s
filing. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment
on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investments, pools of home loans securitized into
bonds, were a central part of the housing bubble that helped
send the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The
housing market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and
investment banks as the market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,
652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is Wieler&#8217;s last day at Goldman Sachs, said the

&lt;p&gt;Wieler said in an e-mail from his Goldman Sachs account
that he was leaving after four years at the New York-based

&lt;p&gt;U.S. consulates worldwide will extend
the same visa privileges to same-sex spouses as to other married
couples starting immediately, Secretary of State John Kerry said
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision applies to spouses of U.S. citizens as well as
non-U.S. citizens. The change resulted from President Barack Obama&#8217;s order that U.S. government agencies review rules that
discriminated against same-sex couples and might be invalidated
by the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in June to overturn the Defense
of Marriage Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every married couple will be treated exactly the same&#8221;
provided that they were legally married in a jurisdiction where
same-sex marriage is recognized, Kerry told employees in the
consular section of the U.S. embassy in London, one of 222 U.S.
visa centers worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry said the Supreme Court decision &#8220;tearing down an
unjust and unfair barrier&#8221; was &#8220;one of those moments where
policy and values join together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Aug 02, 2013 10:25 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-02/chevron-profit-declines-as-crude-prices-fall-with-output.html"><headline>Chevron Profit Declines as Crude Prices Fall With Output</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s second-largest energy company by market value, posted its biggest
second-quarter profit decline in four years and missed analysts&#8217;
estimates as crude oil prices and production fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income dropped by 26 percent to $5.37 billion, or $2.77
a share, from $7.21 billion, or $3.66, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said in a statement today. The
per-share result was 19 cents below the average of 21 estimates,
excluding one-time gains and losses, compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s oil and natural gas output fell 1.6 percent to
the lowest second-quarter average in half a decade as new wells
in Angola, the Gulf of Mexico and Pennsylvania failed to make up
for declining production from older fields, according to the
statement. The price the company fetched for crude sold overseas
dropped 5 percent, while profit from refining crude into fuels
tumbled 59 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron is looking at a natural decline in its resource
base of 6 to 10 percent a year before they even do anything, so
it&#8217;s kind of like running up a down escalator,&#8221; Edmund Cowart,
who helps manage $22 billion, including Chevron shares, at Eagle
Asset Management Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida, said in a
telephone interview today. &#8220;Refining&#8217;s been tough for
everybody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales dropped by 8.4 percent to $57.4 billion. Chevron fell
2.4 percent to $123.40 at 9:54 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shrinking Margins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron received an average of $94 a barrel for non-U.S.
crude during the quarter, compared with $99 a year earlier,
according to the statement. The company&#8217;s so-called upstream
earnings fell 12 percent during the April-to-June period as
worldwide demand for petroleum-based fuels failed to keep pace
with production growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s refineries posted a $766 million profit compared
with $1.88 billion a year earlier as prices for transportation
fuels fell faster than crude, and the lingering effects of a
California refinery fire hindered production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining margins in the U.S., the world&#8217;s largest motor-fuels market, narrowed as lower gasoline use reduced retail
prices by 3.6 percent to a quarterly average of $3.601 a gallon,
based on Energy Department figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson
pledged in March to raise oil and gas output by one-fifth to the
equivalent of 3.3 million barrels a day by the end of 2017
through mega-projects such as the $47 billion Gorgon gas-export
development in Australia. Last month, Watson signed a $1.24
billion agreement with Argentina&#8217;s state-controlled YPF SA to
explore a shale formation in the Latin American nation for oil
and gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron estimated in March that its global output this year
will rise 1.5 percent to an average of 2.65 million barrels a
day, assuming crude prices around $112 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has been the best-performer among the largest
international oil producers this year with a 17 percent increase
in its share price through yesterday. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the
biggest oil company, has risen 7.1 percent, followed by Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)&#8217;s 0.5 percent gain, Total SA&#8217;s 3.8 percent rise
and BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s 7.9 percent increase. PetroChina Co. Ltd. has
fallen 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude averaged $103.35 a barrel during the quarter,
compared with $108.76 a year earlier, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Prices fell as worldwide oil production rose 0.6
percent at a time when demand increased by 0.1 percent.
Consumption increases in expanding economies such as China and
India were more than offset by demand declines in the U.S.,
western Europe and Japan, according to figures published by the
International Energy Agency in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas prices climbed 71 percent to an average of
$4.018 per million British thermal units during the April-to-June period from a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has been raising gas production in the Marcellus
Shale formation in the eastern U.S. since its 2011 acquisition
of Atlas Energy Inc. The transaction included a previously
signed joint venture between Atlas and Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)
that committed the Indian company to cover most of the drilling
costs in exchange for a stake in each well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swissport International AG, which
agreed to buy aviation ground-handling company Servisair
yesterday, said airlines should concentrate on their cabin
activities in order to lower costs and support consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many airlines are still operating a lot of non-core
activities rather than focusing on flying aircraft with the
right fleet and the right number of passengers and the right
yield,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Per Utnegaard said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines still control about half the ground-handling
market worldwide, while fast-growing low-cost carriers often
rely on partners for the service. Swissport, owned by private
equity firm PAI Partners SAS, yesterday agreed to acquire
Servisair from Derichebourg SA (DBG) for an enterprise value of 450
million euros ($597 million), in its biggest purchase to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement, which adds 15,000 employees, comes five
months after the company announced plans to buy the majority of
the ground-handling operations of SAS Group. Those activities
have about 500 million euros in sales, Utnegaard said, while
Servisair had sales of 688 million euros last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Servisair deal may close in the fourth quarter,
the SAS transaction will likely take until next year, Utnegaard
said. The acquisitions will lift Swissport&#8217;s headcount by about
50 percent to 60,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swissport&#8217;s largest rivals are the aviation unit of John
Menzies Plc (MNZS) and Dnata, the ground-handling unit of Emirates,
Utnegaard said. Swissport, which will have a market share of
about 7 percent after acquiring Servisair, will continue to seek
takeover targets, with Africa as a preferred region, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan Exchange Group Inc. (8697), the
operator of the world&#8217;s second-biggest stock market, said it&#8217;s
in talks to provide its trading system to Tokyo Commodity
Exchange Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tocom, as the bourse for gold, rubber and soybean contracts
is known, is examining options beyond next May when its five-year contract to use the trading platform of Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc. comes up for renewal, said spokeswoman Sayaka Sato. It may
keep and upgrade the Nasdaq system or shift to a platform
provided by a different domestic or overseas exchange, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPX is in discussions with Tocom,&#8221; said Naoya Takahashi,
a spokesman for the exchange. &#8220;Nothing has been decided at this
time.&#8221; Sharing systems would bring revenue for JPX and reduce
Tocom&#8217;s systems development costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 25.5 million contracts changed hands through Tocom in
2012, down from a recent peak of 87.3 million in 2003, according
to the bourse&#8217;s website. The exchange reported net income of 20
million yen ($201,126) for the year ended March 31, compared
with a 205 million yen loss the previous year, as investors
increased holdings of risk assets and gold prices reached new
highs in February, amid receding risks from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis
and economic-growth concerns in developing countries, the bourse
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tocom, CME &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tocom President Tadashi Ezaki said on July 12 the bourse is
also in talks with CME Group Inc. about the possibility of
sharing trading systems and met with CME Chief Executive Officer
Phupinder Gill. CME has tentatively offered the use of its
trading systems for around 8.5 billion yen over five years, the
Nikkei newspaper reported today without attribution. JPX is
asking for as much as 7 billion yen for the same period, Nikkei
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPX subsidiary Osaka Securities Exchange Co. uses the J-Gate trading system, also developed by Nasdaq OMX, for
derivatives. The Osaka bourse and Tocom agreed in December 2010
that the commodity exchange can use the OSE&#8217;s J-Gate backup
facilities in case of emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;
