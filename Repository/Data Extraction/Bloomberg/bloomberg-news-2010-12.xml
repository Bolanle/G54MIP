<p>Jeffrey Kindler''s refusal to name an
operations chief in response to a push from senior managers cost
him his job as chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc., according
to a person familiar with the process. </p>
<p>Kindler, 55, quit yesterday hours before a special board
meeting, the person said. Ian C. Read, 57, was named to replace
him. Executives, including Kindler, met in September to discuss
a succession plan and decided Read would become chief operating
officer, taking over some CEO responsibilities, said the person,
who declined to be named because the deliberations were private.
That never happened. </p>
<p>Kindler in recent months had lost support of executives
frustrated with his management style, the person said. At a time
when New York-based Pfizer faces complex policy decisions,
Kindler was focused on smaller matters and micromanaging his
executives, according to the person. </p>
<p>The company has been dealing with a U.S. health-care
overhaul, lawsuits from shareholders alleging that senior
executives failed to stop illegal marketing of drugs, and a
stock that underperformed its peers. The shares have dropped 35
percent since Kindler, formerly Pfizer''s general counsel, was
named CEO on July 28, 2006. </p>
<p>Investors have not been happy about the stock price,
said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak  Co.
in New York, in a telephone interview. Could he have done
better? Yeah. He could have focused on buying more innovative,
smaller companies. </p>
<p>Shares Rise </p>
<p>Pfizer shares rose 9 cents, or less than 1 percent, to
$16.81 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The stock has declined 9 percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>Read, a 32-year veteran of the company, has been head of
Pfizer''s global pharmaceutical operations since 2006,
controlling 85 percent of revenue. Read''s management style is
well-known to Pfizer director and former CEO William C. Steere.
Read ran operations in Latin America and Europe while Steere
headed the company from 1991 to 2000. </p>
<p>Steere didn''t return calls for comment.
Constance J. Horner, an independent director, cited Read''s
experience in emerging markets in the company statement
announcing the change. </p>
<p>Read has brought to product development a focus and
commitment to advance only medicines that have clear value to
our customers, Horner said in the statement. Today''s
business leaders need to understand global markets, drive change
and innovation, and move quickly to adapt to competitive
pressures. Ian''s track record throughout his career has
demonstrated these exact strengths.'' </p>
<p>Special Board Meeting </p>
<p>The board called the Dec. 5 special meeting sometime in the
last week or two, the person said. Pfizer spokesman Ray Kerins
declined to comment on the board deliberations. Kindler didn''t
return calls to his home. </p>
<p>Pfizer has underperformed its rivals over the 4 1/2 years
of Kindler''s tenure. Pfizer''s price-earnings ratio for the past
year is lower than 91 percent of pharmaceutical industry peers
and below 97 percent of companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500
index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Kindler finishes at a low point: Pfizer''s 2010 price-
earnings ratio was 7.3 as of Dec. 3, the last day of trading
before Kindler stepped down, lower than the annual average for
each year he''s been in charge. </p>
<p>During his time as CEO, Kindler faced some of the toughest
challenges of the industry, including the looming loss of
Lipitor and the failure of one of the company''s most promising
drugs, a cholesterol pill that was slated to replace Lipitor. </p>
<p>Torcetrapib Failure </p>
<p>Months after Kindler took the helm in 2006, Pfizer halted
development the cholesterol drug, called torcetrapib, after the
drug failed to benefit patients in a study. To cut costs since,
Kindler has fired more than 14,000 workers, closed research labs
and manufacturing plants. </p>
<p>They''re a big company and it takes a lot to turn this
ship, said David Maris, a New York-based health care analyst
at CLSA, a unit of Credit Agricole SA, in an interview. While
we think Kindler was doing a good job, investor frustration was
rising, mostly over the stock price. </p>
<p>The board has publicly supported the purchase of Wyeth in
2009 for $68 billion, as well as Kindler''s cost-cutting
measures. Read takes over the CEO''s job as the company prepares
to face generic competition to its top-selling cholesterol
treatment Lipitor, which had $11.4 billion in sales last year. </p>
<p>While the drugmaker moved to make up for the expected
losses under Kindler by acquiring Wyeth, it also has had four
setbacks this year in developing its experimental drug pipeline. </p>
<p>Kindler served as CEO and chairman. The board will elect a
new chairman, separating the two roles, at a meeting within two
weeks, the company said in its Dec. 3 statement. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. paid New York City a
$24.7 million penalty, twice the tax incentives the drugmaker
received for expanding its headquarters in the city, after
relocating some corporate offices and transferring hundreds of
jobs to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, city officials said. </p>
<p>The company had stopped receiving benefits under a deal
intended to lure companies. In November it refunded double the
amount it got in the form of abated taxes and other incentives,
said David Lombino, spokesman for the city Economic Development
Corp. Pfizer''s chief executive officer, Jeffrey Kindler,
resigned yesterday, according to a person familiar with the
process. </p>
<p>Pfizer reduced headcount at its East 42nd Street
headquarters to 3,837 as of the June 30 end of its fiscal year
from a peak of more than 6,500, Lombino said. The city and
company first struck a deal in 2003, when the company employed
about 5,300 in New York. Pfizer officials requested more
incentives in 2005, he said. </p>
<p>The city has recovered the value of the benefits offered
through the agreement and a penalty based on the staff reduction
resulting from Pfizer''s global reorganization, Lombino said in
an e-mail. Any reduction is unfortunate, but Pfizer is
maintaining its worldwide headquarters and a major presence in
New York City and it remains an important and valued part of the
local economy. </p>
<p>The company moved staff to facilities in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania after its 2009 merger with Wyeth, said a Pfizer
spokeswoman, Joan Campion. </p>
<p>We''re maintaining our global headquarters in New York
City, Campion said in a phone interview. Pfizer''s primary
care, oncology, emerging markets and established products units
will remain based in the city, she said. </p>
<p>The Economic Development Corp. is part of the
administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority
owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s chief executive officer
Jeffrey Kindler left the top post at the world''s biggest
drugmaker yesterday after the company''s stock underperformed its
rivals over the 4 1/2 years of his tenure. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s price-earnings ratio for the past year is lower
than 91 percent of pharmaceutical industry peers and below 97
percent of companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Kindler, 55, finishes
at a low point; Pfizer''s price-earnings ratio in 2010 is 7.3,
lower than the annual average for each year he''s been in charge. </p>
<p>The stock has dropped 35 percent since Kindler was named
CEO just prior to a 2006 announcement that Pfizer''s most
promising compound, the torcetrapib cholesterol pill, failed to
help patients in a study. The company had spent $1 billion to
develop the drug. Pfizer bought Wyeth in 2009 for $68 billion to
add products to overcome lost sales when the Lipitor cholesterol
pill, with $11.4 billion in sales, faces generic competition. </p>
<p>Investors have not been happy about the stock price,
said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak  Co.
in New York, in a telephone interview. Could he have done
better? Yeah. He could have focused on buying more innovative,
smaller companies. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 9 cents to $16.81 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock had dropped 9.6 percent in
the 12 months before today. </p>
<p>Read''s New Role </p>
<p>Kindler''s successor as chief, Ian C. Read, first joined
Pfizer as an operations auditor in 1978, and has been the head
of the global biopharmaceutical operations since 2006. Read, 57,
must convince investors that the company can continue to
internally develop innovative drugs with billions in annual
sales, Funtleyder said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s most promising experimental drugs include a pill
for rheumatoid arthritis called tasocitinib and a treatment
called crizotinib for a segment of patients with lung cancer.
The drugs combined will have sales of about $2.3 billion by
2016, according to two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Pfizer is
also partnering with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on an experimental
blood thinner called apixaban. </p>
<p>Kindler''s forte was not the pharmaceutical landscape, and
I think with Ian Read, you get a pharmaceutical lifer, said
Manoj Garg, an analyst at Soleil Securities Corp. </p>
<p>Funtleyder and Garg said the change should be viewed
favorably by investors. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s drug for leukemia
wasn''t better than Novartis AG''s treatment Gleevec after a year,
a study found. </p>
<p>The Pfizer drug, bosutinib, didn''t cut the amount of a
tell-tale protein of the cancer in the blood better than
Gleevec, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Bosutinib treats chronic myeloid leukemia, a slow-
progressing cancer that causes bone marrow to produce too many
white cells. The study was the third of three stages of testing
usually required by the U.S. for regulatory approval. </p>
<p>The study followed 502 people, who previously hadn''t been
treated, who received either Gleevec or bosutinib for a year.
The trial is continuing. </p>
<p>Fewer patients who took bosutinib progressed to an advanced
phase of the disease, and fewer died, according to the study.
Almost 40 percent of people treated with bosutinib experienced a
major molecular response, meaning that markers of bad blood
cells were reduced at least 1,000-fold. That compares with 26
percent of people treated with Gleevec. </p>
<p>Pfizer said on Dec. 3 that it planned to submit bosutinib
for regulatory approval in 2011. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest computer-services provider, sold $1
billion of debt due January 2016, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>IBM issued the notes four months after selling $1.5 billion
of debt due 2013 at the lowest interest rate on record at the
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Moody''s Investors
Service upgraded the senior unsecured rating of IBM''s debt one
level to Aa3 from A1 last month, citing a growing emphasis on
higher-margin software and services. </p>
<p>The transition from a server-production-based company to
a service-based company has been valuable towards their credit
improvement, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist and
economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. And
the rating upgrade certainly helped them price a little tighter
than they would have otherwise. </p>
<p>The company plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions by 2015 as it aims to almost double operating
earnings per share. Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is
investing in analytics software and services that help predict
trends, as well as cloud computing, which helps customers save
money by letting them store and access data via the Internet
rather than from their own servers. </p>
<p>Issue Details </p>
<p>The 2 percent notes pay 55 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show, and yield 2.07
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Absolute yields on investment-grade debt have declined
seven basis points to 3.989 percent since IBM''s previous debt
sale on Aug. 2, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s
U.S. Corporate Master Index. Yields fell as low as 3.53 percent
on Nov. 4, the lowest yield since the index began in October
1986. </p>
<p>The offering is very tight even for a high investment-
grade offering and shows the strength of demand within the
credit markets right now, LeBas said in a telephone interview.
There''s a lot of high-quality cash chasing limited investment
opportunities right now. </p>
<p>IBM''s 1 percent debt maturing August 2013 traded at 99.778
cents on Dec. 3 to yield 1.085 percent, or 30.4 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The notes were sold at a spread of 30 basis points. </p>
<p>The company, which has completed 16 acquisitions this year,
ended the third quarter with more than $11 billion in cash and
short-term investments, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest computer-services provider, plans to
sell $1 billion of debt due January 2016 as soon as today,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. </p>
<p>IBM is marketing the notes four months after selling $1.5

at the time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and two
weeks after Moody''s Investors Service upgraded the senior

<p>The Moody''s upgrade is a good reason to expect relatively
tight spreads on the new offering, said Guy LeBas, chief
fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia. In terms of spread, we could actually see
it being priced a little tighter than in August. </p>
<p>Issue Details </p>
<p>The offering may yield 55 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, said the person familiar with the offering,
who declined to be identified because terms aren''t set. That
implies a yield of about 2.10 percent, based on today''s Treasury
bond prices. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Absolute yields on investment-grade debt have declined
seven basis points to 3.989 percent since Aug. 2, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s U.S. Corporate Master Index,
after earlier touching 3.53 percent on Nov. 4, the lowest yield

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest computer-service provider, is adding
analytics to its information-technology services to attract more
customers and spur sales in its largest division. </p>
<p>The company will use analytics to predict clients'' long-
term costs of running different computer systems, Steve Sams,
IBM''s head of data center services, said in an interview last
week. Sams will make the announcement today at the Gartner Data
Center Conference in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>Signings for services, which make up almost 60 percent of
the company''s total revenue, have slipped for three straight
quarters as companies put off spending on larger projects. The
analytics will help IBM win contracts by demonstrating cost
savings of its technology and help current customers to
determine where to invest in data centers, Sams said. </p>
<p>Their budgets clearly are not going up -- if anything,
they''re flat or going down, Sams said of customers. They''re
finding it increasingly challenging to keep up with changes. </p>
<p>The new analytics show clients how much it would cost to
invest in various technologies -- consolidating data centers or
upgrading servers, for example -- and how that would impact
long-term costs, such as power consumption, space requirements
and future upgrades, Sams said. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has invested more than $14
billion in analytics acquisitions, including last year''s $1.2
billion purchase of SPSS Inc., as it bets the ability to predict
trends will help clients save money and boost sales. Analytics
software and services will add about $16 billion to IBM''s
revenue by 2015, the company said in May. </p>

<p>Jeffrey Kindler resigned as Pfizer
Inc.''s chief executive officer after he refused to name a head
of operations as part of a plan agreed to by senior managers in
September, said a person familiar with the proceedings. </p>
<p>Kindler, 55, quit hours before a special board meeting was
scheduled on Dec. 5 to discuss his future, the person said. Ian C. Read, 57, was named to replace him. Senior executives had
agreed Read should be named chief operating officer, said two
people who asked not to be named because the deliberations were
private. That appointment never happened. </p>
<p>Kindler in recent months lost support of executives
frustrated with his management style, one of the people said.
While New York-based Pfizer faces complex policy decisions,
Kindler was focused on smaller matters and micromanaging his
executives, according to the person. Kindler, whose retirement
was effective immediately, didn''t return calls to his home. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drug company, has been dealing
with the U.S. health-care overhaul, lawsuits from shareholders
alleging that senior executives failed to stop illegal marketing
of drugs and a stock that underperformed its peers. The shares
dropped 35 percent since Kindler, formerly Pfizer''s general
counsel, was named CEO on July 28, 2006. </p>
<p>Investors have not been happy about the stock price,
said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak  Co.
in New York, in a telephone interview. Could he have done
better? Yeah. He could have focused on buying more innovative,
smaller companies. </p>
<p>Succession Plan </p>
<p>In September, senior executives at Pfizer attended a
meeting to discuss a succession plan, one of the people said.
During that session, they decided Read would be named chief
operating officer, expanding his responsibilities as a candidate
to become the next CEO, the person said. </p>
<p>Pfizer spokesman Ray Kerins declined to comment on the
board''s deliberations. Pfizer declined to make Read available. </p>
<p>Read, a 32-year veteran of the company, has been head of
Pfizer''s global pharmaceutical operations since 2006,
controlling 85 percent of revenue. Read''s management style is
well-known to Pfizer director and former CEO William C. Steere
since Read ran operations in Latin America and Europe while
Steere headed the company from 1991 to 2000. </p>
<p>Steere didn''t return calls for comment. Constance J. Horner, a board member, cited Read''s experience in emerging
markets in the company statement announcing the change. </p>
<p>Focus and Commitment'' </p>
<p>Read has brought to product development a focus and
commitment to advance only medicines that have clear value to
our customers, Horner said in the statement. Today''s
business leaders need to understand global markets, drive change
and innovation, and move quickly to adapt to competitive
pressures. Ian''s track record throughout his career has
demonstrated these exact strengths. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 4 cents, or less than a percent, to $16.77 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock exchange composite trading. The
stock declined 7.8 percent since the start of the year. </p>
<p>Pfizer has underperformed its rivals over the 4 1/2 years
of Kindler''s tenure. Pfizer''s price-earnings ratio for the past
year is lower than 91 percent of pharmaceutical industry peers
and below 97 percent of companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500
index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Kindler finished at a low point: Pfizer''s 2010 price-
earnings ratio was 7.3 as of Dec. 3, the last day of trading
before Kindler stepped down, lower than the annual average for
each year he has been in charge. </p>
<p>Toughest Challenges </p>
<p>During his time as CEO, Kindler faced some of the toughest
challenges of the industry, including the looming loss of
Lipitor''s patent protection and the failure of one of the
company''s most promising drugs, a cholesterol pill that was
slated to replace Lipitor, the world''s best-selling medicine. </p>
<p>Months after Kindler took the helm in 2006, Pfizer halted
development of the cholesterol drug, torcetrapib, after the pill
failed to benefit patients in a study. To cut costs since,
Kindler has fired more than 14,000 workers and closed research
labs and manufacturing plants. </p>
<p>They''re a big company and it takes a lot to turn this
ship, said David Maris, a New York-based health care analyst
at CLSA, a unit of Credit Agricole SA, in an interview. While
we think Kindler was doing a good job, investor frustration was
rising, mostly over the stock price. </p>
<p>Wyeth Purchase </p>
<p>The board publicly supported the purchase of Wyeth in 2009
for $68 billion, as well as Kindler''s cost-cutting measures.
Read takes over the CEO''s job as the company prepares to face
generic competition to its top-selling cholesterol treatment
Lipitor, which had $11.4 billion in sales last year. </p>
<p>Over the next five years, Pfizer faces generic competition
to products with $20 billion in annual sales, or almost a third
of the company''s annual revenue. While the drugmaker moved to
make up for the expected losses under Kindler by acquiring
Wyeth, it also has had five setbacks this year in developing its
experimental drug pipeline. </p>
<p>In March, the company said its experimental Alzheimer''s
drug Dimebon, which analysts said could have generated $5
billion in annual sales, failed to help patients in a late-stage
test. That same month, Sutent, approved for kidney and stomach
cancers, failed in two studies to shrink breast tumors, and the
experimental drug figitumumab didn''t help lung cancer patients. </p>
<p>Trial Halted </p>
<p>Last month, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. halted a
trial of their experimental blood thinner, apixaban, after an
increase in bleeding outweighed benefits for patients who
recently suffered a heart attack or severe chest pain. The
treatment was being tested to prevent heart complications in
patients with a condition known as acute coronary syndrome. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s bosutinib treatment for leukemia wasn''t better
than Novartis AG''s treatment Gleevec after a year, the company
reported yesterday. The Pfizer-funded study of 502 patients is
continuing. </p>
<p>Kindler served as both CEO and chairman. The board will
elect a new chairman, separating the two roles, at a meeting
within two weeks, the company said in its statement. </p>
<p>Pfizer also said on Dec. 5 it was creating a $75 million
fund and new compliance panel to settle shareholders'' lawsuits
that charge top company officials failed to stop illegal
marketing of drugs. Pfizer last year paid $2.3 billion to settle
U.S. claims it marketed treatments for unapproved purposes. </p>
<p>Including invested dividends, Pfizer''s stock has declined
20 percent since Kindler was named CEO on July 28, 2006,
compared with a return of 10 percent for the SP 500
Pharmaceutical Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Pfizer halved its dividend after the Wyeth acquisition. </p>
<p>The dividend will probably increase by 10 percent a year
through 2013, from 72 cents to about $1, Barbara Ryan, an
analyst with Deutsche Bank in New York, said yesterday in a note
to clients. She said Read''s appointment was a logical one,
bringing strong operational expertise and experience to the
job. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp.''s search partnership
with Yahoo! Inc. is working better than we could have hoped
and the company is more confident that the accord will boost the
prices paid for search terms, an executive said. </p>
<p>The arrangement, whereby Microsoft''s Bing handles the
mechanics of Web search and Yahoo oversees advertising sales, is
exceeding expectations, Charles Songhurst, Microsoft''s general
manager of corporate strategy, said today at a conference for
investors. </p>
<p>Yahoo began depending on Bing''s technology earlier this
year to cut costs and gain market share. Google Inc.''s Web
search lead helps it make more money per search because
advertisers are willing to pay for wider distribution. Google
had 66 percent of the U.S. market in October, said Comscore
Inc., while Microsoft and Yahoo combined for 28 percent. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, struck the search
accord after it failed in an attempt to buy Yahoo. </p>
<p>Songhurst, whose official bio lists accomplishments
including, helping kill the acquisition of Yahoo ($48 billion
saved) and negotiating the agreement to partner with Yahoo
instead, was speaking at a Nasdaq conference in London. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 3 cents to $26.87 as of 4 p.m. New York time

California, gained 61 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $16.94. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. said it will add
features to its Internet Explorer browser that let users better
protect their privacy online by creating Do Not Call lists
for the Internet. </p>
<p>Internet Explorer 9 will bar listed websites from tracking
what users do on the Web, said Dean Hachamovitch, a Microsoft
vice president who''s in charge of Internet Explorer. The
controls also impose limits on what content blocked sites can
display to users. </p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission called for a
do-not-track option for browsing and pressed advertisers to make
data practices clearer for users. Currently advertisers record
consumers'' movements on the Internet and compile a profile of
their interests to better target ads. Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said its move to add the tools will help drive
discussions on the FTC request. </p>
<p>The so-called Tracking Protection features will be in the
near-final version of Internet Explorer 9, which will be
available early next year. A test version without these features
already has been released. </p>
<p>Anyone can create tracking lists and share them with users
who want to adopt that list. Users can install multiple lists
and also designate any Web pages on those lists as safe if they
do want to exchange information with those sites. </p>
<p>Aggregated Content </p>
<p>Many websites display content aggregated from several other
sites. If a user blocks a site, that site''s content also won''t
show up when the user visits a permitted site that happens to
display information from the banned one. </p>
<p>Online advertising revenue swelled to $12.1 billion in the
first half of 2010, up 11 percent from the same period a year
earlier, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. </p>
<p>While Microsoft''s Internet Explorer is the most popular
browser with 58 percent of the market, it has been losing
considerable share to Mozilla Corp.''s Firefox and Google Inc.''s
Chrome, according to Net Applications, which tracks Internet
usage statistics. Firefox has 23 percent and Chrome has 9.3
percent. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is offering
U.S. home-loan bonds without government backing to investors
after acquiring about $6 billion in a single trade this month,
according to three people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The most-profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
won bidding for the debt after a limited competition that also
included Morgan Stanley, according to the people who declined to
be identified because the transaction was private. State Street
Corp. sold the notes, possibly on behalf of a customer, the
people said. </p>
<p>The purchase is a sign the largest brokers, which mostly
stopped making markets in the bonds as the global financial
crisis peaked in 2008, are being emboldened to carry bigger
inventories after values soared and buying and selling revived. </p>
<p>That would be a massive trade, an attention-getter,
said David Castillo, senior managing director at San Francisco-
based broker Further Lane Securities. There''s liquidity in the
market and a tremendous amount of cash that''s looking to be put
to work, though going into yearend, everybody wants to buy
cheaply. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan
Stanley, also in New York, and Carolyn Cichon, a spokeswoman for
Boston-based State Street, didn''t return messages. </p>
<p>Brokers last month conducted open auctions for almost $14
billion of home-loan bonds lacking guarantees from government-
supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae or federal agency Ginnie
Mae, according to Empirasign Strategies LLC. Since the start of
July, the amount of securities offered through the process has
totaled $75 billion, with at least $11.5 billion failing to be
sold, according to the New York-based data provider. </p>
<p>Most Profitable </p>
<p>Outstanding debt in the market, which grew as large as $2.3
trillion in 2007, totals about $1.3 trillion, according to
Federal Reserve data. </p>
<p>The securities, among the largest causes of the $1.8
trillion of writedowns and credit losses at the world''s largest
financial firms during the global crisis, have been among the
most profitable debt investments over the past year. </p>
<p>Some of the bonds returned about 16 percent, while fixed-
rate subprime-mortgages securities gained more than 24 percent
through November, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. won a contract to

<p>The federal agency will move 120,000 users to the company''s

Washington-based Microsoft. The company said it beat out Google

<p>Technology companies are racing to lure customers that want

<p>The department chose Microsoft because half its workers
already use Microsoft''s Exchange e-mail software, Chris Smith,
chief information officer for the Agriculture Department, said
in an interview. Because cloud programs are typically stored on
the provider''s server, customers can save money on machines and
the cost of maintaining and updating the software. </p>

<p>Visa Europe Ltd., operator of the
largest payment-card network in the 27-nation European Union,
will reduce debit-card transaction fees paid by retailers as
part of a deal to end EU antitrust action. </p>
<p>The European Commission will drop its investigation into
debit-card charges after Visa Europe promised in April to
significantly cut fees to 0.2 percent of a purchase, the
agency said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Lower inter-bank fees will trigger real benefits for
merchants and consumers whilst more transparent rules will also
improve competition in the cards market, said Joaquin Almunia,
the EU''s competition commissioner. </p>
<p>Visa Europe, which split from Visa Inc. before the U.S.
card company''s initial public offering in early 2008, will
reduce fees for transactions worth as much as 20 billion euros
($26.5 billion) every year, Almunia said. MasterCard Inc. agreed
to reduce debit card fees to the same rate last year. </p>
<p>The so-called interchange fee, based on Visa Europe''s
guidelines, is paid by a retailer''s bank to the bank that issued
a customer''s card. Visa Europe, owned by more than 4,000
European banks, said the new rate would cut the fees concerned
by less than 20 percent. </p>
<p>EuroCommerce, a group representing stores including
Carrefour SA, the world''s second biggest retailer, and Tesco
Plc, said it was dismayed because the settlement will do
little to remove the burden of interchange fees from Europe''s
retailers and consumers. </p>
<p>Separate Probe </p>
<p>Visa Europe said it hoped to reach an agreed outcome on
a separate EU probe into fees for credit-card and deferred-debit
transactions, where customers must settle their bills at the end
of the month. </p>
<p>Out of 400 million Visa-branded cards in Europe, about 280
million are debit cards, said Simon Kleine, a spokesman for Visa
Europe, in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Almunia said the 0.2 percent rate was chosen as the level
where merchants have no preference whether consumers pay with a
Visa debit card or with cash. </p>
<p>Visa Europe, based in London, said the agreement may allow
the average 0.2 percent fee to be revised if further data
becomes available on the cost of different means of payment,
including cash. </p>
<p>Under its legally binding deal with the EU, Visa Europe
promised to reduce the maximum interchange fee for four years in
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Sweden,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Visa Europe will also publish
fee amounts and allow retailers to choose whether to accept its
various debit cards. The company can be fined by regulators if
it violates the deal. </p>
<p>MasterCard settled a similar case with the commission last
year, agreeing to reduce the interchange fee to 0.3 percent of a
transaction''s cost for credit cards and 0.2 percent for debit
cards. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley and other underwriters
on the Treasury Department''s sale of 2.4 billion Citigroup Inc.
shares will collect $42.3 million of fees from the U.S. bank. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley as lead manager handled 87 percent of the
stock sales, while a team of 13 co-managers including Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, UBS AG and Wells Fargo  Co. handled the
rest, according to a regulatory filing by New York-based
Citigroup today.  </p>
<p>We were pleased with Morgan Stanley and the role they
played, David Miller, chief investment officer of the
Treasury''s Troubled Asset Relief Program, said yesterday in an
interview. The Treasury booked a $6.85 billion profit on its
share sales. </p>
<p>Citigroup, whose $45 billion bailout in 2008 was the
biggest among U.S. banks, has had to shower competitors with
investment-banking fees this year as the government sold its
stakes and kept Citigroup out of the fee pool to steer clear of
conflicts of interest. In October, Citigroup had to pay rival
firms $55.7 million for underwriting the Treasury''s sale of $2.2
billion of trust-preferred securities. </p>
<p>This week''s sale, which raised $10.5 billion for the
Treasury, was the biggest U.S. offering of the year for a stock
already trading, boosting Morgan Stanley''s ranking among
underwriters while eroding Citigroup''s market share, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest U.S. stock sale of
the year was General Motors Co.''s $18.1 billion initial public
offering in November, where Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were
among nine lead managers. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets,  said it has received all required
regulatory approvals forthe sale of its 34.3 percent holding in
China International Capital Corp., clearing the way for the
stake''s sale to four investors. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley expects to realize a pretax gain of about
$700 million upon consummation of the transaction, whichis
expected to close before the end of 2010, the New York-based
bank said today in a statement. Morgan Stanley is selling the
stake to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co., TPG Capital, Great
Eastern Holdings Ltd. and a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund. </p>
<p>The sale will end Morgan Stanley''s 15-year involvement in
CICC, the first Sino-foreign investment bank and the top-ranked
underwriter of share sales in the country. The U.S. firm, which
ceded management control of CICC a decade ago, plans to form a
partnership with Shenzhen-based China Fortune Securities Co. </p>
<p>Given the impressive economic and market developments and
business opportunities, China remains acritical part of Morgan
Stanley''s global strategy, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman said in the statement. Our focus now is
to further expand our domestic market platform and
capabilities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley plans to sell stakes of about 10 percent
each to TPG and KKR, and about a 5 percent stake to Singapore''s
Great Eastern, the insurer controlled by Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp., four people with direct knowledge of the deal said
earlier this month. Government of Singapore Investment Corp.
will buy the remainder, the people said. The 34.3 percent stake
is valued at about $1 billion, two of the people said. </p>
<p>Pivotal Role'' </p>
<p>CICC has played a pivotal role in the development of
China''s financial industry, the investors said in a separate
joint statement. As China takes an ever more prominent
position in the world''s financial markets, CICC has the
potential to become a leading financial institution
internationally. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s application for a planned joint venture
with China Fortune Securities Co. was accepted by the China
Securities Regulatory Commission on Nov. 30, according to a
filing on the watchdog''s website. The CSRC said it gave its
first feedback on the application on Dec. 2, and hasn''t set a
decision date. </p>
<p>It''s Morgan Stanley''s second attempt to dispose of the
holding in CICC. Talks with leveraged-buyout firms fell apart in
early 2008 on disagreements about price, according to a South
China Morning Post report at the time. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley invested $35 million in CICC when it was
established in 1995. It ceded management control in 2000 and
CICC is now run by Levin Zhu, the son of former Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji. Singapore''s GIC also bought CICC shares in 1995 and
has been one of the founding shareholders, according to CICC''s
website. </p>

country''s economy and the rupee. He spoke at a press event in
Mumbai today. </p>
<p>India''s rupee fell today, snapping a six-day winning streak,
as a move by the U.S. to extend tax cuts to boost growth in the
world''s largest economy reduced the allure of higher-yielding
currencies. </p>
<p>We are expecting growth to continue to be strong next
year. Our forecast is 8.7 percent on gross domestic product
growth for the financial year ending March 2012 and this is
being driven by investment demand. </p>
<p>We are looking at 8.3 percent growth for the financial
year that ends March 31, he said. </p>
<p>On inflation: </p>
<p>We are looking at an average number of 6 percent for the
next fiscal year. </p>
<p>On interest rates and central bank policy: </p>
<p>With inflation expectations high, asset prices rising,
and with high fiscal and current account deficits, we think that
the Reserve Bank of India will have to hike interest rates
through the course of 2011. We are expecting them to hike by a
100 basis points next calendar year. </p>
<p>On currency: </p>
<p>We have revised our currency forecasts. We are looking at
a 44 rupee target over 12 months with a three-month target of
45. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, said former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Kindler
will receive about $9.6 million in severance, bonus and short-
term incentive pay for 2010. </p>
<p>The payment includes $4.51 million for severance and $5.05
million in awards for 2010 performance. Kindler also will get
retirement pay valued at about $6.9 million, the New York-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. All of Kindler''s
stock and short-term awards may be recovered by Pfizer within a
year if he engages in an activity harmful to the company,
New York-based Pfizer said in the filing. </p>
<p>Pfizer underperformed its rivals over the 4 1/2 years of
Kindler''s tenure. The stock dropped 35 percent under his
leadership, and the company''s price-earnings ratio for the past
year is lower than 91 percent of pharmaceutical industry peers
and below 97 percent of companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500
index. </p>
<p>Kindler resigned Dec. 5 and was replaced as Pfizer CEO by
Ian C. Read, 57. Read''s pay hasn''t been determined, according to
the filing. Kinder in recent months lost support of executives
frustrated with his management style, according to a person
familiar with the proceedings who asked not to be named because
the deliberations were private. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy producer, will boost capital spending by 20 percent
to $26 billion next year, devoting more of its budget to finding
and pumping oil and natural gas. </p>
<p>Under the spending program, $22.6 billion, or 87 percent,
of the capital budget will go to exploration and production, the
San Ramon, California-based company said in a statement today.
Another $2.9 billion, or 11 percent, will fund work on its
refineries, pipelines and fuel sales units. </p>
<p>The proportion of its budget Chevron invests in finding and
producing oil and gas, known as the upstream business, has risen
from 77 percent of spending in 2008. Crude oil futures prices
have averaged $78.97 a barrel this year in New York, 27 percent
more than last year''s average price. </p>
<p>We are more heavily weighted in upstream because the
returns in the sector are stronger over time, Kurt Glaubitz, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Chevron expects to pump the average equivalent of 2.75
million barrels of crude a day this year, according to company

<p>The budget includes spending for gas projects in western
Australia and deep-water exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico

<p>Chevron rose 51 cents to $86.65 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock

<p>Fixing the culture will require creating a compensation
system that better aligns or balances shareholders'' interests

interests, and changing the perception that it''s the individual
that''s the hero, Gorman, 52, said in November. As an
industry, we can have larger-than-life personalities, but
individuals don''t make institutions. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s breast-cancer drug
Aromasin and similar treatments from AstraZeneca Plc and
Novartis AG make women 26 percent more likely to develop heart
disease than an older therapy, a study found. </p>
<p>The trial, presented today at the San Antonio Breast Cancer
Symposium in Texas, suggests that women already at risk for
cardiac conditions should limit use of these drugs, researchers
said. Tamoxifen, a generic alternative approved in 1977, carries
less risk of heart complications, the study found. </p>
<p>Aromasin, AstraZeneca''s Arimidex, and Femara from Novartis,
are in a family of medicines known as aromatase inhibitors that
work by halting production of estrogen, a hormone that fuels
cancer growth. These drugs generated more than $3.5 billion last
year, often used after tamoxifen, which prevents tumor cells
from using estrogen. Two thirds of all breast-cancers are fed by
estrogen, according to the National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>It appears that aromatase inhibitors have a significant
increase in cardiotoxic side effects, such as heart attack,
angina and heart failure, said Eitan Amir, a senior fellow in
oncology and hematology at the Princess Margaret Hospital in
Toronto, in a statement. Switching drugs may reduce the side
effects. </p>
<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women,
killing almost 433,000 annually, according to the American Heart
Association. An estimated 209,000 women will be diagnosed with
breast cancer this year, making it the most common tumor type in
women, according to the American Cancer Society. More than
40,000 women die from it each year. </p>
<p>Heart, Fracture Risk </p>
<p>Women who took aromatase inhibitors were 26 percent more
likely to have heart disease and 47 percent more likely to
suffer a fracture than those on tamoxifen, regardless of how
long they took the medicine, an analysis of seven studies used
to win approval of the drugs found. The research was conducted
in older, post-menopausal women with early breast cancer.
Patients on tamoxifen were more likely to develop endometrial
cancer and dangerous blood clots in the legs during the studies.
There was a suggestion that women who switched to aromatase
inhibitors after starting on tamoxifen were less likely to die
from something other than breast cancer than those who started
treatment with the medicines. The approach didn''t seem to reduce
the risk of serious side effects, the researchers said. </p>
<p>Drug Sales </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, reported revenue of $483 million
from Aromasin last year. London-based AstraZeneca had sales of
$1.92 billion for Arimidex. Novartis, of Basel, Switzerland,
generated $1.27 billion from Femara in 2009. </p>
<p>A second study today found Pfizer''s Aromasin worked as well
as AstraZeneca''s Arimidex, the market leader with $1.9 billion
in sales last year. The researchers originally hypothesized that
Aromasin, currently used a second-line therapy, may be more
effective with fewer side effects than Arimidex. They conducted
the first head-to-head comparison of the medicines to identify
any differences. </p>
<p>More than 7,500 women participated in the study, which was
funded by the National Cancer Institute in the U.S. and the
International Breast Cancer Study Group in Europe. Women taking
Aromasin were less likely to have osteoporosis and elevated
cholesterol levels, and had higher rates of mood changes and
signs of reduced liver function. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. raised its
dividend for the second time in five months, giving investors a
17 percent boost as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt
unlocks a war chest of cash hoarded in the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The quarterly payout will jump to 14 cents from 12 cents,
after climbing from 10 cents in July, GE said today. The dual
increases are GE''s first in a single year since 1992. </p>
<p>Strong cash generation, accelerated recovery at GE
Capital and solid underlying performance in our industrial
businesses drove the decision, Immelt said in a statement. </p>
<p>The higher dividend, payable Jan. 25 to shareholders of
record on Dec. 27, marks a return to GE''s pattern of announcing
annual increases in the fourth quarter, which the company did
from 1983 through 2007. In February 2009, GE cut its quarterly
dividend to 10 cents from 31 cents, about 68 percent, as the
recession deepened. </p>
<p>The increase takes GE''s prospective dividend yield to 3.2
percent, higher than its multi-industry peers, Nigel Coe, a New
York-based analyst with Deutsche Bank AG wrote in a note to
clients. </p>
<p>Dividend yield is not to be sneezed at in a yield-starved
environment, wrote Coe, who has a hold rating on the
shares. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
makes the most from equity trading of all Wall Street banks, is
losing the head of a unit that invests in securities exchanges
and two senior executives from its London equities division. </p>
<p>Phillip Hylander, 42, who leads the Principal Strategic
Investment Group, will step down at the end of the year,
according to a Dec. 8 memorandum sent to employees and obtained
by Bloomberg News. He will become an advisory director to the
firm on retirement, according to the document. </p>
<p>Matthew H. Cyzer, head of sales trading in Europe, and John A. Ashdown, 42, head of trading in the region, are retiring,
said a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be
identified because the departures haven''t been publicly
announced. Cyzer and Hylander joined Goldman Sachs from Deutsche
Bank AG in 2002. While Hylander joined the firm as a partner,
the New York-based firm''s highest rank, Cyzer and Ashdown were
promoted to the position in 2004. </p>
<p>These guys have been doing it for a while, they''ve had
enough time to raise and grow people beneath them, said Jason Kennedy, chief executive officer of Kennedy Group, a London-
based executive search firm. Those who have made enough to
retire like Hylander and Ashdown are seeing a good reason to
step down. </p>
<p>Falling Revenue </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s revenue from equities sales and trading
dropped 32 percent to $5.43 billion in the first nine months of
this year, in part because the firm lost money in the second
quarter on a bet that stock-market volatility would drop. The
firm this year also shut down a proprietary-trading division
within equities, called principal strategies, in response to
U.S. legislation that prohibits banks from making such bets with
their own money. </p>
<p>Equities revenue at the largest eight Wall Street firms
dropped an average of 12 percent so far this year, meaning that
pay is likely to suffer and hiring plans have been frozen,
according to Kennedy. </p>
<p>We''re very similar to 2008 this year on the equities
side, Kennedy said. Nobody has budgets for next year. </p>
<p>Ashdown and Hylander weren''t immediately available to
comment. Cyzer declined to comment. Sophie Bullock, a
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London, declined to comment. </p>
<p>One Delta </p>
<p>Ashdown''s formal title was head of One Delta Trading for
Equities, Europe, while Cyzer was co-head of One Delta Execution
Services in Europe. One Delta is the name of Goldman Sachs''s
equities division, which excludes derivatives. </p>
<p>Hylander, who joined as co-head of pan-European shares,
became head of One Delta as well as co-head of European equities
in 2006 before switching to his current role a year later. The
Principal Strategic Investment Group employs about 20 people
around the world, according to a person familiar with the
matter. </p>
<p>Successors for Hylander, Cyzer and Ashdown weren''t named.
The bank said in a July memo that Brian Levine would move to
London from New York in his role of co-chief operating officer
of Equities One Delta Trading. </p>
<p>The two memos were signed by David B. Heller, Edward K. Eisler, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz, the firm''s four
co-heads of securities sales and trading. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. used a government
rescue to transform into an agile business determined not to
repeat its past, Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson said. </p>
<p>Bankruptcy once was unthinkable for GM, which had half the
U.S. auto market, Akerson said in a speech today at the Economic
Club of Washington. We are humbled by our near-death
experience, he said. </p>
<p>GM restructured its business in bankruptcy last year with
the help of a federal bailout before a $23.1 billion initial
public offering in November, cutting jobs, closing plants,
renegotiating labor agreements and decreasing the number of
dealers in its U.S. network. </p>
<p>Now that IPO is done, some key executives are leaving
because of government-imposed pay restraints, Akerson said. He
said he''d like to shift toward incentives and variable pay for
management. There won''t be increases in base salaries this year,
he said. </p>
<p>We have to be competitive, Akerson said. We''ve been
able to attract great people. We''re starting to lose them now. </p>
<p>The remaining government shares amount to about a third of
company ownership, Akerson said. Shares will have to sell in the
upper 40s or low 50s for taxpayers to break even, he said. </p>
<p>GM rose 15 cents to $33.89 at 11:28 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Besides cost structures, one of the challenges in turning
GM around has been a corporate culture resistant to change,
Akerson said. </p>
<p>Biggest Surprise </p>
<p>The biggest surprise after joining GM''s board was too
often things were done intuitively, he said. </p>
<p>It was anathema to GM culture to consider whether to
use another company''s engine, he said. Management had been
arrogant, he said. They underestimated foreign car companies and
their ability to make quality vehicles. </p>
<p>Citing his work in private equity before taking the CEO
post at the Detroit-based automaker in September, Akerson said
few investors would have bet on the company 18 months to 24
months ago. </p>
<p>Three weeks ago, people by the hundreds of thousands did
just that, Akerson said. They saw a new company positioned
to break even at the bottom of the market, not the middle. </p>
<p>GM sells more cars with its remaining four brands of

<p>JPMorgan Chase Bank NA is trying to
force a $1.55 billion Las Vegas-area development into
bankruptcy, saying affiliates of builders KB Home, Beazer Homes
USA Inc., and Toll Brothers Inc. mismanaged the project. </p>
<p>JPMorgan filed an involuntary bankruptcy in Las Vegas
yesterday accusing the three builders and five other investors
in South Edge LLC of employing a hostage-ransom strategy to
avoid liability for a $585 million loan. </p>
<p>A unit of KB Home owns 48 percent of South Edge, which
controls the 2,000-acre Inspirada residential and commercial
development in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, according to
court documents. The rest of South Edge is owned by the other
investors, including units of Toll Bros. and Beazer. </p>
<p>JPMorgan asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to appoint a
trustee to take control of South Edge and the project. The eight
owners are refusing to put $270 million into the project as they
promised, the bank said in court papers. </p>
<p>These insiders are sacrificing the project and
repudiating debtor''s obligations in a quest for great profits at
the expense of not only approximately 39 lenders to whom the
insiders seek to shift their losses, but also to the city of
Henderson, JPMorgan said in court papers filed yesterday. </p>
<p>Calls today to Los Angeles-based KB Home before business
hours; Toll Brothers, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania; and Beazer
Homes, based in Atlanta, weren''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>The case is in re South Edge LLC, 10-32968, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). </p>

<p>Three decades after Tron turned
cyberspace into a fantasy world, Walt Disney Co. is pitching the
3-D sequel to grownups with high-end merchandise such as a
$2,600 Rotenier necklace and $795 spiked sandals from Rousseau. </p>
<p>Disney has rewritten its marketing playbook for Tron:
Legacy, which opens Dec. 17, to reach fans old enough to
remember the 1982 original. Jewelry and shoes in particular, the
priciest items, reflect an effort to attract women. </p>
<p>The demographic we got to speak to for this film was a
young adult and the adult consumer who happened to be around
for the original, said Pamela Lifford, a Disney executive vice
president who oversaw development of the Tron fashion goods.
We knew we had to be creative. </p>
<p>With the haute-couture flourish, Disney''s marketing machine
is reaching beyond the core science-fiction and fantasy fans who
form the movie''s natural base. More than 6,000 people, mostly
younger men, crowded into the Comic-Con trade show at the San
Diego Convention Center in July for footage and talks by actor
Jeff Bridges and Tron: Legacy producer Sean Bailey. </p>
<p>Our thinking is to play a lot broader, said Bailey,
Disney''s president of production since January. We have the
digital whiz-bang wizardry that gets the men in. The No. 1 job
was to put a priority on story and emotion, boy meets girl. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. aims to attract more
users to its customer-relationship management software in 2011
than Salesforce.com Inc. and outpace its competitor in that
market for the first time. </p>
<p>We''re gunning for that, Michael Park, vice president of
Microsoft Business Solutions, said today in an interview. The
Redmond, Washington-based software giant is introducing a new
version of the relationship-management software next month,
helping to spur growth. Last year, Salesforce gained about
50,000 more new users than Microsoft, Park estimated. </p>
<p>Microsoft is trying to prize customers from Salesforce and
Oracle Corp. with updated software and a Don''t Get Forced
advertising campaign. Its earlier products weren''t capable
enough to warrant a big marketing push and were available only
in the U.S. and Canada, Park said. The new version will be
offered in 40 countries. </p>
<p>We needed to be more aggressive now that we have a
product we can stand behind, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft expects to pick off Oracle customers who are
unhappy with the software the company acquired from Siebel
Systems Inc. or the Fusion products designed to replace them,
Park said. </p>
<p>Carol Sato, a spokeswoman for Redwood City, California-
based Oracle, and Jane Hynes, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-
based Salesforce, didn''t immediately respond to a telephone call
and e-mail request for comment. </p>
<p>Decade-Old Push </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 10 cents to $27.25 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined 11
percent this year. Salesforce fell $4.73, or 3.2 percent, to
$143.88 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock has gained 95 percent this year. </p>
<p>The campaign is part of a push Microsoft started a decade
ago to get more sales from customer, accounting and finance
programs. The company initially predicted it would earn $10
billion in revenue annually from these products by this year.
It''s generating well north of a billion dollars in revenue a
year, short of that mark, Park said. </p>
<p>The company doesn''t break out revenue for that business in
quarterly reports and Park declined to specify. </p>
<p>The biggest customers for finance and accounting software
already have programs installed and don''t replace them often, he
said. Instead, Microsoft is targeting smaller businesses or
divisions of the larger firms that want less expensive options
than Oracle or Germany-based SAP AG. </p>
<p>While Dell Inc. uses Oracle for its main enterprise-
resource planning software, the company''s manufacturing and
assembly operations are installing Microsoft''s Dynamics ERP,
Park said. Dell expects to save $100 million as a result, he
said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, will raise its quarterly dividend 2 cents to 20 cents
a share, after cutting the payout to help fund its $68 billion
Wyeth acquisition. </p>
<p>The estimate fell short of the Bloomberg dividend forecast
of 21 cents. Pfizer, based in New York, also named George Lorch
board chairman, replacing Jeffrey Kindler, who resigned from his
positions as chairman and chief executive officer on Dec. 5,
according to a company statement. </p>
<p>Pfizer reduced its dividend in half to 16 cents in May 2009
to help pay for its Wyeth purchase. Pfizer raised its dividend
last December to 18 cents a share. The dividend may rise by
about 10 percent a year through 2013, Barbara Ryan, an analyst
with Deutsche Bank in New York, said in a Dec. 7 report. </p>
<p>Lorch, 68, has been a Pfizer director since 2000 and is

<p>Microsoft Corp. has joined a group
protesting Google Inc.''s $700 million acquisition of travel-
search company ITA Software Inc. </p>
<p>Microsoft said today it has become a member of
FairSearch.org, a coalition urging the U.S. Justice Department
to challenge Google''s purchase of the flight-search company. </p>
<p>The Justice Department in August extended its investigation
of whether the $700 million purchase, announced in July,
violates antitrust laws. </p>
<p>As an ITA Software customer, Microsoft''s ability to
continue providing innovative ways for consumers to find the
best flights at the lowest prices online rests on a competitive
market for travel technology, said Jack Evans, a spokesman for
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. </p>
<p>The software company is joining FairSearch.org to help
raise awareness of how the proposed Google-ITA merger could
hurt travelers by slowing innovation and contributing to higher
travel costs, Evans said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Google has pledged to honor all of ITA''s existing
agreements with travel websites. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s decision to oppose the ITA deal was no
surprise, said Adam Kovacevich, a Washington-based spokesman for
Google of Mountain View, California, </p>
<p>Microsoft is our largest competitor and lobbies
regulators against every acquisition we make, Kovacevich said
in an e-mailed statement. The ITA acquisition will provide
consumers with better flight search tools and more choices and
drive more traffic to travel websites, Kovacevich said. </p>
<p>Dominate, Manipulate'' </p>
<p>Acquisition of ITA by Google would give the owner of the
world''s more popular Internet search engine control over
software used by most of its rivals and may allow Google to
dominate and manipulate the market for online air travel,
FairSearch.org said today in an e-mailed statement on Microsoft
joining its efforts. </p>
<p>Other new members of FairSearch.org are Foundem, a U.K.-
based comparison-shopping service, Level...com, a French on-line
travel agency association based in Paris, and ZUJI, a Singapore-
based online travel service agency, according to the group. </p>
<p>FairSearch.org, founded in October, already counts Expedia
Inc., Kayak.com and Travelocity owner Sabre Holdings Corp. as
members. Travelocity owns ZUJI. </p>
<p>Among Google allies supporting the acquistion are Orbitz
Worldwide Inc. and Priceline.com Inc. </p>
<p>In September, independent software developers told the
House Judiciary Committee that they feared not getting fair
access to ITA''s flight-information software if Google buys the
company. </p>

<p>The Metropolitan Transportation
Authority''s Finance Committee added Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo
 Co. and Jefferies Group Inc. to a pool of banks that were
recommended to manage its bond sales. </p>
<p>The Finance Committee of the largest U.S. transit agency,
meeting in New York today, approved 10 investment banks that
will compete to manage $6.2 billion of new bonds for capital
projects in the next three years. The full board of the MTA will
vote on the underwriting pool on Dec. 15. </p>
<p>Last month, board members, including Doreen Frasca and New
York City Budget Director Mark Page, said a seven-member group
of banks was too small. The comments came after the agency''s
staff recommended JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays Plc, Citigroup
Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Siebert
Brandford Shank  Co. and Samuel A. Ramirez  Co. as senior
underwriters from a group of 27 applicants. </p>
<p>A larger group of senior managers, which includes several
firms not previously part of the senior manager pool, assures
MTA of access to a highly capable group of underwriting firms
that will assist MTA in the effective placement of both
variable-rate and fixed-rate bonds, a Finance Committee staff
summary said. </p>
<p>Based on figures from the MTA''s last bond sale in November,
the firms may earn $31 million in fees. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will manage the first-ever sale of securities
backed by a payroll tax in New York City and seven other
counties served by the agency, the transit agency said. The tax
was adopted as part of a 2009 bailout by the state Legislature. </p>
<p>Siebert Brandford and Samuel A. Ramirez are the first-ever
minority-owned firms to be selected as senior bond managers by
the MTA, according to staff. JPMorgan, Barclay''s and Citigroup
are in the authority''s current five-bank rotation, which was
chosen in 2006. </p>
<p>The agency averages about five bond issues per year,
Finance Director Patrick McCoy said last month. The Finance
Committee also approved 16 firms for a pool of co-managers. </p>
<p>The MTA solicited proposals from investment banks to serve
as bond underwriters and interest-rate swap counterparties in
June. Banks seeking to serve as senior managers were judged in
eight categories, including experience with the MTA, bond-
distribution capability and quality of financing ideas. </p>
<p>Build America Bonds </p>
<p>MTA Finance Committee members also approved selling $750
million of Build America Bonds before the federal program, which
subsidizes interest payments, is scheduled to expire on Dec. 31. </p>
<p>The MTA estimated its borrowing cost using taxable Build
America Bonds would be 4.65 percent, compared with 5.5 percent
using traditional tax-exempt bonds, said McCoy. </p>
<p>We think there''s liquidity to sell the bonds, McCoy
said today. The agency will use proceeds of the debt to pay for
capital projects. If it goes ahead with the sale, the MTA will
lower the amount of new debt it plans for next year to about
$900 million from $1.65 billion. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest computer-services provider, sold $1
billion of 18-month floating-rate notes in its first offering of
the securities in more than a year. </p>
<p>The notes yield 3 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, a lending benchmark for banks
that''s currently set at 0.302 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. IBM last sold floating-rate debt in
November 2009, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, tapped credit markets after
raising $1 billion through a sale of five-year notes a week ago.
Floating-rate debt tends to lose value when interest rates
decline because it pays less, while fixed-rate bonds become
relatively more attractive. Sales of floaters, which have
tumbled from the year''s $16.8 billion record in January, may
increase as interest rates climb, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. </p>
<p>There''s certainly demand for them out there, LeBas
said. The downside is in the current environment with Libor
trending at 30 basis points, the current coupon of floating-rate
notes is pretty low, so they''re narrowly a defensive play for
investors. </p>
<p>Even as floating-rate note issuance is dominated by banks,
borrowers from consumer-products company Procter  Gamble Co. to
Caterpillar Inc. have sold the securities in the past month. </p>
<p>Interest Rates Rise </p>
<p>IBM''s notes rank as senior unsecured obligations, the data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The only reason that floating-rate notes would pay off
more than a fixed-rate one is if short-term interest rates do
rise quickly, said LeBas, who doesn''t anticipate that
increase. For investors that are concerned about a rise in
rates, purchasing floaters is one way to reduce that. </p>
<p>Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury have climbed for
the past two weeks to 3.32 percent as of Dec. 10, while those on
30-year Treasuries increased to 4.43 percent as of that date. </p>
<p>IBM plans to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions by
2015 as it aims to almost double operating earnings per share.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing in analytics
software and services that help predict trends, as well as cloud
computing, which helps customers save money by letting them
store and access data via the Internet rather than from their
own servers. </p>
<p>The company, which has announced 15 acquisitions this year,
ended the third quarter with more than $11 billion in cash and
short-term investments. </p>
<p>Barclays Capital and UBS AG managed the offering, according
to a regulatory filing from IBM today. Proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes, the company said in the filing. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack,
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman and other executives won a
dismissal of a shareholder lawsuit filed over $45 billion paid
to the firm''s employees over three years. </p>
<p>New York State Supreme Court Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich threw out the lawsuit, citing a requirement that
shareholders first make a demand on a board before suing on
behalf of a company or show that such a move would be futile,
according to a Dec. 10 decision. </p>
<p>The complaint fails to show that a demand on Morgan
Stanley''s board would be futile, Kornreich wrote. There is
no reasonable doubt that the respective board approvals were not
a valid exercise of business judgment. </p>
<p>The complaint by shareholders including the Security Police
and Fire Professionals of America Retirement Fund said employee
compensation during 2006, 2007 and 2009 was unconscionable
given the firm''s performance, including its reliance on a
government bailout. </p>
<p>The shareholders argued in court papers that making a
demand on Morgan Stanley''s board would have been futile because
its members were beholden to the firm. Kornreich rejected
that argument, saying the plaintiffs didn''t show that the board
couldn''t make disinterested decisions. </p>
<p>We are pleased with the court''s ruling, which dismisses
all claims with prejudice, Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Jay Eisenhofer, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, didn''t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment. </p>
<p>The case is Security Police and Fire Professionals of
America Retirement Fund v. John J. Mack, 600359-2010, New York
State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Precious metals will probably give
investors the best returns among commodities in the next year,
and livestock the worst, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>Precious metals will advance 28 percent over 12 months and
livestock 4 percent, London-based Jeffrey Currie, Allison Nathan
and other Goldman analysts said in a report today. The team
raised its 12-month forecast for the SP GSCI Enhanced Total
Return Index to 18 percent from 16 percent, mostly because of
changes to agricultural estimates. </p>
<p>Extreme weakness in U.S. demand over the past two years
has allowed China to grow unconstrained without any competition
for raw materials, the Goldman analysts said in the report.
This is likely to change in 2011 with a stronger U.S. that is
likely to bump up against a China that is consuming dramatically
more commodities than pre-crisis. </p>
<p>Commodity assets under management rose $19 billion to a
record $340 billion in October, led by demand for index-linked
investments, Barclays Capital said in a report last month. Gold
rose 27 percent this year, heading for a 10th consecutive annual
advance. Investors are seeking hard assets as governments and
central banks led by the Federal Reserve pump more than $2
trillion into the world financial system. </p>

<p>Qatar, the world''s largest exporter
of liquefied natural gas, is seeking partners to build two
petrochemical plants as companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. and
ConocoPhillips seek investment opportunities there. </p>
<p>The Persian Gulf emirate is in talks with Exxon, Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. as possible
partners in construction of two facilities, Mohammed Yousef al-
Mulla, head of Qatar Petrochemical Co., said today. </p>
<p>Qatar is using its gas reserves, the world''s third largest,
to run petrochemical, aluminum and fertilizer factories as it
diversifies its economy away from exporting LNG and crude oil.
The Persian Gulf emirate, which today celebrated raising LNG
capacity to 77 million metric tons a year, aims to increase
annual production of petrochemicals to 28 million tons by 2014,
al-Attiyah said in May. </p>
<p>Exxon is pursuing an agreement signed with Qatar to build a
petrochemical plant in the country, Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said at the celebration ceremony today. </p>
<p>We''ve completed all the work. We''ve concluded commercial
agreements, Tillerson said. We''re waiting for the Qataris to
make a decision about what they want to do. </p>
<p>Qapco, as the state petrochemicals company is known, is a
subsidiary of Industries Qatar. Chevron Phillips is a joint
venture between Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips. </p>
<p>Top of the List'' </p>
<p>Conoco sees Qatar as being at the top of the list of
countries where the company is likely to invest, Chief
Executive Officer James Mulva said, according to a statement
distributed ahead of the ceremony. </p>
<p>The company continues to look for opportunities to
cooperate with Qatar in areas such as petrochemicals, oil and
gas infrastructure, Mulva said. </p>
<p>The Houston-based company this year pulled out of two
projects in the region, one in Saudi Arabia and the other in Abu
Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and in 2007 withdrew from a
U.A.E. refinery project. </p>
<p>Total SA has designs ready for a new petrochemical complex
in Qatar if a $6 billion project announced by Exxon Mobil Corp.
early this year is canceled, two people with knowledge of the
matter said last month. </p>
<p>State-controlled Qatar Petroleum signed an agreement with
Exxon in January to build a petrochemical complex that would be
the emirate''s biggest single energy-related project since
Shell''s Pearl gas-to-liquids plant was announced in 2006. Qatar
may choose a different partner, a Qatar Petroleum official said
in August. </p>
<p>Exxon, Shell, Conoco and Total are all partners with Qatar
in its export-oriented LNG facilities. LNG can be transported by
ship to markets not accessible by pipeline. </p>

<p>Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov was found guilty of two
counts of stealing the firm''s trade secrets by appropriating
part of a high-frequency computer source code. </p>
<p>Aleynikov went on trial Nov. 29 in federal court in New
York on charges of violating the Economic Espionage Act and the
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. He faces as
long as 10 years in prison on the espionage charge and five
years for the interstate transportation charge. </p>
<p>U.S. District Court judge Denise Cote set sentencing of
Aleynikov for March 18. He and his lawyer both declined comment.
He will be under home confinement and electronic monitoring,
Judge Cote ruled. </p>
<p>Aleynikov, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, holds dual
U.S.-Russian citizenship, his lawyer Kevin Marino said in court. </p>
<p>I would like the parties to explain whether or not there
are travel restrictions that can be enforced through a watch
list, Cote told prosecutors and Marino. I would like the
government to confirm for me by 5 o''clock today whether Mr.
Aleynikov''s name can be added to watch lists so he can''t board a
plane. </p>
<p>Cote directed that Aleynikov limit his travel to the
Southern and Eastern Districts of New York. Jurors left the
courthouse after the verdict and all declined to comment. </p>
<p>Cote also ordered that Aleynikov surrender all travel
documents and directed that three financially responsible people
come back and sign his bond. He left court accompanied by family
members and declined comment. </p>
<p>Assistant Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rebecca Rohr, in her
closing statement on Dec. 9, told jurors that Aleynikov was a
thief. On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman
Sachs in June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of
lines of source code from the firm''s trading system, she said. </p>
<p>He circumvented Goldman Sachs''s security system, sent the
code to an outside server in Germany, and later compressed and
encrypted the code, Rohr said. Aleynikov took the code with him
to a meeting with his new employers in Chicago in July 2009, she
said. </p>
<p>After taking Goldman''s software, Aleynikov executed a
program to cover his tracks, prosecutors said. If he thought the
codes were open source and should be publicly available, why
did he then encrypt it?, Rohr asked jurors. So that no one,
like him, could access the code, she said. </p>
<p>While Aleynikov may have broken a confidentiality rule of
Goldman Sachs, he didn''t commit a crime, said his attorney,
Kevin Marino. </p>
<p>He violated the policy, OK, but that''s not a crime,
Marino told jurors. A crime is when you act to harm the victim
and benefit yourself. </p>
<p>Aleynikov had access to all of Goldman Sachs''s high-
frequency trading software and could have easily taken a flash
memory drive and copied the entire trading platform, yet he
didn''t, Marino said. Aleynikov took open-source code he had
written at Goldman Sachs and nothing that was proprietary, he
said. </p>
<p>Marino called the government''s case a silly prosecution
as he waved a notebook at prosecutors at the conclusion of his
closing arguments. </p>
<p>Aleynikov, who started at Goldman Sachs in May 2007, left
his $400,000-a-year job to work for Chicago-based Teza
Technologies LLC, which promised him $1.2 million including
salary, bonus and profit-sharing. </p>
<p>During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that, on
the night of June 4, 2009, before his last day at Goldman Sachs,
Aleynikov transferred hundreds of thousands of lines of computer
source code related to the firm''s high-frequency trading
business. At about 5:20 p.m. the next day, Aleynikov sent parts
of the trading code to a code-storage website in Europe that
wasn''t blocked by the firm, witnesses said. </p>
<p>Marino, saying Goldman Sachs wasn''t the New York Yankees
of high-frequency trading, told jurors that prosecutors
exaggerated the value of the firm''s high-frequency trading
platform. </p>
<p>Sergey knew what Goldman Sachs owned and that lots of it
was open source code, Marino said. </p>
<p>If it''s open source code, it''s not Goldman''s just because
it happened at Goldman, he said. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Trademark </p>
<p>Gufic Wins Indian Trademark Challenge Filed by Estee Lauder </p>
<p>Gufic Biosciences Ltd., a Mumbai-based pharmaceutical and
personal-hygiene products company, bested Estee Lauder''s
Clinique unit in a trademark battle in India, the Business
Standard reported. </p>
<p>In 2008 Estee Lauder had asked the Delhi High Court to bar
Gifuc from selling its Skinclinique Stretch Nil, claiming it
infringed the marks for its Clinique brand, according to the
newspaper. </p>
<p>After several rulings by the Delhi High Court, India''s
Supreme Court found that the Gufic product, which is used to
treat stretch marks associated with pregnancy, was substantially
different from the Estee Lauder product, according to the
Standard. </p>
<p>The Gufic product has been sold since 1997 and there is 
a huge price difference between it and the Clinique products,
the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>Rolex Sues Maker of Vans for Handicapped for Infringement </p>
<p>Rolex Group''s Rolex Watch USA unit sued a Minnesota company
that customizes vans for wheelchair use for trademark
infringement. </p>
<p>According to the complaint filed Dec. 2 in federal court in
Minnesota, Associated Partnership Ltd. of Savage, Minnesota, is
accused of infringing the marks. Associated does business as
Rollx Vans and through its www.rollxvans.com website. </p>
<p>The Switzerland-based watch company claims the Rollx mark
is a confusingly similar, sound-alike mark that is likely to
bring to mind the Rolex mark, create consumer confusion and a
false association between the Swiss company and the van company. </p>
<p>According to the Rollx website, the company has been in
business for almost 40 years. The family-owned company converts
new and used imported and domestic vans for wheelchair users,
according to a video posted on Google Inc.''s YouTube video-
sharing site. </p>
<p>Rolex claims the van company''s mark blurs the
distinctiveness of the watch company''s trademarks. It objects to
the van company''s attempts to register Rollx as a trademark, and
claims it''s suffered irreparable harm and damages as a
result of Rollx''s actions. </p>
<p>The watch company asked the court to bar the van company''s
use of Rollx as a mark, and for awards of money damages,
attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>Rollx didn''t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. </p>
<p>Rolex is represented by Ruth Rivard and Kevin D. Conneely
of Leonard, Street  Deinard of Minneapolis, and Brian W.
Brokate, Beth M. Frenchman and Jeff Dupler of New York''s Gibney,
Anthony  Flaherty LLP. </p>

<p>Shearson, Meister Brau, Handi-Wrap Marks Bought at Auction </p>
<p>In an auction organized by New York-based Racebook Capital
Advisors LLC, some famous trademarks changed hands for prices

<p>Among the trademarks that changed hands in the Dec. 8
auction in Manhattan are Shearson, which went for $45,000;
Meister Brau, for $32,500, and Handi-Wrap, for which a purchaser
paid $30,000, according to Advertising Age. </p>
<p>John J. Cuticelli Jr., Racebook''s chief executive officer,
told Advertising Age each trademark was sold free and clear and
all the buyers have to do is back it with a product. </p>

<p>The Gold Sox name was registered as a trademark by a
Marysville, California-based collegiate summer-league team that

<p>UT Says Car Wash Structure Infringes School Tower Trademark </p>
<p>The operator of a car wash in Austin, Texas, has run afoul

<p>The school objects to the structure atop the building
that''s a copy of the University of Texas tower, according to the
newspaper. </p>
<p>Craig Westemeier, the university''s assistant athletic
director for trademark licensing told the newspaper the school
is working with the carwash owner to make some design changes so
the structure won''t look so much like the campus tower. </p>
<p>The owner of the car has said all his promotional
literature contains the disclaimer that the business isn''t
affiliated with the school, according to the Statesman. </p>

<p>Phil Spector Sued for Royalties by Darlene Love, Ronettes </p>
<p>Pop singer Darlene Love and the vocal group the Ronettes
have again sued producer Phil Spector, who''s in prison in
California for murder, for unpaid royalties on songs recorded in
the 1960s. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, who include Spector''s former wife Ronnie
Greenfield, charge that Spector has violated a 2009 court-
ordered settlement agreement that required him to pay royalties
twice a year, according to a complaint filed Dec. 9 in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York. </p>
<p>Defendants have generated millions of dollars through the
sale of plaintiffs'' musical recordings, yet have paid only a
fraction of royalties, lawyers for the singers said in the
complaint. </p>
<p>Spector is serving a 19-year sentence on a second-degree
murder conviction in the California Substance Abuse Treatment
Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>Love sang with the groups the Blossoms, the Crystals and
Bob B. Soxx and the Blue Jeans. The Crystals'' hits included Da
Doo Ron Ron. </p>
<p>Other plaintiffs include members of the Ronettes; the
estate of Estelle Bennett, Ronnie''s sister; and their cousin
Nedra Talley Ross. </p>
<p>The Ronettes signed with Spector''s Phillies Records, also a
defendant, in 1963 and recorded hits including Be My Baby. 
The case is Darlene Love v. Phil Spector, 652227-2010, Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York. An earlier
case was Ronnie Greenfield v. Phillies Records, 000763-1988,

<p>The trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff''s investment firm filed more than $50 billion in so-
called clawback suits to compensate victims of the con man''s
fraud since his arrest two years ago for masterminding the
biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Irving Picard, the trustee, filed hundreds of suits against
banks, feeder funds, investors and others alleged to have
profited from Madoff''s decades-long fraud. Among those sued was
Madoff''s son Mark, who was found dead Dec. 11 in Manhattan of an
apparent suicide. </p>
<p>The deadline for Picard to file claims expired at midnight
Dec. 11. So far, he has recovered about $2.5 billion. Last week,
he sued Bank Medici AG and its founder, Sonja Kohn, as well as
Bank Austria, UniCredit SpA and dozens of other parties. He is
seeking $19.6 billion from them, which could potentially triple
to $58.8 billion under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act. It''s the biggest claim filed by Picard. </p>
<p>Kohn, 62, whom Picard called Madoff''s criminal soul
mate, used a relationship with the financier that began in
1985 to help build the Vienna-based bank, feeding more than $9.1
billion of investor money into his company, Picard said in a

heart of the rule of law and it makes other crimes possible. Mr.
Norris has not yet come completely to the realization of his
factual guilt, as far as I can tell. </p>
<p>Norris was extradited from the U.K. this year, the first
foreign defendant sent to the U.S. to face charges arising from
a criminal antitrust investigation, Justice Department officials
said in March. </p>
<p>Christopher Curran, a defense attorney for Norris, said
Dec. 10 that his client will appeal the conviction. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Leahy, Pillet Charged in EADS Insider-Trading Probe </p>
<p>Airbus SAS Chief Operating Officer John Leahy and Erik
Pillet, the former human resources director at the European
Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. unit, were charged by a Paris
investigating judge with insider trading. </p>
<p>Leahy was placed under investigation Nov. 5, and Pillet
Oct. 1 after they were called in for questioning, said a
spokeswoman for the prosecutor''s office who declined to be named
citing office policy. </p>
<p>Criminal investigators are looking into allegations that as
many as 17 current and former EADS officials engaged in insider
trading ahead of the announcement about production problems that
would delay the A380, the world''s biggest passenger plane. The
report precipitated a 26 percent drop in the share price on June
14, 2006. </p>
<p>France''s market regulator cleared the officials and the
company of any wrongdoing in December 2009 in a parallel probe. </p>
<p>Leahy''s lawyer Patrick Bernard and EADS spokesman Pierre
Bayle declined to comment. Calls for comment to the men''s
offices weren''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>Four former executives including former EADS co-chief
executive officer Noel Forgeard and one current official have
also been preliminarily charged in the probe. The investigation
began after EADS investors filed a criminal complaint following
the 2006 share price slide. </p>
<p>HSBC, Kingate Global Fund Sued in London Over Madoff Fraud </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc and Kingate Management Ltd. were sued in
London by Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard
Madoff''s investment firm in New York. </p>
<p>The lawsuits, filed Dec. 10 at the High Court, follow cases
filed by Picard against HSBC and Kingate in New York bankruptcy
court. Picard sued HSBC last week for $9 billion over claims it
aided Madoff''s fraud through a network of feeder funds in
Europe, the Caribbean and Central America. </p>
<p>The trustee sued two Kingate feeder funds in April,
arguing that he can retrieve $255 million in fake profit the
funds withdrew from Madoff''s business within 90 days before his
arrest in December 2008. </p>
<p>Picard, facing a deadline to file claims to retrieve money
for victims of Madoff''s fraud, is filing lawsuits in London for
the first time. Picard and the liquidators of Bernard Madoff
Securities International Ltd., the U.K. arm of the convicted con
man''s investment firm, sued the unit''s former directors, seeking
at least $80 million, on Dec. 8. </p>
<p>Picard won a court order in London in May forcing
investment firm FIM Advisers LLP to hand over additional
documents about whether it knew about Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. FIM
managed the Kingate Global and Kingate Euro hedge funds, now in
liquidation in Bermuda, which funneled more than $1.7 billion to
Madoff. </p>
<p>Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty in March 2009 to using money
from new investors to pay off old ones in a Ponzi scheme,
sparking investigations and dozens of lawsuits. U.K. prosecutors
dropped a criminal probe into Madoff''s London unit in February
after they found insufficient evidence to charge anyone. </p>
<p>Adrian Russell, a spokesman for HSBC, declined to
immediately comment. Federico Ceretti and Carlo Grosso, who head
FIM Advisers, didn''t immediately respond to a call seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Kevin McCue, a spokesman for Picard, didn''t immediately
respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>The cases are Irving H. Picard (as Trustee for the
Liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC) v.
Kingate Management Ltd.  11 ors, case no. 10-1478, and Irving
H. Picard v. HSBC Plc, case no. 10-1479, High Court of Justice,
Queen''s Bench Division (London.) </p>
<p>Kerviel, SocGen Sued by Employees for Stress, Lost Savings </p>
<p>Jerome Kerviel and Societe Generale SA were sued by four
bank employees who said they suffered emotionally and
financially after his unauthorized trading cost the bank 4.9
billion euros ($6.5 billion) in 2008. </p>
<p>The women are seeking 15,000 euros each in moral
damages and as much as 3,973 euros in financial damages for
the hit their savings took when the bank''s shares fell,
according to the lawsuit filed Dec. 10 in Nanterre, near Paris. </p>
<p>The women had sizable losses wiped from their savings,
according to an e-mailed copy of the lawsuit. The financial
losses aggravated the moral prejudice they suffered, adding to
their state of anxiety and resentment. </p>
<p>The employees sued two months after the former trader was
sentenced to three years in jail and ordered to repay the loss,
for which the court said he alone was responsible. Kerviel, who
is free pending his appeal, said throughout the trial that the
bank knew of his trading and condoned it. The lawsuit quotes
extensively from a report by the French Banking Commission,
which fined Societe Generale 4 million euros for lax controls
related to Kerviel. </p>
<p>Societe Generale had no comment on the lawsuit, said Laura
Schalk, a spokeswoman for the bank. Calls to lawyers for Kerviel
and the bank for comment weren''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>Former Vitesse Chief Tomasetta Charged in Backdating </p>
<p>Former Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. Chief Executive Officer
Louis Tomasetta and ex-Executive Vice President Eugene Hovanec
were charged by the U.S. with securities fraud stemming from an
options-backdating scheme. </p>
<p>Tomasetta, 62, of Ojai, California, and Hovanec, 60, of
Westlake Village, California, were named in an indictment
unsealed Dec. 10 in U.S. District Court in New York that also
charged them with conspiracy, making false entries with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in a scheme which prosecutors
said ran between 2001 and mid-2006. </p>
<p>Prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara, whose office is prosecuting the case, allege that
Tomasetta, who co-founded the company, and Hovanec engaged in
an illegal scheme to deceive Vitesse''s auditors, investors and
others concerning the company''s true financial condition. </p>
<p>Knowing that the company wasn''t going to meet its own goals
for revenue or earnings, Tomasetta, Hovanec and others devised
a scheme to falsely inflate Vitesse''s revenues, prosecutors
said. </p>
<p>The two men also backdated numerous stock options granted
to Vitesse employees from 2001 to 2004 by backdating the
options, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Both defendants pleaded not guilty Dec. 10 before U.S.
Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger in New York and were released
on $1 million bond, said Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
Bharara''s office. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Tomasetta, 10-CR-1205, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>GMAC Allowed to Proceed With Maine Foreclosure Sales </p>
<p>GMAC Mortgage LLC can sell foreclosed homes in Maine after
defeating a bid by homeowners in the state who sought a federal
court order blocking sales and evictions. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby, at a hearing Dec. 10
in Portland, Maine, declined to grant a temporary restraining
order that a plaintiff''s lawyer said would have kept GMAC from
selling foreclosed homes and evicting residents. </p>
<p>The judge said his decision hinged on the power of federal
courts to stop proceedings in state courts, where foreclosures
take place. He said individual homeowners who face losing their
homes in a foreclosure sale can go to state court to stop the
sales, he said. </p>
<p>This decision is based on the limited authority federal
courts have, Hornby said. </p>
<p>The Maine case, filed in state court in October and moved
to federal court by GMAC in November, involves five homeowners
who are suing GMAC, claiming the company relied on defective
court documents in seizing homes. The plaintiffs are seeking to
represent all Maine homeowners who are facing foreclosure by
GMAC or who lost their homes in a GMAC foreclosure during the
past six years, according to court documents. </p>
<p>Maine Attorney General Janet Mills is considering joining
the GMAC lawsuit, Assistant Attorney General Linda Conti said in
an interview Dec. 10. The office is also considering filing its
own lawsuit against GMAC, she said. </p>
<p>GMAC had agreed to suspend foreclosure sales and evictions
in the state until the judge ruled on the restraining order,
Andrea Bopp Stark, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said. That
agreement expired Dec. 10. </p>
<p>The case is Bradbury v. GMAC Mortgage LLC, 10-00458, U.S.
District Court, District of Maine (Portland). </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Ex-Network Associates Finance Chief Wins Reversal </p>
<p>Prabhat Goyal, the former Network Associates Inc. chief
financial officer convicted in 2007 of securities fraud and of
making false statements to auditors, won reversal on all 15
counts on appeal. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco agreed Dec. 10
with Goyal''s argument that, based on the evidence presented by
prosecutors at his trial, no jury should have convicted him. </p>
<p>Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to
the prosecution, no reasonable juror could have found Goyal
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on any of the charges against
him, the three-member panel said in its ruling. </p>
<p>A federal grand jury indicted Goyal in 2004 for conspiring
to secretly pay distributors to buy more inventory than they
could sell during a given quarter and to hold onto the excess
instead of returning it to the company. </p>
<p>The fraud caused Network Associates to overstate revenue by
more than $470 million and understate losses by about $330
million from 1998 to 2000, according to the indictment. </p>
<p>We''re extremely gratified by the court of appeals''
careful and unassailable opinion, said attorney Seth Waxman,
who argued the case on appeal for Goyal. </p>
<p>Goyal, in October 2008, was sentenced to serve one year and
one day in prison for each count, with the terms to run
concurrently, according to the trial court''s electronic docket.
Waxman said his client never served that time and was free on
bail pending the outcome of the appeal. </p>
<p>We are in the process of reviewing the decision, said
Jack Gillund, a spokesman for the office of U.S. Attorney
Melinda Haag in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Goyal, 08-10436, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). The lower court case is
U.S. v. Goyal, 04-cr-00201, U.S. District Court, Northern

<p>Court Filings </p>
<p>Countrywide Foreclosure Suit Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg </p>
<p>A bankruptcy lawsuit against New Jersey home owner John T.
Kemp, whose mortgage company, a judge ruled, had failed to
deliver the note to the trustee, was the most-read litigation
docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. </p>
<p>The rejection of the claim came after Linda DeMartini, a
mortgage-litigation management division team leader at Bank of
America Corp., which acquired Kemp''s company, Countrywide
Financial Corp. in 2008,  said during a bankruptcy hearing in
Camden last year that it was routine for the lender to keep
mortgage promissory notes even after loans were bundled by the
thousands into bonds and sold to investors. Contracts for such
securitizations usually require the documents to be transferred
to the trustee for mortgage bondholders. That could leave the
trustee with no standing to take the property, and raises the
question of whether other foreclosures could similarly be
blocked. </p>
<p>The bank disavowed the statements by DeMartini, whom it had
flown in from California to testify. It was the policy of
Countrywide, to deliver notes as called for in its
securitization contracts, according to Larry Platt, an attorney
at KL Gates LLP in Washington designated by the Bank of America
to answer questions about the case. </p>
<p>The case is In the Matter of John T. Kemp, Kemp v.
Countrywide Home Loans Inc., 08-02448, U.S. bankruptcy Court for
the District of New Jersey (Camden). </p>

<p>On the Docket </p>
<p>Raj Rajaratnam Insider Trading Trial to Start Feb. 28 </p>
<p>Galleon Group LLC founder Raj Rajaratnam is scheduled to go
on trial Feb. 28 on charges he used tips from company
executives, hedge-fund employees and others in a multimillion-
dollar insider-trading scheme. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard J. Holwell, in an order filed
Dec. 10 in federal court in Manhattan, said the charges against
Rajaratnam will be tried separately from those against his co-
defendant Danielle Chiesi. The trial of Chiesi, a former hedge
fund consultant, is scheduled to start April 25. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 53, was arrested last year and is the central
figure in a probe of insider trading at hedge funds that has led
to 14 guilty pleas. He and Chiesi, a former consultant at New
Castle Funds LLC, deny wrongdoing. Theirs is the largest
insider-trading case involving hedge funds. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam and Chiesi last month lost a bid to block the
first-ever use of wiretap evidence in an insider-trading case.
Evidence at an October hearing showed that the government
secretly recorded about 2,400 conversations between Rajaratnam
and more than 130 friends, business associates and alleged
accomplices. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor
Co. (F), the two largest U.S. automakers, canceled or shortened
shifts for at least seven vehicle assembly plants in Canada and
the U.S. Midwest because of weather-related road closings. </p>
<p>For GM, based in Detroit, the stopped or abbreviated shifts
affected production of the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain
compact sport-utility vehicles, the Chevrolet Impala sedan and
Camaro coupe, the Cadillac CTS and STS sedans, and Chevrolet
Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups. </p>
<p>Ford halted production of its Ford Flex wagon, Edge,
Explorer and Lincoln MKX SUVs, and Lincoln MKT and MKS sedans,
Todd Nissen, a Ford spokesman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Automakers record revenue when vehicles are assembled. So
the loss of production may affect the companies'' fourth-quarter
sales if the output isn''t recouped over the rest of the month. </p>
<p>The Lansing Grand River assembly plant in Lansing,
Michigan, which makes the STS and CTS models, closed earlier
today because of a parts shortage caused by highway closings in
Canada, said Chris Lee, a GM spokesman. He declined to specify
the part. </p>
<p>Workers at GM''s assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, were
sent home early during the day shift and the late shift today
was canceled, said Jason Easton, a spokesman. GM shortened
shifts at its CAMI assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario,
starting yesterday, he said. The CAMI facility makes the Equinox
and Terrain, and the Oshawa plant makes the Impala and Camaro. </p>
<h2>GM, Ford Plants </h2>
<p>GM''s Flint assembly, which makes light- and heavy-duty
Silverado and Sierra pickups, dismissed workers early today and
will adjust work schedules based on parts availability, said Tom Wickham, a spokesman. </p>
<p>Ford''s shutdowns occurred at Oakville Assembly and St.
Thomas Assembly -- both in Ontario -- and the Chicago Assembly
Plant. Nissen, the Ford spokesman, said production schedules for
tomorrow are undetermined. </p>
<p>Lambton County in Ontario declared a state of emergency
because of a winter storm yesterday, the Ontario Provincial
Police said today in a statement on its website. Police are
rescuing drivers from about 360 stranded vehicles on Highway
402, which crosses the border to Port Huron, Michigan, the
police said. </p>
<p>Chrysler''s Canadian operations were unaffected by the
storms, Mary Gauthier, a spokeswoman, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>Ron Lietzke, a spokesman for Honda Motor Co.''s U.S.
manufacturing unit in Marysville, Ohio, said the company''s
factories in Ohio, Indiana and Ontario have continued operating
normally this week. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. will pit one of its computers against past champions of
the Jeopardy! quiz show, more than a decade after another
IBM machine defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov. </p>
<p>Watson, as the computer is called after IBM founder
Thomas J. Watson, will square off against Ken Jennings and Brad
Rutter in a contest scheduled to air Feb. 14, said IBM
researcher Dave Ferrucci in an interview. Jennings has the
longest win streak in the show''s history and Rutter won more
money than any other player. </p>
<p>It''s going to be a close game, said Ferrucci, an
artificial intelligence expert who has headed the Watson
project. These guys are really good. I''m going to have to
breathe deeply and count to 10 a lot. </p>
<p>The three-contestant competition, the show''s usual number,
will last three days and the winner will receive $1 million. The
shows will be broadcast from IBM''s lab in Yorktown Heights, New
York and air during the regular Jeopardy time slot. </p>
<p>The project builds on IBM''s work in the field of artificial
intelligence, including the Deep Blue supercomputer that
defeated world champion Kasparov in a 1997 match. About four
years ago, executives at IBM, the world''s largest computer-
services provider, decided to try another challenge that would
generate public interest -- and this time with potential
commercial appeal, said Ferrucci. </p>
<p>The main task: make computers understand questions in
natural language, as opposed to the keyword searches common on
Google Inc.''s website or Microsoft Corp.''s Bing. While computers
can easily search databases, they have problems understanding
context, innuendo and other subtleties common in most
information, Ferrucci said. </p>
<p>How Watson Works </p>
<p>The Holy Grail here is to create a technology that can
understand what you''re asking, the way you''re asking it, he
said. People want to do more with all the content we have. </p>
<p>For the Jeopardy competition, Watson will receive each
question through a typed entry at the same time host Alex Trebek
reads the queries to Jennings and Rutter. The computer will scan
a custom-made database for answers and then calculate its degree
of confidence in an answer. If the confidence level exceeds a
certain threshold, it will buzz and speak the answer out loud. </p>
<p>Watson''s a big step toward artificial intelligence that
directly affects people''s lives, Paul Saffo, managing director
at investment adviser Discern Analytics in San Francisco, said
in an interview. It will have the intended effect -- this is
going to absolutely capture people''s attention. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, shuffled its executive leadership team and eliminated
a layer of reporting structure following the naming of Ian Read
to chief executive officer last week. </p>
<p>Read previously was head of Pfizer''s global pharmaceutical
operations, responsible for 85 percent of the New York-based
company''s revenue. That position will be eliminated as the heads
of units report directly to Read, said Ray Kerins, a spokesman
for the drugmaker, in a telephone interview. The changes take
effect immediately, Kerins said. Read was named CEO on Dec. 5. </p>
<p>Over the next five years, Pfizer faces generic competition
to products with $20 billion in annual sales, or almost a third
of the company''s revenue. Pfizer is eliminating jobs and
reducing costs as it absorbs the $68 billion acquisition of
Wyeth last year. The new reporting structure will help elevate
leaders and speed up decision making, Kerins said. </p>
<p>We have outstanding leaders who are now being pulled
together into one leadership operation and are no longer
segmented, Kerins said. Having the business units at the
executive leadership table, we can further improve alignment
across all groups and divisions to drive operational
excellence. </p>

Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $813 to $825 a metric ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.
That''s down from $834 to $840 yesterday. </p>
<p>About 15 lots traded. Gunvor International BV and Shell
bought. Statoil ASA, BP Plc and Neste Oil Oyj were sellers. </p>
<p>Eurobob gasoline barges traded at $806 to $813 throughout
the day, according to the survey of traders and brokers
monitoring both the Platts window and Argus Bulletin Board.
That''s down from $816 to $823 yesterday. Ethanol is added to
Eurobob grade to make the finished fuel. </p>
<p>Prices could drop further after showing unseasonal strength
in November and December, Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy
wrote today in a research note. </p>
<p>Massive Indonesian and Nigerian gasoline imports alone
will not be supportive enough and the U.S. will curb gasoline
imports after the recent run rate hikes, JBC Energy said. </p>

of Brazil, Russia, India and China as economic powers. The
Brazilian real has strengthened about 15 percent against the
dollar since the beginning of 2001 and 36 percent since the
start of 2009. </p>
<p>O''Neill predicted that Europe''s sovereign-debt crisis will
continue to roil markets next year as the 16 governments that
share the euro search for ways to balance diverging
competitiveness more than a decade after the currency was
created in a project that was originally known as European
monetary union, or EMU. </p>
<p>I don''t believe this is a credit crisis, he said.
It''s more of a crisis about EMU''s structure and EMU''s
governance. It''s not that easy to resolve over night. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s top
executives will get about $111.3 million in stock next month in
a delayed payout from last year and their record-setting 2007
awards, even as Wall Street prepares for lower bonuses. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is poised
to receive about $24.3 million in January, based on the closing
share price on Dec. 14, while President Gary D. Cohn, 50, will
get about $24 million, company filings show. The payouts, just a
portion of the $67.9 million bonus awarded to Blankfein for 2007
and the $66.9 million paid to Cohn, reflect a 24 percent decline
in the stock''s value since it was granted at $218.86. </p>
<p>Within a year after the bonuses were approved, Goldman
Sachs took $10 billion of U.S. bailout funds, converted to a
bank and was borrowing as much as $35.4 billion a day from
Federal Reserve emergency programs. This year the New York-based
firm paid $550 million to settle U.S. regulators'' fraud charges
related to a mortgage security the company sold in 2007. </p>
<p>Clearly we now look back and say, Were things fine?
Should they have paid? Maybe not,'' said Jeanne Branthover, a
managing director at recruitment firm Boyden Global Executive
Search in New York. There''s nothing you can do about it. The
payouts were in stone. But hopefully, in the future, they won''t
be. </p>
<p>Deferred Stock </p>
<p>Since the 2008 credit crisis wiped out competitors such as
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and led to unprecedented
government assistance to financial institutions, regulators have
encouraged banks to pay senior employees with deferred stock and
recoup payouts if trading strategies backfire. Blankfein and
Cohn, who received cash awards of $27 million and $26.6 million
respectively for 2007, didn''t get any bonuses for 2008 and
received only restricted stock for 2009. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs announced on Dec. 10, 2009, that all 30
members of its management committee would receive only
restricted stock for their year-end bonuses. The company hasn''t
made a similar announcement this year. Through the first nine
months of 2010, Goldman Sachs set aside $13.1 billion to cover
compensation and benefits expenses, or enough to pay each of its
35,400 employees $370,706 apiece. A year earlier, the average
was $527,192 per employee. </p>
<p>The payments come as bonuses across Wall Street are
expected to decline. Compensation for trading and investment-
banking employees is likely to be down 22 percent to 28 percent
from last year, according to Options Group, an executive search
and compensation consultant firm in New York. Morgan Stanley has
told some employees to expect investment-banking bonuses to
decline 10 percent to 30 percent, two people briefed on the
matter said earlier this month. </p>
<p>Record Profit </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s 23 percent share-price decline from the
last day of 2007 compares with a 16 percent drop in the Standard
 Poor''s 500 Index over the same period and a 47 percent plunge
in the SP 500 Financials Index. While the firm''s profit tumbled
80 percent in 2008 from the $11.6 billion earned in 2007, last
year the company recovered to post a $13.4 billion record
profit. So far this year earnings have been lower. </p>
<p>Among the scheduled January payouts are $21.3 million to
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar; $20.8 million to former
co-president Jon Winkelried, who left the firm in March 2009;
and $14.3 million to Edward C. Forst, co-head of investment
management, who left in 2008 and returned to Goldman Sachs a
year later. </p>
<p>The amounts are based on the Dec. 14 closing share price of
$167.33, which is likely to change by the time the stock is
delivered next month. </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Dimon, Mack </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, 54, is set to receive
$6.8 million worth of shares next month that were awarded for
2007. John Mack, 66, who served as CEO of New York-based Morgan
Stanley until this year, didn''t take a bonus in 2007, 2008 or
2009. He will receive about $5.4 million of previously vested
shares in January that Morgan Stanley awarded him for 2005. </p>
<p>Of the $111.3 million in restricted stock awards due to be
doled out in January, $94.9 million was from 2007 grants, the
filings show. While Vice Chairmen John S. Weinberg and J. Michael Evans will each receive $3.3 million from their 2009
bonus grants, their 2007 awards weren''t published in the proxy. </p>
<p>Buffett Agreement </p>
<p>The executives will be restrained from cashing in the stock
they receive. Blankfein, Cohn, Winkelried and Viniar were all
required to keep 90 percent of their shares under an agreement
reached with Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the company controlled by
billionaire Warren Buffett, when it bought $5 billion of the
firm''s preferred stock in 2008. That limit expires when
Buffett''s investment is repaid or on Oct. 1, 2011, whichever
comes soonest. </p>
<p>Even before the Buffett restrictions were imposed, Goldman
Sachs''s CEO, CFO, presidents and vice chairmen were required to
keep at least 75 percent of the shares they had received since
becoming senior executive officers, with the exception of shares
received in Goldman Sachs''s 1999 initial public offering or
through any acquisition by Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley and
JPMorgan also require top executives to retain 75 percent of the
shares they are awarded. </p>
<p>About 88 percent of the 2007 awards were restricted stock
units the firm granted for performance, which were vested at
that time. The executives receive the shares underlying those
units in January 2011. The remaining 12 percent are shares the
executives purchased at a 25 percent discount using their 2007
cash bonuses. Those shares are either delivered or have
restrictions lifted next month. </p>
<p>Stock Options </p>
<p>The executives also received stock options in 2007 that
become exercisable in January. The options, which expire on Nov.
24, 2017, are unlikely to be exercised immediately because the
shares are below the strike price of $204.16. </p>
<p>The January bonus awards will probably trigger varying
reactions among different groups of people, Branthover said. </p>
<p>The public will be outraged, she said. Wall Streeters
will be excited that there''s still money being made on Wall
Street, and there''s still a reason to be working so hard. </p>

<p>Kathleen Brown, who runs the West
Coast municipal finance team at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., will
move to a newly created post in Chicago after her brother Jerry Brown was elected last month as California''s next governor. </p>
<p>Brown, 65, will become chairman of investment banking for
the Midwest, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an internal
memo today. The former California state treasurer, whose brother
and father both served as the state''s governor, joined Goldman
in 2001. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the firm, confirmed
the contents of the memo, which was signed by David Solomon and
John S. Weinberg, co-heads of investment banking. </p>
<p>Kathleen is taking on this new role because it broadens
her client focus, DuVally said. Had she continued to work
with California municipalities, it might have created the
perception of a conflict of interest. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is ninth among underwriters of municipal debt
issued this year by California, the biggest issuer of municipal
bonds in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, leaves office Jan.
3 when Governor-elect Jerry Brown, a Democrat who held the job
from 1975 to 1983, is sworn in. Brown defeated former EBay Inc.
Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman, who came under criticism by
Democrats for being a former board member at Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Bridge Loan </p>
<p>Goldman, the most profitable securities firm in Wall Street
history, lent the state $1.5 billion in November as part of a
syndicate of six banks. The arrangement provided California with
a $6.7 billion bridge loan to help pay bills after a budget
impasse left the state short on cash. Goldman Sachs led a group
of investment banks on $4.93 billion in bonds sold by the state
since Jan. 1, 2009. </p>
<p>J. Timothy Tim Romer, 49, a managing director in the
West Coast public sector and infrastructure group, will succeed
Kathleen Brown as head of the group, DuVally said. Romer, who is
based in Los Angeles, joined Goldman Sachs in 2003 after working
in public finance at Bank of America Corp. and Merrill Lynch 
Co., which is now part of Bank of America. </p>
<p>Brown''s new role will be focused on client relationships
and John Gilbertson will continue to run investment banking in
the Midwest region, DuVally said. </p>
<p>Brown, who was herself the 1994 Democratic nominee for
California governor, reports to James P. Jim Esposito, chief
operating officer for investment banking, as well as to John Waldron, head of investment-banking services, DuVally said. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. and Ford Motor
Co., the two largest U.S. automakers, said parts shortages
caused by winter storms in Canada and the U.S. Midwest reduced
production for a second day. </p>
<p>GM''s Lansing Grand River plant in Michigan is shut down,
and six other plants have shortened or suspended shifts, Chris Lee, a company spokesman, said today in an interview. Shifts
have been shortened at the CAMI assembly plant in Ingersoll,
Ontario, which makes the Chevrolet Equinox sport-utility
vehicle, and a plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Lee said. </p>
<p>GM''s plant in Lordstown, Ohio, is running half shifts, and
its Oshawa Assembly in Ontario is running half a shift on one
line and is shut down on the other, Lee said. The Detroit-based
company''s heavy-duty pickup plant in Flint, Michigan, is
receiving some parts and will run two shifts through tomorrow,
said Tom Wickham, a spokesman. </p>
<p>Automakers record revenue when vehicles are assembled. So
the loss of production may affect the companies'' fourth-quarter
sales if the output isn''t recouped during the rest of the month. </p>
<p>Production was suspended early at Ford''s Oakville assembly
plant in Ontario, Todd Nissen, a spokesman, said in an e-mail.
All other plants are running as previously scheduled," he
said. The automaker''s St. Thomas plant in Ontario, its factory
in Avon Lake, Ohio, and its Chicago factory, which makes the
Explorer SUV, missed production earlier, he said. </p>
<p>We are starting to see improvements in the parts flow and
hope to return to normal production on Thursday,'''' he said. </p>
<p>Highway Still Closed </p>
<p>Chrysler Group LLC factories in Toledo, Ohio, and Brampton,
Ontario, were shut down this morning and should resume
production this afternoon, Jodi Tinson, a spokeswoman for the
Auburn Hills, Michigan-based automaker, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The second shift at Chrysler''s factory in Belvidere,
Illinois, has been canceled because of weather-related parts
issues,'''' she said. </p>
<p>Lambton County in Ontario remains in a state of emergency
after a winter storm on Dec. 13, the Ontario Provincial Police
said today in a statement on its website. Eastbound lanes of
Highway 402, which crosses the border to Port Huron, Michigan,
were reopened today, police said. </p>
<p>Snow and stranded vehicles still are being removed from
westbound Highway 402, according to the police. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. updated its Bing

<p>Bing, which ranks third in the market, accounted for 11.8
percent of U.S. searches in November, up from 11.5 percent the

While Google remained dominant, its share slipped to 66.2
percent from 66.3 percent. Yahoo! Inc. remained second. </p>
<p>Microsoft announced improvements to Bing at an event in San
Francisco. The company made its image-search feature easier to
use and integrated the mobile version of Bing with restaurant
services OpenTable and GrubHub. Users can make a reservation or
order takeout without leaving the application. They also can see
panoramic views of restaurants. </p>
<p>Microsoft looks to gain an edge over Google with the new
features and boost its advertising revenue. The company also has
forged a deal with Yahoo to handle search on its sites. Earlier
this month, Microsoft said the company is increasingly confident
that the agreement will boost revenue. </p>
<p>Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo have about 28 percent of the
U.S. search market. Yahoo''s share inched down to 16.4 percent
from 16.5 percent last month, ComScore said today. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. may be able to
issue long-term bonds at a yield of about 6.5 percent, the first
credit-default swaps on the automaker''s debt since its
bankruptcy show. </p>
<p>Contracts protecting GM''s bonds are at a mid-price of 338
basis points from 345 yesterday, according to Barclays Capital.
That compares with swaps on Ford Motor Co. at a mid-price of 285
basis points at 10:58 a.m. in New York, Barclays data show. </p>
<p>Based on CDS levels, the bonds you''d expect to come at a
slightly heftier yield to where Ford paper comes, said Michael Kraft, senior portfolio manager at Crimson Capital Trading LLC
in New York. He estimates that GM may be able to sell debt that
pays 50 basis points more than Ford bonds of the same maturity. </p>
<p>That would mean a yield of about 6.25 percent on 5-year
notes and 6.5 percent on 10-year debt, Kraft said. The yield on
Ford''s $1.25 billion of 8.125 percent bonds due in January 2020
climbed above 6 percent today. New York-based Moody''s Investors
Service rates both companies Ba2, two steps below investment
grade. </p>
<p>GM Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said Nov. 18 that
the company may offer a relatively small bond issue. Liddell
also said in the interview on CNBC there is no reason why GM
can''t get back to being a strong investment grade. </p>
<p>Noreen Pratscher, a spokeswoman for GM, said the company
doesn''t discuss bond offerings before issuing a regulatory
filing for the sale. </p>
<p>Post Bankruptcy </p>
<p>Yesterday credit swaps on GM were quoted for the first time
since the Detroit-based automaker''s bankruptcy after nearly a
century on the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>General Motors Corp., as the company was formerly known,
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 1, 2009,
after the failure of New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. in September 2008 froze credit markets and helped cause the
longest recession since the Great Depression. </p>
<p>GM paid $2.1 billion to taxpayers today, completing the
repurchase of shares issued under a U.S. government bailout. The
transaction brings the total that taxpayers received in return
for their investment in GM to more than $23 billion, the
Treasury Department said in a statement. The company raised more
than $20 billion in its return to public stock trading Nov. 18. </p>
<p>It''s a healthy thing that you''ve got an auto sector
again, Kraft said. </p>
<p>Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford''s 8.125 percent bonds fell 1
cent to 114.5 cents on the dollar as of 11:23 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-pricing reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt has climbed
from 97 cents on Feb. 10, Trace data show. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>Sometime later this month --
precisely when is a secret -- Sam Palmisano, chief executive
officer of International Business Machines Corp., will gather
his 15 senior vice presidents in the company''s walnut-paneled
boardroom in Armonk, New York, for an all-day brainstorm. </p>
<p>It''s the annual Global Technology Outlook, at which top
executives and scientists decide what ideas to chase most
vigilantly. Research chief John Kelly oversees the discussion as
eight other Ph.D. scientists present slides about half a dozen
trends the research team thinks IBM can''t ignore. The group
convenes at about 7:30 a.m., works through a lunch of sandwiches
and salads, and doesn''t quit until they''ve reached consensus. </p>
<p>Decisions made at the brainstorm shape which projects get
funded, which companies IBM will buy next year, and, for
investors, whether the company will extend its 26 straight
quarters of increased earnings per share. </p>
<p>The numbers are compelling, said Dick Glasebrook, a New
York-based managing director at the Straus Group unit of
Neuberger Berman, which owned 10.6 million IBM shares as of Sept.
30. There''s a high priority, as a differentiating factor, in
focusing on research. </p>
<p>IBM invested $5.8 billion in research and development last
year, 6.1 percent of revenue, compared with $3.0 billion, or 2.4
percent, at Hewlett Packard Co. That''s led to technologies such
as new microprocessor designs and an IBM supercomputer that will
compete on the Jeopardy!'' quiz show next year. </p>
<p>The company counts on Kelly and his team for the most
significant innovations and augments their efforts with niche
acquisitions. Since Palmisano became CEO in 2002, IBM has spent
about $28 billion on deals compared with more than $43 billion
each for HP and Oracle Corp. </p>
<p>More Than Invention </p>
<p>We''re not wandering off into the weeds relative to our
strategy, Kelly, 56, said in an interview. Sam spends not
only a lot of money, but a lot of time on this subject. </p>
<p>IBM''s 3,000 researchers play a role broader than invention.
At the brainstorm session and other forums, Kelly and his
scientists help forge strategy and deal plans. A year ago at the
meeting, they identified the digitization of health-care records
as a top priority, highlighting one gap in software that was
filled with a deal for Initiate Systems Inc. in March. </p>
<p>Kelly also sits on the committee that screens possible
acquisitions, along with MA chief Elias Mendoza. </p>
<p>They, more proactively than others, are really evaluating,
Is this something we need to go out and purchase or is this a
solution we can build'', said Jeff Bistrong, a Boston-based
managing director at investment bank Harris Williams  Co. who
has sold companies to IBM. </p>
<p>Revenue Growth? </p>
<p>The strategy hasn''t led to stronger revenue growth or
stock-market performance than rivals. In the past eight years,
IBM has boosted sales 15 percent, while HP and Oracle have more
than doubled revenue. Since the start of 2002, IBM shares have
climbed 21 percent, as HP and Oracle have more than doubled. </p>
<p>Still, IBM''s 26 quarters of per-share earnings increases
outstrips the six at HP and five for Oracle. Investors have
started to reward IBM. Its stock has outperformed Oracle and HP
since the start of 2009, rising 73 percent through yesterday and
hitting a record high last month. </p>
<p>IBM fell 60 cents to $145.22 at 11:34 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading and had climbed 11 percent this
year before today. </p>
<p>The 59-year-old Palmisano was openly critical of HP after
it struck a deal to buy the data-storage company 3Par Inc. for
$2.35 billion, about triple the company''s market value before
acquisition talks began. </p>
<p>I''m never worried about a competitor that doesn''t invest
in RD, he said in September. </p>
<p> Leo Apotheker, who took over as HP''s CEO last month, said
he plans to boost research spending at the company, which had
cut such investments under his predecessor, Mark Hurd. Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Brainstorm Preparation </p>
<p>Planning for IBM''s annual brainstorm takes months of
preparation. Kelly, a 30-year IBM veteran with a Ph.D. in
materials engineering, starts over the summer. He and his team
meet with venture capitalists, universities and clients. They
cull the information and narrow to five or six broad topics. </p>
<p>The chances of us being blindsided are greatly reduced by
this process, said Kelly. We scour internally, globally
around our research for opportunities, discontinuities and
threats. </p>
<p>While IBM won''t disclose what it will discuss this year,
the company has been focusing on four areas -- emerging markets,
cloud computing, analytics and its Smarter Planet initiative, or
the idea that highways and electrical systems can be made more
efficient through monitoring with digital sensors. Sixty percent
of the research budget goes to those areas. </p>
<p>GTO Breakthroughs </p>
<p>The GTO, as acronym-happy IBMers call it, can lead to
breakthroughs. In 2003, participants homed in on software that
could collect and analyze information in real-time. Following
the meeting, the mandate was just to build machines that have
the ability to sense the world, said Nagui Halim, the
researcher tapped to head the project. </p>
<p>Halim and other researchers created InfoSphere Streams,
software that identifies and analyzes data with stream computing.
It was introduced as a product last year, helping its segment
increase revenue by more than 10 percent. The technology has
helped TD Securities develop an automated options trading system
and Stockholm predict traffic flows. </p>
<p>Cloud Acquisition </p>
<p>Last year, Kelly and his team flagged the growing role that
technology was playing in health care. Though researchers were
developing ways for hospitals and insurers to share information,
they still needed software to integrate various records. That
led to the deal for Initiate, whose programs identify duplicate
patient entries in different databases and consolidate them. </p>
<p>We had quite a few research projects that had started in
health care, Robert Morris, vice president of services
research, said in an interview. We pulled them all together
and, when we did that, we started saying We need more here.'' </p>
<p>In some cases, Kelly, who has been research chief since
2007, suggests potential targets. Researchers in IBM''s lab in
Haifa, Israel, noticed XIV Information Systems, a local storage
company that can increase storage capacity as clients need it.
Kelly told the MA committee about XIV and IBM pounced. </p>
<p>We, working with MA guys and our storage system guys
said, Hey, here''s a company with some very interesting
technology, some very good people,'' Kelly said. </p>
<p>Long-Term Growth </p>
<p>Palmisano told shareholders in May that the company will
almost double operating earnings per share to $20 by 2015. IBM
will add about $20 billion in sales over that period from
investments in its four growth initiatives, he said, while
spending about $20 billion on acquisitions. </p>
<p>Research funding that isn''t spent on IBM''s four growth
platforms goes toward product launches, such as the newest
mainframe model, and exploratory projects, such as the
Jeopardy'' computer and an effort with candy maker Mars Inc. to
map the cocoa gene. </p>
<p>Often, research leads to a process or software code or some
other piece of intellectual property, which are all saved and
vetted by a governance board. Those deemed reusable land in
IBM''s Asset Hub -- an internal website divided into 17
industries, such as banking, and further subcategories, such as
financial risk. Consultants choose codes from an industry or
service as they start projects for clients. </p>
<p>IBM, which has spent about 6 percent of its revenue on
research for the past eight years, just completed its 2011
budget. Though the company won''t disclose specific figures,
Kelly said the company''s priorities are clear. </p>
<p>Sam and the board put their money where their mouth is,
he said. </p>

today. Goldman Sachs has a neutral recommendation on the
stock. </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading in the quarter was muted, though
this was offset somewhat by healthy results in Morgan
Stanley''s main equities business, the Goldman Sachs analysts
said. Equity issuance appears to be exceptionally solid,
probably the best sequential comparison across Morgan Stanley''s
businesses, they said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said Morgan Stanley had a very good year
overall in investment banking though it experienced continued
growing pains in its trading business. Revenue from its debt
capital markets unit will drop 20 percent in the quarter,
Goldman Sachs said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. increased bets against Eisai Co. as the
Japanese drugmaker''s best-selling medicine, the Aricept
Alzheimer''s disease treatment, loses patent protection. </p>
<p>JPMorgan raised its short position for clients or itself to
3.7 percent of Eisai''s shares, worth $380 million, while Goldman
Sachs boosted short holdings to $130 million, regulatory filings
dated Dec. 13 showed. Morgan Stanley  Co. disclosed the third-
biggest position in Eisai. Short-sellers typically sell borrowed
shares, seeking to profit by repurchasing them at lower prices. </p>
<p>The transactions have made Eisai the most shorted Japanese
stock, ahead of trading company Sumitomo Corp., which has $542
million of shares shorted by investors compared with its 1.49
trillion-yen ($17.8 billion) market value, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Eisai is trying to develop new products to buffer sales
amid competition from cheaper copies of Aricept, the world''s
top-selling pill to ease Alzheimer''s symptoms. U.S. regulators
allowed India''s Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. last month to begin
selling its generic version of Aricept. </p>
<p>The company''s shares gained 0.5 percent to 2,934 yen at the
3 p.m. close of trading on the Tokyo stock exchange. The shares
have gained for three days, reducing their year-to-date loss to
14 percent. </p>
<p>Takeshi Shimizu, an Eisai spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s sales of Eisai stock were reported by JPMorgan
Whitefriars Inc., a London-based institutional investment
management unit of the New York-based bank. JPMorgan spokesman
Brian Marchiony declined to comment, as did Sumiko Iwadate, a

<p>The 71,900 square-meter (773,925 square-foot) building at
Bishops Square, adjacent to Spitalfields Market in the City of
London financial district, was sold by Oman''s sovereign wealth
fund and Hammerson Plc, according to a statement today. </p>
<p>Rents are rising in London because of a scarcity of large
new office buildings. The financial crisis made banks unwilling
to lend to developers, causing construction in central London to
fall to its lowest in more than 20 years, according to real

the City rose by 25 percent this year. </p>
<p>We remain bullish on investing in high-quality, well-

<p>Theo Lubke, who headed the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York''s efforts to reform the private
derivatives market, joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help Wall
Street''s most profitable firm navigate the looming overhaul of
financial regulations. </p>
<p>Lubke, 44, started this month as chief regulatory reform
officer in Goldman Sachs'' securities division, according to a
memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The newly-created role will
allow Lubke to work closely with divisional and firm-wide
leadership to implement regulatory reform legislation, the
memo said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is hiring Lubke five months after Congress
mandated the regulation of the $583 trillion over-the-counter
derivatives market, which complicated efforts to resolve the
financial crisis. The reforms threaten to cut profits at dealers
because they will make swaps prices known to the public. Lubke''s
new firm employs a former New York Fed president and has an ex-
Fed board chairman as a director. The current president of the
New York Fed, William Dudley, also worked there. </p>
<p>It''s a pattern, said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street''s history. It''s troublesome stuff
and there needs to be some regulation so people don''t do it and
undermine public policy. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs who
confirmed the contents of the memo, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Lubke Reassigned </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve and New York Fed have strict conflict
of interest policies for its staff, including departing
employees, Jeffrey Smith, a spokesman for the New York Fed,
said in an e-mailed statement. In this instance, as in all
cases, these policies were strictly followed. </p>
<p>Senior Fed officials who leave are prohibited for six
months from attending any meetings with the central bank or from
any contact with it on matters related to the area in which the
official worked, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Lubke was reassigned to an administrative role at the Fed
in September so he could begin looking for a job outside the
bank, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. </p>
<p>In 2007, Timothy Geithner, then president of the New York
Fed, appointed Lubke to his former role, as the central bank
pushed for changes in the credit-default swap market. Geithner,
who''s now Treasury Secretary, started those efforts in 2005 when
he became concerned that an explosion of trading was threatening
the ability of banks and regulators to manage and monitor risks
that posed a threat to the financial system. </p>
<p>Wall Street Criticized </p>
<p>Last year, Lubke criticized Wall Street''s control over the
OTC derivatives market, where credit-default, interest-rate and
other swaps are traded privately between banks and their
customers. </p>
<p>It is simply unacceptable in today''s environment that the
design and structure of the OTC derivatives market can be
controlled by a handful of large dealers, Lubke said at an
International Swaps and Derivatives Association conference in
Beijing in April 2009. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July, requires most
swaps to be guaranteed by clearinghouses and traded on exchanges
or similar systems. Public prices may lead to compressed
differences between what buyers and sellers want to pay for the
contracts, known as the bid-offer spread, Howard Chen, a Credit
Suisse Group AG analyst in New York, wrote in a Dec. 7 note to
clients. </p>
<p>That could be combated by increases in the rate of swaps
trading and greater market efficiency that come from the new
regulations, Chen said in the note. </p>
<p>Both Ways'' </p>
<p>Lubke is the latest regulator to be hired by Wall Street''s
most profitable securities firm. Bankers who worked at Goldman
Sachs have also become regulators. </p>
<p>That street goes both ways, said Geisst, author of
books including The Last Partnerships: Inside the Great Wall
Street Money Dynasties (McGraw-Hill, 2001). They go from
Goldman to the Fed and they go from the Fed to Goldman, and
that''s the important part of it. </p>
<p>Other firms also have ties to the central bank and the
government. Last week, Citigroup Inc., the biggest bailout
recipient among U.S. banks during the financial crisis, hired
former White House Budget Director Peter Orszag to be vice
chairman of its investment-banking division. </p>
<p>Dudley, a former partner at Goldman Sachs and its chief
U.S. economist for a decade, joined the New York Fed in 2007 and
then succeeded Geithner as the central bank''s president in 2009.
E. Gerald Corrigan, who headed the New York Fed from 1985 to
1993, joined Goldman Sachs in 1994, where he went on to be co-
chair of its global risk-management committee and co-chair of
global compliance and control. </p>
<p>Corrigan, Friedman </p>
<p>Corrigan, 69, was appointed by the bank to help oversee a
business standards committee in May, a month after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud over
how it marketed a collateralized debt obligation. Goldman Sachs
agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle the suit. </p>
<p>Stephen Friedman, a former chairman of Goldman Sachs''
board, quit as chairman of the New York Fed''s board of directors
in May 2009 to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest
over his ties to the investment bank. Friedman, who served as
Goldman Sachs''s co-chairman with Robert Rubin from 1990 to 1992
before Rubin became Treasury Secretary, remains a Goldman Sachs
board member. </p>
<p>Geithner, who was named Treasury Secretary in January 2009,
hired former Goldman Sachs lobbyist Mark Patterson as his chief
of staff. Patterson recused himself for two years from any
issues that relate specifically to the bank, which he left in
April 2008. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. said it set the annual
base salary and target bonus of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
at $4.29 million, with additional payments in stock, options and
long-term incentive awards to be disclosed in March. </p>
<p>Read, named CEO on Dec. 5, was previously head of Pfizer''s
global pharmaceutical operations responsible for 85 percent of
company revenue. He will see a base salary increase of 40
percent, to $1.7 million from $1.21 million, the company said in
a filing. His bonus target more than doubled to $2.59 million,
from $1.16 million. </p>
<p>Read''s compensation figures don''t include stock, options
and long-term incentive pay, which will be disclosed in the next
proxy statement, typically filed in March, said Joan Campion, a
spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer. Read, a 32-year veteran
of the company, received compensation valued at $9.45 million in
2009, the most recent year for which total awards have been
included in regulatory filings. </p>
<p>Over the next five years, Pfizer faces generic competition
to products with $20 billion in annual sales, or almost a third
of the company''s revenue. Pfizer is eliminating jobs and
reducing costs as it absorbs the $68 billion acquisition of
Wyeth last year. Pfizer''s former CEO, Jeffrey Kindler, will
receive about $9.6 million in severance, bonus and short-term
incentive pay for 2010. </p>

<p>Canada''s National Energy Board gave
an Exxon Mobil Corp.-led group five years to start building a
C$16.2 billion ($15.9 billion) pipeline intended to haul Arctic
natural gas to southern Canada and the U.S. </p>
<p>More than three decades after the 1,220-kilometer (758-
mile) pipeline first was proposed for the Mackenzie River
valley, a three-member review panel today approved the conduit,
provided Exxon Mobil and its partners meet more than 200
conditions and begin construction by 2015. </p>
<p>The deadline is a hurdle for a project that Exxon Mobil
Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has said is probably a
decade away from being realized. In a July conference call with
analysts, Tillerson cited the high cost of shipping Arctic gas
south and the length of time it would take to build across semi-
sovereign tribal areas and indigenous hunting grounds as
obstacles to profitability. </p>
<p>Our decision is a major step toward allowing the project
to proceed, but it does not mean the project will be built,
the panel said in a 78-page report today, adding that it''s up to
the companies involved to decide if the pipeline makes economic
sense. </p>
<p>The 2015 timeframe causes us a little concern and will be
challenging, Pius Rolheiser, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil''s
Imperial Oil Ltd. unit, said in a telephone interview from
Calgary. It also depends on how long it takes to reach a
fiscal agreement with the government. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell </p>
<p>Imperial is also a partner in the development, along with
Royal Dutch Shell Plc of The Hague, and ConocoPhillips, based in
Houston. </p>
<p>The pipeline would follow the course of a north-flowing
river that cuts through the sparsely populated Northwest
Territories and empties into the Arctic Ocean. In 2007,
Tillerson said the project no longer was viable after the
cost estimate more than doubled amid soaring steel prices and
regulatory delays. </p>
<p>Low natural-gas prices stemming from a surplus of gas
flowing from continental U.S. fields also clouded the project''s
future, Ian Doig, the Calgary-based publisher of Doig''s Digest,
an oil-and-gas industry newsletter, said today in an interview
before the announcement. </p>
<p>The price of gas is a significant challenge, Doig said
in a telephone interview. The area is only represented by one
member of Canada''s Parliament, so the project doesn''t have a lot
of political clout behind it. </p>
<p>Parsons Lake, Taglu </p>
<p>The pipeline would tap fields that the U.S. Energy
Department estimates contain almost 6 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas. Exxon Mobil''s Taglu is the largest with an
estimated 3 trillion cubic feet, followed by ConocoPhillips'' 1.8
trillion-cubic-foot Parsons Lake field and a joint Exxon Mobil-
Shell-owned discovery called Niglintgak. </p>
<p>Over the first 20 years of operation, the conduit would
boost Canada''s gross domestic product by as much as C$42 billion
and generate up to C$14.3 billion in taxes and royalties, the
report said. </p>
<p>This is an important milestone, Environment Minister
John Baird said in a telephone interview after the report was
released. The process has taken a long time -- too long in my
judgment -- but we''re happy to see them move quickly with the
government''s response. </p>
<p>Cabinet Approval </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil and its partners would be required to build
lateral lines from the main pipeline to supply gas to
communities along the route, the report said. </p>
<p>All the panel is doing is giving the Imperial-led group a
list of conditions, Doig said. It''s kind of like a gift
certificate to be used within a certain period of time. The
panel''s recommendations still require approval by Prime Minister
Stephen Harper''s cabinet. </p>
<p>At full capacity, the pipeline would carry 1.2 billion
cubic feet of gas a day, or enough energy to supply about one in
every 10 U.S. homes. </p>
<p>The pipeline has been in the works since the early 1970s
and was shelved after a public inquiry into the potential impact
on the environment, wildlife and indigenous northern
communities. </p>
<p>Natural-gas futures in the U.S., the world''s largest market
for the furnace and factory fuel, peaked at $15.78 per million
British thermal units in December 2005. Since then, they''ve
plunged 75 percent to about $4 amid surging output from new
wells in Texas, Louisiana and Wyoming. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, who oversees the world''s largest
brokerage, said retail investors'' confidence has returned and
trading activity has picked up. </p>
<p>The investors have started coming back to the markets and
there has been a lot more activity in the last several months,
Gorman said today in an interview on CNBC. I''m confident next
year is going to be a better year for the retail investor, and
we''ve seen people take money out of cash and put it into
equities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
backed off its profit-margin goals for the brokerage in July,
blaming the May 6 market crash for scaring away retail
investors. Gorman, 52, had said earlier this year that the
unit''s pretax margin would increase to 15 percent by the end of
this year and top 20 percent by the end of 2011. The margin was
8 percent in the first nine months of the year. </p>
<p>We saw the biggest fall-off in retail activity after the
flash crash that I''ve seen since September 11, 2001, Gorman
said today. Investors are back, confidence is back. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, based in New York, purchased a controlling
stake in a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney last
year. Gorman, who led the brokerage before taking over as CEO
this year, said in a letter to shareholders in April that the
unit is going to play an increasingly important role in our
growth and profitability. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has to thread the needle on its bonus
decisions to reward both employees and shareholders, Gorman
said. The firm has told some employees to expect investment-
banking bonuses to decline 10 percent to 30 percent, two people
briefed on the matter said earlier this month. </p>

<p>General Mills Inc., the maker of
Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup, reported an 8.6 percent gain
in second-quarter profit, missing analysts'' projections as costs
of raw ingredients increased and discounts damped sales growth. </p>
<p>Net income in the period ended Nov. 28 rose to $613.9
million, or 92 cents a share, from $565.5 million, or 83 cents,
a year earlier, the Minneapolis-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding items such as tax gains, earnings were 76
cents, compared with the 78-cent average of estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell raised some cereal
prices mid-November to make up for surging ingredient expenses.
Powell, 56, has introduced items like chocolate-flavored
Cheerios to lure shoppers away from rival cereal makers Kellogg
Co. and Ralcorp Holdings Inc., which have dangled promotional
discounts to capture more sales. </p>
<p>The cereal category has remained sluggish in recent
months, but General Mills has been the relative winner, Alexia Howard, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a report to
clients this week. The New York-based analyst rates the shares
market perform. </p>
<p>General Mills rose 21 cents to $36.59 at 4:00 p.m. in New

percent this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. sold $876.45 million of bonds linked to U.S.
commercial real estate, pushing 2010 sales to $11.5 billion as
strategists forecast next year''s offerings will quadruple. </p>
<p>Property owners are pushing banks to offer better loan
terms as more lenders vie for a share of the $650 billion
commercial-mortgage bond market. Between 20 and 25 institutions
are seeking to originate loans they plan to package into
securities, up from about five competitors a year ago, New York-
based Standard  Poor''s said in a Dec. 2 report. Issuance
plunged to $3.4 billion in 2009 from a record $234 billion in
2007 after the financial crisis froze credit markets. </p>
<p>The CMBS lenders came back quickly, and borrowers are
benefiting, Greg Michaud, head of real estate finance at ING
Investment Management Americas in Atlanta, said in a telephone
interview. Twelve months ago, borrowers were happy to get
anything. Now they are really shopping around. </p>
<p>Today''s sale, tied mostly to payments on shopping center
and office-building loans, priced to yield 140 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate for a top-rated $376 million slice
maturing in 9.84 years, according to a person familiar with it.
The securities were initially marketed to yield between 130 and
135 basis points over swaps, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren''t public. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Interest-Only Loans </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs-Citigroup offering included a higher
percentage of so-called interest-only debt than sales earlier
this year, according to a Dec. 9 report from Fitch Ratings. Such
loans are considered riskier than mortgages that require the
landlord to pay down a portion of the principal. About 85.4
percent of the pool sold today pays principal during the life of
the loans, compared with more than 90 percent of offerings
earlier this year, Fitch said. </p>
<p>Today''s deal still marks a material improvement
compared with those from the boom ended in 2007, according to
Fitch. That year, as much as 87 percent of commercial mortgages
packaged into bonds delayed principal payments for at least a
portion of the life of the loan, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Relaxing Underwriting </p>
<p>Underwriting standards are usually the first metric to
loosen as lending rivalry increases, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
analysts said in a Nov. 24 report that forecast CMBS issuance
may reach $45 billion in 2011. </p>
<p>The competition is healthy because it means you have more
dollars chasing these loans, said Roger Lehman, an analyst at
BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. Financing is a key
component of the recovery in commercial real estate. It''s not a
cash market. </p>
<p>U.S. commercial real estate values peaked in October 2007,
when the Moody''s Real/Commercial Property Price Index touched
191.9. The measure bottomed at 105.4 in August, marking a 45
percent drop. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asked to be
removed from two state underwriting teams in Massachusetts after
Neil Morrison, the firm''s Boston-based public-finance banker,
helped Treasurer Tim Cahill''s failed run for governor. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the world''s most profitable investment bank,
has asked to be excluded from managing bond sales for the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and Massachusetts
Housing Finance Agency since October, according to state
officials. The New York-based firm has been senior banker on
about $7 billion of Massachusetts and agency bonds since 2001
and last was hired to sell securities for the government in
June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Morrison, 36, was an unpaid adviser to Cahill in his run
for governor, according to Juli Sweeney, a campaign spokeswoman.
The banker is no longer working for the firm, Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said yesterday. He wouldn''t
comment on the withdrawals from Massachusetts bond-sale teams. </p>
<p>Public-finance bankers are restricted from making political
contributions to an official of state and local issuers, which
includes a limit on volunteer help, according to industry
regulations. If bankers run afoul of the so-called pay-to-play
rules, a firm can be banned for two years from underwriting bond
offerings that the public official oversees or would control by
winning election. </p>
<p>They can give as much as $250 to a candidate in each
election without triggering the ban if they are eligible to vote
for the public official, the rule says. </p>
<p>Matter of Minutes'' </p>
<p>It''s the time commitment, said Christopher Kit'' Taylor, the former executive director of the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, which oversees the industry. If
he was doing any of this on company time, he''s going to go over
the $250 limit in a matter of minutes. </p>
<p>Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs''s chief executive officer,
created a committee to review the bank''s business standards in
May after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the
firm for fraud in April over the sale of a mortgage-linked
investment in 2007. In July, the bank paid $550 million to
settle the suit and in September it began a national advertising
campaign to repair its reputation. The company denied any
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Morrison said he is still employed at Goldman in an e-
mail sent from a personal account on Dec. 14. He said he needed
the firm''s permission to comment further. </p>
<p>Regulatory filings last updated yesterday listed Morrison
as a Goldman Sachs employee. A first deputy treasurer when he
left Cahill''s office in 2007, Morrison joined the bank in July
2008 from Zurich-based UBS AG. </p>
<p>Government Sachs'' </p>
<p>So many of the New York bank''s executives are former public
employees or have taken high-level government jobs that it
earned the nickname Government Sachs. Yesterday, the firm
said Kathleen Brown, its managing director in charge of winning
municipal-finance business on the West Coast, would move to a
new job in Chicago after her brother, Jerry Brown, won election
as California''s next governor. </p>
<p>Cahill, 52, ran as an independent this year against
Democratic incumbent Deval Patrick and Republican Charlie Baker.
Paul Loscocco, Cahill''s running mate, quit the campaign before
the November election, citing differences over negative
advertising. </p>
<p>A Top Adviser </p>
<p>Loscocco said Morrison, a former aide now at Goldman
Sachs, was serving as a top political adviser to Cahill
and coordinating ads, according to an Oct. 8 statement. Loscocco
didn''t return calls seeking additional comment. </p>
<p>Morrison, in a separate e-mail yesterday, referred
questions about his nonexistent formal role with the Cahill
committee to the campaign. </p>
<p>Morrison was not employed by the campaign and served only
as an informal adviser, Sweeney, the spokeswoman, said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The banker was also identified as a campaign political
adviser in a response to a lawsuit the Cahill campaign brought
in October against Strategic National Consulting LLC, the Grand
Rapids, Michigan, firm it hired. Copies of e-mails in documents
on file in the case show Morrison was communicating with the
consultants on behalf of Cahill. </p>
<p>Morrison E-Mails </p>
<p>This is to notify you that the Cahill campaign (the
campaign'') accepts your offer, Morrison wrote in one of the e-
mails in the documents. It was sent from a personal account to
John Yob, Strategic National''s chief executive officer, and John
Weaver, another paid Cahill adviser, on Aug. 13, 2010, a Friday,
at 3:31 p.m., regarding negotiations to lower their fees. </p>
<p>On behalf of the treasurer I want to let you know that we
are in receipt of this proposal and we are very appreciative of
the obvious good faith effort that you have put forward,
Morrison said at 5:24 p.m. on Aug. 11 in an e-mail about fees.
I will speak to Treasurer Cahill and get back to you with his
thoughts. </p>
<p>Yob didn''t return calls seeking comment. Weaver declined to
comment when reached by telephone. </p>
<p>Morrison joined the treasurer''s office in January 2003
after working on Cahill''s first campaign for the post in 2002.
The aide rose to first deputy and chief of staff three years
later, overseeing bond sales, the state pension fund and the
lottery, according to Cahill''s website. He left in 2007 to join
UBS and later went to Goldman Sachs, regulatory filings show. </p>
<p>City Councilor, Lawyer </p>
<p>Before helping Cahill win the treasurer''s office, Morrison
was a city councilor in Taunton, a community of about 56,000
residents southwest of Boston. The graduate of Boston College
holds a law degree from Suffolk University in Boston, according
to information on the treasurer''s website. </p>
<p>Bond dealers are prohibited from engaging in municipal
securities business with issuers if certain political
contributions have been made to officials of such issuers,
according to the MSRB''s Rule G-37. </p>
<p>Bankers can volunteer on an issuer''s behalf, according to
the rulemaking board, which is based in Alexandria, Virginia.
They run afoul of G-37 rules if they use the bank''s resources or
incur company expenses while they volunteer, the regulator says
on its website. </p>
<p>An employee of a dealer generally can donate his or her
time to an issuer official''s campaign without this being viewed
as a contribution by the dealer to the official, as long as the
employee is volunteering during non-work hours and the dealer
isn''t paying the employee''s salary, the board''s website says. </p>
<p>No Contributions </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs made no contributions to state or local
public officials in Massachusetts through the first three
quarters of this year, according to regulatory filings. A
contribution can mean any gift, subscription, loan, advance,
or deposit of money or anything of value, according to the
rulemaking board. The firm''s next quarterly filing is due on
Jan. 31, said Ernesto Lanza, the board''s general counsel. </p>
<p>Municipal bond dealers can apply for a waiver if they
believe they may face an underwriting ban from the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, which enforces rulemaking board
regulations. Finra has granted G-37 exemptions, according to
letters on its website. Nancy Condon, an authority spokeswoman,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The volunteer stuff is tricky because people don''t always
understand their volunteer work has value, said Julie Vasady-
Kovacs, a lawyer who specializes in political law at Kelley Drye
 Warren LLP in New York. </p>
<p>Piper Jaffray </p>
<p>Minnesota in 2005 banned Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray
Cos. from handling negotiated underwriting and financial
advisory work because of contributions by a municipal finance
professional that exceeded the G-37 limit, according to a press
report at the time. Banks may face fines if they serve as an
underwriter when they should have been banned from participating
in a bond sale, said Taylor, the former MSRB executive director. </p>
<p>In Boston, Goldman Sachs requested that it be removed from
the underwriting team at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority when contacted recently about managing a new bond
offering, according to Jonathan Davis, the agency''s chief
financial officer. </p>
<p>They asked more to be on the sidelines and not
participate in anything, Davis said. He declined further
comment. The agency is controlled by the governor''s office. </p>
<p>The bank made a similar request to the Massachusetts
Housing Finance Agency, which is overseen by a board appointed
by the governor. </p>
<p>MassHousing received a call from Goldman Sachs in October
in which they asked to be removed from all MassHousing bond
deals, said Thomas J. Farmer, a spokesman for the state
agency, in an e-mailed statement. After confirming that their
request had nothing to do with the credit quality of
MassHousing, we complied with their request. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has also managed state general-obligation
bond sales for the treasurer''s office and in June was the senior
banker on a $486.5 million issue by the Massachusetts Water
Pollution Abatement Trust, which is controlled by Cahill. David
Kibbe, a spokesman for Cahill, declined to comment on Goldman
Sachs''s status on the treasurer''s underwriting teams. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world''s
biggest company by market capitalization, discovered oil in a
deep-water field in Brazil''s Santos Basin after hitting a dry
hole in the same block last year. </p>
<p>Traces of oil were found in the well, known as Sabia-1, in
the BM-S-22 block, according to a posting on the website of
Brazil''s National Petroleum Regulator. Exxon last year failed to
find oil or natural gas at the Guarani well in the same block. </p>
<p>Irving, Texas-based Exxon said Nov. 11 that it started
drilling the well using Seadrill Ltd.''s West Polaris rig. The
well, which hasn''t yet been declared commercially viable, is in
the so-called pre-salt area of the Santos Basin where Tupi and
Libra, the two largest oil finds in the Americas in 34 years,
are located. </p>
<p>"We are continuing to drill the well to its target depth,"
Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman in Houston, said today in an
e-mailed statement. "The details of our drilling program are
confidential." </p>
<p>Exxon''s Esso Exploracao Santos Brasileira Ltda. unit owns
40 percent of the block, Hess Brasil Petroleo Ltda. owns 40
percent and Petroleo Brasileiro SA owns 20 percent. The well''s
name is 3ESSO5SPS, according to the oil regulator. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. received a June trial
date for its lawsuit claiming that PepsiCo Inc.''s Trop50 brand
of fruit juices copies the patented and trademarked look of
Coca-Cola''s billion-dollar Simply juice line. </p>
<p>The trade-dress and patent infringement trial will begin
June 13, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake said today in Houston.
Coca-Cola''s request to permanently bar the sale of Trop50 in its
current packaging will be heard at the same time, Lake said. </p>
<p>The rules allow the court to consolidate a preliminary
injunction hearing with trial on the merits, Lake said at a
scheduling hearing. It makes sense to try this case once and
only once. And that''s going to be before a jury. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola sued PepsiCo in October claiming that the new
packaging for the low-calorie Trop50 brand will likely deceive
consumers and dilute the quality of Coke''s own brand of
premium juices, called Simply. </p>
<p>PepsiCo chose packaging that closely mimics the
distinctive and nonfunctional Simply trade dress and patented
Simply closure, ostensibly to revitalize PepsiCo''s fledgling
Trop50 brand, Coca-Cola''s lawyers said in court papers. </p>
<p>Trade-Dress Rights </p>
<p>Coke has no protectable trade-dress rights, PepsiCo
lawyers said in a court filing. Nor is there any likelihood of
confusion between Trop50 and the Simply juice products. </p>
<p>Lake told lawyers for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo that they
should try to settle the dispute out of court to avoid the
expense of trial. </p>
<p>Timothy Durst, a lawyer for Purchase, New York-based
PepsiCo, told the judge that the parties would be revisiting
opportunities for mediation in January. </p>
<p>Lawyers for PepsiCo and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola declined to
comment after the 20-minute hearing. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola introduced its Simply line in 2001 with Simply
Orange. Simply Grapefruit and other varieties followed. The
design is carafe-style with an oversized cap or closure. </p>
<p>PepsiCo began selling the Trop50 line in 2009. In August,
it introduced the new design, which is a clear plastic carafe-
style bottle with a large cap. </p>
<p>Sales of the Simply line grew from $650 million during the
period from 2001 to 2005 to more than $2.4 billion from 2006 to
2009, Coca-Cola said in court papers. It estimates sales this
year at more than $1 billion. Coca-Cola said it has spent more
than $160 million marketing the brand. </p>
<p>The Simply line is managed by Coca-Cola''s Minute Maid unit,
based in Sugar Land, Texas. </p>
<p>PepsiCo rose 22 cents, or 0.33 percent, to $65.97 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Coca-Cola climbed 36
cents, or 0.55 percent, to $65.70. </p>
<p>The case is Coca-Cola Co. v. PepsiCo Inc., 10-04184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). </p>

<p>A Walt Disney Co. union that''s
seeking a new labor agreement for some of the entertainment
company''s hotel workers is proposing executive pay curbs,
singling out board member Fred Langhammer for criticism. </p>
<p>Unite Here is asking shareholders to limit senior
executives to one eligibility test for stock awards, according a
regulatory filing. The group is also seeking to curb potential
severance payments for executives. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, will hold its annual
meeting on March 23 in Salt Lake City. Current policy at Disney
allows executives up to three eligibility tests for stock
awards, Unite Here said. Langhammer, head of the compensation
committee since 2008, also had a hand in pay at American
International Group Inc. as a director from January 2006 until
he resigned in 2008, it said. </p>
<p>During this period, AIG endured criticism for showering
large bonuses and lavish junkets on top executives as the
company imploded, the union, which represents Disneyland hotel
workers, said in the filing. </p>
<p>Disney offered a package that includes wage increases, paid
sick leave and health care, John Nicoletti, a spokesman for
Disneyland in Anaheim, California, said today in an interview.
Of 31 Disneyland unions, only Unite Here hasn''t reached an
agreement. </p>
<p>This is another publicity stunt from Local 11 leadership
to distract from the fact that after three years their members
are still without a contract, Nicoletti said. </p>
<p>Langhammer didn''t respond to a phone request for comment
left at Estee Lauder Cos., where he is chairman of global
affairs. </p>
<p>Re-Test Policy </p>
<p>AIG, based in New York, was once the world''s largest
insurer. It was pushed to the brink of collapse in 2008 as
investments tied to the housing market soured. The company
accepted a U.S. government rescue that has swelled in value to
$182.3 billion. </p>
<p>In fiscal 2008 and 2009, Disney allowed senior executives
to re-test whether they should receive performance-based stock
grants using different criteria, the union said in the filing.
That delinks pay from company performance, Unite Here said. </p>
<p>Disney''s compensation committee in fiscal 2009 voted to
allow executives three tests, according to the filing. Only one
re-test was performed in calendar 2010, the union said, citing
earlier Disney regulatory filings. </p>
<p>There is currently no guarantee that Disney will not
introduce more re-testing opportunities in future years, the
union said. Disney should better tie compensation to
performance by implementing a policy disallowing re-tests. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, rose 4 cents to
$37.05 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 15 percent this year. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. gave Chief
Marketing Officer Joel Ewanick oversight of its worldwide
promotions operations as the company considers expanding its
brands into additional international markets. </p>
<p>Ewanick''s new title will be global chief marketing officer,
Detroit-based GM said today in a statement. Former Chief
Executive Officer Ed Whitacre hired Ewanick, 50, from Nissan
Motor Co. in May as vice president of U.S. marketing. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson, who took over in
September, wants GM to increase its marketing efforts and seek
growth opportunities, Ewanick said today in an interview.
Ewanick said one of his top priorities will be finding new
markets for GM''s Buick, Cadillac and GMC brands, which get most
of their sales in the U.S., and for Chevrolet. </p>
<p>We''re looking to aggressively expand with all four brands
wherever they can go, Ewanick said. There is no reason the
Buick LaCrosse can''t sell in other markets. I have a fair amount
of experience with European brands. The Cadillac CTS would sell
well in Europe. </p>
<p>Ewanick said expanding into other markets will take time
because GM needs to develop distribution channels and brand
awareness. He also is looking at ways to use marketing in
multiple markets to get economies of scale. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said a pilot project to boost production by

and Kuwait showed very promising results. </p>
<p>Chevron is trying to boost production from the Wafra field
in the so-called Neutral Zone shared between the two countries
by as much as 600,000 barrels a day once a new method for
injecting steam is applied on a large scale. </p>
<p>We have 16 steam-injection wells in the field and I can
tell you that the results that came out were very promising,
Ganesh Thakur, Chevron''s vice president and global adviser for
reservoir management, told an industry conference today in
Dharan, Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>The Wafra field will become the world''s largest project for
oil recovery with steam injection, once the company applies it
to the entire field, Thakur said. </p>
<p>Chevron began injecting steam at the site in June 2009 to
extract more crude. The San Ramon, California-based company is
still testing the steam-flooding technology on a small part of
the Wafra field. </p>
<p>The cost of the pilot project is $340 million and to apply
the technology to the entire field would cost several billion

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank, bought the former offices of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in London''s Canary Wharf district for 495 million
pounds ($769 million) to use as its investment bank''s European
headquarters. </p>
<p>JPMorgan purchased the 1 million square-foot (93,000
square-meter) building at 25 Bank Street and extended an
agreement to develop a nearby site, seller Canary Wharf Group
Plc said today in a statement. The bank will also buy 60
Victoria Embankment, a City of London property that it has
leased since 1991, New York-based JPMorgan said in a separate
statement. </p>
<p>A large bank such as JPMorgan needs to have the majority
of its European operations based in London, said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. It''s just
not practical for them to move the business elsewhere. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which employs more than 11,000 people in the U.K.
capital, is moving to Canary Wharf in 2012 from the City of
London financial district, where its investment bank staff is
scattered across four properties. The switch will increase the
number of people working on the entire 97-acre (39-hectare)
Canary Wharf estate to more than 100,000. </p>
<p>The bank is paying 41 percent more than the value given to
the tower by Canary Wharf as of June 30. The difference equals
about three years of rent. </p>
<p>The opportunity for our investment bank to be located in
one state-of-the-art building allows us to upgrade our
operational capabilities and maintain our strong position in the
region, Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s
investment bank, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Songbird Rises </p>
<p>Songbird Estates Plc, the majority owner of Canary Wharf,
advanced the most in more than five weeks in London trading. The
shares gained 3.5 pence, or 2.6 percent, to 139 pence. That was
the most since Nov. 12 when the shares rose 2.7 percent. </p>
<p>U.K.-based banks have threatened to move abroad because of
rising taxes and tighter regulation. Barclays Plc and HSBC
Holdings Plc said in September they may move headquarters if the
government decides to break up the banks. Standard Chartered Plc
said in August it may quit London if new taxes are imposed on
lenders. </p>
<p>This is a tremendous coup for London, London Mayor
Boris Johnson said in an e-mailed statement. Banking is one of
the few global industries in which we truly excel. JPMorgan''s
commitment to London will help ensure the capital retains its
position as a banking powerhouse. </p>
<p>Riverside South </p>
<p>JPMorgan is continuing to work with Canary Wharf Group to
develop the Riverside South site that it previously planned to
use as headquarters for all its London employees. It bought the
site in November 2008 and by next year will have invested more
than 300 million pounds. </p>
<p>Canary Wharf will now have the right to make the first
offer to buy the site. Previously it had the exclusive option to
buy it at a fixed price. The development agreement has been
extended to 2016 from 2013. </p>
<p>Canary Wharf will also receive 144.5 million pounds from
AIG International Group Inc., the U.S. insurer that had to be
rescued by the U.S. government, to cancel a commitment to insure
Lehman''s rental payments for up to four years in the event of
default, the developer said in the statement. </p>
<p>AIG posted 224 million pounds of collateral in March last
year, after its credit rating was lowered, in case Lehman
defaulted. Nomura International Plc, which bought Lehman''s
European operations, exercised an option to vacate the building
effective Sept. 30. </p>
<p>Canary Wharf </p>
<p>Canary Wharf''s combined receipts from JPMorgan and AIG of
639.5 million pounds compares with a book value of 550 million
pounds as of June 30, according to Songbird''s semi-annual
report. </p>
<p>It looks a very good deal for Canary Wharf on the face of
it, Robbie Duncan, an analyst at Nomura, said in a telephone
interview. It shows they are both quite bullish about the
London office market. </p>
<p>The building was built in 2003 for Lehman on a 30-year
lease. The securities firm filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history when it failed in September 2008. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. said it resumed
output from the Oso field in Nigeria more than a month after its
gas and condensate platform there was attacked by militants. </p>
<p>We have restarted 15,000 barrels per day of condensate
from the Oso field, spokesman Ozemoya Okordion said in an e-
mailed response to questions today. No firm time for restart
of natural gas liquids production is available at this time. </p>
<p>Production of about 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day
was shut at the platform as a precaution after eight workers
were kidnapped in the attack, Exxon Mobil said on Nov. 16. The
Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, the main armed
group in the region, claimed responsibility for the attack. </p>
<p>Troops raided militant camps on Nov. 17 and freed hostages
taken in attacks on the Exxon facility, including those of Royal
Dutch Shell Plc''s local unit and Afren Plc, the army said. </p>
<p>Attacks by armed groups in the delta cut Nigeria''s oil
production by more than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon
Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni SpA run joint
ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.
that pump more than 90 percent of the West African nation''s oil. </p>
<p>Chevron''s Nigerian unit suspended oil output through its
Dibi-Abiteye pipeline in the delta after an attack by a militant
group on Dec. 17 caused a breach, a company spokesman said. </p>
<p>The breach is being investigated and we are reviewing our
operations, Scott Walker said today in an e-mailed statement.
He didn''t give details. </p>
<p>The Niger Delta Liberation Force claimed responsibility for
attacks on three oil flow stations in Nigeria''s Delta State
belonging to Chevron Corp. and Eni SpA''s local unit, a spokesman
for the group said in an e-mailed statement on Dec. 18. Eni
officials didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Nigeria is Africa''s largest oil producer and fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports. </p>

since September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Unplanned and planned refinery outages can increase prices
for refined products as refiners turn to spot markets to help

<p>Morgan Crucible Co., SGL Carbon SE
and three other companies fined seven years ago by the European
Union over a graphite cartel were sued in the U.K. on behalf of
rail companies in Britain, Germany and Italy. </p>
<p>The London lawsuit filed on behalf of companies including
Deutsche Bahn AG seeks to recover overpayments for carbon and
graphite products, used for transferring electricity in train
motors, from 1988 to 1999, the law firms Hausfeld  Co. LLP and
Cuatrecasas, Goncalves Pereira, said in a statement today. </p>
<p>EU antitrust regulators in 2003 issued a fine of 101
million euros ($132.7 million) against SGL, France''s Carbone
Lorraine SA, Austria''s Hoffmann  Co. and Schunk GmbH and its
units. While Morgan Crucible received immunity from the EU fines
because it was the first to cooperate, its former Chief
Executive Officer Ian Norris was sentenced to 18 months in
prison in a U.S. case over his role in the cartel. </p>
<p>The case is probably the most significant claim of its
kind brought in Europe to date, Anthony Maton, a lawyer at
Hausfeld, said in the statement. The rail companies seek
restitution in respect of damage suffered over many years from a
long running and hard core cartel. </p>
<p>Competition Appeal Tribunal </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed last week in the Competition Appeal
Tribunal, where U.K. antitrust cases are heard. All the
companies in the EU case are named in the civil lawsuit. </p>
<p>Tino Fritsch, spokesman for Wiesbaden, Germany-based SGL
Carbon, said the company sold the involved subsidiaries around
2003. </p>
<p>In Germany, they wouldn''t have a chance with this lawsuit
because the statute of limitations would have expired, Fritsch
said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>David Eagleton, a U.K. spokesman for Heuchelheim, Germany-
based Schunk, didn''t immediately return a call for comment.
Calls to Windsor, England-based Morgan Crucible and Mersen, the
Paris-based company which earlier this year changed its name
from Carbone Lorraine, weren''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>A similar lawsuit against Morgan Crucible and the other
cartel members was filed in 2007 by Emerson Electric Co. and
four other companies that claim they were overcharged for
graphite electrical parts used in motors, tramways, electric car
windows and air conditioners. That case is pending. </p>
<p>Other plaintiffs in today''s case include the London-based
train leasing company Angel Trains Ltd., Italian train operator
Trenitalia SpA, the Dutch railway company Nederlandse Spoorwegen
and the Portuguese state railway CP-Comboios de Portugal EPE. </p>
<p>140 Meetings </p>
<p>During the cartel period, the rail companies spent a total
of hundreds of millions of euros on affected products, the
law firms said. </p>
<p>The Brussels-based commission said the cartel operated
between October 1988 and December 1999, holding more than 140
meetings to decide price increases for a broad range of
products. The companies controlled 93 percent of the market. </p>
<p>National courts consider EU decisions to be binding proof
that the anti-competitive behavior took place, the law firms
said. </p>
<p>The case is Deutsche Bahn AG  Others v. Morgan Crucible
Co.  Others, 1173/5/7/10, Competition Appeal Tribunal (London). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s top
executives view investment banking as having the best prospects
next year and expect fixed-income to pick up as well, according
to Nomura Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura in New York, described
Goldman Sachs''s view of the market in a note to investors
following a meeting with Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, and Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, makes most of its money trading fixed-income,
currencies and commodities, known as FICC. Yet it''s the
investment-banking business, which includes mergers and
acquisitions and underwriting stocks and bonds, that may show
the fastest growth next year, Goldman executives told Schorr. </p>
<p>Goldman remains reasonably bullish on the outlook for
investment-banking activity in 2011, Schorr said. In fact,
Lloyd listed investment banking as the business that he''s most
confident in as we close out 2010. </p>
<p>The firm ranks second to Morgan Stanley among global
mergers and acquisitions announced in 2010 and is third after
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co. among managers of equity
and equity-linked offerings worldwide this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In a year of record high-yield debt
underwriting, Goldman ranks sixth, the data show. </p>
<p>Revenue Sources </p>
<p>Investment banking accounted for about 11 percent of
Goldman Sachs''s revenue in the first nine months of 2010,
whereas FICC comprised 51 percent of revenue in the period.
Blankfein and Viniar said FICC trading may pick up next year
because the market''s view on interest rates and inflation are
likely to change at some point, Schorr wrote. </p>
<p>When changes in perception occur on these fronts, it
typically leads to a flurry of activity, Schorr wrote. In
addition, wide day-to-day swings in prices usually happen
before a big turn in the market, which will then lead to a
pickup in activity. </p>
<p>Regulatory changes, such as the Volcker rule''s ban on
proprietary trading and new capital requirements, may reduce
Goldman Sachs''s return on equity to a number below the firm''s
previous peak, Schorr estimated. He said that Blankfein and
Viniar didn''t agree that regulations will definitely reduce
returns. </p>
<p>Management feels like there are still a lot of moving
parts, so they are not ready to concede that future returns will
necessarily be a lot lower than the past, Schorr wrote. </p>
<p>Irish Debt </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which had $231 million of Irish government
obligations at the end of September, doesn''t face much direct
exposure to European sovereign debt problems, Schorr said. </p>
<p>Still, we do think management has concerns regarding the
impact that stresses in Europe could have on the macro economy
and funding costs around the globe, Schorr wrote. If there
was a sovereign restructuring (which we think seems hard to
avoid at some point), funding costs would rise around the globe
and be a drag on the global financial system, Schorr said. </p>
<p>Schorr recommends buying Goldman Sachs stock, which he
predicts will reach a price target of $180 from its $164.04
close on Dec. 17. </p>
<p>He expects the firm to earn $7.65 billion, or $13.10 a
share, for the full year, down from $12.2 billion, or $22.13, a
year earlier. Schorr''s earnings estimate is below the $8.39
billion, or $13.74 a share, average estimate of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>A U.S. trade agency will consider
whether imports of Microsoft Corp.''s Xbox gaming system should
be barred after Motorola Inc.''s Mobility unit said that it
infringes patents. </p>
<p>The International Trade Commission in Washington said Dec.
17 it would investigate the complaint filed last month by
Motorola Mobility. Notice of the investigation was posted on the
agency''s website. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s biggest software maker, filed a
lawsuit on Nov. 9 accusing Motorola of breaching contractual
obligations to fairly license patents on wireless networking and
video coding to be used in the Xbox. A day later, Motorola filed
patent-infringement complaints in Florida and Wisconsin. The ITC
case contains allegations similar to those filed in Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Microsoft has said Motorola is demanding patent royalties
that are wholly disproportionate to the royalty rate that its
patents should command under any reasonable calculus. Motorola
has said the demand was a fair offer that Microsoft refused
to accept. </p>
<p>The ITC is a quasi-judicial agency that investigates
allegations of unfair trade practices and has the power to ban
imports of products found to infringe U.S. patents. It typically
completes its investigations in about 15 months. </p>
<p>The new case is in the Matter of Certain Gaming and
Entertainment Consoles, 337-752, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). </p>
<p>Apple Seeks Patent on Mobile Phone App-Sharing Method </p>
<p>Apple Inc., maker of the iPad and the iPhone, is seeking a
patent on a technology that would permit users to share
applications with each other. </p>
<p>The intent of the invention is the purchase -- through an
Apple Apps Store -- of an application by the user with whom it
is shared. </p>
<p>The seed of the application is transmitted from mobile
device to mobile device, so that the recipient, who may like the
application on the sender''s phone, doesn''t have to go to the
trouble of looking it up at the App Store. The recipient can
then use the mobile device to pay for and activate the
application </p>
<p>According to Apple''s 2010031281 application, published in
the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Dec. 9,
some applications that contain sensitive data, such as a medical
database, can be structured so that particular application can''t
be shared. </p>
<p>The only named inventor listed on the application is Edward
D. Steakley. According to the membership database of the State
Bar of California, Steakley, a lawyer, is an in-house counsel at
Apple. </p>
<p>Apple filed the application for the patent in June 2009. </p>

<p>Judge Issues Permanent Order Against Catcher in Rye'' Sequel </p>
<p>Fredrik Colting''s sequel to J.D. Salinger''s Catcher in
the Rye can''t be published in the U.S., according to an order
by a federal judge in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The late Salinger published Catcher in 1951, and the
coming-of-age novel captured the imagination of several
generations of readers. The book, about the disaffected
adolescent Holden Caulfield, sold more than 10 million copies in
its first 10 years of publication. </p>
<p>Colting, under the pen name John David California,
published 60 Years Later, with his own publisher, Windupbird
Publishing, in 2009. The plot revolved around a meeting between
a 76-year-old Caulfield and the 90-year-old author. </p>
<p>Salinger sued for copyright infringement in June 2009 and
died in January 2010 at the age of 91. His survivors continued
the case as plaintiffs. </p>
<p>In May 2010, a federal appeals court told a lower court
judge to reconsider her July 2009 ruling that blocked
publication of Colting''s book. </p>
<p>In her Dec. 14 order, U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts
ordered a permanent ban on the publication of the book. She
dismissed all claims in the case and ordered each side to pay
its own attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>

District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Chocolate Reindeer, Bunnies Not Protected, EU Court Says </p>
<p>Reindeer, bunnies and mice aren''t protected species when
they''re made of chocolate, a European Union court ruled. </p>
<p>Lindt  Spruengli AG, the world''s largest maker of premium
chocolate, and August Storck KG lost separate court challenges
to get EU trademark protection for their chocolate Easter
bunnies, mice and reindeer. </p>
<p>A rabbit, a reindeer and a small bell are typical shapes
in which chocolate and chocolate goods are presented
particularly at Easter and Christmas, the European Union
General Court, the region''s second-highest tribunal, ruled Dec.
17. The shapes are devoid of any distinctive character. </p>
<p>Lindt, based in Kilchberg, Switzerland, has since 2004
failed to get EU-wide trademark protection for the shapes of a
plain chocolate bunny and chocolate bunnies and reindeer wrapped
in gold foil with red ribbon around their necks. It also failed
to get protection for the ribbon and attached bell. The EU
trademark agency based in Alicante, Spain, said in 2008 that the
shapes were too common. The agency also rejected Storck''s
trademark bid for the shape of a chocolate mouse. </p>
<p>This now means Lindt can''t use an EU trademark right to
stop other companies from making similar chocolate bunnies,
Olaf Gillert, a partner specializing in trademark law at law
firm Taylor Wessing LLP in Dusseldorf, said in a telephone
interview. Still, it doesn''t mean that in the future companies
can go ahead and make one-to-one copies. </p>
<p>Lindt has other means to defend its rights, he said. It
could argue it has rights based on the fame of its product or
use national competition rules to enforce product shape, Gillert
said. A question then would be whether consumers really
recognize the golden bunny as being a Lindt product. </p>
<p>Sylvia Kaelin, a spokeswoman for Lindt, declined to
immediately comment, saying she hadn''t yet seen the ruling.
Bernd Roessler, a spokesman for Berlin-based Storck, declined to
immediately comment. </p>
<p>Lindt in 2001 gained a trademark valid across the 27-nation
EU for a chocolate Easter bunny wrapped in gold foil emblazoned
with the word Lindt and bearing a red ribbon. In today''s
case Lindt was seeking protection for the same bunny, minus the
name, which would have given it wider rights. </p>
<p>Lindt already used its existing EU trademark to block an
Austrian chocolate maker from selling products similar to its
own 58-year-old Easter rabbit. This led to a dispute that
resulted in a ruling by the EU''s top court last year that the
trademark can be challenged if the Austrian chocolate maker
proves Lindt registered it in bad faith. </p>
<p>The cases are T-336/08, T-337/08, T-346/08, T-395/08
Chocoladefabriken Lindt  Spruengli v OHMI, and T-13/09, Storck
v. OHMI. </p>
<p>Wal-Mart, UFCW Reach Accord in Canadian Trademark Battle </p>

<p>The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had objected to
the United Food and Commercial Workers Union''s use of the Wal-
Mart logo from a union run website, according to the newspaper. </p>
<p>Terms of the settlement weren''t disclosed, the newspaper

<p>Sheboygan''s Lakeshore Metro''s New Name Opposed by Bus Company </p>
<p>The city-run bus system in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, may have
to change its name to avoid a trademark conflict with a
transportation service for the elderly and disabled, the
Sheboygan Press reported. </p>
<p>After the bus system changed its name from Sheboygan
Transit to Lakeside Metro and spent more than $30,000 to put new
logos on the buses, counsel for Lakeshore Transportation, based
in nearby Cascade, Wisconsin, complained, the newspaper
reported. </p>
<p>Lakeshore Transportation''s lawyer, Daniel Kattman of
Milwaukee''s Reinhart, Boerner  Van Deuren SC, told the
newspaper that customers are confused by the name similarity,
and some have expressed anger that they can''t use their city bus
tickets on the private transportation company''s buses. </p>
<p>If the city doesn''t remove all references to Lakeshore
from its buses and promotional material, the transportation
company will file an infringement case, according to the
newspaper. </p>
<p>NBA Asks Chinese Court to Overturn Adverse Trademark Ruling </p>
<p>NBA Properties Inc., the manager of the National Basketball

People''s Daily reported. </p>
<p>The sports group is appealing a ruling that permitted a
Fujian-based sporting goods team to register Lakes Team and
its Chinese translation as a trademark for beer and other
beverages, according to People''s Daily. </p>
<p>The appeal group said the owners of the Los Angeles Lakers
mark hadn''t proven it was well-enough known name prior to the
Fujian company''s registration, the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>The NBA is disputing the board''s contention that the public
isn''t confused by the beverage company''s trademark, according to
People''s Daily. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software maker, will announce a version of its Windows computer
operating system that runs on ARM Holdings Plc technology for
the first time, said two people familiar with Microsoft''s plans. </p>
<p>The new product will debut at the Consumer Electronics Show
in January, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because Microsoft''s plans are confidential. The software would
be tailored for battery-powered devices, such as tablet
computers and other handhelds, the people said. </p>
<p>The operating system would give Microsoft another way to
attack the market for tablets and phones, where it''s lost ground
to Apple Inc. and Google Inc. ARM chips -- made by Qualcomm
Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are
used in most smartphones, as well as Apple''s best-selling iPad. </p>
<p>A full-featured version of Windows for ARM chips is the
best way for Microsoft to make a dent in the iPad''s lead, said
Robert Breza, a Minneapolis-based analyst for RBC Capital
Markets. While Windows is dominant in the personal-computer
market, it hasn''t parlayed that into tablet success yet. </p>
<p>They''ve got to come back with a product that''s better
than me too'' and is equal if not better in features, Breza
said. He has an outperform rating on Microsoft''s stock,
which he doesn''t own. A lot of tablets today are inferior to
PCs. </p>
<p>ARM Climbs </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 26 cents to $28.07 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has lost 7.9 percent
this year. ARM''s U.S.-traded shares, which have more than
doubled in value this year, climbed 6.6 percent to $19.78. </p>
<p>The new software also will be able to work on Intel Corp.
and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. processors -- the chips that
power PC versions of Windows. While other versions of Microsoft
software aimed at phones and mobile devices work on ARM chips,
this is the first time it will make a full version of Windows
available on that technology. </p>
<p>Intel is trying to make its own forays into tablets and
smartphones, squaring off against ARM''s technology. ARM, based
in Cambridge, England, sells the rights to use its patents and
chip designs and doesn''t manufacture the electronic components. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and a U.S. unit
of French bank Natixis (KN) SA are offering money-market mutual funds
aimed at wooing back customers spooked by the financial crisis
into moving their money to federally insured deposits. </p>
<p>The new offerings promise to keep the average maturity of
their holdings at 10 days or fewer, one-fourth that of competing
funds, according to the companies and researcher Crane Data LLC.
Shorter maturities allow managers to shift more quickly out of a
troubled issuer and into other securities or cash. </p>
<p>They are aimed squarely at the paranoid cash manager,
said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC in Westborough,
Massachusetts, which tracks the $2.79 trillion industry. </p>
<p>Money-market funds lost their place as the top destination
for short-term corporate investments after the $62.5 billion
Reserve Primary Fund collapsed in September 2008, spurring a run
on funds that buy corporate debt. Company treasurers moved cash
to the safety of insured bank deposits, which for more than a
year have also provided more income than money funds because of
historically low interest rates on short-term government and
corporate bonds. </p>
<p>The portion of short-term investments corporate treasuries
held in bank deposits rose to 42 percent from 25 percent two
years earlier, according to a survey published in June by the
Association for Financial Professionals in Bethesda, Maryland.
Money-market funds dropped to 25 percent from 39 percent. </p>
<h2>10-Day Maximum </h2>
<p>The JPMorgan Current Yield Money Market Fund (JCCXX), opened at the
beginning of October, will maintain an asset-weighted maturity
on holdings of 10 days or fewer under normal market
conditions, according to the prospectus. Current Yield is a
prime fund, meaning it invests in corporate debt as well as
government instruments. </p>
<p>Robert Deutsch, head of global liquidity at New York-based
JPMorgan, said the fund''s short duration also will allow it to
move quickly into higher-yielding bonds when the U.S. Federal
Reserve eventually raises interest rates. </p>
<p>RNT Natixis Liquid Prime Portfolio, a prime fund run by
Reich  Tang Asset Management LLC that opened Nov. 30, will
maintain an asset-weighted average maturity of nine days or
fewer, said Tom Nelson, head of sales and marketing at the New
York-based firm. </p>
<p>The average maturity of holdings in prime funds was 43 days
as of Nov. 30, according to Crane. </p>
<h2>New Niche'' </h2>
<p>Managing funds that short is not a novelty, but promising
never to go above 10 days is unique, Peter Rizzo, senior
director of fund services at Standard  Poor''s in New York, said
in a phone interview. It could be a new niche. </p>
<p>Liquid Prime provides shareholders with a daily disclosure
of its portfolio, while most money funds reveal holdings monthly
or quarterly. It also discloses a list of approved issuers from
which the fund can buy. </p>
<p>The focus is less on the absolute level of yield than on
making sure clients can understand what''s in the portfolio and
can see what could be in the portfolio, Nelson said. </p>
<p>Reserve Primary became the second money-market fund in the
four-decade history of the industry to expose investors to a
principle loss after it wrote down to zero $785 million in debt
from bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Clients pulled out
$230 billion from funds in the week ended Sept. 19, 2008. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co.''s experimental blood thinner apixaban topped Sanofi-Aventis
SA''s Lovenox at preventing deadly clots in hip-surgery patients,
according to a study. </p>
<p>The trial of 5,407 patients found that those given the pill
apixaban were 64 percent less likely to develop clots in their
legs or die than those given injections of Lovenox, the standard
treatment. The research, dubbed Advance-3 and sponsored by
Pfizer and Bristol-Myers, was published today in the New England
Journal of Medicine. Both companies are based in New York. </p>
<p>A study released in March by the two drugmakers showed
apixaban was superior to Lovenox in preventing clots from
forming after knee-replacement surgery. Apixaban and similar new
oral blood thinners will provide alternatives to difficult-to-
use treatments such as warfarin, a 56-year-old anticoagulant --
first used as rat poison -- that requires constant monitoring,
said the lead researcher, Michael Rud Lassen. </p>
<p>This new drug offers a real advancement for patients,
said Lassen, a spine surgeon and a researcher with the
University of Copenhagen''s department of orthopedics, in a
telephone interview on Dec. 21. He said he will use apixaban in
his patients if the drug is approved by regulators. </p>
<p>People undergoing hip or knee surgery are at risk of
developing blood clots, and about 40 percent to 60 percent of
patients getting the procedures develop clots if not treated
preventively, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers said in a statement
today. The global market for anticoagulants in 2009 rose to
$690.5 million, from $686.2 million in 2008, and this year
through September the market totaled $528.3 million, according
to IMS Health Inc., a research company in Norwalk, Connecticut. </p>
<p>Regulatory Approval </p>
<p>Pfizer and Bristol-Myers are asking for European approval
for apixaban for use in patients undergoing hip and knee
replacements. In the U.S., the companies are seeking marketing
clearance of the drug for use in preventing strokes in patients
with irregular heartbeat, or atrial fibrillation. The condition
increases the likelihood of clots, said Jack Lawrence, the
Bristol-Myers vice president in charge of apixaban development,
in a telephone interview on Dec. 21. </p>
<p>Warfarin, the standard drug given to patients with atrial
fibrillation, causes side effects and is difficult for doctors
to dose and monitor to reduce bleeding risk. All blood-thinning
medicines raise some risk of bleeding. </p>
<p>There is great hope in the new oral anticoagulants and
their potential to replace, to a large degree, the current
standards of care, Lawrence said. Likely there will be room
for multiple agents. Each drug will have subtle differences that
might encourage one or the other to be prescribed. </p>
<p>Blood Thinner Rivals </p>
<p>Johnson  Johnson, Bayer AG and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH
sell new oral medicines in Europe to prevent clots after hip and
knee surgery. </p>
<p>Boehringer, based in Ingelheim, Germany, received U.S.
approval in October for its anti-clotting drug Pradaxa to
prevent stroke in patients who have atrial fibrillation, New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ and Leverkusen, Germany-based
Bayer are awaiting U.S. clearance for their blood thinner
Xarelto. </p>
<p>The potential impact of these oral, highly specific,
fixed-dose drugs that do not require routine monitoring will no
doubt be substantial, wrote Elaine Hylek, an associate
professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine,
in an editorial in the journal. If these drugs prove to be
effective across the broad spectrum of patients in routine care
and are conscientiously priced, the worldwide impact will be
huge. </p>
<p>In the study, patients undergoing total hip replacement
received either apixaban twice a day or an injection of Lovenox
every 24 hours. Apixaban was started 12 to 24 hours after
surgery, while Lovenox was begun 12 hours before surgery.
Treatment continued for 35 days after surgery and patients were
followed for an additional 60 days after completing their
medicines. </p>
<p>Study Results </p>
<p>The researchers found that 27 patients taking apixaban, or
1.4 percent, developed blood clots in the leg or a blockage in a
lung artery or died. These figures compared with 74, or 3.9
percent, in the Lovenox group, giving those taking apixaban a 64
percent reduction in their risk of developing those
complications, according to the report. </p>
<p>Those taking apixaban were also more than 50 percent less
likely to develop blood clots in their upper legs, which can
travel to the lungs, causing death, Lassen said. Bleeding
occurred in a similar percentage of people taking either
apixaban or Lovenox, the study showed. </p>
<p>In November, Bristol-Myers and Pfizer halted a trial of
apixaban after an increase in bleeding outweighed benefits for
patients who had recently suffered a heart attack or severe
chest pain. </p>
<p>The companies are also studying apixaban as a treatment for
blood clots in the legs and for pulmonary embolism, a condition
in which the clot breaks free and travels to the lung, causing a
blockage in a lung artery that can lead to death, Lawrence said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest computer-services provider, is
building a cloud-computing system for NATO in the first such
deal for the international military alliance. </p>
<p>The software and hardware will let NATO more quickly
collect and analyze data, such as military intelligence in
Afghanistan, said E.J. Herold, head of the project for IBM.
NATO''s military command department in Norfolk, Virginia, will
use the technology first, with the possibility it will expand to
other divisions, he said. Terms of the accord weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>IBM gains a foothold for similar projects for NATO''s other
departments, as well as its 28 member countries.  The Armonk,
New York-based company is betting cloud computing, which helps
customers save money by letting them store and access data via
the Internet, will be a $3 billion business by 2015. </p>
<p>It''s a first step in the door at this international
organization, Herold said in an interview yesterday. With 28
member nations who are all having equal say in doing things, by
definition everything you do becomes more complex. </p>
<p>IBM will manage the North Atlantic Treaty Organization''s
data from inside the Norfolk base, in a so-called private-cloud
model, which lets customers put information on servers within
their own security systems. The system will help the military
command pull together information from sources such as radar
systems, cameras or infrared images that had been separated. </p>
<p>It makes it easier to share information, especially in
time-sensitive situations, like combat, Herold said. It
makes it easier for commanders to understand the situation and
then make a decision. </p>
<p>IBM rose 21 cents to $145.95 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 11 percent

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., weighing
2010 pay packages for a year that could rank as Wall Street''s
second best, said it may grant bonuses that depend on future
earnings, in addition to stock performance. </p>
<p>The awards would go to key employees and be tied to a
variety of financial measures including revenue, net income and
return on equity, a gauge of profitability, the New York-based
company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Awards may
consist of cash, securities or other equity-linked components,
and carry provisions allowing their cancellation or return. </p>
<p>The plan is a tool the compensation committee may use to
further align incentive compensation with long-term
performance, said Stephen Cohen, a company spokesman. Cohen
declined to provide figures on potential payouts, saying that
awards haven''t been set. </p>
<p>Regulators have pushed banks to design pay packages for top
employees that would discourage excessive risk-taking, after a
financial crisis wiped out firms including Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and led to government bailouts. Most firms have
interpreted the guidance to emphasize deferred stock awards over
cash bonuses. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s new program aims to ensure that the
firm''s incentive-compensation structure is balanced and
consistent with the safety and soundness of the firm,
according to the filing. It won''t fuel imprudent risk-
taking, it said. </p>
<p>Recipients will be selected by the board''s compensation
committee, according to the filing, which didn''t specify
eligible executives. </p>
<p>Improper Risk </p>
<p>The payouts may be halted or reclaimed if the firm
determines, for example, that an employee engaged in
materially improper risk analysis or failed sufficiently to
raise concerns about risks, according to the filing. Previous
awards have also included so-called recapture provisions. </p>
<p>The new plan, adopted by the compensation committee Dec.
17, was disclosed after the close of New York markets yesterday,
the last trading session before Christmas. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and the four other largest U.S. firms by
investment-banking and trading revenue -- JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley -- are
set to complete their best two years in investment banking and
trading. They will likely have a better fourth quarter than the
previous two periods, driven by equity underwriting and higher
volume in stock and bond trading, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Even if the quarter only matches the third, their
revenue will top that of any year except 2009. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and an Alabama

a derivative contract that threatened to cost it more than $122
million, according to a court filing and bond documents. </p>
<p>The Alabama Public School and College Authority, which
issues debt to finance construction, and the New York-based bank
sought to dismiss the suit yesterday because of the settlement.
Terms of the agreement weren''t disclosed in the court filings. </p>
<p>The authority paid $19 million to JPMorgan on Dec. 21 to

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost a bid to
have almost $800 million in legal claims from Syncora Guarantee
Inc. and Assured Guaranty Ltd. dismissed in a case that revolves
around defaulted Jefferson County, Alabama, sewer bonds. </p>
<p>New York Supreme Court Judge James Yates in Manhattan
rejected the move by the second-largest U.S. bank on Dec. 21,
saying there were sufficient facts to continue the case. The two
bond insurers sued to recover money paid out and to pay
potential claims on the Jefferson County debt. </p>
<p>Syncora and Assured took JPMorgan to court after a $3
billion refinancing of the sewer debt in 2002 and 2003, which
involved derivatives, collapsed during the credit crisis and
almost bankrupted the county. JPMorgan concealed that it won the
refinancing transaction with bribes of about $3 million
funneled to county commissioners through friends, the insurers
said. They also claimed the bank didn''t disclose a report saying
the sewer system wouldn''t be able to pay its debt. </p>
<p>Plaintiff insurer could have reasonably concluded that
defendants'' alleged bribery practices were indicators that the
county''s affairs were being mismanaged if decisions were made on
this illegal basis, Yates said in his decision. </p>
<p>The insurers said they wouldn''t have insured the debt if
JPMorgan had disclosed the purpose of the $3 million payments. </p>
<p> Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Krebs Report </p>
<p>The bond insurers also said they were unaware of a 2003
report by Birmingham-based engineering firm Paul B. Krebs 
Associates Inc. that concluded the government lacked the money
to meet sewer-debt payments. The report, which came to light in
2009 during a receivership action against the county, warned
officials that they would need to raise sewer revenue by 89
percent and recommended the county take immediate action. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said it never received a copy of the Krebs report. </p>
<p>Who received what and when cannot be established on the
face of the pleadings and is exactly the kind of inquiry
appropriate for discovery, Yates wrote. </p>
<p>Syncora Guarantee insured about $1.2 billion of the sewer
debt and a $165 million surety policy. The company has paid $211
million in claims after the county defaulted on some of the debt
and expects to pay at least $205 million more, according to
court documents. Assured has paid out $4 million and may have to
pay $370 million more on its policies, the documents show. </p>
<p>The judged also dismissed a Jefferson County counterclaim
that alleged that the bond insurers breached their contract
because they failed to retain AAA credit ratings. Their
downgrades helped spark the broader credit crisis while also
leading investors to shun the sewer debt, the county claimed. </p>

<p>By 2015, your mobile phone will
project a 3-D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be
powered by kinetic energy. At least that''s what International
Business Machines Corp. sees in its crystal ball. </p>
<p>The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the
Armonk, New York-based company, which surveys its 3,000
researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next
five years. IBM, the world''s largest provider of computer
services, looks to Silicon Valley for input, gleaning many ideas
from its Almaden research center in San Jose, California. </p>
<p>Holographic conversations, projected from mobile phones,
lead this year''s list. The predictions also include air-
breathing batteries, computer programs that can tell when and
where traffic jams will take place, environmental information
generated by sensors in cars and phones, and cities powered by
the heat thrown off by computer servers. </p>
<p>These are all stretch goals, and that''s good, said Paul Saffo, managing director of foresight at the investment-advisory
firm Discern in San Francisco. In an era when pessimism is the
new black, a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad
thing </p>
<p>For IBM, it''s not just idle speculation. The company is one
of the few big corporations investing in long-range research
projects, and it counts on innovation to fuel growth, Saffo
said. Not all of its predictions pan out, though. IBM was overly
optimistic about the spread of speech technology, for instance.
When the ideas do lead to products, they can have broad
implications for society, as well as IBM''s bottom line, he said. </p>
<p>Research Spending </p>
<p>They have continued to do research when all the other
grand research organizations are gone, said Saffo, who is also
a consulting associate professor at Stanford University. </p>
<p>IBM invested $5.8 billion in research and development last
year, 6.1 percent of revenue. While that''s down from about 10
percent in the early 1990s, the company spends a bigger share on
research than its computing rivals. Hewlett-Packard Co., the top
maker of personal computers, spent 2.4 percent last year. </p>
<p>At Almaden, scientists work on projects that don''t always
fit in with IBM''s computer business. The lab''s research includes
efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles
on one charge, a filtration system for desalination and a
program that shows changes in geographic data. </p>
<p>IBM rose 9 cents to $146.04 at 11:02 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock had gained 11 percent this
year before today. </p>
<p>Citizen Science </p>
<p>The list is meant to give a window into the company''s
innovation engine, said Josephine Cheng, a vice president at
IBM''s Almaden lab. </p>
<p>All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM
and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world''s
biggest problems, she said. </p>
<p>Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has
in the works. One of this year''s ideas -- that sensors in cars,
wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data
about the environment -- is an expansion of the company''s
citizen-science initiative. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, IBM teamed up with the California State
Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose
Environmental Services to help gather information about
waterways. Researchers from Almaden created an application that
lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks, and
report back on conditions. The hope is that these casual
observations will help local and state officials who don''t have
the resources to do the work themselves. </p>
<p>Traffic Predictors </p>
<p>IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next
five years. Computer programs will use algorithms and real-time
traffic information to predict which roads will have backups,
and how to avoid getting stuck. </p>
<p>Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today, IBM
says. Rather than using the current lithium-ion technology, new
models could rely on energy-dense metals that only need to
interact with the air to recharge. Some electronic devices might
ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic
wristwatches, which only need to be shaken to generate a charge. </p>
<p>The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated
by computers and data centers. Almost half of the power used by
data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool. IBM
scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm
houses and offices. </p>
<p>In IBM''s first list of predictions, compiled at the end of
2006, researchers said instantaneous speech translation would
become the norm. That hasn''t happened yet. While some programs
can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages,
and other apps can perform limited speech translation, there''s
nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator
in Star Trek. </p>
<p>Second Life </p>
<p>The company also predicted that online immersive
environments, such as Second Life, would become more widespread.
While immersive video games are as popular as ever, Second
Life''s growth has slowed. Internet users are flocking instead to
the more 2-D environments of Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as
a wallet, ticket broker, concierge, bank and shopping assistant
is coming true -- thanks to the explosion of smartphone
applications. Consumers can pay bills through their banking
apps, buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. continues to be
interested in developing a petrochemical complex in Qatar after
Royal Dutch Shell Plc announced plans to help build a
monoethylene glycol plant in the emirate. </p>
<p>We signed a heads of agreement with Qatar Petroleum in
January 2010, Nikolaas Baeckelmans, an Exxon spokesman, said
in an e-mail today. We have progressed work jointly with Qatar
Petroleum and are awaiting a decision to proceed. </p>
<p>Shell, the largest investor in Qatar, signed an agreement
with state-run Qatar Petroleum to jointly study an estimated
$6 billion petrochemicals project at a ceremony in the Qatari
capital Doha on Dec. 21. </p>
<p>Earlier in January, the Qatari company signed an agreement
with Exxon Mobil for building a petrochemical complex that also
was to cost about $6 billion. It was to be the emirate''s biggest
single energy project since Shell''s Pearl gas-to-liquids plant
was announced in 2006. A Qatar Petroleum official said in August
that Qatar might choose a different partner for that complex. </p>
<p>Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah declined
to say if the Shell project would replace Exxon''s venture, nor
did he comment on whether Exxon would be involved in future
projects in the Persian Gulf country. </p>
<p>The facility Exxon had planned was to include a 1.6
million-ton-a-year steam cracker, two 650,000-ton polyethylene
plants and a 700,000-ton ethylene glycol unit. It was to be
completed by 2015, Exxon and Qatar Petroleum said in January. </p>
<p>Qatar, holder of the world''s third-largest gas reserves, is
investing in petrochemical, aluminum and fertilizer factories as
it diversifies away from exporting liquefied natural gas and
oil. The emirate aims to raise annual petrochemicals production
to at least 18 million tons by 2015-16, al-Attiyah said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley ended JPMorgan Chase
 Co.''s two-year run as the top banker for stock sales after
charging the lowest fees and winning deals from the U.S., China
and Brazil to arrange offerings by state-owned companies. </p>
<p>The 75-year-old securities firm''s global market share rose
to 10.4 percent in 2010 on $72.7 billion of initial public
offerings, additional sales and convertible bond issues, its
first top ranking in six years, according to preliminary data
compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan was second with $59.7 billion,
while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dropped to third after its share
of U.S. equity underwriting slumped to the lowest level since at
least 1998, the data show. </p>
<p>While banks vie for first place in the so-called league
tables betting it may lead to more business, Morgan Stanley''s
ranking came at a price. It was paid an average 2.3 percent fee,
the lowest of the top 10 banks, after underwriting state-backed
sales of General Motors Co., Citigroup Inc., Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd. and Petroleo Brasileiro SA. </p>
<p>If the banks wanted to remain active, they''ve had to
participate in some of the government-sponsored programs, said
Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which manages $4.5 billion.
Like most government programs, they tend not to be highly
profitable, but they''re larger in size. It''s about getting in on
some of those bigger deals even though there''s less profit. </p>
<p>Lehman''s Collapse </p>
<p>Banks arranged $699 billion in share sales this year, up 22
percent from 2009, as the MSCI World Index of 24 developed
markets recouped almost all the losses spurred by the collapse
of New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September
2008. About 37 percent of Morgan Stanley''s underwriting came
from state-controlled companies, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>It was the hangover and the legacy of the crisis that the
government had stakes, said Bruce McCain, Cleveland-based
chief investment strategist at KeyCorp''s private-banking unit,
which oversees $25 billion. The market had recovered enough
this year that it made sense to bring those stakes to market. </p>
<p>GM, 61 percent owned by the Treasury, paid 0.75 percent in
fees, or a total of $136 million, to underwriters in its $18.1
billion IPO last month. The sale was the second-largest in U.S.
history behind San Francisco-based Visa Inc.''s $19.7 billion
deal in March 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
government spent $49.5 billion to rescue the Detroit-based
automaker after it filed for bankruptcy in June last year. </p>
<p>Citigroup Bailout </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was the sole lead manager for the Treasury''s
sale of $10.5 billion of Citigroup stock this month. The deal
helped the U.S. recoup some of the $45 billion it spent to bail
out the New York-based lender. Citigroup paid $42.3 million in
fees, or 0.4 percent of the proceeds, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Agricultural Bank of China in Beijing was charged fees of
1.96 percent for the Hong Kong portion of its record $22.1
billion IPO. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras paid 0.65 percent of
the proceeds for the $22.8 billion sale underwritten by seven
banks in September. </p>
<p>Fees for the government offerings arranged by Morgan
Stanley averaged 0.9 percent, the data show. The firm split a
0.001 percent fee with five banks for India''s sale of a $2.2
billion stake in Hyderabad-based NMDC Ltd. in March. </p>
<p>The average stock offering this year paid 3 percent in
fees, three times more than on Morgan Stanley''s government
deals, the data show. </p>
<p>Win or Lose'' </p>
<p>We don''t want to ever win or lose business solely on the
basis of fees, John Moore, co-head of U.S. equity capital
markets at Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview. As
for large transactions, the benefits of market leadership in a
single year are always important. But as, if not more, important
is the opportunity to serve clients in varied ways over a long
period of time. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, underwrote 333
deals, the most this year and almost 10 percent more than Morgan
Stanley, Bloomberg data show. Its market share fell for a second
year even as the firm helped arrange sales for GM and
Agricultural Bank, and the $20.5 billion Hong Kong IPO by AIA
Group Ltd., the Asian unit of New York-based American
International Group Inc. </p>
<p>The bank retained its top ranking for U.S. corporate bond
sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based
JPMorgan arranged 13.8 percent of the investment-grade debt
offerings, while winning a 14 percent share for junk bonds.
Tasha Pelio, a New York-based spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Coal India, Petronas Chemicals </p>
<p>In Asia, which accounted for 36 percent of the world''s
equity sales, JPMorgan missed out as Morgan Stanley managed the
$3.5 billion state-backed sale from Kolkata-based Coal India
Ltd. and Malaysia''s $4.7 billion offering of Petronas Chemicals
Group Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. Goldman Sachs arranged Queensland''s
$4.2 billion IPO of Brisbane, Australia-based QR National Ltd. </p>
<p>Asia was Goldman Sachs''s biggest market, accounting for 47
percent of its $57.2 billion in deals. The most profitable
securities firm in the history of Wall Street also won the
largest share of business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
It was the sole manager for Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based
Renault SA''s sale of a $4.2 billion stake in Volvo AB of
Gothenburg, Sweden, the region''s largest deal of the year. </p>
<p>The gains failed to offset Goldman Sachs''s decline in the
U.S., where its share plummeted by 51 percent to 8.6 percent.
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company,
declined to comment. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest
drug company, should have the bankruptcy of its Quigley unit
which has protected it from asbestos-related health problems
since 2004 dismissed, lawyers for the U.S. Trustee said. </p>
<p>While the bankruptcy has been pending, creditors with
alleged asbestos-related health problems have been unable to sue
New York-based Pfizer, and many have died, wrote lawyers for the
U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department that oversees
bankruptcy. A hearing to decide the U.S. Trustee''s request is
set for Jan. 13, according to court papers filed Dec. 23. </p>
<p>The harm in delaying the inevitable dismissal of this
case is to the individuals who have filed asbestos claims
against the Debtor and Pfizer, lawyers for acting U.S. Trustee
Tracy Hope Davis wrote in court papers. For some of those
individuals, time may be of the essence. </p>
<p>A judge in September denied Quigley Company Inc.
permission to exit bankruptcy under its fourth proposed Chapter
11 plan. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein found the
world''s largest drug company manipulated the bankruptcy process
to benefit itself. Bernstein said the plan was filed in bad
faith by Pfizer and cited testimony that asbestos claims
directed at Quigley could total $4.45 billion over the next 42
years. </p>
<p>Pfizer spokesman Christopher Loder said the company is
prepared to contribute additional funds to Quigley''s plan to
satisfy the court''s concerns, and will discuss fair compensation
of asbestos claims at the Jan. 13 hearing. </p>
<p>It''s important to note that in 30 years of asbestos
litigation, Pfizer has never been found to be derivatively
liable for Quigley''s liabilities, Loder said in an emailed
statement. </p>
<p>$701 Million Charge </p>
<p>Pfizer reported in its third-quarter report in November a
$701 million charge for asbestos litigation for Quigley. In a
report filed Nov. 12 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Pfizer said it was filing an appeal of the Quigley
ruling to preserve its right to address certain legal issues
raised in the court''s opinion. </p>
<p>An ad-hoc committee representing 43,100 individual asbestos
claimants in Quigley''s bankruptcy had also asked in October that
a judge end the case, and also end the injunction that has
shielded Pfizer from lawsuits since 2004. </p>
<p>Quigley and Pfizer have enjoyed an exceedingly valuable
reprieve from defending asbestos claims in the tort system for
that entire time, and accordingly have, at numerous junctures
throughout this case, been content to let the bankruptcy
proceedings languish, lawyers for the committee wrote. </p>
<p>Working With Quigley </p>
<p>Pfizer said in court papers requesting an appeal that it
was working with Quigley to come up with a plan that took into
account some of the points in Bernstein''s ruling. Pfizer
challenged Bernstein''s statement that Pfizer should put an
amount of money into a trust that is equal to the alleged value
of present and future claims against the drugmaker. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy court erred by precluding Pfizer from
introducing evidence that Pfizer does not have any liability for
Quigley''s conduct in making or selling asbestos-containing
products, lawyers for Pfizer wrote. </p>
<p>Under the proposed Chapter 11 plan, Pfizer would have paid
about $450 million into a trust to satisfy claims about products
for which it allegedly has derivative liability. </p>
<p>Future Claims </p>
<p>The bankruptcy code would direct all future claims to the
trust, covering death and personal injury claims over Insulag,
Panelag and Damit, Quigley products for the steel industry
containing asbestos that were made from the time of World War II
to the 1970s. </p>
<p>The plan barred claimants from taking future actions
against Pfizer. Pfizer was a defendant in 280,343 of the 411,100
claims served against Quigley, Bernstein noted in his ruling. </p>
<p>Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products containing
asbestos from the 1940s to the 1970s. It was bought by Pfizer in
1968. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer, said to unveil new software for tablets
at the Consumer Electronics Show next week, will face skeptics
who say his company won''t soon narrow Apple Inc.''s iPad lead. </p>
<p>By the time Microsoft gets it figured out everybody will
already own an iPad, said Keith Goddard, CEO of Capital
Advisors Inc. an investing firm in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that holds
Apple shares. That train has left the station. </p>
<p>Microsoft will announce a full version of the Windows
computer operating system that runs on ARM Holdings Plc
technology at the show, which begins in Las Vegas on Jan. 6, two
people familiar with Microsoft''s plans said last week. </p>
<p>Allying with ARM is Microsoft''s way of stepping up rivalry
with Apple, which has garnered the largest share of the tablet
market with its iPad, a touch-screen device introduced in April
that handles video, music and computing tasks. The effort may
falter unless Ballmer can match the features consumers have come
to expect from the iPad, Goddard said. </p>
<p>The new Windows version would be tailored for battery-
powered devices, such as tablets and wireless handsets, the
people said. Chips based on ARM technology are made by Qualcomm
Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. </p>
<p>Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment, pointing instead to remarks by
Ballmer in July. </p>
<p>We''re tuning Windows 7 to new slate hardware designs,
Ballmer told analysts then. He also said, Apple has sold
certainly more than I''d like them to sell. </p>
<p>IPad Gains Share </p>
<p>Computer makers have unsuccessfully been trying to sell
tablet-style computers based on Microsoft''s Windows for about a
decade. Before the iPad, tablets made up only about 2 percent of
the PC market. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has sold
7.46 million iPads through September. According to analysts at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., it may sell as many at 37.2 million
iPads next year. </p>
<p>That indicates that the tablet computer''s share of the PC
market may rise to 9.2 percent next year, based on a prediction
by research firm IDC for 402.7 million PC shipments in 2011. </p>
<p>Microsoft dropped 23 cents to $28.07 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined
7.9 percent this year. </p>
<p>Besides gaining share, Apple has also redefined consumer
expectations for what a tablet computer should do, says Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. Instead of requiring the
use of a stylus pen to serve as a computer mouse, the iPad
allows people to navigate using their fingers. </p>
<p>Square Peg'' </p>
<p>Apple did this year what no one had done in the previous
10 -- crack that space between the PC and the phone, said
Gartenberg, who''s based in New York. Microsoft has been
working very hard at putting a square peg in a round hole. </p>
<p>Still, an introduction at CES gives Microsoft a chance to
win over some of the more than 100,000 people expected to attend
the premier technology trade show, he said. </p>
<p>It''s a wonderful opportunity for Microsoft and Ballmer to
put a stake in the ground, said Gartenberg. Now that Apple
cracked the market no one wants to get left behind. </p>
<p>By adapting its computer operating system for a tablet,
Microsoft is taking a different approach from Apple, which used
a mobile-phone operating system as the basis for the iPad.
Apple''s software enables instant startup, longer battery life,
and access to the more than 300,000 applications already
developed for the iPhone. </p>
<p>Frankentablets'' </p>
<p>Microsoft is taking software designed for use with a mouse
and keyboard and adapting it to a touch screen, according to the
people familiar with the matter. That will require developers to
rework PC programs to make them useful on a tablet. </p>
<p>Chips based on ARM technology are used in most smartphones,
as well as Apple''s iPad. Still, they don''t crunch numbers and
handle other computing tasks as quickly as Intel Corp. chips,
which run the majority of PCs. </p>
<p>Loading a full version of Windows onto a tablet powered by
a chip designed for mobile phones may result in an unresponsive
or slow-moving machine, said Michael Cherry, an analyst at
Directions on Microsoft, a Seattle-based research firm. Existing
tablets based on Windows are difficult to use, he said. </p>
<p>Current Windows tablets are what I call Frankentablets --
part laptop and part tablet, he said. They do neither role
well. </p>
<p>Microsoft should leave Windows in the PC environment, where
it works best, and focus instead on scaling up its mobile-phone
software to work on the bigger screen of a tablet, Cherry said. </p>
<p>Then There''s Google </p>
<p>Microsoft has sparred with Apple since the birth of the PC.
Windows won early rounds, relegating Macintosh computers to less
than 10 percent of the market. </p>
<p>Now, it''s also contending with Google Inc., the Mountain
View, California-based Internet company behind the Android
mobile-phone operating system. Earlier this year, Android
surpassed Apple by number of devices running the software in the
U.S., according to NPD Group. </p>
<p>Companies such as Dell Inc. and Samsung, which use
Microsoft''s software in their PCs, are already working on
tablets based on Android as they try to keep from losing ground
to Apple. </p>
<p>The longer it takes Microsoft to get an operating system
into tablets, the less likely the company can challenge Apple
and Google, said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies,
a research firm in Campbell, California. </p>
<p>Given this late move by Microsoft, it would still be
quite an uphill battle, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s
Petershill Fund agreed to buy a minority stake in Mount Lucas
Management Corp., a global macro hedge-fund manager with $1.8
billion under management. </p>
<p>Mount Lucas will keep autonomy over management, operations
and investment strategies, the Newtown, Pennsylvania-based fund
said today in a statement. The size and value of the investment
weren''t disclosed. Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman at New York-
based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the Petershill
investment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s Petershill fund is part of the firm''s
asset-management division and invests in hedge-fund managers.
The fund has acquired stakes in Capula Investment Management
LLP, Trafalgar Asset Managers and Shumway Capital Partners LLC.
Level Global Investors LP, a New York-based fund that sold a
stake to Petershill in April, had its offices raided by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation last month in connection with an
insider-trading probe. The fund told clients that the government
said it wasn''t a target of the investigation. </p>
<p>Paul DeRosa, 69, a principal at Mount Lucas, will become
chairman of the firm at the end of this year, the company said
today. DeRosa is assuming a position that has been vacant since
Frank Vannerson died in March 2008. </p>
<p>DeRosa will no longer be involved in daily management of
the $1.2 billion MLM MacroPeak, the company''s global macro
strategy, Mount Lucas said. Robert J. Barbera, Mount Lucas''s
chief economist, will take over DeRosa''s role in MLM MacroPeak''s
portfolio management, the firm said. That strategy has returned
15.8 percent a year, on average, since it began in February
1996. </p>
<p>Mount Lucas was co-founded in 1986 by Vannerson and Tim Rudderow, the firm''s president. The pair, along with two other
co-founders who have since left, had previously worked at
Commodities Corp., the Princeton, New Jersey-based company that
helped start the careers of macro hedge-fund managers Bruce Kovner, Louis Bacon and Paul Jones. </p>
<p>In 1987, Mount Lucas won Eastman Kodak Co. as a client, one
of the first pension funds to hire a futures manager. </p>
<p>In addition to the macro fund, Mount Lucas manages $500
million in its MLM Index, a diversified index of major futures
markets, and $100 million in a long-only stock fund. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup
Inc. were among U.S. banks that closed or delayed opening most
of their branches in the Northeast today after a blizzard dumped
more than a foot of snow on the region. </p>
<p>Business in cities from Philadelphia to Boston ground to a
crawl and travel was disrupted for a second consecutive day as
airports closed and train service was interrupted or halted amid
waist-high snow drifts and winds gusting to 30 mph (48 kph). </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, and
Citigroup closed all retail branches in New Jersey where
authorities declared a state of emergency and closed state
offices, according to company representatives. Citigroup closed
branches in Boston and will open some in New York and
Connecticut late today, said Natalie Riper, a company
spokeswoman. </p>
<p>While most of JPMorgan''s New York branches and all its
Connecticut branches are closed, they may open later today as
managers evaluate whether employees can safely get to work, said
Christine Holevas, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase''s retail
bank in Chicago. Retail locations in Syracuse and Rochester, New
York, are open. </p>
<p>It''s based on the safety of employees getting there and
the security of the branch, Holevas said. We want to open
more branches, but we''d like to be smart about it. </p>
<p>JPMorgan also closed three office buildings on Long Island
and in New Jersey and employees worked from home. The bank''s
Manhattan headquarters remained open. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>Most Bank of America Corp. branches in Manhattan will
remain closed today, said Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender, the largest U.S. bank by
assets. Several branches were open in New England, and customers
should check the bank''s website for updates, she said. </p>
<p>It''s really on a case-by-case basis, Burke said in a
telephone interview. We thought they would reopen by noon, but
if you look at the transit updates, a majority of the lines are
having issues. </p>
<p>New York City''s Central Park had 20 inches (51 centimeters)
of snow by 8 a.m. local time as the center of storm that started
in the city at mid-day yesterday shifted north and east, the
National Weather Service said. </p>
<p>The storm, which began in the South over the Christmas

<p>General Motors Co., the automaker
one-third owned by the U.S. government, rose 2 percent after
analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Barclays Plc recommended
buying the shares 40 days after trading began. </p>
<p>Analysts at Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley,
Citigroup Inc., Royal Bank of Canada and Credit Suisse Group AG
also today advised buying shares of Detroit-based GM, which
raised more than $20 billion through an initial public offering
of common and preferred shares last month. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson, who led GM through the
IPO 16 months after it emerged from bankruptcy, has said the
automaker can make significant profit amid U.S. sales about
30 percent below the 16.8 million unit annual average from 2000
to 2007. Sales may rise to 12.9 million in the U.S. next year,
Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, said yesterday
in an interview with Pimm Fox on Bloomberg Television. </p>
<p>As the economy improves, the auto market will pick up and
investors are going to boost exposure in the industry, Walter Todd, who helps manage about $900 million at Greenwood Capital
Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>GM rose 72 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $35.32 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 7 percent from the start of trading Nov. 18. </p>
<p>Ebit, Tax Assets </p>
<p>GM is on a path to earn $5.9 billion of earnings before
interest and taxes in North America this year, Brian Johnson, an
analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, wrote in a research
note. Ebit in North America was $4.94 billion through Sept. 30. </p>
<p>Deferred tax assets that stayed with GM through bankruptcy
are worth $9.18 per share, wrote Adam Jonas, a New York-based
analyst at Morgan Stanley. The assets were accumulated in part
as predecessor General Motors Corp. lost $82 billion from 2005
to 2008, and they may allow GM to avoid paying U.S. cash taxes
until 2018, Jonas wrote. </p>
<p>Of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, 10 have a buy
rating on the shares, and four rate GM hold. The average
target price is $43.45, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>GM debuted at a deep discount to Ford and is trading at
3.9 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization, and pension income, wrote Christopher Ceraso, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. Ford trades at a multiple
of 5.5 times, he wrote. </p>
<p>Discount to Ford </p>
<p>We think GM''s current discount to Ford is justified, but
that the gap will close materially in 2012 as GM''s product cycle
hits its stride and Ford''s shifts to a lower gear, Ceraso
wrote. </p>
<p>GM has said it plans to begin building the Chevrolet Sonic
small car next year. That will be followed by the Chevrolet
Malibu midsize sedan in 2012 and Impala full-size sedan in 2013,
according to Himanshu Patel, an analyst at JPMorgan. </p>
<p>The automaker may generate $4.3 billion in free cash flow
this year before pension payments, wrote Patel, who is based in
New York. At that cash flow, GM could achieve its goal of wiping
out debt and pension liabilities by 2013, he said. </p>
<p>GM''s European operations, which lost $1.2 billion on an
Ebit basis in three quarters this year, may break even in 2012,
wrote Barclays'' Johnson and Patel of JPMorgan. Morgan Stanley''s
Jonas said GM Europe may break even in 2011. </p>
<p>We do not believe that GM Europe is likely to be
profitable on a sustainable basis, Credit Suisse''s Ceraso
wrote. </p>
<p>40-Day Rule </p>
<p>New York Stock Exchange and Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority rules prevent analysts at firms that manage IPOs from
releasing research for 40 days, according to the Securities and
Exchange Commission''s website. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup led
the IPO that included more than 30 underwriters, according to GM
regulatory filings. Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and RBC were also listed in GM''s
prospectus. </p>
<p>Trading of GM options rose to almost double the four-week
average, with volume for calls to buy the stock changing hands
2.7 times as much as puts to sell. The most-active contracts
were March $38 calls, which rose 52 percent to 91 cents and
accounted for almost one fifth of all 53,768 calls traded today. </p>
<p>GM''s 8.375 percent bonds due in July 2033, which were
issued by the old General Motors Corp. and will eventually
convert to shares in the new company, rose 1.25 cents to 34
cents on the dollar at 2:26 p.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond-pricing service of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The bonds have gained four consecutive
days to the highest since Nov. 17. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. call-options volume
jumped to almost triple the four-week average, with the most
trading concentrated in bets that the world''s largest drugmaker
will rally 8 percent by April. </p>
<p>Almost 147,000 calls to buy Pfizer stock changed hands, the
most in seven weeks and eight times the number of puts to sell,
as of 4 p.m. in New York. The shares climbed 0.6 percent to
$17.59. Almost half of today''s volume was in two block trades of
the April $19 calls, which rose 50 percent to 30 cents for the
second-biggest gain among all of the drugmaker''s options. </p>
<p>It''s a straight-up directional trade, said Steven Williams, an options strategist at Louis Capital Markets LP in
New York. With the recent bump in Pfizer''s dividend, this is
likely a bet that it will catch up to the broader market. It''s
the first big trade I''ve seen in the last few weeks where people
are going after yield stocks like this, and its likely to be a
precursor to more. </p>
<p>Pfizer said Dec. 13 that it will raise its quarterly
dividend 2 cents to 20 cents a share, after cutting the payout
last year to help fund its $68 billion Wyeth acquisition. The
New York-based company also named George Lorch board chairman,
replacing Jeffrey Kindler, who resigned from his positions as
chairman and chief executive officer on Dec. 5. </p>
<p>The drugmaker is down 3.3 percent this year, lagging the
1.1 percent advance for health stocks in the Standard  Poor''s
500 Index and the 13 percent rally for the benchmark itself. </p>
<p>The April $19 calls had an open interest of 572 existing
contracts before today, which indicates that buyers of new
positions initiated almost all of the transactions in that
contract. The shares must rally 8 percent by expiration on April
15 to reach the strike price. Pfizer hasn''t closed above $19
since February. </p>

<p>Banca Generali SpA, the fund manager
controlled by Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Italy''s biggest
insurer, expects to meet analysts'' estimates for 2010 profit
after adding clients and lowering costs. </p>
<p>Banca Generali''s net income will be close to the average
estimate of 75 million euros ($99 million) made by 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, Chief Executive Officer Giorgio Girelli
said in a phone interview. We expect to meet analysts''
forecasts, helped by lower costs and higher management fees. </p>
<p>The company is forecasting that 2010 operating costs may
have dropped 4 percent to 5 percent, with revenue likely in line
with the 252 million euros generated in 2009, Girelli said. </p>
<p>Banca Generali, which said on Nov. 5 that nine-month profit
rose 32 percent to 60 million euros, is focusing on internal
growth and doesn''t plan acquisitions. The Trieste, Italy-based
company is trying to gain market share in Italy by adding
customers from commercial banks. </p>
<p>Higher net inflows have the same effect as making an
acquisition, Girelli said. At the moment we don''t see any
interesting opportunity for external growth, our strategy is
based on pursuing growing recurring revenue, he said. </p>
<p>Fee Income </p>
<p>Higher fee income will offset lower revenue from lending
and trading, he said. Girelli is aiming to keep a generous
dividend policy, though a decision will be taken by shareholders
in March. Banca Generali distributed a cash dividend of 45 cents
on 2009 earnings. </p>
<p>The bank''s new clients doubled in the first nine months of
the year. The company doesn''t disclose the number of its
customers. </p>
<p>The asset gatherer, which hired about 55 employees this
year, aims to add 50 bankers in 2011, Girelli said. He expects
to increase the average investment portfolio of each banker from
the current 15 million euros to about 16.5 million euros next
year. </p>
<p>Banca Generali rose about 7 percent this year in Milan, the
best performer among Italian financial companies. That compares
with a 10 percent decline of the FTSE Italia All-Share Index
this year. The stock ended little changed yesterday at 9.12
euros, giving the company a market value of 1 billion euros. </p>
<p>Banca Generali is a high quality story, Elena Perini an
analyst at Centrobanca with a hold rating on the stock,
wrote in a Dec. 22 report. It''s a company with best-in-class
results in terms of growth in total and managed assets per
financial adviser and in higher net profit, she said. </p>

<p>Changes to U.S. food-safety rules
may generate sales for International Business Machines Corp.,
Oracle Corp. and other companies that can provide systems to
track outbreaks of food-borne illness. </p>
<p>The U.S. House of Representatives on Dec. 21 and the Senate
last month passed a bill instructing the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to establish over the next two years how the
tracking is to be accomplished. The study may lead to FDA
requirements that farms and manufacturers buy computer systems
to monitor and track shipments, according to agriculture trade
groups that have started work on tracking technology. </p>
<p>The bill, which awaits President Barack Obama''s signature,
may lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales for
companies that produce the labels and scanning devices to enable
tracking systems, said Ray Connelly, general manager of closely
held Truetrac, a developer of agricultural product-tracking
software in Salinas, California. </p>
<p>That''s the free market, said Larry Sanders, a professor
at Oklahoma State University''s Department of Agricultural
Economics in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The consumer is being heard
because of the problems we have been having because of E. coli
and salmonella. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
North Sea Forties crude today from Trafigura Beheer BV, which

<p>The New York-based bank paid a discount of 15 cents below
the cash cost of North Sea oil in February for a Forties
consignment due to load Jan. 13 to Jan. 15, according to a
broker involved in transactions of the region''s crude. Trafigura
also offered three separate cargoes loading between Jan. 10 and
Jan. 22 at prices from as low as 35 cents over Dated Brent to as
high as 65 cents above the benchmark. </p>
<p>Total SA bid for a Jan. 15 to Jan. 21 Forties cargo at 25
cents below the February price, while ConocoPhillips bid for a
Jan. 16 to Jan. 21 Forties shipment at a 30-cent premium to
Dated Brent. Both failed to find sellers. </p>
<p>Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts trading window that ends at 4:30 p.m. in London.
Prior to the window, Forties crude loading from 10 to 21 days in

premium of 12 cents yesterday. </p>
<p>Brent crude for February settlement traded at $92.57 a

close of the window, down from $93.99 a barrel yesterday. The
March contract traded at $92.47 a barrel, making it 10 cents

<p> Pfizer Inc. must pay $1.5 million in
damages to a pharmacist who developed breast cancer after taking
one of the company''s menopause drugs, a jury in Puerto Rico
ruled. </p>
<p>Jurors in federal court in San Juan deliberated about 7
hours over two days before finding yesterday that Pfizer''s Wyeth
subsidiary failed to properly warn Helen Rivera-Adams and her
doctors about the health risks of its Prempro menopause
medicine, one of her lawyers said in an interview. </p>
<p>Rivera-Adams, suffering from the late stages of cancer,
pushed ahead with the trial to get the message out that this
drug is dangerous, Michael Robb, one of her lawyers, said in a
telephone interview today. I don''t know how many times Wyeth
executives will have to hear that this drug ruins women''s lives
before they acknowledge it, he said. </p>
<p>We are disappointed with the jury''s verdict and believe
there is no basis in fact or law for this decision, Christopher Loder, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer, said in an e-
mailed statement today. The company is weighing its legal
options. </p>
<p>Hormone therapy medicines are an important treatment
option for many women with debilitating symptoms of menopause,
he said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has regularly
reviewed the benefits and risks of these medicines, he said. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. </p>
<p>Drugs Combined </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, completed its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now lost eight of the
15 Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out after trial
or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the verdicts
through settlements, while other decisions are on appeal. </p>
<p>Wyeth also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, according to court filings. The companies had won
the last four Prempro suits to go to trial before Rivera-Adams''s
case. </p>
<p> San Juan Pharmacist </p>
<p>Rivera-Adams, 62, is a pharmacist in San Juan who owns her
own drugstore, Robb said. She and her family had sought
$8 million in damages over her Prempro-linked breast cancer, he
said. </p>
<p>Jurors found the drug helped cause Rivera-Adams''s cancer
and that Wyeth officials didn''t provide adequate warnings about
the drug''s cancer risks to her or her doctors, said Robb, who is
based in Miami. </p>
<p>Rivera-Adams took Prempro for 19 months before being
diagnosed with cancer in January 2002, according to court
filings. </p>
<p>The case is Rivera-Adams v. Wyeth, 03-1713 (JAF), U.S.
District Court, District of Puerto Rico (San Juan). </p>
