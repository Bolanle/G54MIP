&lt;p&gt;Graeme McDowell beat Tiger Woods in
the first playoff in the 12-year history of golf&#8217;s Chevron World
Challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods failed to end his 13-month winless run, his longest
as a professional golfer, after giving up a four-shot overnight
lead at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods sank a two-foot putt on the final hole of regulation
play to tie McDowell at 16-under and force extra holes after the
U.S. Open champion made a birdie from about 25 feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDowell then birdied  the first extra hole to claim the
title from four-time winner Woods, whose charitable foundation
hosts the tournament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, reported a benzene release after a pump
failed at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, crude refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident happened yesterday at 6:30 p.m. local time,
according to the National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News couldn&#8217;t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pascagoula refinery is San Ramon, California-based
Chevron&#8217;s largest U.S. oil-processing plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. of Irving, Texas is the biggest U.S.
energy company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiger Woods tops the leaderboard by
four strokes entering today&#8217;s final round of the Chevron World
Challenge at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks,
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods, who hasn&#8217;t won a tournament in 2010, shot a four-
under 68 yesterday to finish the third round at 17-under 199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m excited how I&#8217;ve been hitting the golf ball, and how
I&#8217;ve been managing my game around this course,&#8221; Woods said at a
press conference yesterday. &#8220;This is going to be a fun test
tomorrow. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell is in second place at
13-under 203 and Paul Casey is in third place at 9-under 207. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods has won the Chevron World Challenge four times. It&#8217;s
an unofficial tournament with a field of 18 players selected
from the top 50 in world rankings and has a top prize of $1.2
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods last won 13 months ago at the Australian Masters. His
281-week run as world&#8217;s No. 1 golfer ended on Nov. 1, when Lee Westwood replaced him atop the rankings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending in Brazil, Russia,
India and China may surpass U.S. purchases in 15 years and
companies that sell to emerging-market shoppers are some of the
best investments &#8220;of our lifetime,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Asset
Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending in the so-called BRIC countries may climb by more
than $500 billion a year, O&#8217;Neill said in a Bloomberg Television
interview in London yesterday. BRIC consumer spending was about
$4 trillion in 2009, compared with about $10 trillion in the
U.S., O&#8217;Neill wrote in a Dec. 3 research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having exposure either directly or indirectly to the
consumers in the BRIC and Next-11 countries remains the key
investment strategy of our lifetime,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill, who coined
the BRIC acronym in 2001 and four years later created the &#8220;Next
11&#8221; grouping of smaller emerging nations, including Turkey and
Indonesia, with the most potential to affect world growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares of consumer companies in the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index have climbed 30 percent as a group this year, the
top gain among 10 industries. That compares with a 7.4 percent
advance in the MSCI All-Country World Index of emerging and
advanced-nation stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should consider buying consumer companies in
developing markets or &#8220;Western multinationals,&#8221; depending on
relative valuations, O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkson, Tingyi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s department stores will post &#8220;the strongest growth&#8221;
as disposable income rises, Xiaopo Wei, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at CLSA Ltd., said in a phone interview today. He
recommends buying Parkson Retail Group Ltd.&#8217;s shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing-based department-store chain controlled by
Malaysia&#8217;s Lion Group will have same-store sales that will
&#8220;easily surpass 11 percent (if not 12 percent)&#8221; this year, Wei
said in a note to clients last month. Parkson fell 2.4 percent
to HK$12.78 at 11:56 a.m. in Hong Kong and has lost 6.7 percent
this year, compared with a 6.8 percent gain for the benchmark
Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foodmaker Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp., personal
hygiene products manufacturer Hengan International Group Co. and
Tsingtao Brewery Co. are among the companies whose stock CLSA
Ltd. recommends buying. China&#8217;s retail sales have grown by a
monthly average of 18.3 percent this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Resources Enterprise Ltd., the Chinese government-
backed partner of SABMiller Plc that also operates retail
businesses, will probably see its margins widen &#8220;amid mild
inflation&#8221; next year, CLSA said in a note to clients last month.
Its stock has gained 18 percent this year in Hong Kong after
more than doubling last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill joined New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as
co-head of global economics research and chief currency
economist in 1995 and was named chairman of the money management
unit, which oversees about $820 billion, in September. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Kindler&#8217;s refusal to name an
operations chief in response to a push from senior managers cost
him his job as chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc., according
to a person familiar with the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler, 55, quit yesterday hours before a special board
meeting, the person said. Ian C. Read, 57, was named to replace
him. Executives, including Kindler, met in September to discuss
a succession plan and decided Read would become chief operating
officer, taking over some CEO responsibilities, said the person,
who declined to be named because the deliberations were private.
That never happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler in recent months had lost support of executives
frustrated with his management style, the person said. At a time
when New York-based Pfizer faces complex policy decisions,
Kindler was focused on smaller matters and micromanaging his
executives, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been dealing with a U.S. health-care
overhaul, lawsuits from shareholders alleging that senior
executives failed to stop illegal marketing of drugs, and a
stock that underperformed its peers. The shares have dropped 35
percent since Kindler, formerly Pfizer&#8217;s general counsel, was
named CEO on July 28, 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have not been happy about the stock price,&#8221;
said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak  Co.
in New York, in a telephone interview. &#8220;Could he have done
better? Yeah. He could have focused on buying more innovative,
smaller companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 9 cents, or less than 1 percent, to
$16.81 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The stock has declined 9 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read, a 32-year veteran of the company, has been head of
Pfizer&#8217;s global pharmaceutical operations since 2006,
controlling 85 percent of revenue. Read&#8217;s management style is
well-known to Pfizer director and former CEO William C. Steere.
Read ran operations in Latin America and Europe while Steere
headed the company from 1991 to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steere didn&#8217;t return calls for comment.
Constance J. Horner, an independent director, cited Read&#8217;s
experience in emerging markets in the company statement
announcing the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &#8220;has brought to product development a focus and
commitment to advance only medicines that have clear value to
our customers,&#8221; Horner said in the statement. &#8220;Today&#8217;s
business leaders need to understand global markets, drive change
and innovation, and move quickly to adapt to competitive
pressures. Ian&#8217;s track record throughout his career has
demonstrated these exact strengths.&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Board Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board called the Dec. 5 special meeting sometime in the
last week or two, the person said. Pfizer spokesman Ray Kerins
declined to comment on the board deliberations. Kindler didn&#8217;t
return calls to his home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has underperformed its rivals over the 4 1/2 years
of Kindler&#8217;s tenure. Pfizer&#8217;s price-earnings ratio for the past
year is lower than 91 percent of pharmaceutical industry peers
and below 97 percent of companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler finishes at a low point: Pfizer&#8217;s 2010 price-
earnings ratio was 7.3 as of Dec. 3, the last day of trading
before Kindler stepped down, lower than the annual average for
each year he&#8217;s been in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time as CEO, Kindler faced some of the toughest
challenges of the industry, including the looming loss of
Lipitor and the failure of one of the company&#8217;s most promising
drugs, a cholesterol pill that was slated to replace Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torcetrapib Failure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Months after Kindler took the helm in 2006, Pfizer halted
development the cholesterol drug, called torcetrapib, after the
drug failed to benefit patients in a study. To cut costs since,
Kindler has fired more than 14,000 workers, closed research labs
and manufacturing plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re a big company and it takes a lot to turn this
ship,&#8221; said David Maris, a New York-based health care analyst
at CLSA, a unit of Credit Agricole SA, in an interview. &#8220;While
we think Kindler was doing a good job, investor frustration was
rising, mostly over the stock price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board has publicly supported the purchase of Wyeth in
2009 for $68 billion, as well as Kindler&#8217;s cost-cutting
measures. Read takes over the CEO&#8217;s job as the company prepares
to face generic competition to its top-selling cholesterol
treatment Lipitor, which had $11.4 billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the drugmaker moved to make up for the expected
losses under Kindler by acquiring Wyeth, it also has had four
setbacks this year in developing its experimental drug pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler served as CEO and chairman. The board will elect a
new chairman, separating the two roles, at a meeting within two
weeks, the company said in its Dec. 3 statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. paid New York City a
$24.7 million penalty, twice the tax incentives the drugmaker
received for expanding its headquarters in the city, after
relocating some corporate offices and transferring hundreds of
jobs to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, city officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had stopped receiving benefits under a deal
intended to lure companies. In November it refunded double the
amount it got in the form of abated taxes and other incentives,
said David Lombino, spokesman for the city Economic Development
Corp. Pfizer&#8217;s chief executive officer, Jeffrey Kindler,
resigned yesterday, according to a person familiar with the
process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reduced headcount at its East 42nd Street
headquarters to 3,837 as of the June 30 end of its fiscal year
from a peak of more than 6,500, Lombino said. The city and
company first struck a deal in 2003, when the company employed
about 5,300 in New York. Pfizer officials requested more
incentives in 2005, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The city has recovered the value of the benefits offered
through the agreement and a penalty based on the staff reduction
resulting from Pfizer&#8217;s global reorganization,&#8221; Lombino said in
an e-mail. &#8220;Any reduction is unfortunate, but Pfizer is
maintaining its worldwide headquarters and a major presence in
New York City and it remains an important and valued part of the
local economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company moved staff to facilities in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania after its 2009 merger with Wyeth, said a Pfizer
spokeswoman, Joan Campion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re maintaining our global headquarters in New York
City,&#8221; Campion said in a phone interview. Pfizer&#8217;s primary
care, oncology, emerging markets and established products units
will remain based in the city, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s chief executive officer
Jeffrey Kindler left the top post at the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker yesterday after the company&#8217;s stock underperformed its
rivals over the 4 1/2 years of his tenure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s price-earnings ratio for the past year is lower
than 91 percent of pharmaceutical industry peers and below 97
percent of companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Kindler, 55, finishes
at a low point; Pfizer&#8217;s price-earnings ratio in 2010 is 7.3,
lower than the annual average for each year he&#8217;s been in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock has dropped 35 percent since Kindler was named
CEO just prior to a 2006 announcement that Pfizer&#8217;s most
promising compound, the torcetrapib cholesterol pill, failed to
help patients in a study. The company had spent $1 billion to
develop the drug. Pfizer bought Wyeth in 2009 for $68 billion to
add products to overcome lost sales when the Lipitor cholesterol
pill, with $11.4 billion in sales, faces generic competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have not been happy about the stock price,&#8221;
said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak  Co.
in New York, in a telephone interview. &#8220;Could he have done
better? Yeah. He could have focused on buying more innovative,
smaller companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 9 cents to $16.81 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock had dropped 9.6 percent in
the 12 months before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read&#8217;s New Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler&#8217;s successor as chief, Ian C. Read, first joined
Pfizer as an operations auditor in 1978, and has been the head
of the global biopharmaceutical operations since 2006. Read, 57,
must convince investors that the company can continue to
internally develop innovative drugs with billions in annual
sales, Funtleyder said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s most promising experimental drugs include a pill
for rheumatoid arthritis called tasocitinib and a treatment
called crizotinib for a segment of patients with lung cancer.
The drugs combined will have sales of about $2.3 billion by
2016, according to two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Pfizer is
also partnering with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on an experimental
blood thinner called apixaban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler&#8217;s &#8220;forte was not the pharmaceutical landscape, and
I think with Ian Read, you get a pharmaceutical lifer,&#8221; said
Manoj Garg, an analyst at Soleil Securities Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funtleyder and Garg said the change should be viewed
favorably by investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s drug for leukemia
wasn&#8217;t better than Novartis AG&#8217;s treatment Gleevec after a year,
a study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer drug, bosutinib, didn&#8217;t cut the amount of a
tell-tale protein of the cancer in the blood better than
Gleevec, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bosutinib treats chronic myeloid leukemia, a slow-
progressing cancer that causes bone marrow to produce too many
white cells. The study was the third of three stages of testing
usually required by the U.S. for regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study followed 502 people, who previously hadn&#8217;t been
treated, who received either Gleevec or bosutinib for a year.
The trial is continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer patients who took bosutinib progressed to an advanced
phase of the disease, and fewer died, according to the study.
Almost 40 percent of people treated with bosutinib experienced a
major molecular response, meaning that markers of bad blood
cells were reduced at least 1,000-fold. That compares with 26
percent of people treated with Gleevec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said on Dec. 3 that it planned to submit bosutinib
for regulatory approval in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service upgraded the senior unsecured rating of IBM&#8217;s debt one
level to Aa3 from A1 last month, citing a growing emphasis on
higher-margin software and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The transition from a server-production-based company to
a service-based company has been valuable towards their credit
improvement,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist and
economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. &#8220;And
the rating upgrade certainly helped them price a little tighter
than they would have otherwise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions by 2015 as it aims to almost double operating
earnings per share. Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is
investing in analytics software and services that help predict
trends, as well as cloud computing, which helps customers save
money by letting them store and access data via the Internet
rather than from their own servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue Details &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2 percent notes pay 55 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show, and yield 2.07
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolute yields on investment-grade debt have declined
seven basis points to 3.989 percent since IBM&#8217;s previous debt
sale on Aug. 2, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s
U.S. Corporate Master Index. Yields fell as low as 3.53 percent
on Nov. 4, the lowest yield since the index began in October
1986. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The offering is very tight even for a high investment-
grade offering and shows the strength of demand within the
credit markets right now,&#8221; LeBas said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of high-quality cash chasing limited investment
opportunities right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s 1 percent debt maturing August 2013 traded at 99.778
cents on Dec. 3 to yield 1.085 percent, or 30.4 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The notes were sold at a spread of 30 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has completed 16 acquisitions this year,
ended the third quarter with more than $11 billion in cash and
short-term investments, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy cyclical stocks
and companies with high return on equity such as Oracle Corp.
and Visa Inc. as the U.S. economy expands and stocks rally next
year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth, low inflation and interest rates near zero
create a &#8220;superb environment&#8221; for stocks, Goldman investment
strategist David Kostin wrote in a note dated Dec. 3. Cyclical
industries such financial services, technology and energy will
gain from the strong economic outlook and an 18 percent jump in
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index in 2011, the strategist said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fund managers should own stocks leveraged to the
accelerating U.S. economy,&#8221; Kostin wrote. &#8220;The stock market
will re-rate growth when it becomes convinced the expansion is
durable. Fund managers should be there first.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks that are leveraged so that they will benefit more
than other equities from higher economic growth and a rise in
the stock market -- so-called dual-beta stocks -- will jump,
said Kostin, who also recommended Juniper Networks Inc., the
second-largest networking-equipment provider after Cisco Systems
Inc.; Broadcom Corp.; Qualcomm Inc.; Nasdaq OMX Inc., Baxter
International Inc., Eaton Corp. and Hasbro Inc., the world&#8217;s
second-largest toymaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin said last week that he estimates the SP 500 will
end next year at 1,450, up 18 percent from the close on Dec. 3.
The strategist forecast combined earnings per share for SP 500
companies of $84 in 2010, $94 next year and $104 in 2012 in a
report dated Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs forecasts U.S. economic growth of 2.7 percent
in 2011 and 3.6 percent in 2012. The global economy will grow
4.6 percent next year and 4.8 percent in 2012, according to the
New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, plans to
sell $1 billion of debt due January 2016 as soon as today,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is marketing the notes four months after selling $1.5
billion of debt due 2013 at the lowest interest rate on record
at the time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and two
weeks after Moody&#8217;s Investors Service upgraded the senior
unsecured rating of IBM&#8217;s debt one level to Aa3 from A1, citing
a growing emphasis on higher-margin software and services. &lt;/p&gt;

money by letting them store and access data via the Internet,
rather than from their own servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moody&#8217;s upgrade is &#8220;a good reason to expect relatively
tight spreads on the new offering,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief
fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia. &#8220;In terms of spread, we could actually see
it being priced a little tighter than in August.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue Details &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering may yield 55 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, said the person familiar with the offering,
who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. That
implies a yield of about 2.10 percent, based on today&#8217;s Treasury
bond prices. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolute yields on investment-grade debt have declined
seven basis points to 3.989 percent since Aug. 2, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Corporate Master Index,
after earlier touching 3.53 percent on Nov. 4, the lowest yield
since the index began in October 1986. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Total costs could be similar to what we would&#8217;ve seen in
August with a five-year,&#8221; said LeBas in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s 1 percent debt maturing August 2013 traded at 99.778
cents on Dec. 3 to yield 1.085 percent, or 30.4 basis points

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-service provider, is adding
analytics to its information-technology services to attract more
customers and spur sales in its largest division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will use analytics to predict clients&#8217; long-
term costs of running different computer systems, Steve Sams,
IBM&#8217;s head of data center services, said in an interview last
week. Sams will make the announcement today at the Gartner Data
Center Conference in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signings for services, which make up almost 60 percent of
the company&#8217;s total revenue, have slipped for three straight
quarters as companies put off spending on larger projects. The
analytics will help IBM win contracts by demonstrating cost
savings of its technology and help current customers to
determine where to invest in data centers, Sams said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their budgets clearly are not going up -- if anything,
they&#8217;re flat or going down,&#8221; Sams said of customers. &#8220;They&#8217;re
finding it increasingly challenging to keep up with changes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new analytics show clients how much it would cost to
invest in various technologies -- consolidating data centers or
upgrading servers, for example -- and how that would impact
long-term costs, such as power consumption, space requirements
and future upgrades, Sams said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has invested more than $14
billion in analytics acquisitions, including last year&#8217;s $1.2
billion purchase of SPSS Inc., as it bets the ability to predict
trends will help clients save money and boost sales. Analytics
software and services will add about $16 billion to IBM&#8217;s
revenue by 2015, the company said in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, named Ian C. Read chief executive officer as the
company prepares to face generic competition to its top-selling
cholesterol treatment Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read, 57, the head of Pfizer&#8217;s global biopharmaceutical
operations since 2006, replaces Jeffrey B. Kindler, 55, who
retired saying he needed to &#8220;recharge my batteries&#8221; after a
&#8220;period extremely demanding on me personally,&#8221; according to a
statement yesterday from the New York-based company. Kindler&#8217;s 
retirement is effective immediately, said Ray Kerins, a 
spokesman for Pfizer, in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler was named CEO on July 28, 2006. Since then, the
shares have fallen 35 percent before today in New York trading.
Pfizer will lose patent protection in the U.S. next year for
Lipitor, which had $11.4 billion in sales last year. While the
drugmaker moved to make up for the expected losses by paying $68
billion in 2009 to acquire Wyeth, it also has had four setbacks
this year in developing its research pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This seems sudden,&#8221; said Les Funtleyder, a Miller Tabak
 Co. portfolio manager in New York, in a telephone interview
yesterday. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been an easy ride for&#8221; for Kindler, he
said. &#8220;The stock has underperformed. Pharma in general and
Pfizer in particular have had a tough couple of years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be a slight impact on production,&#8221; Kevin Allexon, a spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said

&lt;p&gt;The maintenance is expected to last &#8220;a couple of weeks,&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;The refinery is a joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela

&lt;p&gt;Tiger Woods&#8217;s winless streak
will stretch into 2011 after he blew a four-shot final-round
lead for the first time as a professional golfer and lost the
Chevron World Challenge in a playoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graeme McDowell upstaged tournament host Woods by making a
birdie putt of more than 20 feet at the 18th hole to tie and
then again in the playoff to claim the $1.2 million top prize at
Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDowell&#8217;s win caps a season in which he won the U.S. Open
and clinched Europe&#8217;s Ryder Cup victory. For Woods, the playoff
loss ends a winless year in which he lost his No. 1 ranking and
was divorced and dumped by sponsors including ATT Inc. and
Accenture Plc after admitting to multiple extramarital affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those are probably two of the greatest putts I&#8217;ve made,&#8221;
McDowell said during a news conference. &#8220;To play the weekend
alongside Tiger, it&#8217;s a pretty special feeling to go out there
four back and do the job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods had never previously lost after entering the final
day of a tournament with a lead of at least three shots. He
hasn&#8217;t won since the Australian Masters 13 months ago and last
claimed a title in the U.S. at the BMW Championship in September
2009. Woods said he&#8217;s encouraged heading into the off-season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Kindler resigned as Pfizer
Inc.&#8217;s chief executive officer after he refused to name a head
of operations as part of a plan agreed to by senior managers in
September, said a person familiar with the proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler, 55, quit hours before a special board meeting was
scheduled on Dec. 5 to discuss his future, the person said. Ian C. Read, 57, was named to replace him. Senior executives had
agreed Read should be named chief operating officer, said two
people who asked not to be named because the deliberations were
private. That appointment never happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler in recent months lost support of executives
frustrated with his management style, one of the people said.
While New York-based Pfizer faces complex policy decisions,
Kindler was focused on smaller matters and micromanaging his
executives, according to the person. Kindler, whose retirement
was effective immediately, didn&#8217;t return calls to his home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drug company, has been dealing
with the U.S. health-care overhaul, lawsuits from shareholders
alleging that senior executives failed to stop illegal marketing
of drugs and a stock that underperformed its peers. The shares
dropped 35 percent since Kindler, formerly Pfizer&#8217;s general
counsel, was named CEO on July 28, 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have not been happy about the stock price,&#8221;
said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak  Co.
in New York, in a telephone interview. &#8220;Could he have done
better? Yeah. He could have focused on buying more innovative,
smaller companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Succession Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, senior executives at Pfizer attended a
meeting to discuss a succession plan, one of the people said.
During that session, they decided Read would be named chief
operating officer, expanding his responsibilities as a candidate
to become the next CEO, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokesman Ray Kerins declined to comment on the
board&#8217;s deliberations. Pfizer declined to make Read available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read, a 32-year veteran of the company, has been head of
Pfizer&#8217;s global pharmaceutical operations since 2006,
controlling 85 percent of revenue. Read&#8217;s management style is
well-known to Pfizer director and former CEO William C. Steere
since Read ran operations in Latin America and Europe while
Steere headed the company from 1991 to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steere didn&#8217;t return calls for comment. Constance J. Horner, a board member, cited Read&#8217;s experience in emerging
markets in the company statement announcing the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Focus and Commitment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &#8220;has brought to product development a focus and
commitment to advance only medicines that have clear value to
our customers,&#8221; Horner said in the statement. &#8220;Today&#8217;s
business leaders need to understand global markets, drive change
and innovation, and move quickly to adapt to competitive
pressures. Ian&#8217;s track record throughout his career has
demonstrated these exact strengths.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 4 cents, or less than a percent, to $16.77 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock exchange composite trading. The
stock declined 7.8 percent since the start of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has underperformed its rivals over the 4 1/2 years
of Kindler&#8217;s tenure. Pfizer&#8217;s price-earnings ratio for the past
year is lower than 91 percent of pharmaceutical industry peers
and below 97 percent of companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler finished at a low point: Pfizer&#8217;s 2010 price-
earnings ratio was 7.3 as of Dec. 3, the last day of trading
before Kindler stepped down, lower than the annual average for
each year he has been in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toughest Challenges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time as CEO, Kindler faced some of the toughest
challenges of the industry, including the looming loss of
Lipitor&#8217;s patent protection and the failure of one of the
company&#8217;s most promising drugs, a cholesterol pill that was
slated to replace Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Months after Kindler took the helm in 2006, Pfizer halted
development of the cholesterol drug, torcetrapib, after the pill
failed to benefit patients in a study. To cut costs since,
Kindler has fired more than 14,000 workers and closed research
labs and manufacturing plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re a big company and it takes a lot to turn this
ship,&#8221; said David Maris, a New York-based health care analyst
at CLSA, a unit of Credit Agricole SA, in an interview. &#8220;While
we think Kindler was doing a good job, investor frustration was
rising, mostly over the stock price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth Purchase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board publicly supported the purchase of Wyeth in 2009
for $68 billion, as well as Kindler&#8217;s cost-cutting measures.
Read takes over the CEO&#8217;s job as the company prepares to face
generic competition to its top-selling cholesterol treatment
Lipitor, which had $11.4 billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next five years, Pfizer faces generic competition
to products with $20 billion in annual sales, or almost a third
of the company&#8217;s annual revenue. While the drugmaker moved to
make up for the expected losses under Kindler by acquiring
Wyeth, it also has had five setbacks this year in developing its
experimental drug pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the company said its experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s
drug Dimebon, which analysts said could have generated $5
billion in annual sales, failed to help patients in a late-stage
test. That same month, Sutent, approved for kidney and stomach
cancers, failed in two studies to shrink breast tumors, and the
experimental drug figitumumab didn&#8217;t help lung cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trial Halted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. halted a
trial of their experimental blood thinner, apixaban, after an
increase in bleeding outweighed benefits for patients who
recently suffered a heart attack or severe chest pain. The
treatment was being tested to prevent heart complications in
patients with a condition known as acute coronary syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s bosutinib treatment for leukemia wasn&#8217;t better
than Novartis AG&#8217;s treatment Gleevec after a year, the company
reported yesterday. The Pfizer-funded study of 502 patients is
continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler served as both CEO and chairman. The board will
elect a new chairman, separating the two roles, at a meeting
within two weeks, the company said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also said on Dec. 5 it was creating a $75 million
fund and new compliance panel to settle shareholders&#8217; lawsuits
that charge top company officials failed to stop illegal
marketing of drugs. Pfizer last year paid $2.3 billion to settle
U.S. claims it marketed treatments for unapproved purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including invested dividends, Pfizer&#8217;s stock has declined
20 percent since Kindler was named CEO on July 28, 2006,
compared with a return of 10 percent for the SP 500
Pharmaceutical Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Pfizer halved its dividend after the Wyeth acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dividend will probably increase by 10 percent a year
through 2013, from 72 cents to about $1, Barbara Ryan, an
analyst with Deutsche Bank in New York, said yesterday in a note
to clients. She said Read&#8217;s appointment was &#8220;a logical one,&#8221;
bringing &#8220;strong operational expertise and experience to the
job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s search partnership
with Yahoo! Inc. is working &#8220;better than we could have hoped&#8221;
and the company is more confident that the accord will boost the
prices paid for search terms, an executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangement, whereby Microsoft&#8217;s Bing handles the
mechanics of Web search and Yahoo oversees advertising sales, is
exceeding expectations, Charles Songhurst, Microsoft&#8217;s general
manager of corporate strategy, said today at a conference for
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo began depending on Bing&#8217;s technology earlier this
year to cut costs and gain market share. Google Inc.&#8217;s Web
search lead helps it make more money per search because
advertisers are willing to pay for wider distribution. Google
had 66 percent of the U.S. market in October, said Comscore
Inc., while Microsoft and Yahoo combined for 28 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, struck the search
accord after it failed in an attempt to buy Yahoo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songhurst, whose official bio lists accomplishments
including, &#8220;helping kill the acquisition of Yahoo ($48 billion
saved) and negotiating&#8221; the agreement to partner with Yahoo
instead, was speaking at a Nasdaq conference in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 3 cents to $26.87 as of 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale,
California, gained 61 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $16.94. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said it will add
features to its Internet Explorer browser that let users better
protect their privacy online by creating &#8220;Do Not Call&#8221; lists
for the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 9 will bar listed websites from tracking
what users do on the Web, said Dean Hachamovitch, a Microsoft
vice president who&#8217;s in charge of Internet Explorer. The
controls also impose limits on what content blocked sites can
display to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission called for a
do-not-track option for browsing and pressed advertisers to make
data practices clearer for users. Currently advertisers record
consumers&#8217; movements on the Internet and compile a profile of
their interests to better target ads. Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said its move to add the tools will help drive
discussions on the FTC request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called Tracking Protection features will be in the
near-final version of Internet Explorer 9, which will be
available early next year. A test version without these features
already has been released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can create tracking lists and share them with users
who want to adopt that list. Users can install multiple lists
and also designate any Web pages on those lists as safe if they
do want to exchange information with those sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregated Content &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many websites display content aggregated from several other
sites. If a user blocks a site, that site&#8217;s content also won&#8217;t
show up when the user visits a permitted site that happens to
display information from the banned one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online advertising revenue swelled to $12.1 billion in the
first half of 2010, up 11 percent from the same period a year
earlier, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer is the most popular
browser with 58 percent of the market, it has been losing
considerable share to Mozilla Corp.&#8217;s Firefox and Google Inc.&#8217;s
Chrome, according to Net Applications, which tracks Internet
usage statistics. Firefox has 23 percent and Chrome has 9.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc., the world&#8217;s second-
biggest payments network, and Visa Europe Ltd. are suspending
use of their brands by WikiLeaks, which released thousands of
secret U.S. military and State Department documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard and London-based Visa Europe, operator of the
largest card network in the European Union, are following EBay
Inc. unit PayPal, which recently cut access to WikiLeaks for
violating the online payment processor&#8217;s acceptable use policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MasterCard is currently in the process of working to
suspend the acceptance of MasterCard cards on WikiLeaks,&#8221; said
James Issokson, a spokesman for the Purchase, New York-based
company, in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions are the latest in a series by companies that
may crimp access to funds for WikiLeaks. PostFinance, the
banking arm of SwissPost, closed a bank account held by
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, saying he doesn&#8217;t qualify to
be a client. Amazon.com Inc. dropped WikiLeaks from its website-
hosting service for breaching terms of service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Kleine, a spokesman for Visa Europe, said in an e-
mail that the firm suspended Visa payment acceptance on
WikiLeak&#8217;s website &#8220;pending further investigation into the
nature of its business and whether it contravenes Visa operating
rules.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe and San Francisco-based Visa Inc. are separate
companies. Cnet reported MasterCard&#8217;s decision earlier today on
its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Arrest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange, 39, was arrested in the U.K. today after Swedish
police issued an international arrest warrant on rape
allegations. Assange, who was denied bail, challenged the
request to turn him over to Swedish authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Stephens, Assange&#8217;s U.K. lawyer with the firm Finers
Stephens Innocent LLP in London, told reporters outside court
that the bail ruling was &#8220;unfortunate.&#8221; He said that many
people believe the allegations in Sweden are politically
motivated. Stephens represents media organizations, including
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard didn&#8217;t receive a request from the U.S.
government or any third party before acting, according to
spokesman Chris Monteiro. &#8220;This decision was MasterCard&#8217;s
alone,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WikiLeaks drew condemnation for posting thousands of
classified documents on its website, including U.S. embassy
communications and a military video of a July 2007 helicopter
attack in Iraq that killed a Reuters television cameraman and
his driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in 2006, WikiLeaks receives confidential material
and posts it on the Internet &#8220;so readers and historians alike
can see evidence of the truth,&#8221; the nonprofit organization says
on its website. WikiLeaks relies on donations to fund operations
and accepts payments via credit card, bank transfer and postal
mail, according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said it will
boost its investment banking team in Southeast Asia by 30
percent to 40 percent in the next 12 to 18 months to tap growth
in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company will also expand its presence in

corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions for Southeast
Asia, said at a briefing in Singapore today. He declined to

&lt;p&gt;The volume of mergers and acquisitions in Southeast Asia is
expected to increase by 20 percent to 30 percent in 2011, led by
cross-border transactions in the consumer and energy sectors,
Sivitilli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen initial public offerings, each in excess
of $300 million to $400 million, are likely in Singapore next
year, Yeo Hong Ping, head of investment banking in the city-
state, said at the same briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are also looking to issue more innovative debt
products, such as the perpetual bonds sold by Noble Group Ltd.
in October this year, Yeo said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global market for mergers and
acquisitions may have &#8220;relatively strong&#8221; growth next year as
corporate earnings recover, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s German
head said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the global MA transactions volume to grow 10
percent to 15 percent in the mid-term,&#8221; Alexander Dibelius,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head of operations in Germany and Austria as
well as Russia and central and eastern Europe, told journalists
yesterday. The volume may increase 8 percent to 12 percent in
2011 &#8220;if there are no major market dislocations,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MA market worldwide has increased 11 percent this year
to $1.95 trillion from 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. New York-based Goldman Sachs has been the second-
biggest adviser in 2010 after Morgan Stanley, the data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dibelius said higher corporate earnings, improved business
outlooks and expansion in emerging markets such as Brazil,
Russia, India and China will drive MA growth in the mid-term, a
period he defined as three to five years. Emerging markets
accounted for 43 percent of the global deal volume this year, up
from 27 percent in 2007, while the volume in Germany fell to 3
percent from 7 percent of the total, according to Dibelius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for initial public offerings will also &#8220;recover
significantly next year,&#8221; helped by equity funds that are
seeing money inflows again, he said. &#8220;The IPOs in our pipeline
indicate a clear improvement in this area.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer source code former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. programmer Sergey Aleynikov is accused
of stealing can be found on the Internet, an expert witness said
on the last day of Aleynikov&#8217;s trial before closing arguments
start tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Goldberg, an associate professor of computer
science at New York University and the only witness for the
defense, said he compared the high frequency trading code, which
Goldman Sachs and prosecutors say was proprietary, with what&#8217;s
publicly available on websites. They were either the same or
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s was slightly modified, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of code he found on Aleynikov&#8217;s computers was
proprietary, told a federal jury in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The material he downloaded or obtained from Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s computers contained lots of open source software,&#8221;
Goldberg testified today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested in July 2009 and charged with
stealing portions of the code from Goldman Sachs on his last day
of work for the bank in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is charged with violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. If
convicted, he faces as long as 15 years in prison. His attorney,
Kevin Marino, argued Aleynikov broke a confidentiality rule of
the company and didn&#8217;t commit a crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Wheel of Fortune&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in New York concluded their case today
by calling witnesses who told jurors about a lawsuit against
Aleynikov by the creators of the &#8220;Wheel of Fortune&#8221; TV game
show. The suit claimed Aleynikov and his company created an
online version of the game that violated the show&#8217;s intellectual
property rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov entered into an agreement in December 1997 in
which &#8220;he was ordered to cease infringing on the television
show&#8221; and to stop publishing a game he was selling, prosecutors
said. When he was arrested last year, investigators found a
resume in which Aleynikov &#8220;essentially bragged about his theft
of intellectual property,&#8221; prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government argued that the suit and the order could be
considered by jurors as relevant to Aleynikov&#8217;s motives for his
alleged crimes against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Open Source&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov who started working as a programmer at Goldman
Sachs in May 2007 is accused of copying hundreds of thousands of
lines of computer source code. Aleynikov told federal
investigators that he intended to copy only &#8220;open source&#8221; code
not owned by Goldman Sachs, according to the prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti told jurors that
after Aleynikov agreed to take a job at Teza Technologies LLC,
the Chicago-based company promised him a $1.2 million salary, a
bonus and profit-sharing, compared with $400,000 he was making
at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 5:20 p.m. on his last day of work Aleynikov sent
parts of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s high-speed trading code to an outside
computer server, Facciponti said in opening statements to the
jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov sent stolen code to a code-storage website in
Europe that wasn&#8217;t blocked by Goldman Sachs, he said. Aleynikov
then executed a program to cover his tracks, Facciponti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is
presiding over the trial, to keep parts of the evidence secret
to avoid disclosing Goldman Sachs trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courtroom was closed today after Marino said his expert
witness would discuss the confidential evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is offering
U.S. home-loan bonds without government backing to investors
after acquiring about $6 billion in a single trade this month,
according to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most-profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
won bidding for the debt after a limited competition that also
included Morgan Stanley, according to the people who declined to
be identified because the transaction was private. State Street
Corp. sold the notes, possibly on behalf of a customer, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase is a sign the largest brokers, which mostly
stopped making markets in the bonds as the global financial
crisis peaked in 2008, are being emboldened to carry bigger
inventories after values soared and buying and selling revived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would be a massive trade, an attention-getter,&#8221;
said David Castillo, senior managing director at San Francisco-
based broker Further Lane Securities. &#8220;There&#8217;s liquidity in the
market and a tremendous amount of cash that&#8217;s looking to be put
to work, though going into yearend, everybody wants to buy
cheaply.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan
Stanley, also in New York, and Carolyn Cichon, a spokeswoman for
Boston-based State Street, didn&#8217;t return messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers last month conducted open auctions for almost $14
billion of home-loan bonds lacking guarantees from government-
supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae or federal agency Ginnie
Mae, according to Empirasign Strategies LLC. Since the start of
July, the amount of securities offered through the process has
totaled $75 billion, with at least $11.5 billion failing to be
sold, according to the New York-based data provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Profitable &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outstanding debt in the market, which grew as large as $2.3
trillion in 2007, totals about $1.3 trillion, according to
Federal Reserve data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities, among the largest causes of the $1.8
trillion of writedowns and credit losses at the world&#8217;s largest
financial firms during the global crisis, have been among the
most profitable debt investments over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the bonds returned about 16 percent, while fixed-
rate subprime-mortgages securities gained more than 24 percent
through November, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-Eleven Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
convenience-store chain, will buy 183 Florida properties from
Exxon Mobil Corp. as it accelerates North American acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash transaction comprises 169 stores in markets
including Orlando and Palm Beach, five parcels of land and
contracts to supply gasoline to nine service stations owned by
dealers, Sean Duffy, 7-Eleven&#8217;s vice president of mergers and
acquisitions, said today in a telephone interview. The companies
declined to disclose the purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held 7-Eleven, the Dallas-based unit of Japan&#8217;s
Seven  I Holdings Co., is considering another nine
transactions, with the number of stores ranging from fewer than
10 to as many as 200, Duffy said. The U.S. retailer has added
about 750 stores since 2007 and will bring its total to almost
800 in Florida with the Exxon acquisition, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a great opportunity in the industry now that goes
with our aggressive approach to mergers and acquisitions,&#8221;
Duffy, 45, said. &#8220;We have access to a lot of capital and
lending rates are extremely favorable now. Our debt is close to
being extinguished.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duffy declined to disclose 7-Eleven&#8217;s debt or potential
acquisition targets. A lack of credit to some small- and medium-
size companies is impeding their efforts to borrow and refinance
debt, forcing them to consider selling stores, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching Signs, Displays &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and the largest U.S. oil
company, started divesting its domestic retail outlets in 2008
to focus on higher-profit businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7-Eleven plans to spend $250,000 to $500,000 a store to
remodel the Exxon locations in Florida during the next two
years, Duffy said. Most will be switched to 7-Eleven signs and
interior displays, taking advantage of the company&#8217;s marketing
and distribution for its 610 Florida stores, he said. All will
keep selling Mobil gasoline and let customers use the ExxonMobil
credit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The convenience chain ended discussions to buy Casey&#8217;s
General Stores Inc. on Nov. 3 after failing to agree on terms.
7-Eleven offered $2.1 billion including net debt, or $43 a
share, for the Ankeny, Iowa-based company, which rejected a deal
with Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., a Laval, Quebec-based
convenience-store chain, earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Florida acquisition, 7-Eleven will operate,
franchise or license almost 8,500 stores in the U.S., Canada and
Mexico, said Margaret Chabris, a company spokeswoman. It
operates about 39,500 stores in 16 countries, generating
worldwide revenue of $58.9 billion in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. won a contract to
provide Web-based e-mail and other services to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, making headway in efforts to gain
share in the growing market for cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal agency will move 120,000 users to the company&#8217;s
Internet-based e-mail and conferencing software, said Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft. The company said it beat out Google
Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. for the deal and
the department confirmed it looked at all of the available
competing options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies are racing to lure customers that want
computing delivered over the Internet from an outside provider,
via the so-called cloud. The contract, which also involves
instant messaging and document-sharing programs, is the largest
U.S. government adoption of cloud software, Microsoft Vice
President Ron Markezich said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department chose Microsoft because half its workers
already use Microsoft&#8217;s Exchange e-mail software, Chris Smith,
chief information officer for the Agriculture Department, said
in an interview. Because cloud programs are typically stored on
the provider&#8217;s server, customers can save money on machines and
the cost of maintaining and updating the software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc., the movie-rental
service, will expand its online offering of Walt Disney Co.
shows, adding programs such as ABC Family&#8217;s &#8220;Greek&#8221; after
introducing a streaming-only service last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licensing deal with the world&#8217;s biggest media company
covers delivery over the Internet for an expanded lineup of TV
shows from the ABC broadcast network, Disney Channel and, for
the first time, ABC Family, the companies said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix is making more films and programs available to
consumers through Web-connected TV sets and game consoles,
lowering its dependence on mail-order DVDs. In November, the Los
Gatos, California-based company introduced its first streaming-
only subscription in the U.S. for $7.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Disney Channel and ABC Family shows will be available
for streaming on Netflix as early as 15 days after airing on TV,
Kim Harbin, a Disney spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. No ABC
broadcast episodes will be on Netflix during the current season,
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior seasons of ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Lost,&#8221; &#8220;Ugly Betty&#8221; and
&#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; will be available, the companies said today,
as well as shows from ABC Studios such as &#8220;Scrubs&#8221; and
episodes of Disney Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Good Luck Charlie.&#8221; The
agreement includes old episodes of Disney Channel hits &#8220;Hannah
Montana&#8221; and &#8220;The Suite Life of Zack  Cody,&#8221; and movies such
as &#8220;High School Musical&#8221; and &#8220;Camp Rock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts&#8217; Ratings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under its October 2008 deal with the Starz premium cable
channel, Netflix streams first-run movies to its &#8220;Watch
Instantly&#8221; service from Walt Disney Studios and Sony Pictures.
The agreement is set to expire in late 2011, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 29 analysts who follow the company, 7 have sell
ratings, 17 say hold and 5 suggest buying it, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Studios will likely become much more aggressive in
pushing for higher content fees,&#8221; Barton Crockett, an analyst
with Lazard Capital Markets who has a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the
stock, said today in a research note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix named David Wells to replace Chief Financial
Officer Barry McCarthy, according to a statement yesterday after
the markets closed. Wells, who served most recently as vice
president of financial planning and analysis, will take on the
new role as of Dec. 10. McCarthy is leaving to explore positions
outside the company, Netflix said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a Barclays Capital investor conference today,
McCarthy said there is no single piece of content that Netflix
must have to succeed. The company might expand its international
streaming business beyond Canada as early as next year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 36 cents to
$36.97 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Netflix, whose share price has more the tripled this year,
dropped $1.58 to $188.23 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd., operator of the
largest payment-card network in the 27-nation European Union,
will reduce debit-card transaction fees paid by retailers as
part of a deal to end EU antitrust action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission will drop its investigation into
debit-card charges after Visa Europe promised in April &#8220;to
significantly cut&#8221; fees to 0.2 percent of a purchase, the
agency said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lower inter-bank fees will trigger real benefits for
merchants and consumers whilst more transparent rules will also
improve competition in the cards market,&#8221; said Joaquin Almunia,
the EU&#8217;s competition commissioner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, which split from Visa Inc. before the U.S.
card company&#8217;s initial public offering in early 2008, will
reduce fees for transactions worth as much as 20 billion euros
($26.5 billion) every year, Almunia said. MasterCard Inc. agreed
to reduce debit card fees to the same rate last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called interchange fee, based on Visa Europe&#8217;s
guidelines, is paid by a retailer&#8217;s bank to the bank that issued
a customer&#8217;s card. Visa Europe, owned by more than 4,000
European banks, said the new rate would cut the fees concerned
by less than 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EuroCommerce, a group representing stores including
Carrefour SA, the world&#8217;s second biggest retailer, and Tesco
Plc, said it was &#8220;dismayed&#8221; because the settlement &#8220;will do
little to remove the burden of interchange fees from Europe&#8217;s
retailers and consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe said it hoped to reach &#8220;an agreed outcome&#8221; on
a separate EU probe into fees for credit-card and deferred-debit
transactions, where customers must settle their bills at the end
of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 400 million Visa-branded cards in Europe, about 280
million are debit cards, said Simon Kleine, a spokesman for Visa
Europe, in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said the 0.2 percent rate was chosen as &#8220;the level
where merchants have no preference whether consumers pay with a
Visa debit card or with cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, based in London, said the agreement may allow
the average 0.2 percent fee to be revised &#8220;if further data
becomes available on the cost of different means of payment,
including cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under its legally binding deal with the EU, Visa Europe
promised to reduce the maximum interchange fee for four years in
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Sweden,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Visa Europe will also publish
fee amounts and allow retailers to choose whether to accept its
various debit cards. The company can be fined by regulators if
it violates the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard settled a similar case with the commission last
year, agreeing to reduce the interchange fee to 0.3 percent of a
transaction&#8217;s cost for credit cards and 0.2 percent for debit
cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tushar Poddar, chief India economist
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., comments on the outlook for the
country&#8217;s economy and the rupee. He spoke at a press event in
Mumbai today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee fell today, snapping a six-day winning streak,
as a move by the U.S. to extend tax cuts to boost growth in the
world&#8217;s largest economy reduced the allure of higher-yielding
currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are expecting growth to continue to be strong next
year. Our forecast is 8.7 percent on gross domestic product
growth for the financial year ending March 2012 and this is
being driven by investment demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are looking at 8.3 percent growth&#8221; for the financial
year that ends March 31, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On inflation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are looking at an average number of 6 percent for the
next fiscal year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On interest rates and central bank policy: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With inflation expectations high, asset prices rising,
and with high fiscal and current account deficits, we think that
the Reserve Bank of India will have to hike interest rates
through the course of 2011. We are expecting them to hike by a
100 basis points next calendar year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On currency: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have revised our currency forecasts. We are looking at
a 44 rupee target over 12 months with a three-month target of
45.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talisman Energy Inc., the Canadian
explorer aiming to spend about $200 million in Papua New Guinea
this year, said it is interested in supplying gas to Exxon Mobil
Corp.&#8217;s $15 billion project in the Pacific nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talisman may feed a potential third or fourth production
unit at the Exxon-led liquefied natural gas venture, among other
options, Ian Angell, Talisman&#8217;s business development manager,
said in Sydney today. The company aims to tap as much as 5
trillion cubic feet of gas resources, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
ConocoPhillips are among companies in Australia and Papua New
Guinea advancing with LNG projects to meet Asian demand for the
fuel. Exxon partner Oil Search Ltd. has said it is seeking
reserves to support two more processing units, or trains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You might think Talisman is all about shale&#8221; development
in North America, Angell said at a conference today. &#8220;Southeast
Asia potentially offers the greatest upside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Calgary-based company also is &#8220;actively pursuing and
have invested significant money already in understanding the
potential for a longer-term gas offtake project,&#8221; possibly an
LNG development or a gas-to-liquids development, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talisman in 2009 acquired U.K. explorer Rift Oil Plc for
about 108 million pounds, adding gas assets in Papua New Guinea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizon Oil Ltd. said in November that Papua New Guinea
refused to extend a license covering gas fields in the nation.
The permit is held by a venture including Horizon, Adelaide-
based oil and gas producer Santos Ltd. and Talisman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Kindler
will receive about $9.6 million in severance, bonus and short-
term incentive pay for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment includes $4.51 million for severance and $5.05
million in awards for 2010 performance. Kindler also will get
retirement pay valued at about $6.9 million, the New York-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. All of Kindler&#8217;s
stock and short-term awards may be recovered by Pfizer within a
year if he &#8220;engages in an activity harmful to the company,&#8221;
New York-based Pfizer said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer underperformed its rivals over the 4 1/2 years of
Kindler&#8217;s tenure. The stock dropped 35 percent under his
leadership, and the company&#8217;s price-earnings ratio for the past
year is lower than 91 percent of pharmaceutical industry peers
and below 97 percent of companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler resigned Dec. 5 and was replaced as Pfizer CEO by
Ian C. Read, 57. Read&#8217;s pay hasn&#8217;t been determined, according to
the filing. Kinder in recent months lost support of executives
frustrated with his management style, according to a person
familiar with the proceedings who asked not to be named because
the deliberations were private. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As chairman and chief executive
officer of BlackRock Inc., Larry Fink controls more money than
Germany has gross domestic product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock is the world&#8217;s biggest asset-management firm, a
$3.45&#160;trillion powerhouse that is Wall Street&#8217;s largest trading
partner, set to pay investment banks $1&#160;billion in fees this
year. It manages $1.4 trillion for public pension funds in
states including New York, New Jersey and California, and
invests $240 billion for central banks and sovereign wealth
funds such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company serves as the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s go-to
source for private-sector financial expertise and managed at
least $150&#160;billion in toxic assets on behalf of U.S. taxpayers
after the 2008 bailouts of American International Group Inc. and
Bear Stearns Cos. While running the company is a team effort,
Fink, 58, is BlackRock&#8217;s brain, and BlackRock, increasingly, is
Wall Street&#8217;s, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its Dec. 13
edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no bank, no sovereign wealth fund, no insurance
company that&#8217;s as large as BlackRock,&#8221; says Ralph Schlosstein, a
co-founder who left in 2007 and is now CEO of Evercore Partners
Inc., a New York-based investment bank. &#8220;BlackRock today is one
of, if not the, most influential financial institutions in the
world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of all this, it&#8217;s surprising how few people beyond
Wall Street are familiar with Larry Fink and BlackRock. Founded
in 1988 as a bond-trading shop, BlackRock has somehow reached
financial omnipotence while remaining out of the public eye,
escaping the scorn, and the acclaim, so often heaped on the
nation&#8217;s premier investment bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors, Not Traders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BlackRock competes with Goldman&#8217;s much smaller
asset-management unit, the two firms are fundamentally
different. That&#8217;s because trading, not investing, makes up most
of Goldman&#8217;s business, and Goldman is known as a place where
executives achieve mind-boggling wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock is focused on the less lucrative work of
investing money for individuals and institutions such as pension
plans, endowments and foundations through mutual funds,
exchange-traded funds and separately managed accounts. It makes
most of its money through management fees rather than by taking
positions for itself. On Wall Street, where boring is suddenly
better, Fink is the newly minted nerd king. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are two things that Goldman has, or used to
have, that Fink and his BlackRock co-founders -- Rob Kapito, 53,
Susan Wagner, 48, and Charles Hallac, 46 -- covet: a prestigious
brand and a permanent spot in the public consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pep Talk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an October afternoon, recognition is very much on Fink&#8217;s
mind as he prepares to address his 8,900 worldwide employees in
one of his quarterly &#8220;state of the state&#8221; pep talks. The
atmosphere crackles inside the company&#8217;s seventh-floor
conference room in Manhattan, where an oval table and a wall of
monitors show live footage of BlackRock offices around the
world, giving the place the feel of the White House&#8217;s situation
room. One end of the table remains conspicuously empty until two
young men in blue dress shirts sit down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dude,&#8221; jokes a third, seated on a bench against the wall,
&#8220;you realize Larry&#8217;s gonna be sitting right there? Can you
handle the pressure?&#8221; The two scramble into other chairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later, Fink walks in with a slightly sheepish
affect and takes his seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Good morning, everyone,&#8221; he says, holding a single sheet
of paper. &#8220;I&#8217;m not here to tell you we&#8217;re perfect. We have
problems, as all firms do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking Points &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talks about BlackRock&#8217;s quarterly performance (&#8220;We grew
by 9 percent&#8221;); the company&#8217;s recent, slightly troubled
integration of Barclays Global Investors, the U.K.-based money
manager BlackRock bought for $15.2&#160;billion in 2009 (&#8220;It&#8217;s clear
to me that we have a firm that&#8217;s more cohesive than ever&#8221;); and
the current share price (&#8220;I think the market is dead wrong in
terms of where our stock is trading&#8221;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhetoric is hardly soaring, but Fink exudes confidence.
He tries to excite his audience with descriptions of the firm&#8217;s
success and power and the need for all employees to try harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a giant responsibility,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We have to not
just focus on $3.4&#160;trillion of assets being managed, but who
we&#8217;re managing for -- maybe it&#8217;s your parents, maybe it&#8217;s a
school teacher or a fireman.&#8221; The company is &#8220;connected to the
entire world in what we do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Fink returns to one of his favorite themes, an
issue that drives him and keeps him awake at night: the chronic
underappreciation of his company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-Management Skills &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to continue to build the BlackRock brand,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;And, hopefully someday, your families will know what
BlackRock is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the financial crisis turned the Wall Street power
structure on its head, BlackRock offered something valuable --
the ability to analyze risk, especially bond risk and mortgage-
bond risk. The company had been collecting data on mortgages
since 1994, when the market was much smaller than it is today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the possession of all this information made
BlackRock important beyond its size. As bank executives and
government officials woke up to the horror of toxic mortgage
debt hiding on balance sheets around the world, BlackRock was
one of the few entities that could actually figure out what the
stuff was worth -- and could do so without presenting a
competitive threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailout Backup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Expertise would have been irrelevant without the trust,&#8221;
says Terrence Keeley, a former managing director of UBS AG,
which hired BlackRock to analyze a $22&#160;billion portfolio of debt
that it later sold to the firm. The company helped the U.S.
Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve with the government-
backed buyout of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase  Co. as well
the bailouts of American International Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock was also lucky, because asset-management firms
have barely been affected by the new post-crisis regulations
that are causing terror across boardrooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it made its share of mistakes before and after the
crisis -- including significant losses in funds that invest in
real estate and mortgage-backed securities -- the company has
only gained power and prestige since 2007 and this year is
expected by analysts to earn almost $2&#160;billion on $4.7&#160;billion
of revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Fink was one of the highest-paid chief
executives on post-bailout Wall Street, with $15.9&#160;million in
compensation, according to data from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, while Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein got $862,657, down
from $41 million in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquiring Stature &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways BlackRock became so huge -- swamping its
nearest competitors, State Street Corp. and Pacific Investment
Management Co. -- was by swallowing other companies. In 2004 it
purchased State Street Research  Management (no relation to
State Street) for $375&#160;million from MetLife Inc.; two years
later it acquired Merrill Lynch  Co.&#8217;s investment unit for $9
billion, bringing its assets above the $1&#160;trillion mark. In
February, while BlackRock was digesting Barclays Global, it
filed paperwork with the SEC reporting stakes of more than 5
percent in 1,800 companies, temporarily paralyzing the SEC&#8217;s
electronic database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it expands its reach into equity and bond markets around
the world, the company wants to introduce its own trading
platform, which would help BlackRock match buy and sell orders
to save money for clients, reducing its dependence on Wall
Street brokers and cutting the fees it sends to them each year.
BlackRock has also started a capital markets unit to help its
customers invest directly in corporate debt offerings, which
will allow it to negotiate better terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Pulls Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With $3&#160;trillion-plus in assets, it&#8217;s safe to assume
BlackRock can pull it off,&#8221; says Marc Irizarry, an analyst at
Goldman Sachs in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock recently has been in the headlines for the wrong
reasons: On Dec.&#160;7, the Massachusetts state pension fund pulled
$1&#160;billion from the company, citing dissatisfaction with its
performance and the departure of key executives. Investors
withdrew $64&#160;billion from the company&#8217;s funds in the first half
of this year, and BlackRock&#8217;s shares have plummeted 26&#160;percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are those who say BlackRock, as with Goldman Sachs
before it, has too much sway over the financial system. Others
suggest that its ascent is part of an inevitable reshaping of
Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers&#8217; World &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The balance of power has shifted generally to buyers as
opposed to sellers, and people like BlackRock, who control large
investment funds, will find themselves in a position of power,&#8221;
says Peter Solomon, a former vice chairman of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. who now runs his own New York investment bank.
&#8220;What they do with that power would be worth noting. You see the
White House calling them, and I can guarantee that they&#8217;re not
totally passive with their influence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When BlackRock rearranged its offices earlier this year,
expanding onto several additional floors on East 52nd Street,
Fink decided not to radically redecorate his new space. &#8220;Same
furniture, exactly the same maker,&#8221; he says, gesturing around
the room and chuckling. No $2&#160;million renovation? &#8220;No. I don&#8217;t
believe in that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the surroundings are hardly shabby. In addition to
the L-shaped desk sprinkled with family photos, there are potted
orchids, shelves of books displayed like trophies and paintings
from Fink&#8217;s personal collection of American folk art on the
walls. He and his wife, Lori, have three children and live
primarily in Manhattan, although they also own homes in North
Salem, N.Y., an hour north of the city, and Aspen, Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discounting Goldman Comparison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perched on a cream-colored armchair in his office, Fink is
a disarming presence. Leaning forward with elbows on knees, his
face reacting to questions with cartoonishly exaggerated
expressions, he&#8217;s less like a master of the universe than a
master of the water cooler -- albeit one who discourses on
unemployment rates and the intricacies of quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He brushes off the Goldman Sachs comparison. &#8220;They&#8217;re in
such a different business,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be in that
business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the recent history and fates of the two companies are
inextricable. BlackRock raised $126&#160;million in an initial public
offering, to little fanfare, in September 1999 -- the same year
Goldman staged its own $3.7&#160;billion IPO. Eleven years later,
BlackRock&#8217;s stock is up 1,110&#160;percent, compared with a
200&#160;percent increase for Goldman. Fink is a warmly received
guest of politicians and policy makers in Washington, some of
whom wouldn&#8217;t risk being caught chumming around with Blankfein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Little Fearsome &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think in some cases, people could be a little frightened
of us,&#8221; Fink says. &#8220;Goldman Sachs is a great partner of
BlackRock&#8217;s, and yet we compete bitterly against each other,
too, in the asset-management side. We use them as a
counterparty, and we do a lot of trades with them.&#8221; But, he
says, &#8220;we are very different. This is who we want to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary trading helped banks rake in enormous gains
during the stock market boom that peaked in October 2007. Fink
said BlackRock shouldn&#8217;t use its balance sheet for anything but
co-investments alongside investors, a distinctly un-Goldman-like
strategy. He says he rejects the idea of expanding BlackRock&#8217;s
reach by moving closer to an investment bank or securities firm
approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wall Street&#8217;s about velocity of money,&#8221; Fink says. &#8220;And as
velocity of money became more and more important, relationships
became less and less important, and as Wall Street started to
realize they could make more money by &#8216;balance sheeting&#8217; things,
it became less client-centric.&#8221; He says, &#8220;I wanted to do
something different, and that was being client-centric.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobbying Lawmakers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One consequence of BlackRock&#8217;s prominence is that, like
Goldman Sachs, the firm has to work to avoid the perception of
arrogance. As implementation of the financial reform bill is
being worked out by various regulatory agencies in Washington,
BlackRock, in what seems like an audacious move to people
including Janet Tavakoli, has lobbied to be excluded from the
definition of a &#8220;systemically important&#8221; firm to avoid more
stringent regulatory oversight, arguing that it does not have
balance sheet risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you&#8217;re big enough, you do pose a systemic risk. Like
Fannie and Freddie, their portfolios are so large, any move they
make moves the market,&#8221; says Tavakoli, a structured-finance
consultant. &#8220;BlackRock can&#8217;t have it all ways, and so far
they&#8217;ve escaped without so much as a whisper about their
reputation, which right now isn&#8217;t looking too good from where I
sit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock has also proven that it won&#8217;t be shy about
confronting the world&#8217;s biggest financial institutions to defend
its turf. In October the company was part of a group including
Pimco and the New York Federal Reserve that sent a letter to
Bank of America Corp., then BlackRock&#8217;s biggest shareholder,
seeking to force the bank to repurchase soured mortgages
packaged by its Countrywide Financial unit into $47&#160;billion of
bonds. Bank of America reduced its stake in BlackRock from
34&#160;percent to about 7.1&#160;percent as federal regulators pushed it
to improve its balance sheet. Fink refuses to discuss the demand
letter, except to say that his firm has a duty to ensure that
the securities purchased on behalf of BlackRock&#8217;s clients are
what the bank claimed they were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the controversy surrounding the company prevented
it from effectively becoming an adjunct of the U.S. government.
As the financial system creaked under the weight of toxic
mortgage debt in 2007, Fink and other BlackRock executives
became regular sounding boards for Timothy Geithner, then
chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. Both have remained in regular
contact with Fink, according to phone records made public by the
agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling for Help &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock&#8217;s first assignment came as the subprime-mortgage
collapse triggered withdrawals from a money-market fund managed
by the Florida Local Government Investment Pool. BlackRock was
chosen over JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Barclays Plc to salvage
the fund by separating the good assets from those that couldn&#8217;t
be sold, for a $125,000 fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Bear Stearns fell apart in March 2008, JPMorgan CEO
Jamie Dimon had a BlackRock team of 50 analysts work through the
weekend to evaluate Bear Stearns&#8217;s most illiquid assets. At the
end of the weekend, Geithner called Fink to ask him to manage
$30&#160;billion in bad mortgage debt that had been carved out from
Bear Stearns&#8217;s books before its healthier parts were sold to
JPMorgan. BlackRock played a similar role with AIG, Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fees that BlackRock earns from these assignments were
disclosed last year after Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of
Iowa and others expressed outrage over the lack of competitive
bidding in the awarding of the government contracts and the
potential for conflicts of interest. BlackRock is set to earn at
least $120&#160;million from the Fed over a three-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Grassley reiterated questions about the dual role
of BlackRock in advising the Federal Reserve and being one of
the eight investment firms selected to buy assets under the
Public-Private Investment Program. In a letter to Neil Barofsky,
the special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief
Program, Grassley asked the auditor about any findings the
agency has made about potential conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While BlackRock was advising the government on the value of
some toxic assets, it and other firms such as Pimco were buying
similar securities through their investment units. The company
also drew $3.8&#160;billion from the Fed&#8217;s Term Asset-Backed
Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. The firm has repaid all but
$221&#160;million of the funds to the government. BlackRock used the
program to give its fund clients the investment opportunity,
said Bobbi Collins, a spokeswoman for the firm. Its investment
funds don&#8217;t have access to information that isn&#8217;t publicly
available and that it has procedures in place to wall off its
advisory and fund units, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original Idea &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it were a calmer period, would there have been a better
process? Maybe,&#8221; says Fink. &#8220;We were in these moments where four
hours made a difference. I would like those people who criticize
to have been there to witness what was going on at that time.&#8221;
He says, &#8220;This could be some of my hubris, but I believe we
might have been the only firm that could have done it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock was born in 1988 out of a concept that&#8217;s obvious
now but was somewhat novel at the time: risk management is
crucial. &#8220;I think we caught an idea before people recognized
that it was an important idea,&#8221; Fink says. &#8220;We believe that
fully understanding what you&#8217;re investing in is very important.&#8221;
Asked where this lightning bolt came from, Fink laughs and says:
&#8220;Losing money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Guy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fink grew up in Van Nuys, California, the son of a shoe
salesman and an English professor. He attended the University of
California, Los Angeles business school before joining First
Boston -- now part of Credit Suisse Group AG -- where he traded
bonds in the 1980s. His work slicing and pooling mortgage bonds,
then selling them to investors as securities called
collateralized mortgage obligations, has today mushroomed into a
$2&#160;trillion market. Fink&#8217;s department became the most profitable
at First Boston, and at 31 he was made the youngest-ever
managing director at the firm, as well as the youngest member of
its executive committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rise ended abruptly in 1986, shortly after his 33rd
birthday. During the first quarter, an investment he&#8217;d made had
resulted in a $100&#160;million profit; the following quarter, his
division lost more than $100&#160;million as interest rates fell
unexpectedly. Fink says he became a pariah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I knew intellectually how much risk we were taking, but I
didn&#8217;t have the tools to truly understand it,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We were
loved when we made the hundred-plus million dollars the first
quarter; they hated us when we lost $100 million.&#8221; He says,
&#8220;We should have been fired for making all the money and not
understanding how we were making it! It was a big lesson, at 33
years old.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Backing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left First Boston under a cloud less than two years
later and started BlackRock with Schlosstein, a former Lehman
trader. The firm began its life in the headquarters of its first
financial backer, Blackstone Group LP, which gave BlackRock a
$5&#160;million line of credit for a 40&#160;percent stake. The fledgling
firm&#8217;s mission was obscure but simple: to help investors
understand the risks in their bond portfolios. &#8220;In April of
1988, people would say, &#8216;Risk management for bonds?&#8217; They looked
at us like we were crazy,&#8221; says Susan Wagner, who joined the
firm at its inception and is now a BlackRock vice chairman.
&#8220;Today, that model has been validated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm accumulated about $20&#160;billion in assets by 1994.
While business was picking up, the relationship between
BlackRock and Blackstone became tense. Fink had a falling out
with Blackstone co-founder Stephen Schwarzman that same year
over BlackRock&#8217;s independence, resulting in the sale of
BlackRock to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. of Pittsburgh for
$240&#160;million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE Breakthrough &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real breakthrough for the company came in 1995, when it
helped General Electric Co. value and dispose of a $10&#160;billion
portfolio of distressed mortgage securities, saving $1&#160;billion
for GE and establishing BlackRock&#8217;s reputation. By 2000, Fink
saw a chance to build out the firm&#8217;s analytics into a separate
business, called BlackRock Solutions. The unit offers a risk-
management system called Aladdin and now employs more than 800
people with degrees ranging from economics and engineering to
mathematics and nuclear physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aladdin can analyze stocks, bonds and derivatives, though
what makes it particularly valuable is the work it can do on
mortgage-related bonds, the area that Fink helped develop in the
1980s. The system categorizes and assigns a value to each
mortgage bond in an investor&#8217;s portfolio based on location, Zip
Code and dozens of other criteria, says Charles Hallac, a co-
founder and the head of BlackRock Solutions, which accounts for
about 5&#160;percent of the firm&#8217;s fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power of Aladdin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a green-and-white computer screen on his desk, he
demonstrates what clients see when they log into the Aladdin
system: the value that BlackRock has assigned to each individual
security they&#8217;ve invested in, while modeling the value of the
security for scenarios such as a repeat of the 2008 credit
crisis, a falling U.S. dollar or the breakout of an Asian flu
pandemic. As the financial crisis worked its way through the
system, Aladdin was a big reason why BlackRock was summoned by
governments and financial institutions around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2008, BlackRock had started moving away from the
riskiest bonds two years before and came through the worst
market since the Great Depression without posting a loss,
although not all of its investors fared as well. The firm
managed to squeeze out a profit of $54&#160;million in the last
quarter of 2008, as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the
ensuing market paralysis shocked Wall Street. This put the
company in a good position to pounce on Barclays Global, a deal
that was hatched by Fink lieutenant Rob Kapito at a Yankees
game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missteps Taken &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, lost $2.1&#160;billion in the last
three months of 2008, its first-ever quarterly loss. The
investment bank also accepted $10&#160;billion in bailout funds from
the U.S. government that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock isn&#8217;t immune to outside forces. Investors in the
preferred shares of its closed-end funds saw their investments
frozen as the auction-rate market collapsed in 2008. Some
distressed-debt strategies, created before the market meltdown,
sank millions of dollars into loans that continued to lose value
as markets tanked. And for all its expertise in evaluating
fixed-income assets, BlackRock&#8217;s own long-term track record in
the area has been mediocre. In the three years ended Sept. 30,
funds representing only 55&#160;percent of BlackRock&#8217;s fixed-income
assets had beaten their respective benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDO Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BlackRock had a bit of a stumble in their bond funds in
2008, as there was a failure to anticipate that the global
unwind would take out everything except government bonds,&#8221; says
Eric Jacobson, a Morningstar Inc. fund analyst in Chicago. &#8220;I
think the lesson they and many others learned is that
ultimately, despite a good risk-management system, it&#8217;s the
quality of active management that will carry you to the next
step.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics such as Tavakoli also say that BlackRock&#8217;s dismal
performance as a manager of certain collateralized-debt
obligations during the height of the real estate bubble raises
questions about whether the company should be trusted with
massive amounts of government assets. According to Tavakoli&#8217;s
research, several deals worth billions overall that BlackRock
put together went bust; problems in the mortgage market were
already evident, and financial institutions were scrambling to
keep the securitization money train running by executing deals
that were sure to fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I look at their track record with CDOs, I think there
were gravely serious questions,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They&#8217;re too close to
the problem to merit getting any no-bid contracts&#8221; from the
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuyvesant Town &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the magnitude of the Great Recession and the
corresponding collapse in real estate markets, we are
disappointed with the return experience of CDOs with real estate
exposure,&#8221; Collins, the BlackRock spokeswoman, says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had about $9.6&#160;billion in CDO assets as of
Sept. 30 of this year. Fink says he thinks the government will
end up making money on the toxic AIG and Bear Stearns assets
BlackRock managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the company&#8217;s most public humiliations, it also
lost money in Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, a Manhattan
apartment complex acquired by in 2006 by BlackRock&#8217;s real estate
unit and Tishman Speyer Properties LP. One of BlackRock&#8217;s
investors, the California Public Employees Retirement System,
lost $500&#160;million on the deal, prompting Fink to personally
apologize to the board of the state pension fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the clients for whom we made mistakes, we&#8217;re guilty,&#8221;
Fink says. &#8220;It still gnaws at me that we failed them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Swoosh&#8217; Recovery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in his office, Fink is less than dire about the future
of the teachers and firefighters whose causes he likes to
publicly champion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m much more constructive than the consensus,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;I never felt the economy was going to have this V shape; I
always talked about the swoosh economy. And that&#8217;s what it is.
It&#8217;s still the Nike swoosh economy. At the end of the swoosh it
goes up. It&#8217;s just a longer swoosh part, and that&#8217;s where we
are.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far he rides that swoosh is a question of increasing
importance, and the subject of much speculation. Fink says that
the time is coming when he won&#8217;t run BlackRock. He aspires to
someday enter public service if the right opportunity presents
itself, though he isn&#8217;t specific about what that opportunity
might be. As he ruminates on the future, he jumps up to fetch a
blue binder from his bookshelf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do a 360 review of every leader,&#8221; he says, opening the
book. &#8220;This is really intense stuff.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He starts to read an anonymous comment contributed by
another BlackRock executive: &#8220;Overall, I&#8217;d give Larry a 96 out
of 100,&#8221; he begins. Then, &#8220;I worry about Larry. I love that he&#8217;s
client focused, but one day he&#8217;s going to keel over. In flying
all around the world, he insists on taking commercial
transportation. We should probably get him a plane.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. has begun work on plans
to comply with a corrective action order issued by the U.S.
Transportation Department following a crude-oil pipeline leak in
Salt Lake City, according to Mickey Driver, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in the process of inspecting valves and other
equipment along our pipeline,&#8221; Driver said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan will address future prevention measures, enhanced
detection and response, and ongoing reliability of the pipeline
system, according to Driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,
which is part of the Transportation Department, issued a
corrective order yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The order prevents the company from returning the line to
service without an approved plan that meets PHMSA&#8217;s safety
regulations,&#8221; Damon Hill, a spokesman for the agency, said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order also requires the company to draw up and execute
short- and long-term plans for correcting safety issues to
prevent similar situations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Federal officials tasked with oversight and enforcement
of this pipeline&#8217;s operation have told us the line will not be
restarted without assurances that our residents and environment
will be protected,&#8221; Ralph Becker, the mayor of Salt Lake City
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company took possession of a large cylindrical steel
component late yesterday that is part of the fluid catalytic
cracking unit, Allexon said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based company also plans to install
larger flare gas and compressor systems during planned
maintenance in spring 2011, Pam Malek, a company spokeswoman,
said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery can process about 60,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy producer, will boost capital spending by 20 percent
to $26 billion next year, devoting more of its budget to finding
and pumping oil and natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the spending program, $22.6 billion, or 87 percent,
of the capital budget will go to exploration and production, the
San Ramon, California-based company said in a statement today.
Another $2.9 billion, or 11 percent, will fund work on its
refineries, pipelines and fuel sales units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of its budget Chevron invests in finding and
producing oil and gas, known as the upstream business, has risen
from 77 percent of spending in 2008. Crude oil futures prices
have averaged $78.97 a barrel this year in New York, 27 percent
more than last year&#8217;s average price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are more heavily weighted in upstream because the
returns in the sector are stronger over time,&#8221; Kurt Glaubitz, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron expects to pump the average equivalent of 2.75
million barrels of crude a day this year, according to company
slides prepared for analysts at a Nov. 11 conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget includes spending for gas projects in western
Australia and deep-water exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
and Nigeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 51 cents to $86.65 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares, which have 19 buy and
six hold ratings from analysts, have climbed 13 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. energy company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citadel LLC, the $12 billion hedge
fund run by Ken Griffin, said it hired former JPMorgan Chase 
Co. coal head Miguel Abreu to trade the commodity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abreu joined the Chicago-based firm this month, Katie Spring, a spokeswoman for Citadel, said today in an e-mailed
response to questions. Abreu will trade from London in the
energy trading group led by Mark Stainton, she said. Abreu
couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan began dismissals in its commodities business in
July after buying parts of RBS Sempra Commodities LLP, according
to an internal conference call given by Blythe Masters, head of
the unit, a recording of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses at JPMorgan&#8217;s coal business cost the company as much
as $250 million, the New York Post reported June 8, without
saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought RBS&#8217;s metals, oil and European power and
gas businesses for $1.7 billion from San Diego-based Sempra
Energy and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, headquartered in
Edinburgh. The sale was completed on July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters said in July that the dismissals would eliminate
less than 10 percent of the combined &#8220;front offices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil trader Ira Eisenstein said yesterday he left JPMorgan
last week following the restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citadel expanded into energy in 2002. Four years later
Citadel and JPMorgan Chase  Co. took over the energy trades of
Amaranth Advisors LLC when the hedge fund collapsed after losing
$6.6 billion on natural gas. Citadel later bought the positions
held by New York-based JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citadel trades oil globally, as well as natural gas in
North America and gas and power in Europe, according to its
website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia, the world&#8217;s biggest
supplier of cocaine, saw production of the illegal narcotic
decline last year amid a government spraying campaign and
declining U.S. consumption, according to a new report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s capacity to produce pure cocaine fell by 10 tons
to 270 metric tons in 2009 from a year earlier, and compared
with about 700 tons in 2001, the U.S. Office of National Drug
Control Policy said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine production in Colombia fell to less than half the
world&#8217;s total last year, when Peru surpassed the nation in
cultivation of the drug&#8217;s base ingredient, the coca leaf, the
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia, backed by more than $600 million in annual U.S.
anti-narcotics aid, has stepped up drug eradication efforts this
decade and intensified its campaign against drug-funded
guerrilla groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine production in neighboring Peru rose last year, to
225 metric tons, while output in Bolivia remained stable at 195
metric tons, according to today&#8217;s statement by the White House
drug czar. Europe may be one of the main markets of both
nations, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine usage in the U.S. is declining even as consumption
of other drugs increased in 2009 from two years earlier,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As eradication and law-enforcement efforts increase,
traffickers are diluting the drug, the drug czar said. Purity of
cocaine seized in bulk shipments in the U.S. declined 14 percent
from 2006 to 2010. Colombia supplies about 95 percent of cocaine
consumed in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s government says the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia is the country&#8217;s biggest cocaine trafficker, and
dozens of its commanders have been indicted on drug-smuggling
charges by the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil trader Ira Eisenstein left
JPMorgan Chase  Co. last week as the second-largest U.S. bank
by assets restructured its team after the $1.7 billion
acquisition of RBS Sempra Commodities LLP units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am no longer there,&#8221; New York-based Eisenstein, who
spent 17 years at Morgan Stanley before JPMorgan, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;A number of other people left
at the same time. They are just restructuring.&#8221; JPMorgan
trimmed oil traders to make room for new staff, Eisenstein said.
Kimberly Weinrick, spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s global commodities unit, led by Blythe Masters,
trimmed headcount following acquisitions including units of Bear
Stearns Cos. and UBS AG. The bank began dismissals on July 21 to
cut the RBS Sempra overlap and eliminated less than 10 percent
of the combined &#8220;front offices,&#8221; Masters said that month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sempra Energy, based in San Diego, and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, headquartered in Edinburgh, completed a $1.7
billion sale to JPMorgan of the venture&#8217;s metals, oil and
European power and gas businesses on July 1. &#8220;The acquisition
almost doubled the number of clients the firm&#8217;s commodities
business can serve,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a Nov. 9 filing to the
Securities Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Purchase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed in October to buy RBS Sempra&#8217;s North
American natural gas and power trading book for about $220
million. RBS was forced to sell its commodities unit to comply
with European Union rules after getting 45.5 billion pounds
($71.8 billion) in the largest bailout of a U.K. bank. The
lender bought a controlling stake in Sempra Energy in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For every organization that is reshaping their business,
there&#8217;s likely another looking to hire,&#8221; Dominic Mound, a
consultant at Commodity Appointments Ltd., said today in
Singapore. &#8220;Demand for good, quality people remains strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank may cut jobs at its industrial-metals team in
London, according to a Dec. 1 Metal Bulletin report, citing
unidentified people. At least two jobs there will be cut to
eliminate duplication, according to the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, the bank said it would close the proprietary
trading desk in commodities to comply with new U.S. curbs on
investment banks, according to a person briefed on the matter.
The closure affected fewer than 20 traders in the unit, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisenstein, 52, said he joined the bank in April 2008 to
help build the physical oil trading business. Among the people
he worked with was Andy Kelleher, former president of
ConocoPhillips Supply  Trading, who joined the bank in August
2009. Eisenstein was an executive director at Morgan Stanley
before joining JPMorgan in 2008, said an October presentation
from JPMorgan. He started his career at Phibro Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. is the largest U.S. lender by assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil  Natural Gas Corp., India&#8217;s
biggest energy explorer, has submitted a binding bid for Exxon
Mobil Corp.&#8217;s 25 percent stake in Angola&#8217;s Block 31, the
government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offshore block may start producing crude oil in 2012
and output may reach a peak of 150,000 barrels a day, junior oil
minister Jitin Prasada said today in parliament in New Delhi,
without giving more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-owned ONGC is part of India&#8217;s push to secure energy
supplies overseas as demand for fuels rises in Asia&#8217;s second-
fastest-growing major economy. The government has ordered ONGC
to make at least one big acquisition in the year ending March 31
after Indian companies lost out to China in bids for $12.5
billion of assets in the year ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prasada didn&#8217;t mention the value of the bid. ONGC may pay
$2 billion for Exxon&#8217;s stake in the block, the Economic Times
reported Nov. 1. ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma couldn&#8217;t immediately
be reached on his mobile phone for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Ross, a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil, declined to
say whether its stake in the block is for sale or comment on the
minister&#8217;s statement. The Irving, Texas-based company remains
&#8220;committed to Angola and to ongoing operations,&#8221; she said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, through a subsidiary, operates Block 15, the single
largest producing block in Angola, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC shares declined 1.8 percent to 1,321.60 rupees in
Mumbai trading while the benchmark Sensitive Index fell 2.3
percent. The stock has climbed 12 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Partners &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc owns 26.7 percent of Block 31 and is its operator,
Prasada said. Its partners include Statoil ASA, Total SA,
Marathon Oil Corp. and Angola&#8217;s state-run oil company, Sonangol
SA, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is encouraging national oil companies to invest in
foreign oil and gas projects, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said
Nov. 1. The nation&#8217;s demand for oil and gas will increase 40
percent in the next 10 years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian companies are looking to invest in oil and gas
assets in African countries, including Nigeria, Sudan, Ghana,
Uganda and Angola, Prasada said in a separate statement in
parliament today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s breast-cancer drug
Aromasin and similar treatments from AstraZeneca Plc and
Novartis AG make women 26 percent more likely to develop heart
disease than an older therapy, a study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, presented today at the San Antonio Breast Cancer
Symposium in Texas, suggests that women already at risk for
cardiac conditions should limit use of these drugs, researchers
said. Tamoxifen, a generic alternative approved in 1977, carries
less risk of heart complications, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromasin, AstraZeneca&#8217;s Arimidex, and Femara from Novartis,
are in a family of medicines known as aromatase inhibitors that
work by halting production of estrogen, a hormone that fuels
cancer growth. These drugs generated more than $3.5 billion last
year, often used after tamoxifen, which prevents tumor cells
from using estrogen. Two thirds of all breast-cancers are fed by
estrogen, according to the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It appears that aromatase inhibitors have a significant
increase in cardiotoxic side effects, such as heart attack,
angina and heart failure,&#8221; said Eitan Amir, a senior fellow in
oncology and hematology at the Princess Margaret Hospital in
Toronto, in a statement. &#8220;Switching drugs may reduce the side
effects.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women,
killing almost 433,000 annually, according to the American Heart
Association. An estimated 209,000 women will be diagnosed with
breast cancer this year, making it the most common tumor type in
women, according to the American Cancer Society. More than
40,000 women die from it each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart, Fracture Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women who took aromatase inhibitors were 26 percent more
likely to have heart disease and 47 percent more likely to
suffer a fracture than those on tamoxifen, regardless of how
long they took the medicine, an analysis of seven studies used
to win approval of the drugs found. The research was conducted
in older, post-menopausal women with early breast cancer.
Patients on tamoxifen were more likely to develop endometrial
cancer and dangerous blood clots in the legs during the studies.
There was a suggestion that women who switched to aromatase
inhibitors after starting on tamoxifen were less likely to die
from something other than breast cancer than those who started
treatment with the medicines. The approach didn&#8217;t seem to reduce
the risk of serious side effects, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, reported revenue of $483 million
from Aromasin last year. London-based AstraZeneca had sales of
$1.92 billion for Arimidex. Novartis, of Basel, Switzerland,
generated $1.27 billion from Femara in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study today found Pfizer&#8217;s Aromasin worked as well
as AstraZeneca&#8217;s Arimidex, the market leader with $1.9 billion
in sales last year. The researchers originally hypothesized that
Aromasin, currently used a second-line therapy, may be more
effective with fewer side effects than Arimidex. They conducted
the first head-to-head comparison of the medicines to identify
any differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 7,500 women participated in the study, which was
funded by the National Cancer Institute in the U.S. and the
International Breast Cancer Study Group in Europe. Women taking
Aromasin were less likely to have osteoporosis and elevated
cholesterol levels, and had higher rates of mood changes and
signs of reduced liver function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Citibank, Bank of
America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit and five other banks were
sued by the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm to recover
more than $1 billion for the con man&#8217;s defrauded customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, which include Natixis SA, Fortis Prime Fund
Solutions Bank (Ireland) Ltd., ABN Amro Bank NV, Nomura Bank
International Plc. and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA,
received money through Madoff feeder funds when they knew, or
should have known, that Madoff&#8217;s investments were a fraud, the
trustee, Irving Picard, said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, who faces a two-year legal deadline that runs out
Dec. 11, has filed hundreds of suits in the past month, seeking
more than $34 billion from banks, feeder funds, investors and
others alleged to have profited from Madoff&#8217;s decades-long Ponzi
scheme, the biggest in history. So far, Picard has recovered
about $2.5 billion for victims of the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Citi will vigorously defend against these claims by the
trustee as they are without merit and entirely untrue,&#8221;
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said in an e-
mailed statement. &#8220;Citi did not know about nor in any way
assist in the Madoff fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the other banks didn&#8217;t return requests
seeking comment after regular business hours yesterday. Picard
filed the complaints under seal yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard also sued former Tremont Capital Management Chief
Executive Officer Sandra Manzke and Maxam Capital Management
seeking more than $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxam, which Manzke started after she left Tremont in 2005,
invested more than $300 million of investors&#8217; money with Madoff
in less than three years, Picard said in a complaint filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. He seeks a
return of almost $100 million that Maxam withdrew from Madoff as
well as fees the firm received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manzke didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
seeking comment yesterday. Jonathan Cogan, a lawyer who
represents Manzke in a separate securities lawsuit against
Tremont, also didn&#8217;t immediately return a call to his office
after regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.

&lt;p&gt;DBS Accused of Misrepresenting Lehman-Related Product in Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS Bank Ltd., a unit of Southeast Asia&#8217;s biggest lender,
was sued by a client claiming fraudulent and negligent
misrepresentations that a $1.5 million Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.-related investment was &#8220;sound.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former DBS banker Desmond Lim Hong Nian had said principal
invested in the structured product was safe, according to a Nov.
30 lawsuit filed with the Singapore High Court by Australian
Mark Carpenter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s seeking to recover the $1.17 million he lost when
Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008, and claiming an
additional $280,000 from DBS and Lim for losses incurred after
the bank made five unauthorized transactions in currency-linked
investments, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS in February had its ban on the sale of structured notes
lifted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore after it improved
the internal procedures of its advisory services across all
investment products. The Singapore-based bank was one of 10
financial institutions banned from selling structured notes
following claims by investors that they were misled on products
tied to Lehman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Lee, a Singapore-based spokeswoman at DBS, said the
bank will defend the lawsuit. Lim is no longer employed by the
bank, she added, declining to elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpenter&#8217;s lawyer N. Sreenivasan couldn&#8217;t be reached for
comment at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS denied in court filings telling Carpenter that his
principal in the investments would be protected. Carpenter
indicated he was prepared to take high risks and was an
experienced investor who made his own decisions, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mark Carpenter vs DBS Bank Ltd. S444/2010 in
the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard Sues Madoff U.K. Ex-Directors, Family Members &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidators of Bernard Madoff Securities International
Ltd., the U.K. arm of the convicted con man&#8217;s investment firm,
sued the unit&#8217;s former directors in a London court seeking at
least $80 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed yesterday, alleges the U.K. office acted
&#8220;as a cover&#8221; for the New York firm&#8217;s fraud, the liquidators
said in a joint statement with Irving Picard, the U.S. trustee
of Madoff&#8217;s business and the other plaintiff in the suit. The
defendants include Madoff&#8217;s brother, his two sons and five
directors including Stephen Raven, the former chief executive
officer of the European unit, the liquidators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directors breached their duties &#8220;by making fraudulent
payments to various Madoff-related entities, including payments
for luxury goods and services enjoyed by Bernard Madoff and the
Madoff family, including a yacht, a home in the south of France,
and an Aston Martin car,&#8221; the liquidators at Grant Thornton LLP
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty in March 2009 to using money
from new investors to pay off old ones in a Ponzi scheme,
sparking investigations and dozens of lawsuits. U.K. prosecutors
dropped a criminal probe into Madoff&#8217;s London unit in February
after they found &#8220;insufficient evidence&#8221; to charge anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $910 million was transferred between the London
unit and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in New York
from the time of the office&#8217;s founding in 1983 until firm&#8217;s
collapse in December 2008, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are baseless claims against Mark and Andrew Madoff,
who were not involved in the financial operations of Madoff
Securities International&#8221; Martin Flumenbaum, an attorney for
Madoff&#8217;s sons, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;They were
outside directors with de minimis ownership interests. They had
no knowledge of their father&#8217;s crimes, including any fraudulent
activity related to the London entity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raven&#8217;s lawyer, Nicola Finnerty, declined to immediately
comment. Charles Spada, a lawyer for Madoff&#8217;s brother, Peter,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonja Kohn, the former chairman of Bank Medici AG in
Austria, was also sued for funneling more than $27 million to
the London unit &#8220;in sham transactions purported to be payments
for research and other services, but which were actually
kickbacks,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to a Kohn spokesman and a lawyer that previously
represented her weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Madoff Securities International Ltd. v. Stephen Ernest John Raven, 10-1468, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench
Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Trustee Sues UBS for $555 Million, Tremont &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG and Tremont Group Holdings Inc., the hedge-fund firm
owned by Oppenheimer Acquisition Corp., were sued by the trustee
liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s investment firm over claims they
profited from his fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim for at least $555 million against UBS comes after
a $2 billion suit against the Zurich-based bank last month,
Irving H. Picard, the lawyer appointed as trustee by a New York
bankruptcy court, said in a statement Dec. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard said in a separate statement that Tremont, its
funds, affiliates and owners including Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co. ignored obvious warning signs of fraud to maximize
their own profits and self-interest. The statement didn&#8217;t say
how much he was seeking from Tremont. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any money recovered will be returned to Madoff&#8217;s victims on
a pro rata basis, said Picard, who has so far recovered about
$2.5 billion for creditors of Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC. Picard faces a Dec. 11 deadline to file claims
against parties alleged to have profited from Madoff&#8217;s fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Cockerill, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for UBS, said
yesterday by e-mail that the bank would take &#8220;all appropriate
steps&#8221; to show Picard&#8217;s latest allegations are &#8220;false and
unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Cybulski, a spokesman for MassMutual, couldn&#8217;t be
reached by telephone after working hours and didn&#8217;t respond to
an e-mail requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina after admitting he directed the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Sues Former Employees Over Client Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. sued four former employees over
claims they mounted a &#8220;coordinated attack&#8221; by taking client
records to their new employer, New York-based Dynasty Financial
Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-employees of Bank of America&#8217;s U.S. Trust unit said
in their resignation letters that taking the records is allowed
under a voluntary recruiting agreement, according to the
complaint filed yesterday in New York state Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America,
the biggest U.S. lender, nor U.S. Trust signed such an
agreement, according to the complaint. Bank of America seeks a
court order barring the former employees from using U.S. Trust&#8217;s
wealth management client information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Trust&#8217;s client records are contained in databases
which provide &#8220;complete, comprehensive information regarding
every aspect of a client or potential client&#8217;s financial
information, including their liquid assets, total net worth,
investment styles and preferences, and asset allocation,&#8221;
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records may also contain clients&#8217; bank account
identification and names of advisers, accountants and attorneys,
according to the complaint. The suit names as defendants Dynasty
Financial, Michael C. Brown, Charles F. Britton, Marcus Wilson
and Amanda Kerley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, a Bank of America financial adviser with $5.9
billion in client assets, was recruited by Todd S. Thomson,
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s former head of wealth management, Bloomberg
News reported Dec. 6. Dynasty Financial, which offers technology
and services for independent advisory firms, was founded by
Thomson and Shirl Penney, another ex-Citigroup manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Trust, founded a decade before the Civil War, was
purchased by Charles Schwab Corp. in 2000. Bank of America
agreed to pay $3.3 billion for the business in 2006 to add to
its units that manage the assets of wealthy Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for Dynasty Financial,
declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of America v. Michael C. Brown, New York
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Suit Claims Insider Trading of Wimm-Bill-Dann &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued
unidentified buyers of Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC securities over
what the agency called &#8220;highly profitable and suspicious
purchases&#8221; before PepsiCo Inc. announced it would buy a 66
percent stake in the Russian dairy and juice producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unknown purchasers&#8221; bought 400,000 American depositary
receipts in the Russian company from Nov. 29 to Dec.1, when
there was no public information available concerning the
contemplated acquisition, the agency said yesterday in a
complaint in federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After PepsiCo&#8217;s announcement of the acquisition, the price
of Wimm-Bill-Dann&#8217;s ADRs, traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
increased by 28 percent, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result, the unknown purchasers are in a position to
realize total profits of approximately $2.7 million from the
sale of the ADRs,&#8221; the SEC said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, announced Dec. 2 that
it intended to acquire the interest in the company for $3.8
billion, with U.S. shares priced at $33. That was 32 percent
more than the average in the preceding 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors bought Wimm-Bill-Dann&#8217;s U.S. shares through
an account at SG Private Banking (Suisse) SA, a subsidiary of
Societe Generale Bank  Trust SA, the U.S. regulators said in
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. One or More Unknown Purchasers, 10-
cv-9159, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas Sued by Former Clients Claiming Deception, Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas Wealth Management was sued by two former
private banking clients in Singapore who claim they were
deceived into buying high-risk investment products that resulted
in an $11 million loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of the world&#8217;s biggest bank by assets and Wee Wan
Tin, a Singapore-based managing director, engaged in fraud to
sell two-year equity-linked investments tied to Intel Corp.,
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Dell Inc. in 2007, Indonesian
businessman Henry Djuhari and his wife Nathaline Lie Djuhari
said in a lawsuit filed with Singapore&#8217;s High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss was because of the global financial turmoil and
the couple&#8217;s decision to sell the investments, the Paris-based
bank said in its filing with the court. The Djuharis had also
&#8220;voluntarily consented&#8221; to taking on the risks involved, BNP
Paribas said. A closed hearing in the case was held Dec. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See Tow Soo Ling, the lawyer for the Djuharis, didn&#8217;t reply
to an e-mail and phone calls requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunis Lee, a Singapore-based spokeswoman at BNP Paribas,
said she couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Henry Djuhari  Anor vs. BNP Paribas Wealth
Management  Anor, S604/2010 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Deal in Muni Case May Be &#8216;Tip of the Iceberg&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s agreement to pay $137 million in
restitution for taking part in a nationwide bid-rigging
conspiracy for municipal-investment contracts may soon be
followed by more settlements to repay the scheme&#8217;s victims, the
Justice Department&#8217;s Antitrust Division head said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stay tuned to this channel -- I think you will see a lot
more activity in the coming weeks and months,&#8221; Christine
Varney, the antitrust chief, said, according to Bloomberg News&#8217;s
Martin Z. Braun and Jeff Bliss. &#8220;We are committed to getting
restitution, full restitution, to all the municipalities that
were victims of this scheme,&#8221; Varney added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, which has assisted the government probe of
the $2.8 trillion municipal-bond market since at least 2007 in
return for leniency, has provided documents, e-mails and
recordings of phone calls, according to court records of civil
suits. In September, Douglas Lee Campbell, formerly employed by
the bank&#8217;s municipal derivatives group, pleaded guilty to taking
part in a conspiracy to pay state and local governments below-
market rates on investments purchased with bond proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s settlement is &#8220;likely the tip of the
iceberg,&#8221; Andrew Gavil, a law professor at Howard University in
Washington, D.C., said in an e-mail. He said other conspirators
may pay much higher penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has identified more than a dozen firms,
including JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG, and Societe Generale as
unindicted co-conspirators in a criminal case brought by the
Justice Department against a Los Angeles investment broker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota Will Face Acceleration Cases Under Tentative Order &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp. will have to face lawsuits claiming
deaths and personal injuries caused by unintended sudden
acceleration of its vehicles if a tentative ruling by a federal
judge in California becomes final. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for injured customers and families of those killed
in accidents provided sufficient evidence to allow their cases
to go forward, said U.S. District Judge James V. Selna in Santa
Ana, California, in a tentative ruling yesterday. Selna earlier
denied Toyota&#8217;s motion to dismiss class-action, or group suits
claiming economic losses related to sudden acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automaker is accused in the lawsuits of failing to
disclose or warn of a defect in its vehicles that could cause
sudden acceleration. Toyota said in court filings that the
plaintiffs didn&#8217;t offer specific allegations of an actual defect
and that the company didn&#8217;t conceal anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Toyota demands a level of specificity that is not
required at the pleadings stage,&#8221; Selna wrote in his tentative
order. &#8220;The defect is identified: plaintiffs&#8217; cars suddenly and
unexpectedly accelerate and do not stop upon proper application
of the brake pedal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Toyota City, Japan, has recalled more
than 8 million vehicles for repairs related to sudden,
unintended acceleration. In September 2009, the automaker
announced a recall of 3.8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles
because of a defect that may cause floor mats to jam accelerator
pedals. The company later recalled vehicles over defects
involving the pedals themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Judge Selna&#8217;s ruling is tentative and we will be in
court&#8221; today to discuss it, Celeste Migliore, a Toyota
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;It would be inappropriate to
comment on a tentative ruling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota faces about 400 lawsuits alleging lost vehicle value
or injury or death from sudden acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selna is scheduled to hear oral arguments today about his
tentative ruling. Federal lawsuits claiming death or injury
caused by episodes of sudden acceleration are combined in his
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the judge finalizes this important tentative ruling,
the plaintiffs&#8217; ship is sailing at full speed with a prevailing
wind,&#8221; Mark Robinson, one of the lead lawyers in the personal
injury and death cases, said yesterday in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are combined as In re Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Used Credit Ratings &#8216;Arbitrage&#8217; for CDOs, Court Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc exploited the difference between companies&#8217;
credit ratings and the view the open market took of their
default risk in structuring securities, a former Barclays banker
told a London court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonio Agresta, who structured the notes at the center of
a 92 million-euro ($122 million) lawsuit, told the High Court
yesterday that the process, known as &#8220;credit ratings
arbitrage,&#8221; &#8220;formed the basis&#8221; of the bank&#8217;s collateralized
debt obligation business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CDO business existed because historically there has
been a consistent discrepancy between the implied default
probability&#8221; of credit ratings &#8220;and historical default
rates,&#8221; Agresta said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays is being sued by San Marino bank Cassa di
Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino SpA, or CRSM, for
fraudulent misrepresentation over the sale of CDOs. Barclays
denies the allegations that it sold CSRM structured notes
designed to have a much higher default risk than their triple-A
rating suggested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is scheduled to last for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San
Marino SpA v. Barclays Bank Plc, 08-757, High Court of Justice,
Queen&#8217;s Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Programmer&#8217;s Expert Says Code Was on Web &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer source code former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
programmer Sergey Aleynikov is accused of stealing can be found
on the Internet, an expert witness testified as the defense
began its case in Aleynikov&#8217;s trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Goldberg, an associate professor of computer
science at New York University, said he made a side-by-side
comparison of the code Aleynikov allegedly stole from Goldman
with what&#8217;s publicly available on websites and determined they
were either the same or Goldman&#8217;s was slightly modified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The material he downloaded or obtained from Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s computers contained lots of open source software,&#8221;
Goldberg testified as the defense began presenting its case
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested in July 2009 and indicted Feb. 11
for stealing high-frequency trading code software from the
brokerage. His attorney, Kevin Marino, argues his client broke a
confidentiality rule of the company and didn&#8217;t commit a crime.
Aleynikov has denied any criminal wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in New York concluded their case
yesterday by calling witnesses who told jurors about a lawsuit
against Aleynikov. The suit accused him of violating
intellectual property rights of the &#8220;Wheel of Fortune&#8221;
television show as the president of a company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alien-Hiring Sanctions Supported in U.S. Supreme Court Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court justices signaled they are inclined to
uphold an Arizona law that threatens companies with the
revocation of their corporate charters if they hire illegal
aliens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia took
the lead as the justices aimed a barrage of questions at a
lawyer challenging the measure in an hour-long hearing in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case may provide a hint as to the court&#8217;s approach to
other state immigration measures, including a separate Arizona
statute that gives local police a greater role in arresting
illegal immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is challenging the law
alongside civil rights groups and a labor union. President
Barack Obama&#8217;s administration also says the law should be struck
down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, which the court will resolve by early July, is
Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting, 09-115. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JJ Loses Jury Trial on Warnings of Levaquin Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson failed to properly warn of the risks of
tendon damage linked to its antibiotic Levaquin, a Minnesota
jury said in the first trial on claims over the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minneapolis federal court jury yesterday awarded
damages of $700,000 in the case of John Schedin, 82, for failure
to warn. It rejected his claim that JJ violated state consumer-
fraud law by misrepresenting or concealing information about
Levaquin. Jurors are considering Schedin&#8217;s claim for punitive
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedin in 2008 sued JJ and its Ortho-McNeil-Janssen
Pharmaceuticals unit, claiming he ruptured both Achilles tendons
after taking the drug. The companies didn&#8217;t warn doctors and
patients of Levaquin&#8217;s association with tendon damage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is the first on more than 2,600 claims in U.S.
courts alleging that Levaquin caused tendon damage in patients
and that New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ failed to disclose
the risk adequately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury assigned 75 percent of liability to Ortho-McNeil-
Janssen, 10 percent to Schedin and 15 percent to his doctor, who
isn&#8217;t part of the lawsuit. This will reduce the judgment so far
against Ortho to $630,000, Jake Sargent, a company spokesman,
said yesterday in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will issue a statement when the trial is over,
Michael Heinley, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Schedin v. Johnson  Johnson, 08-cv-05743,
combined for trial in In re Levaquin Products Liability
Litigation, 08-md-01943, U.S. District Court, District of
Minnesota (Minneapolis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Twilight Zone&#8217; Foreclosure Law Firm in N.Y. Draws Fine, Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven J. Baum&#8217;s New York foreclosure law firm has
attracted lawsuits and fines for its actions during the housing
crisis, with one judge likening its conduct to something out of
the &#8220;Twilight Zone,&#8221; Bloomberg News&#8217;s Thom Weidlich and Karen
Freifeld report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recently as last month, Baum&#8217;s firm, which one lawyer
for homeowners said processes about half the foreclosures in New
York state, was ordered to pay $14,532.50 in legal fees and
costs and a $5,000 fine by Nassau County District Court Judge
Scott Fairgrieve in Hempstead, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said that when Paul Raia refused to vacate a
Garden City co-op after foreclosure, Baum&#8217;s firm filed an
eviction petition that misidentified the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Falsities were contained in five paragraphs out of only
ten paragraphs in the entire petition,&#8221; Fairgrieve wrote in his
Nov. 23 decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 50 U.S. state attorneys general are investigating
whether banks, loan servicers and law firms properly prepared
documents to justify hundreds of thousands of foreclosures. The
probe came after JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Ally Financial Inc.&#8217;s
GMAC mortgage unit said they would stop repossessions in 23
states where courts supervise home seizures and Bank of America
Corp. froze foreclosures nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven J. Baum PC, located in Amherst, New York, just north
of Buffalo, has been accused of overcharging, filing false
documents and representing parties on both sides of a mortgage
transfer. Baum runs the firm his father founded in 1972,
according to a fact-sheet provided by Earl V. Wells III, his
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Judge Removed by U.S. Senate for Corruption &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate voted to convict a federal judge accused of
corruption and remove him from the bench, the first time that
has happened in 21 years and only the eighth time in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge G. Thomas Porteous of New Orleans was charged with
taking cash and bribes from lawyers and bail bondsmen with cases
before his court, making false statements in declaring personal
bankruptcy and lying to the Senate during his confirmation. At
least two-thirds of the Senate voted guilty on each of the four
charges, the threshold needed for a conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House earlier this year approved four articles of
impeachment against Porteous, 63. It found that he had a
gambling problem and was soliciting cash during his time as a
federal judge and earlier while serving on a state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porteous&#8217;s lawyer in the impeachment proceedings, Jonathan
Turley, argued that the accusations against him are either
false, based on errors or weren&#8217;t serious enough to be
considered &#8220;high crimes and misdemeanors.&#8221; Turley said
Porteous already had pledged to retire and not to return to the

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is to give
$20 million to a network of non-profit groups that provide

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. is recalling its lung
drug Thelin worldwide and halting trials of the medicine after
it was linked to potentially life-threatening liver damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No new patients should be prescribed Thelin and those
receiving it should be transferred to other therapies, Pfizer,
based in New York, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine treats pulmonary hypertension, an incurable
condition where there is increased pressure in the arteries of
the lungs, causing shortness of breath, according to the
National Institutes of Health. It is sold in the European Union,
Canada and Australia. It&#8217;s not approved in the U.S. The drug
generated $44.4 million in the first three quarters of 2010,
said Pfizer spokesman Curtis Allen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thelin was not expected to become a major player&#8221;
because of its safety profile, Brigitte de Lima, an analyst for
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote today in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 26 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $17.02 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other treatments for pulmonary hypertension include oxygen,
Pfizer&#8217;s Revatio, calcium channel blockers, which relax the
muscles in the wall of the blood vessels, and diuretics, which
lower the amount of water in the body, reducing the amount of
work the heart has to do, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beckman Coulter Inc., a maker of
laboratory equipment, is exploring a sale after it was
approached by buyout firms interested in taking the company
private, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckman, with a market value of about $4 billion before
today, hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to study whether to go
private or search for a strategic buyer, said the people, who
asked not to be named because the talks are private. Blackstone
Group LP and Apollo Global Management LLC are among the firms
that approached Beckman, said two of the people. The process is
in early stages, and any deal for the Brea, California-based
company would likely be months away, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co., Danaher Corp. and 3M Co. are among
industrial companies that have recently told financial advisers
they are interested in acquiring makers of lab equipment or
scientific instruments used in labs, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckman said in September that Chief Executive Officer
Scott Garrett had resigned and appointed J. Robert Hurley as
interim president and CEO while it searches for a successor.
Beckman would likely seek at least $90 a share in a buyout, and
might command as much as $160 a share, said Dan Leonard, an
analyst with Leerink Swann  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Lab Testing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Beckman Coulter should attract interest from both
strategic and financial buyers,&#8221; Leonard said in a research
report today. &#8220;Beckman&#8217;s diagnostic lab testing platforms stick
well to customers and drive significant consumable revenues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckman jumped 26 percent, or $14.99, to $72.08 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, down 13
percent this year before today, rebounded from a low of $44.58
on Sept. 7, the day Garrett&#8217;s resignation was disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for Beckman and Goldman declined to comment, as
did spokeswomen for Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE and 3M,
based in St. Paul, Minnesota. A spokesman for Washington-based
Danaher didn&#8217;t respond to messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Zehren, a spokesman for Apollo, and Peter Rose of
Blackstone also declined comment. There have been 104
acquisitions in the medical diagnostic equipment business in the
past five years with an average disclosed price of $466 million
and an average premium of 51 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal Premiums &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers paid an average of 18.1 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the
diagnostic-equipment industry deals. Beckman had ebitda of
$205.9 million in the third quarter, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think there is low odds that 3M will seriously look at
this, but we believe GE and Danaher will,&#8221; said Jeffrey Sprague, co-founder of Vertical Research Partners in Stamford,
Connecticut, saying Danaher was the most likely to make an
offer. &#8220;With a $6 billion enterprise value, Beckman Coulter is
probably a bit bigger than either would care to do right now,
but it is a manageable size for either.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE, which has been building its health-care business, in
October agreed to buy cancer diagnostics company Clarient Inc.
in a deal valued at about $580 million. Danaher said in
September it would acquire Keithley Instruments Inc., a maker of
equipment for engineers at electronics manufacturers and
academic institutions, for about $300 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Beckman received a warning letter from U.S.
regulators saying the company marketed a test for heart problems
without proper clearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA Warning &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration
involved a test called AccuTnI, which measures a protein called
tropinin that is a marker for heart problems. The FDA letter
said the company had made &#8220;significant modifications&#8221; to the
product without getting the required regulatory clearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Beckman&#8217;s product quality issues are clearly hindering
new sales and customer retention,&#8221; Bruce Cranna, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. in Boston, said in an Oct. 27 note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Beckman remains a &#8220;substantial player&#8221; in the
laboratory business, &#8220;we have concerns about the macro backdrop
and management&#8217;s ability to blunt the impact of troponin
missteps and prevent the fire from spreading to allied clinical
segments,&#8221; Cranna said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the company&#8217;s &#8220;recent operational troubles,&#8221; a
buyout may be possible at $60 a share to $70 a share, said Amit Hazan, an analyst with Gleacher  Co. in New York, in a note to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckman&#8217;s biggest business is making laboratory equipment
used in scientific research and in hospitals. The company had
revenue of $3.3 billion in 2009. The company had $285 million in
cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckman has more than 275,000 laboratory systems installed
in about 160 countries, Paul Glyer, a company senior vice
president, said at a Piper Jaffray Cos. health-care conference
on Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
makes the most from equity trading of all Wall Street banks, is
losing the head of a unit that invests in securities exchanges
and two senior executives from its London equities division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillip Hylander, 42, who leads the Principal Strategic
Investment Group, will step down at the end of the year,
according to a Dec. 8 memorandum sent to employees and obtained
by Bloomberg News. He will become an advisory director to the
firm on retirement, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew H. Cyzer, head of sales trading in Europe, and John A. Ashdown, 42, head of trading in the region, are retiring,
said a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be
identified because the departures haven&#8217;t been publicly
announced. Cyzer and Hylander joined Goldman Sachs from Deutsche
Bank AG in 2002. While Hylander joined the firm as a partner,
the New York-based firm&#8217;s highest rank, Cyzer and Ashdown were
promoted to the position in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These guys have been doing it for a while, they&#8217;ve had
enough time to raise and grow people beneath them,&#8221; said Jason Kennedy, chief executive officer of Kennedy Group, a London-
based executive search firm. &#8220;Those who have made enough to
retire like Hylander and Ashdown are seeing a good reason to
step down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue from equities sales and trading
dropped 32 percent to $5.43 billion in the first nine months of
this year, in part because the firm lost money in the second
quarter on a bet that stock-market volatility would drop. The
firm this year also shut down a proprietary-trading division
within equities, called principal strategies, in response to
U.S. legislation that prohibits banks from making such bets with
their own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities revenue at the largest eight Wall Street firms
dropped an average of 12 percent so far this year, meaning that
pay is likely to suffer and hiring plans have been frozen,
according to Kennedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very similar to 2008 this year on the equities
side,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;Nobody has budgets for next year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashdown and Hylander weren&#8217;t immediately available to
comment. Cyzer declined to comment. Sophie Bullock, a
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Delta &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashdown&#8217;s formal title was head of One Delta Trading for
Equities, Europe, while Cyzer was co-head of One Delta Execution
Services in Europe. One Delta is the name of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
equities division, which excludes derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hylander, who joined as co-head of pan-European shares,
became head of One Delta as well as co-head of European equities
in 2006 before switching to his current role a year later. The
Principal Strategic Investment Group employs about 20 people
around the world, according to a person familiar with the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successors for Hylander, Cyzer and Ashdown weren&#8217;t named.
The bank said in a July memo that Brian Levine would move to
London from New York in his role of co-chief operating officer
of Equities One Delta Trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two memos were signed by David B. Heller, Edward K. Eisler, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz, the firm&#8217;s four
co-heads of securities sales and trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture
said it chose Microsoft Corp. over Google Inc. for a $27 million
cloud-computing project because the agency wanted to leverage
existing business arrangements with the software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-year review showed that the government would get the
best value by using earlier investments in Microsoft Exchange,
Outlook and SharePoint to create a new e-mail system, the
department said in an e-mailed statement attributed to USDA
Chief Information Officer Chris Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department officials &#8220;felt that we were in the right spot
at the right time to leverage our consolidation of our existing
infrastructure and licenses,&#8221; Smith said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Google said it was not
allowed to bid for USDA&#8217;s business, according to an e-mailed
statement sent to CNET, an online publication. The USDA said its
contract with Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is worth $27
million over three years, with one base year and two option
years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Bank NA is trying to
force a $1.55 billion Las Vegas-area development into
bankruptcy, saying affiliates of builders KB Home, Beazer Homes
USA Inc., and Toll Brothers Inc. mismanaged the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan filed an involuntary bankruptcy in Las Vegas
yesterday accusing the three builders and five other investors
in South Edge LLC of employing a &#8220;hostage-ransom strategy&#8221; to
avoid liability for a $585 million loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit of KB Home owns 48 percent of South Edge, which
controls the 2,000-acre Inspirada residential and commercial
development in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, according to
court documents. The rest of South Edge is owned by the other
investors, including units of Toll Bros. and Beazer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to appoint a
trustee to take control of South Edge and the project. The eight
owners are refusing to put $270 million into the project as they
promised, the bank said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These insiders are sacrificing the project and
repudiating debtor&#8217;s obligations in a quest for great profits at
the expense of not only approximately 39 lenders to whom the
insiders seek to shift their losses, but also to the city of
Henderson,&#8221; JPMorgan said in court papers filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls today to Los Angeles-based KB Home before business
hours; Toll Brothers, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania; and Beazer
Homes, based in Atlanta, weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is in re South Edge LLC, 10-32968, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Carl Icahn&#8217;s hostile bid for Lions
Gate Entertainment Corp. was set back by a New York judge&#8217;s
decision to let a board member vote shares acquired in a deal
that diluted the billionaire investor&#8217;s stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn asked the court to block director Mark Rachesky from
voting the shares he acquired on July 20 at the independent film
studio&#8217;s Dec. 14 annual meeting as he sought the election of
five directors he nominated. New York state Supreme Court
Justice James Yates yesterday denied Icahn&#8217;s request for a
preliminary injunction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn, 74, who is attempting to buy the studio for $7.50 a
share, sued Vancouver-based Lions Gate in Canada and New York in
July to reverse an equity-for-debt swap that increased
Rachesky&#8217;s stake to almost 29 percent. Icahn argued that
management conspired with large shareholders to thwart his bid.
He owns about 33.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The denial of the motion will permit existing shareholders
to vote on Dec. 14 &#8220;while giving Icahn, if he loses the proxy
fight on that day, and should he prevail in the ensuing
litigation, an opportunity for a new election&#8221; with the votes
to be counted in less than 10 months as sought, Yates wrote in
his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said an important factor in his determination was
that Lions Gate&#8217;s lawyers told him another shareholder&#8217;s meeting
would be held in September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn said in a Dec. 6 interview that he needed a favorable
ruling to prevail at next week&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need the court&#8217;s ruling,&#8221; Icahn said. &#8220;If we get
that, Rachesky will go down from 29 percent to 20 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for Icahn, Joseph DiBenedetto, declined to
comment immediately after the decision was released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lions Gate said in a statement it was pleased with the
ruling and believes &#8220;the transaction, which resulted in the
reduction of Lionsgate debt by approximately $100 million,
supported the best interests of the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney Andrew Rossman, who represents Rachesky, said in a
telephone interview, &#8220;We look forward to the annual meeting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Icahn v. Lions Gate, 651076/2010, New York state
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Ex-UBS Executives Indicted in Muni Bid Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former co-head of UBS AG&#8217;s municipal derivatives group
and two colleagues were indicted in the U.S. government&#8217;s
multiyear investigation of bid-rigging on investment contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Ghavami, Gary Heinz and Michael Welty were charged
with six counts in U.S. District Court in New York, the Justice
Department said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The individuals charged today allegedly participated in
complex fraud schemes and conspiracies that subverted
competition in the market for municipal finance contracts and
deprived municipal bond issuers of the benefits of their
investments,&#8221; said Christine Varney, the department&#8217;s antitrust
chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division has ramped up
its more than four-year criminal investigation of the $2.8
trillion municipal bond market in the past few weeks. On Dec. 7, Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay $137 million in restitution
for its involvement in the bid-rigging conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghavami, a Belgian citizen living in Moscow, was arrested
Dec. 1 after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport
in New York. A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker, James Hertz,
pleaded guilty Nov. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Peter Ghavami will plead not guilty and fight this
case,&#8221; said James Mitchell, his lawyer, in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heinz couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment, and Welty hung up on
a reporter. Kelly Smith, a UBS spokeswoman in New York, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department didn&#8217;t identify which company
employed Ghavami, Heinz and Welty. Records filed with the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show they worked for
UBS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Wins Order, Ex-Workers Can&#8217;t Take Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. won a court order blocking four
former employees from using and sharing the bank&#8217;s client
records at their new employer, New York-based Dynasty Financial
Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America alleged Dec. 8 in a complaint in New York
state court that taking the records from the bank&#8217;s U.S. Trust
unit to Dynasty Financial amounted to trade-secret theft. The
employees claimed in their resignation letters that they were
allowed to take the records under a voluntary recruiting
agreement among brokers, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael C. Brown, formerly a Bank of America financial
adviser with $5.9 billion in client assets, and the other three
defendants are temporarily blocked from &#8220;using or disclosing in
any manner the customer lists and any other property or trade
secret information taken at the time&#8221; of their resignation from
U.S. Trust, according to a copy of the order signed by Justice
Melvin L. Schweitzer and provided yesterday by Bill Halldin, a
Bank of America spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for Dynasty Financial, said in
an e-mailed statement that Schweitzer denied &#8220;the majority of
Bank of America&#8217;s claims,&#8221; including a request to prevent Brown
and his team from continuing to work with some clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is unnecessary and &#8220;a blatant&#160;legal tactic&#160;in
an&#160;attempt&#160;to portray Mr. Brown and his team in a negative
light,&#8221; Goldberg said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order directs the former employees to return customer
lists and any other property to U.S. Trust. It also blocks them
from &#8220;soliciting, inviting, encouraging, requesting&#8221; customer
accounts that may have been &#8220;wrongfully solicited,&#8221; according
to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halldin declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit names as defendants Dynasty Financial, Brown,
Charles F. Britton, Marcus Wilson and Amanda Kerley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of America v. Michael C. Brown, 030283,
New York Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Sued By German Investors Over Madoff Fund Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s biggest lender, was sued by a
group of 650 German investors in Luxembourg seeking compensation
for losses they suffered through a fund that placed assets with
convicted conman Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of mainly private investors is seeking about 25
million euros ($33 million) in damages, alleging the London-
based bank is liable for losses through Herald (Lux) US Absolute
Return Fund, said Edouard Fremault, a senior analyst at Deminor
International, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HSBC was responsible for the safekeeping of the assets of
Herald (Lux) and, despite very clear regulation to the contrary
in Luxembourg, HSBC fully delegated custodial functions to
Madoff,&#8221; Fremault said by telephone yesterday. &#8220;HSBC was aware
there was risk associated with Madoff because it had received a
report from KPMG showing this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dec. 6 Luxembourg lawsuit was filed a day after Irving
Picard, the U.S. trustee liquidating Madoff&#8217;s firm, sued HSBC in
New York for $9 billion, alleging the bank enabled Madoff&#8217;s
fraud. HSBC also faces separate Madoff-related lawsuits in
Ireland and Luxembourg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HSBC is party to a number of proceedings in various
jurisdictions&#8221; and &#8220;believes it has good defenses and shall
defend itself vigorously,&#8221; a spokesman for the lender said by
telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC&#8217;s Luxembourg unit was custodian for the Herald (Lux)
fund, which had assets of $225.7 million as of Oct. 31, 2008,
according to Bloomberg data. The fund was forced to dissolve
because of Madoff-related losses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre Seeks to Dismiss Amended SEC Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader accused
of misleading investors in a product linked to subprime
mortgages, asked to have the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s revised lawsuit against him dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amended complaint fails &#8220;utterly to remedy the fatal
defects in the original complaint,&#8221; Tourre said in his motion
filed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. Because the
transactions involving the collateralized debt obligations
called Abacus 2007-AC1 occurred outside the U.S., Tourre can&#8217;t
be held liable under U.S. securities law, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC adds an allegation that a closing for Abacus
2007-AC1 took place in New York on April 26, 2007,&#8221; Tourre said
in his filing. &#8220;As to the closing, the SEC pleads no facts
supporting a plausible inference that the &#8216;closing&#8217; was anything
more than a ministerial lawyer-driven documentation exercise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, which reached a $550 million settlement with
Goldman Sachs in July, included new claims against Tourre in an
amended complaint filed Nov. 22. U.S. regulators accuse the
London-based trader of defrauding investors by not disclosing
that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying
securities for the collateralized debt obligation and planned to
bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan Corruption Cases in U.S. Spotlight Chavez Officials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan corruption cases are surfacing in U.S. courts
with civil and criminal allegations involving judges, financial
regulators and senior military officers in President Hugo
Chavez&#8217;s government, Bloomberg News&#8217; David Glovin and Charlie
Devereux report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since October, U.S. prosecutors have brought an extortion
case against an official of Venezuela&#8217;s securities regulator, an
arms trafficking case tied to engine shipments for Venezuela&#8217;s
air force and a cocaine smuggling case against an accused drug
kingpin who implicated Venezuelan military figures. A civil suit
alleging money laundering by seven top Venezuelan officials is
on appeal after a trial judge dismissed it in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s so much corruption that has washed ashore from
Venezuela,&#8221; said Joel Hirst, an international affairs fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. &#8220;More and more
criminal activity is having its source in Venezuela. It&#8217;s
spilling into the public and into the U.S. courts because a lot
of Venezuelans have fled to the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan officials say corrupt businessmen are using U.S.
antagonism toward Venezuela to protect themselves and tarnish
the international reputation of Chavez&#8217;s self-described
revolutionary, socialist government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those speculating businessmen should show their faces in
Venezuela and stop running away and accusing our officials in
the United States,&#8221; Finance Minister Jorge Giordani told
reporters in Caracas on Nov. 3, referring to charges brought
against a securities regulator official, Rafael Ramos de la
Rosa. Ramos was indicted last month for conspiracy to commit
extortion and launder money as the government-appointed receiver
of Caracas brokerage Uno Valores Casa de Bolsa CA. He pleaded
not guilty in federal court in Miami on Dec. 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Programmer Was &#8216;Thief,&#8217; Prosecutor Tells Jury &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. programmer Sergey Aleynikov
is a &#8220;thief&#8221; who on his last day of work took some of the
company&#8217;s proprietary trading code to use at his new firm, a
prosecutor told jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca Rohr said in closing
arguments yesterday that Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of
thousands of lines of source code from Goldman&#8217;s trading system
on June 5, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He circumvented Goldman&#8217;s security system, sent the code to
an outside server in Germany, and later compressed and encrypted
the code, Rohr told jurors in federal court in Manhattan.
Aleynikov took the code with him to a meeting with his new
employers in Chicago in July, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He had a cheat sheet -- the codes from Goldman Sachs that
he needed to get started with for a trading system&#8221; at his new
employer, Rohr said. &#8220;He wanted to make it seem like he&#8217;d
written the code himself. He was a programmer who stole the
answers to the test.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov&#8217;s attorney, Kevin Marino, argued that his client
may have broken a confidentiality rule of New York-based Goldman
and didn&#8217;t commit a crime. Jurors began deliberations yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is charged with violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. If
convicted, he faces as long as 15 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Airways Says Hong Kong Staff Can&#8217;t Bring U.K. Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; British Airways Plc told a London court that a group of 16
Hong Kong-based former cabin crew shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to sue
the airline in the U.K. for age discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Airways had the right to make the workers retire at
the age of 45 because U.K. discrimination law doesn&#8217;t apply to
them, Thomas Linden, a lawyer for the carrier, told a panel of
judges at the Court of Appeal yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Parliament did not legislate to protect employees across
the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It protects employees who are employed
at an establishment in Great Britain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two lower courts have already ruled against British Airways
and allowed the former Hong Kong-based employees to bring a
claim. Linden said the lower courts erred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their employment with the airline, the flight
attendants flew into the U.K. around 28 times a year spending up
to three days in the country on each occasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie Tether, lawyer for the Hong Kong crew, said that
the earlier rulings were correct and that all employees on U.K.
aircraft operated by a British business are entitled to
protection under the age discrimination laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is British Airways Plc v. Mak and Ors, Appeal of
Appellant from the order of The Employment Appeal Tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay May Be Liable for L&#8217;Oreal Trademark Breaches &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; EBay Inc. can be held liable for trademark breaches on its
auction site if it has been notified of continuing infringement,
a European Union court aide said in a dispute involving L&#8217;Oreal
SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While EBay isn&#8217;t liable for potentially infringing
information posted by users on its site in general, the owner of
the second most-visited U.S. e-commerce site can be held liable
for any infringements from the moment it&#8217;s notified of a
trademark breach and also for content it transfers to search
engines, such as Google and Yahoo. EBay uses L&#8217;Oreal trademarks
as sponsored links to lead users to infringing perfumes and
other cosmetics, L&#8217;Oreal has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whilst EBay is generally exempted from liability for
information stored by its clients on its website, it still
remains liable for the content of data it communicates as an
advertiser to a search engine,&#8221; Advocate General Niilo
Jaeaeskinen of the EU&#8217;s Court of Justice said yesterday in a
non-binding opinion. No exemption applies either &#8220;if EBay has
been notified of the infringing use of a trademark.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&#8217;Oreal has argued EBay is liable for trademark breaches
due to its active involvement in the pre-sale, sale and after-
sale processes on its online platform. The case was referred
from the U.K. to the EU&#8217;s top court in Luxembourg for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruling by the EU court, which in most cases follows its
advisers&#8217; opinions, may help settle pending trademark disputes
between the two companies in France, Belgium and Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Advocate General retained the possibility of
prohibiting the sale of testers and unpackaged products,&#8221;
Paris-based L&#8217;Oreal said in an e-mail. &#8220;This balanced opinion
is overall consistent with the stance that L&#8217;Or&#233;al has held for
several years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-324/09, L&#8217;Oreal SA, Lancome parfums et beaute
 Cie SNC, Laboratoire Garnier  Cie, L&#8217;Oreal (UK) Ltd. v. EBay
International AG, EBay Europe SARL, EBay (UK) Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Afghanistan Contractor Gets 41 Months for Bribery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former KBR Inc. employee in Afghanistan was sentenced to
41 months in prison for accepting bribes for steering work to
companies doing business with the U.S. military. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Freeman of Hempstead, New York, pleaded guilty to
taking $200,000 while working in Afghanistan from 2007 to 2009.
He also admitted he laundered the money by sending cash back to
the U.S. in concealed transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I just made a horrible decision, your honor,&#8221; Freeman
told U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMahon rejected pleas from Freeman&#8217;s lawyer to impose a
sentence of less than the 41 to 51 months called for in
nonbinding federal sentencing guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is very necessary to send a message loud and clear
that this type of behavior will not be tolerated,&#8221; McMahon
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge called Afghanistan a &#8220;murky part of the world&#8221;
where representatives of the U.S. have to operate &#8220;completely
and totally on the up and up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Freeman, 10-cr-00766, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Swaps Lawyers After $590 Million Lehman Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., ordered by a bankruptcy judge to pay Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. $590 million after taking its

Shearman  Sterling LLP as its representative in the continuing
case, according to a Dec. 6 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo Reaches Pension Probe Deal With His Father&#8217;s Former Aide &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Cuomo, New York&#8217;s attorney general, reached an
agreement in his pension-fund probe with a one-time aide to his
father and the state&#8217;s former three-term governor, Mario M.
Cuomo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Albany, New York, attorney and lobbyist
Gerald A. &#8220;Jerry&#8221; Weiss was disclosed yesterday on the
attorney general&#8217;s official state website and in an e-mail.
Weiss, who had no securities license and wasn&#8217;t affiliated with
a broker-dealer, got $52,000 for introducing an investment firm
to the New York City Comptroller&#8217;s Office, according to the
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who was elected New York&#8217;s
governor last month, also announced yesterday that he had
recouped $1.5 million for the state and its Common Retirement
Fund from a Dallas investment firm and from a lobbying firm led
by a Weiss partner, Patricia Lynch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gifts, favors and campaign contributions are not a
legitimate basis for government contracts or special
treatment,&#8221; the attorney general said in a statement announcing
the accords with Patricia Lynch Associates Inc. and the Dallas
firm, Aldus Equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiss and Lynch are partners in another Albany lobbying
firm, LW Strategies LLC, according to an online New York City
directory of registered lobbyists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiss is also a partner in the Syracuse, New York-based law
firm Hiscock  Barclay LLP, which in July contributed $45,900 to
Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s gubernatorial campaign, according to New York
State Board of Elections on-line data. The firm donated $10,000
to the campaign in January 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Nugent, a partner in the Hiscock  Barclay firm who
is identified in the settlement papers as counsel for Weiss,
declined to comment on the agreement or discuss the
contributions made to the Cuomo campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to put this matter behind us,&#8221; Darren
Dopp, a Lynch firm partner and spokesman, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiss didn&#8217;t admit any wrongdoing in his agreement with
Cuomo. According to the agreement, he and his lobbying firm
divided $104,000 in fees received from an investment firm which
got pension business from the New York City Police and Fire
pension funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three decades after &#8220;Tron&#8221; turned
cyberspace into a fantasy world, Walt Disney Co. is pitching the
3-D sequel to grownups with high-end merchandise such as a
$2,600 Rotenier necklace and $795 spiked sandals from Rousseau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has rewritten its marketing playbook for &#8220;Tron:
Legacy,&#8221; which opens Dec. 17, to reach fans old enough to
remember the 1982 original. Jewelry and shoes in particular, the
priciest items, reflect an effort to attract women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The demographic we got to speak to for this film was a
young adult and the adult consumer who happened to be around&#8221;
for the original, said Pamela Lifford, a Disney executive vice
president who oversaw development of the &#8220;Tron&#8221; fashion goods.
&#8220;We knew we had to be creative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the haute-couture flourish, Disney&#8217;s marketing machine
is reaching beyond the core science-fiction and fantasy fans who
form the movie&#8217;s natural base. More than 6,000 people, mostly
younger men, crowded into the Comic-Con trade show at the San
Diego Convention Center in July for footage and talks by actor
Jeff Bridges and &#8220;Tron: Legacy&#8221; producer Sean Bailey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our thinking is to play a lot broader,&#8221; said Bailey,
Disney&#8217;s president of production since January. &#8220;We have the
digital whiz-bang wizardry that gets the men in. The No. 1 job
was to put a priority on story and emotion, boy meets girl.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. aims to attract more
users to its customer-relationship management software in 2011
than Salesforce.com Inc. and outpace its competitor in that
market for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re gunning for that,&#8221; Michael Park, vice president of
Microsoft Business Solutions, said today in an interview. The
Redmond, Washington-based software giant is introducing a new
version of the relationship-management software next month,
helping to spur growth. Last year, Salesforce gained about
50,000 more new users than Microsoft, Park estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to prize customers from Salesforce and
Oracle Corp. with updated software and a &#8220;Don&#8217;t Get Forced&#8221;
advertising campaign. Its earlier products weren&#8217;t capable
enough to warrant a big marketing push and were available only
in the U.S. and Canada, Park said. The new version will be
offered in 40 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We needed to be more aggressive now that we have a
product we can stand behind,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects to pick off Oracle customers who are
unhappy with the software the company acquired from Siebel
Systems Inc. or the Fusion products designed to replace them,
Park said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carol Sato, a spokeswoman for Redwood City, California-
based Oracle, and Jane Hynes, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-
based Salesforce, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a telephone call
and e-mail request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decade-Old Push &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 10 cents to $27.25 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined 11
percent this year. Salesforce fell $4.73, or 3.2 percent, to
$143.88 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock has gained 95 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign is part of a push Microsoft started a decade
ago to get more sales from customer, accounting and finance
programs. The company initially predicted it would earn $10
billion in revenue annually from these products by this year.
It&#8217;s generating &#8220;well north of a billion dollars in revenue&#8221; a
year, short of that mark, Park said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company doesn&#8217;t break out revenue for that business in
quarterly reports and Park declined to specify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest customers for finance and accounting software
already have programs installed and don&#8217;t replace them often, he
said. Instead, Microsoft is targeting smaller businesses or
divisions of the larger firms that want less expensive options
than Oracle or Germany-based SAP AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Dell Inc. uses Oracle for its main enterprise-
resource planning software, the company&#8217;s manufacturing and
assembly operations are installing Microsoft&#8217;s Dynamics ERP,
Park said. Dell expects to save $100 million as a result, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, will raise its quarterly dividend 2 cents to 20 cents
a share, after cutting the payout to help fund its $68 billion
Wyeth acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate fell short of the Bloomberg dividend forecast
of 21 cents. Pfizer, based in New York, also named George Lorch
board chairman, replacing Jeffrey Kindler, who resigned from his
positions as chairman and chief executive officer on Dec. 5,
according to a company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reduced its dividend in half to 16 cents in May 2009
to help pay for its Wyeth purchase. Pfizer raised its dividend
last December to 18 cents a share. The dividend may rise by

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. has joined a group
protesting Google Inc.&#8217;s $700 million acquisition of travel-
search company ITA Software Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said today it has become a member of
FairSearch.org, a coalition urging the U.S. Justice Department
to challenge Google&#8217;s purchase of the flight-search company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department in August extended its investigation
of whether the $700 million purchase, announced in July,
violates antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As an ITA Software customer, Microsoft&#8217;s ability to
continue providing innovative ways for consumers to find the
best flights at the lowest prices online rests on a competitive
market for travel technology,&#8221; said Jack Evans, a spokesman for
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software company is joining FairSearch.org to help
raise awareness of &#8220;how the proposed Google-ITA merger could
hurt travelers by slowing innovation and contributing to higher
travel costs,&#8221; Evans said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has pledged to honor all of ITA&#8217;s existing
agreements with travel websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s decision to oppose the ITA deal was no
surprise, said Adam Kovacevich, a Washington-based spokesman for
Google of Mountain View, California, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is our largest competitor and lobbies
regulators against every acquisition we make,&#8221; Kovacevich said
in an e-mailed statement. The ITA acquisition will &#8220;provide
consumers with better flight search tools and more choices and
drive more traffic to travel websites,&#8221; Kovacevich said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Dominate, Manipulate&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisition of ITA by Google would give the owner of the
world&#8217;s more popular Internet search engine control over
software used by most of its rivals and may allow Google &#8220;to
dominate and manipulate&#8221; the market for online air travel,
FairSearch.org said today in an e-mailed statement on Microsoft
joining its efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other new members of FairSearch.org are Foundem, a U.K.-
based comparison-shopping service, Level...com, a French on-line
travel agency association based in Paris, and ZUJI, a Singapore-
based online travel service agency, according to the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FairSearch.org, founded in October, already counts Expedia
Inc., Kayak.com and Travelocity owner Sabre Holdings Corp. as
members. Travelocity owns ZUJI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Google allies supporting the acquistion are Orbitz
Worldwide Inc. and Priceline.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, independent software developers told the
House Judiciary Committee that they feared not getting fair
access to ITA&#8217;s flight-information software if Google buys the
company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, sold $1
billion of 18-month floating-rate notes in its first offering of
the securities in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes yield 3 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, a lending benchmark for banks
that&#8217;s currently set at 0.302 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. IBM last sold floating-rate debt in
November 2009, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, tapped credit markets after
raising $1 billion through a sale of five-year notes a week ago.
Floating-rate debt tends to lose value when interest rates
decline because it pays less, while fixed-rate bonds become
relatively more attractive. Sales of floaters, which have
tumbled from the year&#8217;s $16.8 billion record in January, may
increase as interest rates climb, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s certainly demand for them out there,&#8221; LeBas
said. &#8220;The downside is in the current environment with Libor
trending at 30 basis points, the current coupon of floating-rate
notes is pretty low, so they&#8217;re narrowly a defensive play for
investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as floating-rate note issuance is dominated by banks,
borrowers from consumer-products company Procter  Gamble Co. to
Caterpillar Inc. have sold the securities in the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest Rates Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s notes rank as senior unsecured obligations, the data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only reason that floating-rate notes would pay off
more than a fixed-rate one is if short-term interest rates do
rise quickly,&#8221; said LeBas, who doesn&#8217;t anticipate that
increase. &#8220;For investors that are concerned about a rise in
rates, purchasing floaters is one way to reduce that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury have climbed for
the past two weeks to 3.32 percent as of Dec. 10, while those on
30-year Treasuries increased to 4.43 percent as of that date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions by
2015 as it aims to almost double operating earnings per share.
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing in analytics
software and services that help predict trends, as well as cloud
computing, which helps customers save money by letting them
store and access data via the Internet rather than from their
own servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has announced 15 acquisitions this year,
ended the third quarter with more than $11 billion in cash and
short-term investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital and UBS AG managed the offering, according
to a regulatory filing from IBM today. Proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes, the company said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s benchmark ASE Index dropped
6.93, or 0.5 percent, to 1,499.39 at the 5:20 p.m. close in
Athens, a second day of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTSE/ASE 20 Index of the country&#8217;s biggest companies
declined 0.8 percent to 713.63 today. The Cypriot General Index
retreated 0.9 percent to 1,143.08. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following shares were among the most active in Athens
trading today. Symbols are in parentheses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athens Water Supply  Sewage Co. SA (EYDAP GA) rose 2.4
percent to 4.74 euros, gaining for a second day. Greece&#8217;s
biggest water company was rated &#8220;buy&#8221; in new coverage at
Eurobank Securities which said more municipalities in its supply
network and tariff increase give the company &#8220;hidden value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Bank SA (ALPHA GA) dropped 2.2 percent to 4.42 euros,
falling for a second day. Virtually all major banking systems
reduced their exchange-rate adjusted holdings in Greece during
the second quarter, the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for
International settlements said in its latest quarterly report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB GA), Greece&#8217;s second-
biggest lender, declined 4.7 percent to 4.22 euros, the biggest
drop in six weeks. National Bank of Greece SA (ETE GA), the

euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA (EEEK GA) added 1.5
percent to 19.80 euros. The world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of
Coke beverages had its share-price estimate raised to 20.5 euros
from 19 euros by analysts at Piraeus Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Power Corp. SA (PPC GA) gained 1.5 percent to 11.44

&lt;p&gt;Precious metals will probably give
investors the best returns among commodities in the next year,
and livestock the worst, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precious metals will advance 28 percent over 12 months and
livestock 4 percent, London-based Jeffrey Currie, Allison Nathan
and other Goldman analysts said in a report today. The team
raised its 12-month forecast for the SP GSCI Enhanced Total
Return Index to 18 percent from 16 percent, mostly because of
changes to agricultural estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Extreme weakness in U.S. demand over the past two years
has allowed China to grow unconstrained without any competition
for raw materials,&#8221; the Goldman analysts said in the report.
&#8220;This is likely to change in 2011 with a stronger U.S. that is
likely to bump up against a China that is consuming dramatically
more commodities than pre-crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity assets under management rose $19 billion to a
record $340 billion in October, led by demand for index-linked
investments, Barclays Capital said in a report last month. Gold
rose 27 percent this year, heading for a 10th consecutive annual
advance. Investors are seeking hard assets as governments and
central banks led by the Federal Reserve pump more than $2
trillion into the world financial system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qatar, the world&#8217;s largest exporter
of liquefied natural gas, is seeking partners to build two
petrochemical plants as companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. and
ConocoPhillips seek investment opportunities there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Persian Gulf emirate is in talks with Exxon, Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. as possible
partners in construction of two facilities, Mohammed Yousef al-
Mulla, head of Qatar Petrochemical Co., said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar is using its gas reserves, the world&#8217;s third largest,
to run petrochemical, aluminum and fertilizer factories as it
diversifies its economy away from exporting LNG and crude oil.
The Persian Gulf emirate, which today celebrated raising LNG
capacity to 77 million metric tons a year, aims to increase
annual production of petrochemicals to 28 million tons by 2014,
al-Attiyah said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is pursuing an agreement signed with Qatar to build a
petrochemical plant in the country, Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said at the celebration ceremony today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve completed all the work. We&#8217;ve concluded commercial
agreements,&#8221; Tillerson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re waiting for the Qataris to
make a decision about what they want to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qapco, as the state petrochemicals company is known, is a
subsidiary of Industries Qatar. Chevron Phillips is a joint
venture between Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Top of the List&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conoco sees Qatar as being &#8220;at the top of the list of
countries&#8221; where the company is likely to invest, Chief
Executive Officer James Mulva said, according to a statement
distributed ahead of the ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company &#8220;continues to look for opportunities&#8221; to
cooperate with Qatar in areas such as petrochemicals, oil and
gas infrastructure, Mulva said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Houston-based company this year pulled out of two
projects in the region, one in Saudi Arabia and the other in Abu
Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and in 2007 withdrew from a
U.A.E. refinery project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA has designs ready for a new petrochemical complex
in Qatar if a $6 billion project announced by Exxon Mobil Corp.
early this year is canceled, two people with knowledge of the
matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-controlled Qatar Petroleum signed an agreement with
Exxon in January to build a petrochemical complex that would be
the emirate&#8217;s biggest single energy-related project since
Shell&#8217;s Pearl gas-to-liquids plant was announced in 2006. Qatar
may choose a different partner, a Qatar Petroleum official said
in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Shell, Conoco and Total are all partners with Qatar
in its export-oriented LNG facilities. LNG can be transported by
ship to markets not accessible by pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov was found guilty of two
counts of stealing the firm&#8217;s trade secrets by appropriating
part of a high-frequency computer source code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov went on trial Nov. 29 in federal court in New
York on charges of violating the Economic Espionage Act and the
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. He faces as
long as 10 years in prison on the espionage charge and five
years for the interstate transportation charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court judge Denise Cote set sentencing of
Aleynikov for March 18. He and his lawyer both declined comment.
He will be under home confinement and electronic monitoring,
Judge Cote ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, holds dual
U.S.-Russian citizenship, his lawyer Kevin Marino said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would like the parties to explain whether or not there
are travel restrictions that can be enforced through a watch
list,&#8221; Cote told prosecutors and Marino. &#8220;I would like the
government to confirm for me by 5 o&#8217;clock today whether Mr.
Aleynikov&#8217;s name can be added to watch lists so he can&#8217;t board a
plane.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote directed that Aleynikov limit his travel to the
Southern and Eastern Districts of New York. Jurors left the
courthouse after the verdict and all declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote also ordered that Aleynikov surrender all travel
documents and directed that three financially responsible people
come back and sign his bond. He left court accompanied by family
members and declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rebecca Rohr, in her
closing statement on Dec. 9, told jurors that Aleynikov was a
&#8220;thief.&#8221; On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman
Sachs in June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of
lines of source code from the firm&#8217;s trading system, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He circumvented Goldman Sachs&#8217;s security system, sent the
code to an outside server in Germany, and later compressed and
encrypted the code, Rohr said. Aleynikov took the code with him
to a meeting with his new employers in Chicago in July 2009, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking Goldman&#8217;s software, Aleynikov executed a
program to cover his tracks, prosecutors said. If he thought the
codes were open source and should be publicly available, &#8220;why
did he then encrypt it?,&#8221; Rohr asked jurors. &#8220;So that no one,
like him, could access the code,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Aleynikov may have broken a confidentiality rule of
Goldman Sachs, he didn&#8217;t commit a crime, said his attorney,
Kevin Marino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He violated the policy, OK, but that&#8217;s not a crime,&#8221;
Marino told jurors. &#8220;A crime is when you act to harm the victim
and benefit yourself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov had access to all of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s high-
frequency trading software and could have easily taken a flash
memory drive and copied the entire trading platform, yet he
didn&#8217;t, Marino said. Aleynikov took open-source code he had
written at Goldman Sachs and nothing that was proprietary, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino called the government&#8217;s case &#8220;a silly prosecution&#8221;
as he waved a notebook at prosecutors at the conclusion of his
closing arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who started at Goldman Sachs in May 2007, left
his $400,000-a-year job to work for Chicago-based Teza
Technologies LLC, which promised him $1.2 million including
salary, bonus and profit-sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that, on
the night of June 4, 2009, before his last day at Goldman Sachs,
Aleynikov transferred hundreds of thousands of lines of computer
source code related to the firm&#8217;s high-frequency trading
business. At about 5:20 p.m. the next day, Aleynikov sent parts
of the trading code to a code-storage website in Europe that
wasn&#8217;t blocked by the firm, witnesses said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino, saying Goldman Sachs &#8220;wasn&#8217;t the New York Yankees
of high-frequency trading,&#8221; told jurors that prosecutors
exaggerated the value of the firm&#8217;s high-frequency trading
platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sergey knew what Goldman Sachs owned and that lots of it
was open source code,&#8221; Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it&#8217;s open source code, it&#8217;s not Goldman&#8217;s just because
it happened at Goldman,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gufic Wins Indian Trademark Challenge Filed by Estee Lauder &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gufic Biosciences Ltd., a Mumbai-based pharmaceutical and
personal-hygiene products company, bested Estee Lauder&#8217;s
Clinique unit in a trademark battle in India, the Business
Standard reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008 Estee Lauder had asked the Delhi High Court to bar
Gifuc from selling its Skinclinique Stretch Nil, claiming it
infringed the marks for its &#8220;Clinique&#8221; brand, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several rulings by the Delhi High Court, India&#8217;s
Supreme Court found that the Gufic product, which is used to
treat stretch marks associated with pregnancy, was substantially
different from the Estee Lauder product, according to the
Standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gufic product has been sold since 1997 and there is &#8220;
a huge price difference between it and the Clinique products,
the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolex Sues Maker of Vans for Handicapped for Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolex Group&#8217;s Rolex Watch USA unit sued a Minnesota company
that customizes vans for wheelchair use for trademark
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Dec. 2 in federal court in
Minnesota, Associated Partnership Ltd. of Savage, Minnesota, is
accused of infringing the marks. Associated does business as
Rollx Vans and through its www.rollxvans.com website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Switzerland-based watch company claims the Rollx mark
is a &#8220;confusingly similar, sound-alike mark&#8221; that is likely to
bring to mind the Rolex mark, create consumer confusion and a
false association between the Swiss company and the van company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Rollx website, the company has been in
business for almost 40 years. The family-owned company converts
new and used imported and domestic vans for wheelchair users,
according to a video posted on Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube video-
sharing site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolex claims the van company&#8217;s mark blurs the
distinctiveness of the watch company&#8217;s trademarks. It objects to
the van company&#8217;s attempts to register Rollx as a trademark, and
claims it&#8217;s suffered &#8220;irreparable harm and damages&#8221; as a
result of Rollx&#8217;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watch company asked the court to bar the van company&#8217;s
use of Rollx as a mark, and for awards of money damages,
attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rollx didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolex is represented by Ruth Rivard and Kevin D. Conneely
of Leonard, Street  Deinard of Minneapolis, and Brian W.
Brokate, Beth M. Frenchman and Jeff Dupler of New York&#8217;s Gibney,
Anthony  Flaherty LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rolex Watch U.S.A. Inc. v. Associated
Partnership Ltd.,0:10-cv-04787-ADM-JJK, U.S. District Court,
District of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shearson, Meister Brau, Handi-Wrap Marks Bought at Auction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an auction organized by New York-based Racebook Capital
Advisors LLC, some famous trademarks changed hands for prices
from $2,000 to $4,500, Advertising Age reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the trademarks that changed hands in the Dec. 8
auction in Manhattan are Shearson, which went for $45,000;
Meister Brau, for $32,500, and Handi-Wrap, for which a purchaser
paid $30,000, according to Advertising Age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John J. Cuticelli Jr., Racebook&#8217;s chief executive officer,
told Advertising Age each trademark was sold free and clear and
&#8220;all the buyers have to do is back it with a product.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the brands that found no takers were Kitten Soft,
Kool Shake, Nudit, Hot Pants, Relaxacizor and Pharmhouse,
Advertising Age reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amarillo Told It Can&#8217;t Use &#8216;Gold Sox&#8217; for Baseball Team Name &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plan to revive the Gold Sox name for an Amarillo, Texas-
based minor league baseball team has run into opposition, the
Amarillo Globe-News reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gold Sox name was registered as a trademark by a
Marysville, California-based collegiate summer-league team that
objected to its use by the Texas team, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of the California team told the newspaper
they&#8217;ve not interested in money, so won&#8217;t license the name to
the Texas team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UT Says Car Wash Structure Infringes School Tower Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator of a car wash in Austin, Texas, has run afoul
of the University of Texas, the Statesman newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school objects to the structure atop the building
that&#8217;s a copy of the University of Texas tower, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Westemeier, the university&#8217;s assistant athletic
director for trademark licensing told the newspaper the school
is working with the carwash owner to make some design changes so
the structure won&#8217;t look so much like the campus tower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the car has said all his promotional
literature contains the disclaimer that the business isn&#8217;t
affiliated with the school, according to the Statesman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil Spector Sued for Royalties by Darlene Love, Ronettes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop singer Darlene Love and the vocal group the Ronettes
have again sued producer Phil Spector, who&#8217;s in prison in
California for murder, for unpaid royalties on songs recorded in
the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, who include Spector&#8217;s former wife Ronnie
Greenfield, charge that Spector has violated a 2009 court-
ordered settlement agreement that required him to pay royalties
twice a year, according to a complaint filed Dec. 9 in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants have generated millions of dollars through the
sale of plaintiffs&#8217; musical recordings, yet have paid only a
fraction of royalties,&#8221; lawyers for the singers said in the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spector is serving a 19-year sentence on a second-degree
murder conviction in the California Substance Abuse Treatment
Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love sang with the groups the Blossoms, the Crystals and
Bob B. Soxx and the Blue Jeans. The Crystals&#8217; hits included &#8220;Da
Doo Ron Ron.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other plaintiffs include members of the Ronettes; the
estate of Estelle Bennett, Ronnie&#8217;s sister; and their cousin
Nedra Talley Ross. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ronettes signed with Spector&#8217;s Phillies Records, also a
defendant, in 1963 and recorded hits including &#8220;Be My Baby.&#8221; 
The case is Darlene Love v. Phil Spector, 652227-2010, Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York. An earlier
case was Ronnie Greenfield v. Phillies Records, 000763-1988,

&lt;p&gt;Eastman Kodak Sues Shutterfly Over Photo Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastman Kodak Co. accused Shutterfly Inc., the Internet-
based photo storage and printing company, of infringing five
patents for image processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodak is seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages in
the lawsuit, filed Dec. 10 in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shutterfly has misappropriated Kodak&#8217;s technology by
&#8220;offering to sell image products&#8221; including prints and photo
books &#8220;through its website, shutterfly.com,&#8221; lawyers for
Rochester, New York-based Kodak contend in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodak, which was founded in 1880 and popularized film
photography, is trying to make the transition to digital imaging
in part by using its patents to combat competition -- including
camera phones. It claims that Shutterfly infringed five patents,
issued between 2000 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gretchen Sloan, a Shutterfly spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Eastman Kodak v. Shutterfly, 10CV-1079, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s investment firm filed more than $50 billion in so-
called clawback suits to compensate victims of the con man&#8217;s
fraud since his arrest two years ago for masterminding the
biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard, the trustee, filed hundreds of suits against
banks, feeder funds, investors and others alleged to have
profited from Madoff&#8217;s decades-long fraud. Among those sued was
Madoff&#8217;s son Mark, who was found dead Dec. 11 in Manhattan of an
apparent suicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for Picard to file claims expired at midnight
Dec. 11. So far, he has recovered about $2.5 billion. Last week,
he sued Bank Medici AG and its founder, Sonja Kohn, as well as
Bank Austria, UniCredit SpA and dozens of other parties. He is
seeking $19.6 billion from them, which could potentially triple
to $58.8 billion under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act. It&#8217;s the biggest claim filed by Picard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohn, 62, whom Picard called Madoff&#8217;s &#8220;criminal soul
mate,&#8221; used a relationship with the financier that began in
1985 to help build the Vienna-based bank, feeding more than $9.1
billion of investor money into his company, Picard said in a
complaint last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreas Theiss, a lawyer for Kohn and Medici in Vienna,
said in an interview that, &#8220;Kohn and Medici are victims of
Madoff. What is being claimed in the lawsuit has nothing to do
with reality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit said in an e-mailed statement on behalf of
itself, Bank Austria and its fund management unit Pioneer Global
Asset Management SpA, which is also a defendant, that they will
fight the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their &#8220;attorneys are reviewing the matter and we will
manage this through the normal course legal process,&#8221; the bank
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, who pleaded guilty, is serving a 150-year
sentence in federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Kohn, 10-5411, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Programmer Found Guilty of Stealing Secrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov was found guilty of two counts of stealing the firm&#8217;s
trade secrets by appropriating part of a high-frequency computer
source code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov went on trial Nov. 29 in federal court in New
York on charges of violating the Economic Espionage Act and the
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. He faces as
long as 10 years in prison on the espionage charge and five
years for the interstate transportation charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote set sentencing of Aleynikov
for March 18. He and his lawyer both declined comment. He will
be under home confinement and electronic monitoring, Cote ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rebecca Rohr, in her
closing statement on Dec. 9, told jurors that Aleynikov was a
&#8220;thief.&#8221; On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman
Sachs in June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of
lines of source code from the firm&#8217;s trading system, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He circumvented Goldman Sachs&#8217;s security system, sent the
code to an outside server in Germany, and later compressed and
encrypted the code, Rohr said. Aleynikov took the code with him
to a meeting with his new employers in Chicago in July 2009, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Aleynikov may have broken a confidentiality rule of
Goldman Sachs, he didn&#8217;t commit a crime, said his attorney,
Kevin Marino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He violated the policy, OK, but that&#8217;s not a crime,&#8221;
Marino told jurors. &#8220;A crime is when you act to harm the victim
and benefit yourself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Ratings Are Protected Speech, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratings by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc., Standard 
Poor&#8217;s and Fitch Ratings Ltd. are protected speech, a California
judge said Dec. 10 in a tentative ruling in a $1 billion lawsuit
by California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System against the
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Richard Kramer in San Francisco state court said the
companies&#8217; ratings of three structured investment vehicles that
the retirement system lost money on are a form of speech about
an issue of public interest that is protected under a California
law designed to fend off lawsuits meant to chill public debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Calpers v. Moody&#8217;s, 09-490241, Superior Court
of California, County of San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi to Pay $87.8 Million to Settle GVT Fraud Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi SA agreed to pay a record 150 million reais ($87.8
million) to settle allegations by Brazil&#8217;s securities regulator
that it fraudulently misled investors in its 7.2 billion reais
purchase of telephone carrier GVT Holding SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris-based Vivendi was accused of providing incomplete
information that led investors to believe it had enough GVT
shares to fend off rival bids for the company, according to e-
mailed statement announcing the accord by Brazilian securities
regulator CVM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi, the owner of the world&#8217;s largest music and video-
game companies, outbid Telefonica SA late last year for control
of GVT, raising its initial bid to top the Spanish rival.
Vivendi, which operates France&#8217;s second-largest mobile-phone
company SFR together with Vodafone Group Plc, has said it will
use GVT to expand into pay television in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French company said in an e-mailed statement Dec. 10
that the payment didn&#8217;t imply the acknowledgment of wrongdoing.
The payment concludes the investigation, Vivendi said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Morgan Crucible Chief Gets 18 Months in Prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Norris, the former chief executive officer of Morgan
Crucible Co., was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role
in a scheme to fix prices for carbon and graphite products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno in Philadelphia also
ordered Norris, 67, to pay a $25,000 fine and serve three years&#8217;
probation after his prison term. A federal jury convicted Norris
in July of conspiring to obstruct justice. The same jury
acquitted him of trying to influence others&#8217; grand jury
testimony and of intent to induce the destruction of records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obstruction of justice is an extremely serious crime,&#8221;
Robreno said before imposing the sentence. &#8220;It strikes at the
heart of the rule of law and it makes other crimes possible. Mr.
Norris has not yet come completely to the realization of his
factual guilt, as far as I can tell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norris was extradited from the U.K. this year, the first
foreign defendant sent to the U.S. to face charges arising from
a criminal antitrust investigation, Justice Department officials
said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Curran, a defense attorney for Norris, said
Dec. 10 that his client will appeal the conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Norris, 03-cr-632, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leahy, Pillet Charged in EADS Insider-Trading Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbus SAS Chief Operating Officer John Leahy and Erik
Pillet, the former human resources director at the European
Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. unit, were charged by a Paris
investigating judge with insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leahy was placed under investigation Nov. 5, and Pillet
Oct. 1 after they were called in for questioning, said a
spokeswoman for the prosecutor&#8217;s office who declined to be named
citing office policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal investigators are looking into allegations that as
many as 17 current and former EADS officials engaged in insider
trading ahead of the announcement about production problems that
would delay the A380, the world&#8217;s biggest passenger plane. The
report precipitated a 26 percent drop in the share price on June
14, 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s market regulator cleared the officials and the
company of any wrongdoing in December 2009 in a parallel probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leahy&#8217;s lawyer Patrick Bernard and EADS spokesman Pierre
Bayle declined to comment. Calls for comment to the men&#8217;s
offices weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four former executives including former EADS co-chief
executive officer Noel Forgeard and one current official have
also been preliminarily charged in the probe. The investigation
began after EADS investors filed a criminal complaint following
the 2006 share price slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, Kingate Global Fund Sued in London Over Madoff Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc and Kingate Management Ltd. were sued in
London by Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s investment firm in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits, filed Dec. 10 at the High Court, follow cases
filed by Picard against HSBC and Kingate in New York bankruptcy
court. Picard sued HSBC last week for $9 billion over claims it
aided Madoff&#8217;s fraud through a network of feeder funds in
Europe, the Caribbean and Central America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee sued two Kingate &#8220;feeder funds&#8221; in April,
arguing that he can retrieve $255 million in fake profit the
funds withdrew from Madoff&#8217;s business within 90 days before his
arrest in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, facing a deadline to file claims to retrieve money
for victims of Madoff&#8217;s fraud, is filing lawsuits in London for
the first time. Picard and the liquidators of Bernard Madoff
Securities International Ltd., the U.K. arm of the convicted con
man&#8217;s investment firm, sued the unit&#8217;s former directors, seeking
at least $80 million, on Dec. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard won a court order in London in May forcing
investment firm FIM Advisers LLP to hand over additional
documents about whether it knew about Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. FIM
managed the Kingate Global and Kingate Euro hedge funds, now in
liquidation in Bermuda, which funneled more than $1.7 billion to
Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty in March 2009 to using money
from new investors to pay off old ones in a Ponzi scheme,
sparking investigations and dozens of lawsuits. U.K. prosecutors
dropped a criminal probe into Madoff&#8217;s London unit in February
after they found &#8220;insufficient evidence&#8221; to charge anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Russell, a spokesman for HSBC, declined to
immediately comment. Federico Ceretti and Carlo Grosso, who head
FIM Advisers, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a call seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin McCue, a spokesman for Picard, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Irving H. Picard (as Trustee for the
Liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC) v.
Kingate Management Ltd.  11 ors, case no. 10-1478, and Irving
H. Picard v. HSBC Plc, case no. 10-1479, High Court of Justice,
Queen&#8217;s Bench Division (London.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel, SocGen Sued by Employees for Stress, Lost Savings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerome Kerviel and Societe Generale SA were sued by four
bank employees who said they suffered emotionally and
financially after his unauthorized trading cost the bank 4.9
billion euros ($6.5 billion) in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women are seeking 15,000 euros each in &#8220;moral
damages&#8221; and as much as 3,973 euros in financial damages for
the hit their savings took when the bank&#8217;s shares fell,
according to the lawsuit filed Dec. 10 in Nanterre, near Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women &#8220;had sizable losses wiped from their savings,&#8221;
according to an e-mailed copy of the lawsuit. The financial
losses &#8220;aggravated the moral prejudice they suffered, adding to
their state of anxiety and resentment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employees sued two months after the former trader was
sentenced to three years in jail and ordered to repay the loss,
for which the court said he alone was responsible. Kerviel, who
is free pending his appeal, said throughout the trial that the
bank knew of his trading and condoned it. The lawsuit quotes
extensively from a report by the French Banking Commission,
which fined Societe Generale 4 million euros for lax controls
related to Kerviel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale had no comment on the lawsuit, said Laura
Schalk, a spokeswoman for the bank. Calls to lawyers for Kerviel
and the bank for comment weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Vitesse Chief Tomasetta Charged in Backdating &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. Chief Executive Officer
Louis Tomasetta and ex-Executive Vice President Eugene Hovanec
were charged by the U.S. with securities fraud stemming from an
options-backdating scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomasetta, 62, of Ojai, California, and Hovanec, 60, of
Westlake Village, California, were named in an indictment
unsealed Dec. 10 in U.S. District Court in New York that also
charged them with conspiracy, making false entries with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in a scheme which prosecutors
said ran between 2001 and mid-2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara, whose office is prosecuting the case, allege that
Tomasetta, who co-founded the company, and Hovanec &#8220;engaged in
an illegal scheme to deceive Vitesse&#8217;s auditors, investors and
others&#8221; concerning the company&#8217;s true financial condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the company wasn&#8217;t going to meet its own goals
for revenue or earnings, Tomasetta, Hovanec and others &#8220;devised
a scheme to falsely inflate Vitesse&#8217;s revenues,&#8221; prosecutors
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men also backdated numerous stock options granted
to Vitesse employees from 2001 to 2004 by backdating the
options, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both defendants pleaded not guilty Dec. 10 before U.S.
Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger in New York and were released
on $1 million bond, said Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
Bharara&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Tomasetta, 10-CR-1205, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMAC Allowed to Proceed With Maine Foreclosure Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMAC Mortgage LLC can sell foreclosed homes in Maine after
defeating a bid by homeowners in the state who sought a federal
court order blocking sales and evictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby, at a hearing Dec. 10
in Portland, Maine, declined to grant a temporary restraining
order that a plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer said would have kept GMAC from
selling foreclosed homes and evicting residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said his decision hinged on the power of federal
courts to stop proceedings in state courts, where foreclosures
take place. He said individual homeowners who face losing their
homes in a foreclosure sale can go to state court to stop the
sales, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decision is based on the limited authority federal
courts have,&#8221; Hornby said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maine case, filed in state court in October and moved
to federal court by GMAC in November, involves five homeowners
who are suing GMAC, claiming the company relied on defective
court documents in seizing homes. The plaintiffs are seeking to
represent all Maine homeowners who are facing foreclosure by
GMAC or who lost their homes in a GMAC foreclosure during the
past six years, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maine Attorney General Janet Mills is considering joining
the GMAC lawsuit, Assistant Attorney General Linda Conti said in
an interview Dec. 10. The office is also considering filing its
own lawsuit against GMAC, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMAC had agreed to suspend foreclosure sales and evictions
in the state until the judge ruled on the restraining order,
Andrea Bopp Stark, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said. That
agreement expired Dec. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bradbury v. GMAC Mortgage LLC, 10-00458, U.S.
District Court, District of Maine (Portland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Network Associates Finance Chief Wins Reversal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prabhat Goyal, the former Network Associates Inc. chief
financial officer convicted in 2007 of securities fraud and of
making false statements to auditors, won reversal on all 15
counts on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco agreed Dec. 10
with Goyal&#8217;s argument that, based on the evidence presented by
prosecutors at his trial, no jury should have convicted him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to
the prosecution, no reasonable juror could have found Goyal
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on any of the charges against
him,&#8221; the three-member panel said in its ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal grand jury indicted Goyal in 2004 for conspiring
to secretly pay distributors to buy more inventory than they
could sell during a given quarter and to hold onto the excess
instead of returning it to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fraud caused Network Associates to overstate revenue by
more than $470 million and understate losses by about $330
million from 1998 to 2000, according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re extremely gratified by the court of appeals&#8217;
careful and unassailable opinion,&#8221; said attorney Seth Waxman,
who argued the case on appeal for Goyal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goyal, in October 2008, was sentenced to serve one year and
one day in prison for each count, with the terms to run
concurrently, according to the trial court&#8217;s electronic docket.
Waxman said his client never served that time and was free on
bail pending the outcome of the appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in the process of reviewing the decision,&#8221; said
Jack Gillund, a spokesman for the office of U.S. Attorney
Melinda Haag in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goyal, 08-10436, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). The lower court case is
U.S. v. Goyal, 04-cr-00201, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countrywide Foreclosure Suit Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bankruptcy lawsuit against New Jersey home owner John T.
Kemp, whose mortgage company, a judge ruled, had failed to
deliver the note to the trustee, was the most-read litigation
docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rejection of the claim came after Linda DeMartini, a
mortgage-litigation management division team leader at Bank of
America Corp., which acquired Kemp&#8217;s company, Countrywide
Financial Corp. in 2008,  said during a bankruptcy hearing in
Camden last year that it was routine for the lender to keep
mortgage promissory notes even after loans were bundled by the
thousands into bonds and sold to investors. Contracts for such
securitizations usually require the documents to be transferred
to the trustee for mortgage bondholders. That could leave the
trustee with no standing to take the property, and raises the
question of whether other foreclosures could similarly be
blocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank disavowed the statements by DeMartini, whom it had
flown in from California to testify. It was the policy of
Countrywide, to deliver notes as called for in its
securitization contracts, according to Larry Platt, an attorney
at KL Gates LLP in Washington designated by the Bank of America
to answer questions about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of John T. Kemp, Kemp v.
Countrywide Home Loans Inc., 08-02448, U.S. bankruptcy Court for
the District of New Jersey (Camden). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam Insider Trading Trial to Start Feb. 28 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group LLC founder Raj Rajaratnam is scheduled to go
on trial Feb. 28 on charges he used tips from company
executives, hedge-fund employees and others in a multimillion-
dollar insider-trading scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard J. Holwell, in an order filed
Dec. 10 in federal court in Manhattan, said the charges against
Rajaratnam will be tried separately from those against his co-
defendant Danielle Chiesi. The trial of Chiesi, a former hedge
fund consultant, is scheduled to start April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, was arrested last year and is the central
figure in a probe of insider trading at hedge funds that has led
to 14 guilty pleas. He and Chiesi, a former consultant at New
Castle Funds LLC, deny wrongdoing. Theirs is the largest
insider-trading case involving hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam and Chiesi last month lost a bid to block the
first-ever use of wiretap evidence in an insider-trading case.
Evidence at an October hearing showed that the government
secretly recorded about 2,400 conversations between Rajaratnam
and more than 130 friends, business associates and alleged
accomplices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s home prices may be
entering a &#8220;bubble&#8221; amid a battle between surging liquidity
and government efforts to cool the property market, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residential real estate values-to-gross domestic product
has exceeded the island&#8217;s peak of 3.13 times in 1997 and may
&#8220;overshoot&#8221; to 3.5 times next year based on the brokerage&#8217;s
forecast of a 15 percent increase in home prices in 2011,
analysts led by Lucia Kwong said in a report dated Dec. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This shows that economic growth cannot catch up with
asset price growth or liquidity is likely to channel mostly into
properties and little to other segments,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;The
battle between policies and liquidity will continue in the next
nine to 12 months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong last month intensified a yearlong battle to curb
surging home prices with additional taxes and policies a day
after the International Monetary Fund warned that asset
inflation may derail the city&#8217;s economy. Homes sold within six
months of purchase will now incur a 15 percent stamp duty, and
down payments will increase for most mortgages, with those for
homes costing at least HK$12 million ($1.5 million) rising to 50
percent from 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government acted after home prices climbed more than 50
percent since the beginning of 2009 and surpassed a 1997 peak
with record-low mortgage rates and an influx of Chinese buyers.
The island&#8217;s currency peg to the dollar prevents its de-facto
central bank from raising interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Sales Rises &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home transactions picked up after a decline following last
month&#8217;s government curbs, according to Centaline Property Agency
Ltd., the city&#8217;s biggest privately held real-estate brokerage.
The company handled 53 home sales over the weekend, a 61 percent
increase from the previous week, it said in a press release
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures show the government&#8217;s determination to stem
rising prices, the JPMorgan analysts said. &#8220;Cash-rich
investors&#8221; who don&#8217;t rely on mortgage financing and plan to
hold their properties for more than two years shouldn&#8217;t be
affected, they said. Funds from the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s plan
to boost purchases of bonds may increase capital inflows and
raise Hong Kong asset prices in the next six to nine months,
they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property Index Rebounds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Property Index rose 1.3 percent at the 4 p.m.
close in Hong Kong, the most since Nov. 29. Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd., Hong Kong&#8217;s biggest listed developer, climbed
1.5 percent, and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., controlled by Li
Ka-shing, the city&#8217;s richest man, added 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property measure has fallen 3 percent since the
government&#8217;s curbs on Nov. 19, more than double the 1.2 percent
drop in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan prefers office and shopping mall landlords to
developers as retail sales during the year-end holiday season
are expected to be good, helping to drive rents higher. Hongkong
Land Holdings Ltd., Hysan Development Co. and Wharf Holdings Ltd.
are their top picks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade A or prime office rents in the city&#8217;s Central
business district will rise about 24 percent in 2011 because of
increased demand and limited new supply, CB Richard Ellis Inc.
said last week. Overall residential values are expected to climb
5 percent to 10 percent, CB Richard Ellis said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. will pit one of its computers against past champions of
the &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; quiz show, more than a decade after another
IBM machine defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Watson,&#8221; as the computer is called after IBM founder
Thomas J. Watson, will square off against Ken Jennings and Brad
Rutter in a contest scheduled to air Feb. 14, said IBM
researcher Dave Ferrucci in an interview. Jennings has the
longest win streak in the show&#8217;s history and Rutter won more
money than any other player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a close game,&#8221; said Ferrucci, an
artificial intelligence expert who has headed the Watson
project. &#8220;These guys are really good. I&#8217;m going to have to
breathe deeply and count to 10 a lot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-contestant competition, the show&#8217;s usual number,
will last three days and the winner will receive $1 million. The
shows will be broadcast from IBM&#8217;s lab in Yorktown Heights, New
York and air during the regular &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; time slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project builds on IBM&#8217;s work in the field of artificial
intelligence, including the Deep Blue supercomputer that
defeated world champion Kasparov in a 1997 match. About four
years ago, executives at IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-
services provider, decided to try another challenge that would
generate public interest -- and this time with potential
commercial appeal, said Ferrucci. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main task: make computers understand questions in
natural language, as opposed to the keyword searches common on
Google Inc.&#8217;s website or Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Bing. While computers
can easily search databases, they have problems understanding
context, innuendo and other subtleties common in most
information, Ferrucci said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Watson Works &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Holy Grail here is to create a technology that can
understand what you&#8217;re asking, the way you&#8217;re asking it,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;People want to do more with all the content we have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; competition, Watson will receive each
question through a typed entry at the same time host Alex Trebek
reads the queries to Jennings and Rutter. The computer will scan
a custom-made database for answers and then calculate its degree
of confidence in an answer. If the confidence level exceeds a
certain threshold, it will buzz and speak the answer out loud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Watson&#8217;s a big step toward artificial intelligence that
directly affects people&#8217;s lives,&#8221; Paul Saffo, managing director
at investment adviser Discern Analytics in San Francisco, said
in an interview. &#8220;It will have the intended effect -- this is
going to absolutely capture people&#8217;s attention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington" date="Dec 14, 2010  5:38 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-14/new-york-fed-s-theo-lubke-joins-goldman-as-chief-regulatory-reform-officer.html"><headline>New York Fed Swaps Reformer Lubke Joins Goldman Sachs</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Theo Lubke, who served for 15 years
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and headed its efforts
to reform the private derivatives market, joined Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubke, 44, started this month as chief regulatory reform
officer in Goldman Sachs&#8217; securities division, the memo said.
The newly-created role will allow Lubke to &#8220;work closely with
divisional and firm-wide leadership to implement regulatory
reform legislation,&#8221; according to the memo. Michael DuVally, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, confirmed the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
is hiring Lubke five months after Congress mandated the
regulation of the $583 trillion over-the-counter derivatives
market after swaps complicated efforts to resolve the financial
crisis. The reforms threaten to cut the profit at dealers such
as Goldman Sachs because they will make swaps prices known to
the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Lubke was appointed to his former role by Timothy Geithner, now Treasury Secretary, who was then president of the
New York Fed. The central bank has pushed for changes in the
credit-default swap market since 2005, when Geithner became
concerned that an explosion of trading was threatening the
ability of banks and regulators to manage and monitor risks that
posed a threat to the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was reassigned as a senior vice president at the New
York Fed in September to begin looking for a job outside the
bank, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Statement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Reserve and New York Fed have strict conflict
of interest policies for its staff, including departing
employees,&#8221; Jeffrey Smith, a spokesman for the New York Fed,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;In this instance, as in all
cases, these policies were strictly followed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Fed officials are prohibited for six months from
attending any meetings with the central bank or from any
contact with it on matters related to the area in which the
official worked, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Lubke criticized Wall Street&#8217;s control over the
OTC derivatives market, where credit-default, interest-rate and
other swaps are traded privately between banks and their
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is simply unacceptable in today&#8217;s environment that the
design and structure of the OTC derivatives market can be
controlled by a handful of large dealers,&#8221; Lubke said at an
International Swaps and Derivatives Association conference in
Beijing in April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July, requires most
swaps to be guaranteed by clearinghouse and traded on exchanges
or similar systems. Public prices may lead to compressed
differences between what buyers and sellers want to pay for the
contracts, known as the bid-offer spread, Howard Chen, a Credit
Suisse Group AG analyst in New York, wrote in a Dec. 7 note to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be combated by increases in the rate of swaps
trading and greater market efficiency that come from the new
regulations, Chen said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, shuffled its executive leadership team and eliminated
a layer of reporting structure following the naming of Ian Read
to chief executive officer last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read previously was head of Pfizer&#8217;s global pharmaceutical
operations, responsible for 85 percent of the New York-based
company&#8217;s revenue. That position will be eliminated as the heads
of units report directly to Read, said Ray Kerins, a spokesman
for the drugmaker, in a telephone interview. The changes take
effect immediately, Kerins said. Read was named CEO on Dec. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next five years, Pfizer faces generic competition
to products with $20 billion in annual sales, or almost a third
of the company&#8217;s revenue. Pfizer is eliminating jobs and
reducing costs as it absorbs the $68 billion acquisition of
Wyeth last year. The new reporting structure will help elevate
leaders and speed up decision making, Kerins said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have outstanding leaders who are now being pulled
together into one leadership operation and are no longer
segmented,&#8221; Kerins said. &#8220;Having the business units at the
executive leadership table, we can further improve alignment
across all groups and divisions to drive operational
excellence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

than have us regulate or mandate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies participating in the effort include Yahoo! Inc.,
MasterCard Inc., Visa Inc., American Express Co., GoDaddy.com
Inc., Neustar Inc., eNom Inc. and EBay Inc.&#8217;s Paypal Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the administration has made clear, no one company can
solve this problem, so this new cross-industry group is a
welcome step forward that we are pleased to support,&#8221; Hilary Ware, managing counsel for litigation and regulatory affairs at
Mountain View, California-based Google, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. interest rate swap spreads are
likely to narrow through early January as corporate debt
issuance increases and demand for higher-yielding assets climbs,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A key factor likely to influence swap spreads over the
next few weeks is the well-advertised January effect, which is a
strong seasonal tendency for spreads to narrow,&#8221; wrote a team
of strategists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. led by Terry Belton, New
York-based global head of fixed-income and foreign-exchange
research, in a note dated Dec. 10. Belton wasn&#8217;t available to
comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year swap spread has narrowed in nine out the past
10 years during the mid-December to early January period, with
the average amount 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point,
JPMorgan data shows. Swap rates are typically higher than
Treasury yields as the floating payments are based on interest
rates, such as Libor, that contain credit risk. Sovereign debt
is usually viewed as less risky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year spread, the difference between the five-year
swap rate and the comparable maturity Treasury yield, widened
0.5 basis point today to 21.25 basis points. This year the
spread reached as low as 6.5 basis points in March and as high
as 42.5 basis points in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While strong seasonal patterns make us cautious on
intermediate spread wideners, we do favor long-end wideners
where spreads now appear extremely cheap relative to fair
value,&#8221; he wrote. Belton&#8217;s fixed-income research group was No.
1 this year in Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s poll of U.S.
money managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year swap spread, trading today at negative 27 basis
points, is about 18 basis points below JPMorgan&#8217;s fair-valued
estimate, the largest mispricing since May 2009, Belton wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year swap spread turned negative for the first time
in October 2008 and has mostly traded below zero since January
2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA,
the world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of Coke drinks, is offering
94 million euros ($125.8 million) to take full control of the
Nigerian Bottling Company plc, or NBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC, which has a 66.4 percent stake in NBC, is
offering the other holders the money to cancel their
shareholding in the Nigerian bottler, Athens-based Coca-Cola HBC
said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If approved by NBC&#8217;s other shareholders, the transaction
will take place during the second quarter of 2011 and NBC would
be delisted from the Nigerian Stock Exchange, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed move will result in cost savings, reduce
complexity and allow NBC to fully use the financial strength and
resources of its parent, Coca-Cola HBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of cases shipped by Coca-Cola HBC rose 5 percent
to 610.5 million euros in the third-quarter reflecting &#8220;strong
volume performance&#8221; in &#8220;key markets&#8221; such as Nigeria, the
company said Oct. 27. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said Brazil&#8217;s currency may be overvalued
and predicted more volatility in euro-area debt markets in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People have got to be a tiny bit careful about Brazil; it
has traveled a long, long way,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said today in a radio
interview on &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene. &#8220;The
currency is overvalued. I get people from Rio and Sao Paulo
visiting me in London and describing London as cheap.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are a reminder of how much has changed since
O&#8217;Neill coined the acronym BRIC in 2001 to describe the ascent
of Brazil, Russia, India and China as economic powers. The
Brazilian real has strengthened about 15 percent against the
dollar since the beginning of 2001 and 36 percent since the
start of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill predicted that Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis will
continue to roil markets next year as the 16 governments that
share the euro search for ways to balance diverging
competitiveness more than a decade after the currency was
created in a project that was originally known as European
monetary union, or EMU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe this is a credit crisis,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s more of a crisis about EMU&#8217;s structure and EMU&#8217;s
governance. It&#8217;s not that easy to resolve over night.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve proposed
two rules that would raise consumer protection coverage limits
for credit transactions and leases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules would increase the limits to $50,000, according
to a Fed statement yesterday. Amounts will be adjusted annually
to reflect any increase in the consumer price index, the Fed
said. Consumer loans of more than $25,000 are generally exempt
from the protections of the Truth in Lending Act, and leases
where the consumer&#8217;s total obligation exceeds $25,000 are also
exempt from safeguards of the Consumer Leasing Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to disclose
important terms of consumer loans and prohibits lenders from
engaging in certain practices. The Consumer Leasing Act requires
lessors to provide consumers with disclosures regarding the cost
and other terms of personal property leases, such as automobile
leases. The $50,000 limit for leases would apply to everything
consumers are required to pay under the lease excluding taxes,
the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial overhaul bill enacted July 21 included a
provision to extend coverage to $50,000 effective July 21, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Federation of Energy Traders &#8216;Welcomes&#8217; EU Proposal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Federation of Energy Traders said yesterday it
&#8220;welcomes&#8221; a draft proposal by the European Commission for
regulation of the energy market, according to an e-mailed
statement. The group called for European Union lawmakers to use
care in designing the regulatory system &#8220;so as not to harm the
market, nor hinder its development,&#8221; and urged them to clarify
the powers and responsibilities of the agencies involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Will Stop &#8216;Inappropriate&#8217; Ties Between Banks, Non-Banks 9 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China will seek to halt &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; ties between
banks and non-bank financial institutions, the China Banking
Regulatory Commission said in a statement posted on its website
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watchdog also said it will control the pace of lending
and modify loan structures, and will control the credit risk of
local-government financing vehicles. The CBRC made the statement
after the central government&#8217;s annual economic work meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico Adds Anti-Laundering Rules for Lenders, Universal Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s Finance Ministry will publish new regulations for
specialized lenders known as Sofomes in a bid to prevent money
laundering, El Universal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules will require Mexico&#8217;s tax agency to create a
registry of the lenders, which currently don&#8217;t receive approval
to operate from any financial regulator, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sofomes will have nine months to comply with the new
rules, the newspaper reported. The regulations will be published
in the federal gazette in the coming days, El Universal said. &lt;/p&gt;

Transferable Securities, known as UCITS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks comments on possible measures to
further harmonize protection for UCITS investors in the wake of
scandals and the financial crisis, the Brussels-based commission
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimi Accepts Proposal to Extend Japan Capital Gain Tax Break &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese Financial Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi said he
and Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda agreed to extend the
nation&#8217;s capital gain tax break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters in Tokyo after meeting Noda, Jimi
said they haven&#8217;t decided how long the tax break will be
extended. Jimi says he wanted a two year extension and Noda has
called for it to be extended by one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister Naoto Kan ordered a 5
percentage point cut in the nation&#8217;s corporate tax rate starting
in the next fiscal year to boost an economy that is showing
signs of contraction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate tax rate in Tokyo, Japan&#8217;s financial and
economic center, is 40.69 percent, compared with 28 percent in
the U.K. and 25 percent in China, according to Ministry of
Finance data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Financial Crisis Panel Rift Spurs Protest by Republicans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal split between Republicans and Democrats on the
congressionally appointed commission investigating the 2008
financial crisis is about to break into the open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican members of the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission are planning to register a public protest against a
decision by the FCIC&#8217;s Democratic majority to push back a
deadline for reporting its findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is in part a reaction to a plan that would limit
dissenting views to 36 pages in a 500-page book the panel is set
to publish next year, three people with knowledge of the protest
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Thomas, vice chairman of the panel, told reporters in
Washington yesterday that he is trying to schedule a news
conference for tomorrow, the day the panel was required to issue
its final report. While Thomas didn&#8217;t give details, the people
said the FCIC&#8217;s four Republicans are likely to attend and may
provide a preview of their own report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republicans are angry that the commission&#8217;s six
Democrats voted last month to push the delivery of the final
report to January, said the people, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the plans aren&#8217;t public. The change was made
to &#8220;accommodate the publication&#8221; of the book, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress created the FCIC to investigate the causes of the
financial crisis that toppled Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and
prompted U.S. bailouts for private companies. The panel has been
beset by internal disputes and staff departures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Considers Second European Dark Pool Amid Scrutiny &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the world&#8217;s most profitable
investment bank, is considering opening a second dark pool with
a different regulatory structure as European Union policy makers
seek more transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is in talks with regulators to
create a trading platform to be called Sigma X MTF in addition
to its current internal system, a so-called broker crossing
network known as Sigma, David Shrimpton, who will be chief
operating officer of the new system, said yesterday by phone.
The new dark pool&#8217;s regulatory status will more closely resemble
a multilateral trading facility like Chi-X Europe Ltd. and will
be accessible to external traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week the European Commission proposed placing
transparency requirements on dark pools to provide more
information to investors. Dark pools are being probed by
regulators in both the EU and U.S. because of concerns that
their lack of transparency makes prices potentially less
reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission may require &#8220;organized trading&#8221;
to be subject to minimum requirements, including disclosure of
the kinds of trades that can be executed, and who is allowed to
participate. Waivers that allow investors not to disclose pre-
trade information on regulated exchanges should be &#8220;subject to
further clarification and in some cases restrictions,&#8221;
according to the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission is seeking views on its plans until February
2011. Any final proposals would have to be approved by national
governments and the European Parliament to become law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FSA Unable to Publish RBS Report Without Permission &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority wasn&#8217;t able to
publish its supervisory report on Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc without permission from the banks and individuals involved
in the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA is prohibited under U.K. and European Union law
&#8220;to publish information collected through a supervisory
investigation&#8221; without permission, said Hector Sants, chief
executive officer of the agency. Lawmakers should review whether
the Prudential Regulatory Authority, which will replace the FSA
in 2012, should have more power to release data, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA cleared RBS and former executives including ex-
Chief Executive Officer Fred Goodwin in the Dec. 2 report, which
faulted the bank for &#8220;a series of bad decisions&#8221; before the
financial crisis. Edinburgh-based RBS posted the biggest loss in
corporate history in 2008 and required a bailout of 45.5 billion
pounds ($72 billion) following its acquisition of ABN Amro
Holding NV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA was probing the 2007 ABN Amro takeover, conduct by
RBS executives and a 2008 rights offering. RBS spokeswoman Linda
Harper declined to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable, in a
letter to Adair Turner, chairman of the FSA, urged the FSA to
publish any report into whether the lender&#8217;s former executives
broke regulatory rules in the run-up to the 2008 bailout. In the
letter, Cable said he was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; the findings weren&#8217;t
public. U.K. Treasury minister Mark Hoban said the report&#8217;s
publication is a matter for the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WTO Rules U.S. Tariffs on Chinese Tire Imports Legal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World Trade Organization judges rejected China&#8217;s complaint
that U.S. tariffs on Chinese car and light-truck tires violate
global trade rules, saying the Obama administration &#8220;did not
fail to comply with its obligations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama announced the three-year duties on
$1.8 billion of tires from China in September 2009, acting on a
complaint by the United Steelworkers union, which represents
15,000 employees at 13 tire plants in the U.S. The union said
Chinese tire exports to the U.S. tripled from 2001 to 2004 to 41
million and called for a cap on annual imports of 21 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was the largest so-called safeguard petition filed
to protect U.S. producers from growing imports from China. Union
leaders and Democratic lawmakers said at the time the decision
was proof of Obama&#8217;s commitment to safeguarding domestic workers
and jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government said the tariffs broke WTO rules and
were a &#8220;serious case of trade protectionism, which China
resolutely opposes.&#8221; It lodged a complaint at the Geneva-based
WTO against the duties just three days after Obama announced
them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse May Sell CoCo Bonds Next Year, CEO Dougan Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland&#8217;s second-biggest bank,
may start selling contingent convertible bonds as early as next
year as regulators push firms to use the securities as a cushion
against losses, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Brady Dougan told the Financial
Times in an interview that he hopes the bank can &#8220;do
something&#8221; during the next year. Credit Suisse spokesman Marc
Dosch confirmed the comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougan told Bloomberg Television in an interview in October
that the bank has already received indications of investor
interest in such securities and sees some benefits in starting
to sell them &#8220;sooner rather than later.&#8221; He also said that the
bank may consider using contingent convertibles, or CoCos, which
automatically become equity when certain capital levels are
breached, as part of future bonus payments for bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Swiss government-appointed panel recommended in October
that Zurich-based Credit Suisse and UBS AG hold as much as 9
percent of their risk-weighted capital in CoCos by 2019. UBS
said previously that it doesn&#8217;t plan to sell CoCos until the
bank &#8220;significantly&#8221; boosts capital under the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision&#8217;s Basel III rules, which apply a stricter
definition of capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC Plans to Sell $1 Billion of Bonds Tied to Real Estate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. plans to sell almost $1
billion of securities tied to residential and commercial real-
estate debt once held by failed banks, according to a person
familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is selling guaranteed notes backed by the debt,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
transactions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC is offering bonds from three securitizations
through Barclays Capital, the person said. Two are tied to
residential debt, and total $160.2 million and $135.7 million,
the person said. An additional $679 million of bonds are tied to
commercial-property debt, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Barr, a spokesman for the FDIC, declined to comment,
saying any possible bond sales would be considered private
placements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informa Global Markets reported on the deals yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECB Said to Consider Asking for Capital Increase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank may ask members for a capital
increase to protect itself from any losses stemming from its
government bond purchases, said a euro-area central bank
official with knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any new money would come from the 16 national central banks
which use the euro and contribute most of the ECB&#8217;s 5.8 billion
euro ($7.8 billion) capital base, the ECB&#8217;s statutes show. The
matter may be discussed at the next Governing Council meeting on
Dec. 16 and no decision has yet been made, said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. Germany would view any ECB
request positively, a government official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate suggests the ECB is concerned its program to buy
the bonds of strained governments such as Portugal and Ireland,
which now totals 72 billion euros, may end up saddling its
balance sheet with losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ECB spokeswoman declined to comment. The ECB&#8217;s potential
capital request was reported by Reuters late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banker Pay Shouldn&#8217;t Be Tied to Risk-Taking, EU&#8217;s Barnier Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers&#8217; pay shouldn&#8217;t be linked to the amount of risk they
take on behalf of lenders, Michel Barnier, the European Union&#8217;s
financial services commissioner, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnier made the remarks in response to questions from
British lawmakers about rising banker salaries in London
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers will face limits on cash payouts and the size of
their bonus relative to salary from the start of next year,
after European Union regulators approved laws to curb incentives
for excessive risk-taking on Dec. 10. The rules limit bankers to
receiving about 25 percent of their bonuses in immediate cash
payouts, the rest either deferred or held in shares for a
minimum of three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217;s Callow says Eurozone Banks Need an FDIC &lt;/p&gt;

similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banker Threats to Quit Region Are Blackmail, EU&#8217;s Barnier Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers won&#8217;t follow up on &#8220;blackmail&#8221; threats to flee
the European Union&#8217;s tough new regulations, said Michel Barnier,
the region&#8217;s financial-services chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnier, who earlier said he wants to limit the link
between bonuses and risk-taking, told British lawmakers at the
Treasury Select Committee yesterday that he doubted there would
be &#8220;a flight of talent&#8221; out of Europe to financial centers in
the U.S. or Asia as proposed curbs on short-selling, over-the-
counter derivatives and bonuses take effect from next year in
the 27-nation EU. He said he wasn&#8217;t &#8220;overly impressed&#8221; by such
&#8220;blackmail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers will face limits on cash payouts and the size of
their bonus relative to salary from the start of next year,
after EU regulators approved laws to curb incentives for
excessive risk-taking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Bank of America Executive Named to Lead OCC Examinations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
appointed Mike Brosnan, a former Bank of America Corp.
executive, as its next senior deputy comptroller for large-bank
supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brosnan, who returned to the OCC in 2008 after spending
four years at Bank of America and a predecessor company, will
replace Doug Roeder when Roeder retires at the end of the year,
the Washington-based agency said in a statement on its Web site
yesterday. Previously, Brosnan had spent 21 years at the OCC,
the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large-bank unit oversees examinations and supervision
for 15 lenders with a combined $7.5 trillion in assets, the OCC
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. reduced a large
position in the U.S. silver futures market, the Financial Times
said, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was made to try to deflect public criticism of
its dealings in silver, the FT said. The bank&#8217;s silver positions
would from now on be &#8220;materially smaller&#8221; than in the past,
according to the paper. Two calls and an e-mail to Jennifer Zuccarelli, a New York-based spokeswoman at JPMorgan, were not
immediately answered outside of office hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comex silver surged 77 percent this year, extending the 49
percent rally in 2009. Prices climbed to a 30-year high of
$30.75 an ounce on Dec. 7 as investors sought precious metals as
a store of value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. built Celebration,
Florida, as an idealized version of a circa-World War II small
town, where litter-free streets are lined with white picket
fences and front porches entice neighbors to sit after dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there&#8217;s trouble in the 16-year-old paradise set within
earshot of the nightly fireworks at Walt Disney World Resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebration&#8217;s foreclosure rate is about double the state&#8217;s
pace as homeowners who paid a premium for a vision of utopia
fall behind on their mortgages. Earlier this month, a resident
on the verge of losing his house shot himself after a 14-hour
standoff with police. Three days before that, the town had its
first murder when a man was bludgeoned with an ax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of people bought homes in Celebration thinking
Tinker Bell had sprinkled the town with pixie dust,&#8221; said
Michael Olenick, chief executive officer of mortgage-data firm
Legalprise Inc., referring to the character in Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Peter
Pan&#8221; movie whose magical dust allows people to fly as long as
they think happy thoughts. &#8220;Reality is hitting hard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreclosure rate in Celebration since the beginning of
2009, based on notices of so-called lis pendens that initiate a
case, is one for every 20 residents, compared with one per 48
people in Florida as a whole, according to Legalprise, in West
Palm Beach. Celebration home values have dropped as much as 60
percent from the 2006 peak, while statewide values are down 51
percent, data from Seattle-based research firm Zillow Inc. show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fantasyland&#8217; Premium &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebration foreclosures are happening at a faster pace in
part because property owners in financial trouble are walking
away from vacation homes in the town, where real estate sells
for about 30 percent more than surrounding communities, said
Olenick. Before the recession, people were willing to pay more
for living in a Disney &#8220;fantasyland,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The harsh reality is, bad things happen in Celebration
too, both in real estate and in life,&#8221; Olenick said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Foushee, 52, barricaded himself in his home on Dec.
2, shooting at sheriff&#8217;s deputies and members of a SWAT team
before turning the gun on himself. No law enforcement officers
were injured. Foushee&#8217;s home had been in foreclosure since
October 2009, according to legal filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Osceola sheriff&#8217;s department said there was no
connection between Foushee&#8217;s death and the murder of Matteo
Giovanditto, 58, who was found in his home by a neighbor on Nov.
29. On Dec. 6, David-Israel Zenon Murillo, an acquaintance of
Giovanditto, was arrested and confessed to killing him,
according to a statement on the website of the sheriff&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different Movie Set &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are &#8220;in shock&#8221; after the deaths, said Angela
Sessoms, who has lived in Celebration for 10 years. In the past,
visitors have commented the town looks like the set of a Disney
movie, she said. She heard a similar description with a dark
twist last week, as word of the killings spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the SWAT team, the roads barricaded, and the school
in lockdown, it was like a different kind of movie set,&#8221;
Sessoms said. Before the deaths, a stolen bicycle was considered
Celebration&#8217;s biggest crime, said Sessoms, a real estate agent
at Century 21 Premium Properties&#8217; downtown office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community has marked the events by tying yellow ribbons
to the oak trees that edge its quiet streets, as a memorial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney started building Celebration in 1994, and the first
residents arrived in 1996. Located on the southern border of
Disney World, 25 miles south of Orlando, it was designed by
Robert A.M. Stern, dean of the Yale University School of
Architecture, and Jaquelin Robertson, a founding partner at
Cooper, Robertson  Partners in New York. The style of the
development is called New Urbanism, also known as
neotraditionalism, emulating 1950s mixed-use neighborhoods where
it was easier to walk than to drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kilwin&#8217;s, Woof Gang &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the center of town, bordering a lake constructed by
Disney, stores include Kilwin&#8217;s, a seller of ice cream and
fudge, and the Woof Gang Bakery, where dog owners buy gourmet
treats. At the Market Street Cafe, there&#8217;s an old-fashioned soda
counter where diners can order the restaurant&#8217;s specials: meat
loaf and chicken pot pie, followed by apple or pecan pie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexin Capital, a New York-based private real estate
investment firm, bought the 18-acre Celebration downtown from
Disney in 2004. Mike Nunez, a spokesman for the company, didn&#8217;t
return calls seeking comment. Disney still owns some commercial
property in the town, according to Marilyn Waters, a spokeswoman
for the Burbank, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice the Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living 12 minutes from Disney World&#8217;s Magic Kingdom, with a
backdoor access road, comes at a price. Buying in the 10,000-
person town requires paying what locals call the &#8220;Celebration
Premium.&#8221; The median home value, including single-family
properties and condominiums, was $250,800 in October, almost
twice the $127,300 for the entire state, according to Zillow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properties in Celebration are priced as high as $3.9
million for a six-bedroom, 8,000-square-foot (743 square-meter)
mansion on a three-quarter-acre lot, according to Realtor.com.
At $529,000, buyers could get a four-bedroom, 2,800-square-foot
home with a wrap-around porch on about a sixth of an acre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For condominiums, $90,000 will buy a two-bedroom, 1,000-
square-foot unit, according to Realtor.com. At the top of the
market, a five-bedroom, 3,400-square-foot, townhouse-style condo
is priced at $675,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, at the height of the real estate boom, the
least expensive single-family house in the June to December
period sold for $350,000, according to Kathleen Carlson, owner
of Imagination Realty in the town&#8217;s center. In the same period
this year, it was $210,000, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest condominium sale in the boom was $193,000,
compared with a sale at $70,000 for the 2010 period, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Town Maintenance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All owners pay about $860 a year for private trash pickup
and recreational facilities, including parks, community pools
and baseball fields. Condo owners pay an additional maintenance
fee that varies depending on location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town&#8217;s Architectural Review Committee maintains strict
control over the appearance of properties, dictating paint
colors, regulating holiday decorations and overseeing the size
of political signs that can only be posted in the 45 days
leading up to an election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most residents see the rules as &#8220;protection,&#8221; said
Carlson, who lives in a Celebration home with a wide front porch
where she drinks coffee with neighbors on Sunday mornings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of us came here not because of Disney -- we came
because we wanted that type of control over our neighborhood,&#8221;
Carlson said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry that your neighbor will
suddenly start parking an old pickup on his front lawn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Acceptable Styles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Carlson&#8217;s house, most properties have front porches
that encourage neighborliness. There are six accepted historical
architectural styles for homes: Victorian, Classical, Colonial
Revival, Mediterranean, French, and Coastal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While white picket fences outline most front yards, not
everyone is allowed to have them. That would look too fake, said
Laura Poe, a spokeswoman for the town. The architectural
committee decides who can have the old-fashioned fences and who
must have short, trimmed hedges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town shows its Disney heritage in annual seasonal
shows, each with special effects originally designed by the
entertainment company. In October, leaf-shaped confetti shoots
out of lamp posts in the village center to simulate colorful
falling foliage. During the month of December, the posts emit
what locals call snoap -- soap suds that look like snow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in real life, the snow falls four times a night, on
schedule, and dissipates without shoveling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Two of my grandchildren think we live inside Disney
World, with Mickey Mouse,&#8221; said Celebration resident Sessoms,
referring to a four-year-old and a five-year-old. &#8220;Except for
the recent violence, I can understand why they would think
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Dec 15, 2010  6:19 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-15/goldman-s-bankfein-deputies-to-collect-111-3-million-in-stock-bonuses.html"><headline>Goldman Officers to Reap $111 Million Payout From 2007, 2009</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s top
executives will get about $111.3 million in stock next month in
a delayed payout from last year and their record-setting 2007
awards, even as Wall Street prepares for lower bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is poised
to receive about $24.3 million in January, based on the closing
share price on Dec. 14, while President Gary D. Cohn, 50, will
get about $24 million, company filings show. The payouts, just a
portion of the $67.9 million bonus awarded to Blankfein for 2007
and the $66.9 million paid to Cohn, reflect a 24 percent decline
in the stock&#8217;s value since it was granted at $218.86. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a year after the bonuses were approved, Goldman
Sachs took $10 billion of U.S. bailout funds, converted to a
bank and was borrowing as much as $35.4 billion a day from
Federal Reserve emergency programs. This year the New York-based
firm paid $550 million to settle U.S. regulators&#8217; fraud charges
related to a mortgage security the company sold in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly we now look back and say, &#8216;Were things fine?
Should they have paid? Maybe not,&#8217;&#8221; said Jeanne Branthover, a
managing director at recruitment firm Boyden Global Executive
Search in New York. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. The
payouts were in stone. But hopefully, in the future, they won&#8217;t
be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deferred Stock &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 2008 credit crisis wiped out competitors such as
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and led to unprecedented
government assistance to financial institutions, regulators have
encouraged banks to pay senior employees with deferred stock and
recoup payouts if trading strategies backfire. Blankfein and
Cohn, who received cash awards of $27 million and $26.6 million
respectively for 2007, didn&#8217;t get any bonuses for 2008 and
received only restricted stock for 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs announced on Dec. 10, 2009, that all 30
members of its management committee would receive only
restricted stock for their year-end bonuses. The company hasn&#8217;t
made a similar announcement this year. Through the first nine
months of 2010, Goldman Sachs set aside $13.1 billion to cover
compensation and benefits expenses, or enough to pay each of its
35,400 employees $370,706 apiece. A year earlier, the average
was $527,192 per employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payments come as bonuses across Wall Street are
expected to decline. Compensation for trading and investment-
banking employees is likely to be down 22 percent to 28 percent
from last year, according to Options Group, an executive search
and compensation consultant firm in New York. Morgan Stanley has
told some employees to expect investment-banking bonuses to
decline 10 percent to 30 percent, two people briefed on the
matter said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 23 percent share-price decline from the
last day of 2007 compares with a 16 percent drop in the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index over the same period and a 47 percent plunge
in the SP 500 Financials Index. While the firm&#8217;s profit tumbled
80 percent in 2008 from the $11.6 billion earned in 2007, last
year the company recovered to post a $13.4 billion record
profit. So far this year earnings have been lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the scheduled January payouts are $21.3 million to
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar; $20.8 million to former
co-president Jon Winkelried, who left the firm in March 2009;
and $14.3 million to Edward C. Forst, co-head of investment
management, who left in 2008 and returned to Goldman Sachs a
year later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amounts are based on the Dec. 14 closing share price of
$167.33, which is likely to change by the time the stock is
delivered next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, Mack &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, 54, is set to receive
$6.8 million worth of shares next month that were awarded for
2007. John Mack, 66, who served as CEO of New York-based Morgan
Stanley until this year, didn&#8217;t take a bonus in 2007, 2008 or
2009. He will receive about $5.4 million of previously vested
shares in January that Morgan Stanley awarded him for 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the $111.3 million in restricted stock awards due to be
doled out in January, $94.9 million was from 2007 grants, the
filings show. While Vice Chairmen John S. Weinberg and J. Michael Evans will each receive $3.3 million from their 2009
bonus grants, their 2007 awards weren&#8217;t published in the proxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett Agreement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives will be restrained from cashing in the stock
they receive. Blankfein, Cohn, Winkelried and Viniar were all
required to keep 90 percent of their shares under an agreement
reached with Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the company controlled by
billionaire Warren Buffett, when it bought $5 billion of the
firm&#8217;s preferred stock in 2008. That limit expires when
Buffett&#8217;s investment is repaid or on Oct. 1, 2011, whichever
comes soonest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the Buffett restrictions were imposed, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s CEO, CFO, presidents and vice chairmen were required to
keep at least 75 percent of the shares they had received since
becoming senior executive officers, with the exception of shares
received in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 1999 initial public offering or
through any acquisition by Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley and
JPMorgan also require top executives to retain 75 percent of the
shares they are awarded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 88 percent of the 2007 awards were restricted stock
units the firm granted for performance, which were vested at
that time. The executives receive the shares underlying those
units in January 2011. The remaining 12 percent are shares the
executives purchased at a 25 percent discount using their 2007
cash bonuses. Those shares are either delivered or have
restrictions lifted next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives also received stock options in 2007 that
become exercisable in January. The options, which expire on Nov.
24, 2017, are unlikely to be exercised immediately because the
shares are below the strike price of $204.16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The January bonus awards will probably trigger varying
reactions among different groups of people, Branthover said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The public will be outraged,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Wall Streeters
will be excited that there&#8217;s still money being made on Wall
Street, and there&#8217;s still a reason to be working so hard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Marois" date="Dec 15, 2010  5:39 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-15/goldman-sachs-moves-brown-to-midwest-as-brother-wins-california-election.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Moves Kathleen Brown to Midwest Role</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Brown, who runs the West
Coast municipal finance team at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., will
move to a newly created post in Chicago after her brother Jerry Brown was elected last month as California&#8217;s next governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, 65, will become chairman of investment banking for
the Midwest, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an internal
memo today. The former California state treasurer, whose brother
and father both served as the state&#8217;s governor, joined Goldman
in 2001. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the firm, confirmed
the contents of the memo, which was signed by David Solomon and
John S. Weinberg, co-heads of investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Kathleen is taking on this new role because it broadens
her client focus,&#8221; DuVally said. &#8220;Had she continued to work
with California municipalities, it might have created the
perception of a conflict of interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is ninth among underwriters of municipal debt
issued this year by California, the biggest issuer of municipal
bonds in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, leaves office Jan.
3 when Governor-elect Jerry Brown, a Democrat who held the job
from 1975 to 1983, is sworn in. Brown defeated former EBay Inc.
Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman, who came under criticism by
Democrats for being a former board member at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridge Loan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the most profitable securities firm in Wall Street
history, lent the state $1.5 billion in November as part of a
syndicate of six banks. The arrangement provided California with
a $6.7 billion bridge loan to help pay bills after a budget
impasse left the state short on cash. Goldman Sachs led a group
of investment banks on $4.93 billion in bonds sold by the state
since Jan. 1, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Timothy &#8220;Tim&#8221; Romer, 49, a managing director in the
West Coast public sector and infrastructure group, will succeed
Kathleen Brown as head of the group, DuVally said. Romer, who is
based in Los Angeles, joined Goldman Sachs in 2003 after working
in public finance at Bank of America Corp. and Merrill Lynch 
Co., which is now part of Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown&#8217;s new role will be focused on client relationships
and John Gilbertson will continue to run investment banking in
the Midwest region, DuVally said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, who was herself the 1994 Democratic nominee for
California governor, reports to James P. &#8220;Jim&#8221; Esposito, chief
operating officer for investment banking, as well as to John Waldron, head of investment-banking services, DuVally said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. updated its Bing
search engine today, aiming to build on U.S. market-share gains
last month as it chases Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing, which ranks third in the market, accounted for 11.8
percent of U.S. searches in November, up from 11.5 percent the
previous month, Reston, Virginia-based ComScore Inc. said today.
While Google remained dominant, its share slipped to 66.2
percent from 66.3 percent. Yahoo! Inc. remained second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced improvements to Bing at an event in San
Francisco. The company made its image-search feature easier to
use and integrated the mobile version of Bing with restaurant
services OpenTable and GrubHub. Users can make a reservation or
order takeout without leaving the application. They also can see
panoramic views of restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft looks to gain an edge over Google with the new
features and boost its advertising revenue. The company also has
forged a deal with Yahoo to handle search on its sites. Earlier
this month, Microsoft said the company is increasingly confident
that the agreement will boost revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo have about 28 percent of the
U.S. search market. Yahoo&#8217;s share inched down to 16.4 percent
from 16.5 percent last month, ComScore said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. use
&#8220;anti-competitive&#8221; rules to prevent merchants in Canada from
encouraging shoppers to use cheaper payment options such as cash
or debit, Canada&#8217;s competition watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Competition Bureau, acting on a complaint from Canadian
retailers, asked a tribunal to strike down the rules imposed by
the world&#8217;s two largest credit-card companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa and MasterCard&#8217;s anti-competitive behavior hurts
businesses and consumers alike,&#8221; Melanie Aitken, the bureau&#8217;s
commissioner, said in a statement today. &#8220;It is particularly
harmful for small and medium sized businesses, key engines for
economic growth in Canada.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two credit card companies agreed in October to change
some of their practices in the U.S. to avert an antitrust suit.
The settlement allowed four million U.S. merchants to steer
customers to different credit cards or forms of payments through
discounts and rebates, the U.S. Justice Department said at the
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard, which account for 90 percent of
Canada&#8217;s credit-card transactions, prevent merchants from
applying a surcharge on high-cost cards issued by the companies.
Merchants pay C$5 billion ($4.98 billion) in &#8220;hidden credit
card fees,&#8221; the bureau said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highest Rates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit companies also impose a &#8220;no surcharge rule,&#8221;
preventing merchants from charging a fee for credit-card
transactions, forcing them to embed fees in retail prices.
Canada has among the highest card acceptance fees in the world,
ranging from 1.5 percent to 3 percent, almost twice as high as
Europe, the bureau said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard&#8217;s Canadian unit said the Competition Bureau&#8217;s
legal claims are without merit and will be rejected by the
Competition Tribunal, a court that hears cases on mergers and
trade practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If these changes were implemented by the Competition
Bureau, the result would be to enrich merchants at the expense
of consumers,&#8221; MasterCard Canada President Betty DeVita said in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa is disappointed that the Canadian Competition Bureau
has taken an anti-consumer position by filing a lawsuit against
Visa to overturn policies that protect consumers,&#8221; Visa said in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s policies don&#8217;t prevent retailers from offering an
incentive for shoppers to use cash or debit, Visa said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime later this month --
precisely when is a secret -- Sam Palmisano, chief executive
officer of International Business Machines Corp., will gather
his 15 senior vice presidents in the company&#8217;s walnut-paneled
boardroom in Armonk, New York, for an all-day brainstorm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the annual Global Technology Outlook, at which top
executives and scientists decide what ideas to chase most
vigilantly. Research chief John Kelly oversees the discussion as
eight other Ph.D. scientists present slides about half a dozen
trends the research team thinks IBM can&#8217;t ignore. The group
convenes at about 7:30 a.m., works through a lunch of sandwiches
and salads, and doesn&#8217;t quit until they&#8217;ve reached consensus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions made at the brainstorm shape which projects get
funded, which companies IBM will buy next year, and, for
investors, whether the company will extend its 26 straight
quarters of increased earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The numbers are compelling,&#8221; said Dick Glasebrook, a New
York-based managing director at the Straus Group unit of
Neuberger Berman, which owned 10.6 million IBM shares as of Sept.
30. &#8220;There&#8217;s a high priority, as a differentiating factor, in
focusing on research.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM invested $5.8 billion in research and development last
year, 6.1 percent of revenue, compared with $3.0 billion, or 2.4
percent, at Hewlett Packard Co. That&#8217;s led to technologies such
as new microprocessor designs and an IBM supercomputer that will
compete on the &#8216;Jeopardy!&#8217; quiz show next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company counts on Kelly and his team for the most
significant innovations and augments their efforts with niche
acquisitions. Since Palmisano became CEO in 2002, IBM has spent
about $28 billion on deals compared with more than $43 billion
each for HP and Oracle Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Than Invention &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not wandering off into the weeds relative to our
strategy,&#8221; Kelly, 56, said in an interview. &#8220;Sam spends not
only a lot of money, but a lot of time on this subject.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s 3,000 researchers play a role broader than invention.
At the brainstorm session and other forums, Kelly and his
scientists help forge strategy and deal plans. A year ago at the
meeting, they identified the digitization of health-care records
as a top priority, highlighting one gap in software that was
filled with a deal for Initiate Systems Inc. in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly also sits on the committee that screens possible
acquisitions, along with MA chief Elias Mendoza. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They, more proactively than others, are really evaluating,
&#8216;Is this something we need to go out and purchase or is this a
solution we can build&#8217;,&#8221; said Jeff Bistrong, a Boston-based
managing director at investment bank Harris Williams  Co. who
has sold companies to IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue Growth? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy hasn&#8217;t led to stronger revenue growth or
stock-market performance than rivals. In the past eight years,
IBM has boosted sales 15 percent, while HP and Oracle have more
than doubled revenue. Since the start of 2002, IBM shares have
climbed 21 percent, as HP and Oracle have more than doubled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, IBM&#8217;s 26 quarters of per-share earnings increases
outstrips the six at HP and five for Oracle. Investors have
started to reward IBM. Its stock has outperformed Oracle and HP
since the start of 2009, rising 73 percent through yesterday and
hitting a record high last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 60 cents to $145.22 at 11:34 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading and had climbed 11 percent this
year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 59-year-old Palmisano was openly critical of HP after
it struck a deal to buy the data-storage company 3Par Inc. for
$2.35 billion, about triple the company&#8217;s market value before
acquisition talks began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m never worried about a competitor that doesn&#8217;t invest
in RD,&#8221; he said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Leo Apotheker, who took over as HP&#8217;s CEO last month, said
he plans to boost research spending at the company, which had
cut such investments under his predecessor, Mark Hurd. Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brainstorm Preparation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for IBM&#8217;s annual brainstorm takes months of
preparation. Kelly, a 30-year IBM veteran with a Ph.D. in
materials engineering, starts over the summer. He and his team
meet with venture capitalists, universities and clients. They
cull the information and narrow to five or six broad topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The chances of us being blindsided are greatly reduced by
this process,&#8221; said Kelly. &#8220;We scour internally, globally
around our research for opportunities, discontinuities and
threats.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IBM won&#8217;t disclose what it will discuss this year,
the company has been focusing on four areas -- emerging markets,
cloud computing, analytics and its Smarter Planet initiative, or
the idea that highways and electrical systems can be made more
efficient through monitoring with digital sensors. Sixty percent
of the research budget goes to those areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GTO Breakthroughs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GTO, as acronym-happy IBMers call it, can lead to
breakthroughs. In 2003, participants homed in on software that
could collect and analyze information in real-time. Following
the meeting, &#8220;the mandate was just to build machines that have
the ability to sense the world,&#8221; said Nagui Halim, the
researcher tapped to head the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halim and other researchers created InfoSphere Streams,
software that identifies and analyzes data with stream computing.
It was introduced as a product last year, helping its segment
increase revenue by more than 10 percent. The technology has
helped TD Securities develop an automated options trading system
and Stockholm predict traffic flows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Acquisition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Kelly and his team flagged the growing role that
technology was playing in health care. Though researchers were
developing ways for hospitals and insurers to share information,
they still needed software to integrate various records. That
led to the deal for Initiate, whose programs identify duplicate
patient entries in different databases and consolidate them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had quite a few research projects that had started in
health care,&#8221; Robert Morris, vice president of services
research, said in an interview. &#8220;We pulled them all together
and, when we did that, we started saying &#8216;We need more here.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Kelly, who has been research chief since
2007, suggests potential targets. Researchers in IBM&#8217;s lab in
Haifa, Israel, noticed XIV Information Systems, a local storage
company that can increase storage capacity as clients need it.
Kelly told the MA committee about XIV and IBM pounced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We, working with MA guys and our storage system guys
said, &#8216;Hey, here&#8217;s a company with some very interesting
technology, some very good people,&#8217;&#8221; Kelly said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-Term Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano told shareholders in May that the company will
almost double operating earnings per share to $20 by 2015. IBM
will add about $20 billion in sales over that period from
investments in its four growth initiatives, he said, while
spending about $20 billion on acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research funding that isn&#8217;t spent on IBM&#8217;s four growth
platforms goes toward product launches, such as the newest
mainframe model, and exploratory projects, such as the
&#8216;Jeopardy&#8217; computer and an effort with candy maker Mars Inc. to
map the cocoa gene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, research leads to a process or software code or some
other piece of intellectual property, which are all saved and
vetted by a governance board. Those deemed reusable land in
IBM&#8217;s &#8220;Asset Hub&#8221; -- an internal website divided into 17
industries, such as banking, and further subcategories, such as
financial risk. Consultants choose codes from an industry or
service as they start projects for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has spent about 6 percent of its revenue on
research for the past eight years, just completed its 2011
budget. Though the company won&#8217;t disclose specific figures,
Kelly said the company&#8217;s priorities are clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sam and the board put their money where their mouth is,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley had its fourth-
quarter earnings estimates cut by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
which cited weak trading revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s fourth-quarter earnings-per-share estimate
was lowered to 35 cents from 55 cents, while it held its 2011
forecast at $3 and cut its 2012 estimate to $3.15 from $3.30,
analysts including Daniel Harris wrote in a note to clients
today. Goldman Sachs has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation on the
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading in the quarter was &#8220;muted,&#8221; though
this was offset somewhat by &#8220;healthy&#8221; results in Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s main equities business, the Goldman Sachs analysts
said. &#8220;Equity issuance appears to be exceptionally solid,
probably the best sequential comparison across Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
businesses,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said Morgan Stanley had a &#8220;very good&#8221; year
overall in investment banking though it experienced continued
&#8220;growing pains&#8221; in its trading business. Revenue from its debt
capital markets unit will drop 20 percent in the quarter,
Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal India Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest
producer of the fuel, plans to form a partnership with the Port
of Visakhapatnam on the east coast to increase import capacity
as power generation demand rises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tie-up will initially allocate 5 million metric tons of
port capacity for coal imports, Coal India&#8217;s technical director
N.C. Jha said in an interview in New Delhi today. The venture
will later build a 20 million-ton coal berth, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for coal has outpaced domestic production in India,
which aims to provide electricity to every household by 2012.
More than half of India&#8217;s power generation capacity is coal-
fired and Coal India is preparing to bring in additional
supplies from overseas as it awaits environmental approval for
new mining projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal India, based in Kolkata, plans to import 6 million
tons of coal in the year ending March 31. The miner is in talks
with companies, including NTPC Ltd., India&#8217;s largest power
generation company, Jha said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How much we import and when will depend on buyers,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We are telling our clients to strike a long-term
purchase agreement with us. The large volume will help us import
coal at lower prices and power companies will benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal India also plans to secure cargo capacity in an
agreement with Shipping Corp. of India Ltd., Jha said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. increased bets against Eisai Co. as the
Japanese drugmaker&#8217;s best-selling medicine, the Aricept
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease treatment, loses patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its short position for clients or itself to
3.7 percent of Eisai&#8217;s shares, worth $380 million, while Goldman
Sachs boosted short holdings to $130 million, regulatory filings
dated Dec. 13 showed. Morgan Stanley  Co. disclosed the third-
biggest position in Eisai. Short-sellers typically sell borrowed
shares, seeking to profit by repurchasing them at lower prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transactions have made Eisai the most shorted Japanese
stock, ahead of trading company Sumitomo Corp., which has $542
million of shares shorted by investors compared with its 1.49
trillion-yen ($17.8 billion) market value, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisai is trying to develop new products to buffer sales
amid competition from cheaper copies of Aricept, the world&#8217;s
top-selling pill to ease Alzheimer&#8217;s symptoms. U.S. regulators
allowed India&#8217;s Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. last month to begin
selling its generic version of Aricept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares gained 0.5 percent to 2,934 yen at the
3 p.m. close of trading on the Tokyo stock exchange. The shares
have gained for three days, reducing their year-to-date loss to
14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeshi Shimizu, an Eisai spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s sales of Eisai stock were reported by JPMorgan
Whitefriars Inc., a London-based institutional investment
management unit of the New York-based bank. JPMorgan spokesman
Brian Marchiony declined to comment, as did Sumiko Iwadate, a
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two funds run by J.P. Morgan Asset
Management acquired the London headquarters of law firm Allen 
Overy LLP for about 560 million pounds ($882 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 71,900 square-meter (773,925 square-foot) building at
Bishops Square, adjacent to Spitalfields Market in the City of
London financial district, was sold by Oman&#8217;s sovereign wealth
fund and Hammerson Plc, according to a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rents are rising in London because of a scarcity of large
new office buildings. The financial crisis made banks unwilling
to lend to developers, causing construction in central London to
fall to its lowest in more than 20 years, according to real
estate broker Drivers Jonas Deloitte. It predicts that rents in
the City rose by 25 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain bullish on investing in high-quality, well-
tenanted office properties located throughout Europe&#8217;s most
important cities,&#8221; said Peter Reilly, head of JPMorgan&#8217;s real
estate asset management arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammerson developed the building in 2005 and sold a 75
percent stake in the property to Oman Investment Fund in June
2009. It expects to book a profit of 79 million pounds for the
sale of its remaining 25 percent stake, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington" date="Dec 15, 2010 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-15/goldman-sachs-hires-new-york-fed-s-lubke-pointman-on-derivatives-reform.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Hires New York Fed's Lubke, Pointman on Derivatives Reform</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Theo Lubke, who headed the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s efforts to reform the private
derivatives market, joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable firm navigate the looming overhaul of
financial regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubke, 44, started this month as chief regulatory reform
officer in Goldman Sachs&#8217; securities division, according to a
memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The newly-created role will
allow Lubke to &#8220;work closely with divisional and firm-wide
leadership to implement regulatory reform legislation,&#8221; the
memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is hiring Lubke five months after Congress
mandated the regulation of the $583 trillion over-the-counter
derivatives market, which complicated efforts to resolve the
financial crisis. The reforms threaten to cut profits at dealers
because they will make swaps prices known to the public. Lubke&#8217;s
new firm employs a former New York Fed president and has an ex-
Fed board chairman as a director. The current president of the
New York Fed, William Dudley, also worked there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a pattern,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;It&#8217;s troublesome stuff
and there needs to be some regulation so people don&#8217;t do it and
undermine public policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs who
confirmed the contents of the memo, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubke Reassigned &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Reserve and New York Fed have strict conflict
of interest policies for its staff, including departing
employees,&#8221; Jeffrey Smith, a spokesman for the New York Fed,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;In this instance, as in all
cases, these policies were strictly followed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Fed officials who leave are prohibited for six
months from attending any meetings with the central bank or from
any contact with it on matters related to the area in which the
official worked, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubke was reassigned to an administrative role at the Fed
in September so he could begin looking for a job outside the
bank, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Timothy Geithner, then president of the New York
Fed, appointed Lubke to his former role, as the central bank
pushed for changes in the credit-default swap market. Geithner,
who&#8217;s now Treasury Secretary, started those efforts in 2005 when
he became concerned that an explosion of trading was threatening
the ability of banks and regulators to manage and monitor risks
that posed a threat to the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Criticized &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Lubke criticized Wall Street&#8217;s control over the
OTC derivatives market, where credit-default, interest-rate and
other swaps are traded privately between banks and their
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is simply unacceptable in today&#8217;s environment that the
design and structure of the OTC derivatives market can be
controlled by a handful of large dealers,&#8221; Lubke said at an
International Swaps and Derivatives Association conference in
Beijing in April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July, requires most
swaps to be guaranteed by clearinghouses and traded on exchanges
or similar systems. Public prices may lead to compressed
differences between what buyers and sellers want to pay for the
contracts, known as the bid-offer spread, Howard Chen, a Credit
Suisse Group AG analyst in New York, wrote in a Dec. 7 note to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be combated by increases in the rate of swaps
trading and greater market efficiency that come from the new
regulations, Chen said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Both Ways&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubke is the latest regulator to be hired by Wall Street&#8217;s
most profitable securities firm. Bankers who worked at Goldman
Sachs have also become regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That street goes both ways,&#8221; said Geisst, author of
books including &#8220;The Last Partnerships: Inside the Great Wall
Street Money Dynasties&#8221; (McGraw-Hill, 2001). &#8220;They go from
Goldman to the Fed and they go from the Fed to Goldman, and
that&#8217;s the important part of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other firms also have ties to the central bank and the
government. Last week, Citigroup Inc., the biggest bailout
recipient among U.S. banks during the financial crisis, hired
former White House Budget Director Peter Orszag to be vice
chairman of its investment-banking division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dudley, a former partner at Goldman Sachs and its chief
U.S. economist for a decade, joined the New York Fed in 2007 and
then succeeded Geithner as the central bank&#8217;s president in 2009.
E. Gerald Corrigan, who headed the New York Fed from 1985 to
1993, joined Goldman Sachs in 1994, where he went on to be co-
chair of its global risk-management committee and co-chair of
global compliance and control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrigan, Friedman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrigan, 69, was appointed by the bank to help oversee a
business standards committee in May, a month after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud over
how it marketed a collateralized debt obligation. Goldman Sachs
agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Friedman, a former chairman of Goldman Sachs&#8217;
board, quit as chairman of the New York Fed&#8217;s board of directors
in May 2009 to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest
over his ties to the investment bank. Friedman, who served as
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-chairman with Robert Rubin from 1990 to 1992
before Rubin became Treasury Secretary, remains a Goldman Sachs
board member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner, who was named Treasury Secretary in January 2009,
hired former Goldman Sachs lobbyist Mark Patterson as his chief
of staff. Patterson recused himself for two years from any
issues that relate specifically to the bank, which he left in
April 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. said it set the annual
base salary and target bonus of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
at $4.29 million, with additional payments in stock, options and
long-term incentive awards to be disclosed in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read, named CEO on Dec. 5, was previously head of Pfizer&#8217;s
global pharmaceutical operations responsible for 85 percent of
company revenue. He will see a base salary increase of 40
percent, to $1.7 million from $1.21 million, the company said in
a filing. His bonus target more than doubled to $2.59 million,
from $1.16 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read&#8217;s compensation figures don&#8217;t include stock, options
and long-term incentive pay, which will be disclosed in the next
proxy statement, typically filed in March, said Joan Campion, a
spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer. Read, a 32-year veteran
of the company, received compensation valued at $9.45 million in
2009, the most recent year for which total awards have been
included in regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next five years, Pfizer faces generic competition
to products with $20 billion in annual sales, or almost a third
of the company&#8217;s revenue. Pfizer is eliminating jobs and
reducing costs as it absorbs the $68 billion acquisition of
Wyeth last year. Pfizer&#8217;s former CEO, Jeffrey Kindler, will
receive about $9.6 million in severance, bonus and short-term
incentive pay for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s National Energy Board gave
an Exxon Mobil Corp.-led group five years to start building a
C$16.2 billion ($15.9 billion) pipeline intended to haul Arctic
natural gas to southern Canada and the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than three decades after the 1,220-kilometer (758-
mile) pipeline first was proposed for the Mackenzie River
valley, a three-member review panel today approved the conduit,
provided Exxon Mobil and its partners meet more than 200
conditions and begin construction by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline is a hurdle for a project that Exxon Mobil
Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has said is probably a
decade away from being realized. In a July conference call with
analysts, Tillerson cited the high cost of shipping Arctic gas
south and the length of time it would take to build across semi-
sovereign tribal areas and indigenous hunting grounds as
obstacles to profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our decision is a major step toward allowing the project
to proceed, but it does not mean the project will be built,&#8221;
the panel said in a 78-page report today, adding that it&#8217;s up to
the companies involved to decide if the pipeline makes economic
sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 2015 timeframe causes us a little concern and will be
challenging,&#8221; Pius Rolheiser, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
Imperial Oil Ltd. unit, said in a telephone interview from
Calgary. &#8220;It also depends on how long it takes to reach a
fiscal agreement with the government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial is also a partner in the development, along with
Royal Dutch Shell Plc of The Hague, and ConocoPhillips, based in
Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline would follow the course of a north-flowing
river that cuts through the sparsely populated Northwest
Territories and empties into the Arctic Ocean. In 2007,
Tillerson said the project no longer was &#8220;viable&#8221; after the
cost estimate more than doubled amid soaring steel prices and
regulatory delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low natural-gas prices stemming from a surplus of gas
flowing from continental U.S. fields also clouded the project&#8217;s
future, Ian Doig, the Calgary-based publisher of Doig&#8217;s Digest,
an oil-and-gas industry newsletter, said today in an interview
before the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The price of gas is a significant challenge,&#8221; Doig said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;The area is only represented by one
member of Canada&#8217;s Parliament, so the project doesn&#8217;t have a lot
of political clout behind it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsons Lake, Taglu &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline would tap fields that the U.S. Energy
Department estimates contain almost 6 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas. Exxon Mobil&#8217;s Taglu is the largest with an
estimated 3 trillion cubic feet, followed by ConocoPhillips&#8217; 1.8
trillion-cubic-foot Parsons Lake field and a joint Exxon Mobil-
Shell-owned discovery called Niglintgak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the first 20 years of operation, the conduit would
boost Canada&#8217;s gross domestic product by as much as C$42 billion
and generate up to C$14.3 billion in taxes and royalties, the
report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an important milestone,&#8221; Environment Minister
John Baird said in a telephone interview after the report was
released. &#8220;The process has taken a long time -- too long in my
judgment -- but we&#8217;re happy to see them move quickly with the
government&#8217;s response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabinet Approval &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil and its partners would be required to build
lateral lines from the main pipeline to supply gas to
communities along the route, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All the panel is doing is giving the Imperial-led group a
list of conditions,&#8221; Doig said. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like a gift
certificate to be used within a certain period of time.&#8221; The
panel&#8217;s recommendations still require approval by Prime Minister
Stephen Harper&#8217;s cabinet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At full capacity, the pipeline would carry 1.2 billion
cubic feet of gas a day, or enough energy to supply about one in
every 10 U.S. homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline has been in the works since the early 1970s
and was shelved after a public inquiry into the potential impact
on the environment, wildlife and indigenous northern
communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural-gas futures in the U.S., the world&#8217;s largest market
for the furnace and factory fuel, peaked at $15.78 per million
British thermal units in December 2005. Since then, they&#8217;ve
plunged 75 percent to about $4 amid surging output from new
wells in Texas, Louisiana and Wyoming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., the San
Francisco-based lender that doubled its size by buying Wachovia
Corp. during the credit crisis, passed JPMorgan Chase  Co. to
become the largest U.S. bank by stock-market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s market capitalization rose to $157.6 billion
at today&#8217;s close of New York trading, surpassing JPMorgan&#8217;s
$156.4 billion. Wells Fargo is ranked fourth by assets and
deposits, while JPMorgan is second behind Bank of America Corp.
and New York-based Citigroup Inc. is third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, 57, has used
acquisitions to fuel growth at Wells Fargo. The lender completed
more than 55 purchases in the past five years, led by its $12.7
billion takeover of Wachovia in October 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Wells Fargo had $622.4 billion in assets
in the quarter before it purchased Wachovia. It held $1.2
trillion in assets at the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo rose 0.8 percent to $30.02 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have advanced
11 percent this year, compared with a loss of 4 percent at
JPMorgan. The biggest stakeholder in Wells Fargo is Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 12, Wells Fargo passed Bank of America as the most
valuable U.S. bank before the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
company passed it the following week on May 18, according to
Bloomberg data. New York-based JPMorgan has held the lead for
most of the last two years, except for the five-month period
between February and July of this year when it repeatedly traded
places with Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget about Google Inc.&#8217;s struggle
with Facebook for eyeballs and programmers. Pay no attention to
its fight with Apple Inc. over smartphones, or to any other tech
rivalry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search giant&#8217;s war with Microsoft Corp. is The Big One,
the confrontation that will determine what kind of future
Microsoft has, and maybe if it even has a future. And the two
new weapons Google unsheathed last week carry an unmistakable
message of mortal peril. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First came the Nexus S, the new Google-labeled smartphone
and the first to run &#8220;Gingerbread,&#8221; Google&#8217;s latest Android
operating system. Then came a plain black laptop called the Cr-
48, the first computer to run the company&#8217;s Web-based Chrome
Operating System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, neither seems particularly menacing. The
Nexus S, made by Samsung, is the successor to one of the most
hyped and least successful products of 2010, the lovely and ill-
fated Nexus One. And the Cr-48 isn&#8217;t even for sale. It&#8217;s a
generic prototype that Google is making available to thousands
of developers, companies and others to get them familiar with
the concept of the new operating system before commercial
versions from manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co. and
Acer Inc. show up next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enormous Threat &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the two devices represent an enormous threat to
Microsoft and its chief executive officer, Steve Ballmer. The
success of Android is rapidly foreclosing Microsoft&#8217;s growth
prospects as more computing is done on mobile devices.
Meanwhile, Chrome OS takes dead aim at its great twin cash cows:
the Windows and Microsoft Office franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the two new offerings, the Nexus S is the one most
visible to consumers. The phone went on sale in the U.S.
yesterday at Best Buy Co. stores and online for $199 on a two-
year contract from Deutsche Telekom AG&#8217;s T-Mobile USA, and for
$529 with no contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone, a variation on Samsung&#8217;s popular Galaxy S line,
comes with a gorgeous four-inch touch screen, front- and rear-
facing cameras for video chatting and a passel of Google apps
and services. Its potential killer application is Near Field
Communication, a technology that allows it to read encoded
information from special chips that can be embedded in signs, on
T-shirts or other objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile Payments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting NFC support into Android is the biggest step yet
toward using the mobile phone as a way of paying for things. And
it comes at a time when Microsoft is still playing catch-up.
Having frittered away its early strength in smartphones, it
suffered a series of stumbles, including a line of youth-
oriented phones called Kin that it introduced this year and
pulled from the market after less than two months. Its latest
effort, the Windows Phone 7 operating system, is a great
improvement -- but still lacks such basics as cut-and-paste
functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s possible for Google and Apple to both succeed in
mobile phones. It&#8217;s harder to imagine Google and Microsoft both
thriving. Google&#8217;s business model, which calls for getting
manufacturers to use its operating system, is far closer to
Microsoft&#8217;s than to Apple&#8217;s strategy of making money on the sale
of proprietary hardware. And, of course, Google offers Android
to manufacturers at a price that Microsoft can&#8217;t beat: free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Android is all about limiting Microsoft&#8217;s future,
Chrome OS takes dead aim at its present: the Windows and Office
businesses that, in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, earned $6.7
billion of the company&#8217;s $7.1 billion in operating income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Cloud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance the Cr-48 -- Cr being the symbol for the
element chromium -- looks like a basic laptop. The differences
become evident once you turn it on. With no large programs or
device drivers to load, it boots in 15 seconds. The operating
system is, essentially, just a Web browser that you can never
close. Forget about a hard drive: Everything you use, all your
programs and all your data, reside in the cloud, on Google&#8217;s
distant servers. And it uses not a bit of Microsoft software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is Microsoft the only one threatened. What kind of chip
powers the Cr-48? Who cares? For the record, the Cr-48 has an
Atom microprocessor from Intel Corp., but it&#8217;s no more relevant
than what kind of chip powers your smartphone. How about makers
of flash memory chips, like Toshiba? A Chrome OS machine needs
little -- the Cr-48 has only 16 gigabytes -- since nothing is
stored on the computer itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useless Brick &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome completely commoditizes the hardware; the only
things that count are being connected to the Internet, and at
what speed. For now, that&#8217;s Chrome&#8217;s biggest weakness. While the
Cr-48 works either over a Wi-Fi network or its built-in Verizon
Wireless 3G service, you can&#8217;t always count on getting a
connection. On a cross-country flight this week, the Cr-48 was a
useless, inert brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, that isn&#8217;t likely to be a permanent
condition as Internet connections become ever more ubiquitous.
Some airlines, such as Virgin America Inc., have already started
rolling out onboard Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Chrome OS, like Android, is free, it&#8217;s logical to ask
what Google gets out of it. Company executives talk about the
benefits of tying users to Google services and gaining valuable
data to help refine its search algorithms. It remains to be seen
whether those users will be troubled by the privacy implications
and whether Google&#8217;s business model will work for manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&#8217;t help thinking that the real point of Chrome is
the threat it poses to Windows. From its founding, Google has
defined itself as the anti-Microsoft. Its &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221;
corporate mantra never needed to specify what it meant by
&#8220;evil,&#8221; because everyone already knew. The fact is, Google
doesn&#8217;t actually need Chrome OS to succeed. Microsoft, though,
desperately needs it to fail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. sold $876.45 million of bonds linked to U.S.
commercial real estate, pushing 2010 sales to $11.5 billion as
strategists forecast next year&#8217;s offerings will quadruple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property owners are pushing banks to offer better loan
terms as more lenders vie for a share of the $650 billion
commercial-mortgage bond market. Between 20 and 25 institutions
are seeking to originate loans they plan to package into
securities, up from about five competitors a year ago, New York-
based Standard  Poor&#8217;s said in a Dec. 2 report. Issuance
plunged to $3.4 billion in 2009 from a record $234 billion in
2007 after the financial crisis froze credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CMBS lenders came back quickly, and borrowers are
benefiting,&#8221; Greg Michaud, head of real estate finance at ING
Investment Management Americas in Atlanta, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;Twelve months ago, borrowers were happy to get
anything. Now they are really shopping around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s sale, tied mostly to payments on shopping center
and office-building loans, priced to yield 140 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate for a top-rated $376 million slice
maturing in 9.84 years, according to a person familiar with it.
The securities were initially marketed to yield between 130 and
135 basis points over swaps, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-Only Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs-Citigroup offering included a higher
percentage of so-called interest-only debt than sales earlier
this year, according to a Dec. 9 report from Fitch Ratings. Such
loans are considered riskier than mortgages that require the
landlord to pay down a portion of the principal. About 85.4
percent of the pool sold today pays principal during the life of
the loans, compared with more than 90 percent of offerings
earlier this year, Fitch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s deal still marks a &#8220;material improvement&#8221;
compared with those from the boom ended in 2007, according to
Fitch. That year, as much as 87 percent of commercial mortgages
packaged into bonds delayed principal payments for at least a
portion of the life of the loan, according to Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relaxing Underwriting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriting standards are usually the first metric to
loosen as lending rivalry increases, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
analysts said in a Nov. 24 report that forecast CMBS issuance
may reach $45 billion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The competition is healthy because it means you have more
dollars chasing these loans,&#8221; said Roger Lehman, an analyst at
BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. &#8220;Financing is a key
component of the recovery in commercial real estate. It&#8217;s not a
cash market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. commercial real estate values peaked in October 2007,
when the Moody&#8217;s Real/Commercial Property Price Index touched
191.9. The measure bottomed at 105.4 in August, marking a 45
percent drop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European gasoil barge differentials
declined as inventories of the heating fuel remained near their
highest level in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesel premiums to gasoil futures traded on London&#8217;s ICE
Futures Europe exchange rose even as BP Plc sold several lots.
Gasoil and gasoline cracks, a measure of refining profitability,
also advanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium unleaded gasoline barges for immediate loading in
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $823 to $827 a metric ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. That&#8217;s
up from yesterday&#8217;s deals at $819 to $825. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOT Trading AG sold three barges. Vitol Group and Total SA
were the main buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurobob grade barges changed hands earlier at $806 to $808
a ton, according to a survey of the Argus Bulletin Board. That&#8217;s
within yesterday&#8217;s trading range of $798 to $810 a ton. Ethanol
is added to Eurobob grade to make the finished fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gasoline crack, or premium to Brent crude, rose 15
cents to $4.55 a barrel. The crack declined to $4.40 a barrel
yesterday, its lowest level since Nov. 23, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunvor International BV sold a 12,500-ton cargo of naphtha
at $840 a ton to Glencore International AG, compared with a
trade at $832 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle Distillates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil barge differentials declined. Deals were struck at
discounts of $12 to $14 to January gasoil traded on the ICE
exchange. Barges traded at discounts $10 to $11.50 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low sulfur diesel rose to a premium of $19 to $21
over ICE gasoil, compared with yesterday&#8217;s premiums of $18.50 to
$20 a ton. BP sold seven barges. Mabanaft AG bought six lots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil for January delivery on the ICE exchange rose $1.50
to $769.75 a ton at 5:38 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil&#8217;s crack widened to $11.24 a barrel, up 32 cents from
yesterday. Brent for January fell 0.2 percent to $92.05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the jet fuel barge market, Glencore sold to Morgan
Stanley for the second consecutive day. The deal was struck at a
$60 premium to ICE gasoil or $4 higher than yesterday&#8217;s trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamoil SA, Libya&#8217;s overseas oil refiner, said it shut its
Cremona plant in Italy because of a malfunction in a section of
the facility, the company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery, which has the capacity to process about
95,000 barrels of oil a day, is scheduled to resume operations
on Dec. 22, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s drug regulator is reviewing
a class of medicines that includes Actelion Ltd.&#8217;s Tracleer and
Gilead Sciences Inc.&#8217;s Letairis after Pfizer Inc. pulled a
treatment from the market because it was linked to potentially
life-threatening liver damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs are used to treat pulmonary arterial
hypertension, a potentially fatal condition that causes high
blood pressure in the artery moving blood from the heart to the
lungs. Pfizer&#8217;s Thelin may have led to two cases of fatal liver
injury, the European Medicines Agency said in an e-mailed
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelin, Tracleer and Letairis, which is sold outside the
U.S. as Volibris, are known as endothelin receptor antagonists.
The drugs&#8217; toxicity to the liver may vary in intensity and
frequency, the agency said. GlaxoSmithKline Plc markets Volibris
outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use
will begin to review whether the drugs &#8220;remain a valuable
option in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension,&#8221; according
to the statement. Strict recommendations about dosing and
monitoring have to be followed, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roland Haefeli, a spokesman for Actelion in Allschwil,
Switzerland, declined to comment. A spokesman for Foster City,
California-based Gilead referred questions to London-based
Glaxo. Glaxo didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a voice message left
at the press office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Statement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No new patients should be prescribed Thelin and those
receiving it should be transferred to other therapies, Pfizer,
based in New York, said in a Dec. 10 statement. The company
halted trials of the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelin was sold in the EU, Canada and Australia. It&#8217;s not
approved in the U.S. The drug generated $44.4 million in the
first three quarters of 2010, said Pfizer spokesman Curtis
Allen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension is an incurable condition where
there is increased pressure in the arteries of the lungs,
causing shortness of breath, according to the National
Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actelion got about 85 percent of its revenue last year from
Tracleer, which has dominated the market for pulmonary arterial
hypertension since it won approval in 2001. The drug generated
1.51 billion Swiss francs ($1.56 billion) in sales in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other treatments for pulmonary hypertension include oxygen,
Pfizer&#8217;s Revatio, calcium channel blockers, which relax the
muscles in the wall of the blood vessels, and diuretics, which
lower the amount of water in the body, reducing the amount of
work the heart has to do, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asked to be
removed from two state underwriting teams in Massachusetts after
Neil Morrison, the firm&#8217;s Boston-based public-finance banker,
helped Treasurer Tim Cahill&#8217;s failed run for governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable investment bank,
has asked to be excluded from managing bond sales for the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and Massachusetts
Housing Finance Agency since October, according to state
officials. The New York-based firm has been senior banker on
about $7 billion of Massachusetts and agency bonds since 2001
and last was hired to sell securities for the government in
June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison, 36, was an unpaid adviser to Cahill in his run
for governor, according to Juli Sweeney, a campaign spokeswoman.
The banker &#8220;is no longer working for the firm,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said yesterday. He wouldn&#8217;t
comment on the withdrawals from Massachusetts bond-sale teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public-finance bankers are restricted from making political
contributions to an official of state and local issuers, which
includes a limit on volunteer help, according to industry
regulations. If bankers run afoul of the so-called pay-to-play
rules, a firm can be banned for two years from underwriting bond
offerings that the public official oversees or would control by
winning election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can give as much as $250 to a candidate in each
election without triggering the ban if they are eligible to vote
for the public official, the rule says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Matter of Minutes&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the time commitment,&#8221; said Christopher &#8216;Kit&#8217; Taylor, the former executive director of the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, which oversees the industry. &#8220;If
he was doing any of this on company time, he&#8217;s going to go over
the $250 limit in a matter of minutes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief executive officer,
created a committee to review the bank&#8217;s business standards in
May after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the
firm for fraud in April over the sale of a mortgage-linked
investment in 2007. In July, the bank paid $550 million to
settle the suit and in September it began a national advertising
campaign to repair its reputation. The company denied any
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison said he is &#8220;still employed at Goldman&#8221; in an e-
mail sent from a personal account on Dec. 14. He said he needed
the firm&#8217;s permission to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory filings last updated yesterday listed Morrison
as a Goldman Sachs employee. A first deputy treasurer when he
left Cahill&#8217;s office in 2007, Morrison joined the bank in July
2008 from Zurich-based UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Government Sachs&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many of the New York bank&#8217;s executives are former public
employees or have taken high-level government jobs that it
earned the nickname &#8220;Government Sachs.&#8221; Yesterday, the firm
said Kathleen Brown, its managing director in charge of winning
municipal-finance business on the West Coast, would move to a
new job in Chicago after her brother, Jerry Brown, won election
as California&#8217;s next governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cahill, 52, ran as an independent this year against
Democratic incumbent Deval Patrick and Republican Charlie Baker.
Paul Loscocco, Cahill&#8217;s running mate, quit the campaign before
the November election, citing differences over negative
advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Top Adviser &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loscocco said Morrison, &#8220;a former aide now at Goldman
Sachs,&#8221; was serving as a &#8220;top political adviser&#8221; to Cahill
and coordinating ads, according to an Oct. 8 statement. Loscocco
didn&#8217;t return calls seeking additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison, in a separate e-mail yesterday, referred
questions about his &#8220;nonexistent formal role with the Cahill
committee&#8221; to the campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Morrison was not employed by the campaign and served only
as an informal adviser,&#8221; Sweeney, the spokeswoman, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banker was also identified as a campaign &#8220;political
adviser&#8221; in a response to a lawsuit the Cahill campaign brought
in October against Strategic National Consulting LLC, the Grand
Rapids, Michigan, firm it hired. Copies of e-mails in documents
on file in the case show Morrison was communicating with the
consultants on behalf of Cahill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison E-Mails &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is to notify you that the Cahill campaign (&#8216;the
campaign&#8217;) accepts your offer,&#8221; Morrison wrote in one of the e-
mails in the documents. It was sent from a personal account to
John Yob, Strategic National&#8217;s chief executive officer, and John
Weaver, another paid Cahill adviser, on Aug. 13, 2010, a Friday,
at 3:31 p.m., regarding negotiations to lower their fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On behalf of the treasurer I want to let you know that we
are in receipt of this proposal and we are very appreciative of
the obvious good faith effort that you have put forward,&#8221;
Morrison said at 5:24 p.m. on Aug. 11 in an e-mail about fees.
&#8220;I will speak to Treasurer Cahill and get back to you with his
thoughts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yob didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment. Weaver declined to
comment when reached by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison joined the treasurer&#8217;s office in January 2003
after working on Cahill&#8217;s first campaign for the post in 2002.
The aide rose to first deputy and chief of staff three years
later, overseeing bond sales, the state pension fund and the
lottery, according to Cahill&#8217;s website. He left in 2007 to join
UBS and later went to Goldman Sachs, regulatory filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Councilor, Lawyer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before helping Cahill win the treasurer&#8217;s office, Morrison
was a city councilor in Taunton, a community of about 56,000
residents southwest of Boston. The graduate of Boston College
holds a law degree from Suffolk University in Boston, according
to information on the treasurer&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond dealers are prohibited &#8220;from engaging in municipal
securities business with issuers if certain political
contributions have been made to officials of such issuers,&#8221;
according to the MSRB&#8217;s Rule G-37. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers can volunteer on an issuer&#8217;s behalf, according to
the rulemaking board, which is based in Alexandria, Virginia.
They run afoul of G-37 rules if they use the bank&#8217;s resources or
incur company expenses while they volunteer, the regulator says
on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An employee of a dealer generally can donate his or her
time to an issuer official&#8217;s campaign without this being viewed
as a contribution by the dealer to the official, as long as the
employee is volunteering&#8221; during non-work hours and the dealer
isn&#8217;t paying the employee&#8217;s salary, the board&#8217;s website says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Contributions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made no contributions to state or local
public officials in Massachusetts through the first three
quarters of this year, according to regulatory filings. A
contribution can mean any &#8220;gift, subscription, loan, advance,
or deposit of money or anything of value,&#8221; according to the
rulemaking board. The firm&#8217;s next quarterly filing is due on
Jan. 31, said Ernesto Lanza, the board&#8217;s general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipal bond dealers can apply for a waiver if they
believe they may face an underwriting ban from the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, which enforces rulemaking board
regulations. Finra has granted G-37 exemptions, according to
letters on its website. Nancy Condon, an authority spokeswoman,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The volunteer stuff is tricky because people don&#8217;t always
understand their volunteer work has value,&#8221; said Julie Vasady-
Kovacs, a lawyer who specializes in political law at Kelley Drye
 Warren LLP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper Jaffray &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minnesota in 2005 banned Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray
Cos. from handling negotiated underwriting and financial
advisory work because of contributions by a municipal finance
professional that exceeded the G-37 limit, according to a press
report at the time. Banks may face fines if they serve as an
underwriter when they should have been banned from participating
in a bond sale, said Taylor, the former MSRB executive director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Boston, Goldman Sachs requested that it be removed from
the underwriting team at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority when contacted recently about managing a new bond
offering, according to Jonathan Davis, the agency&#8217;s chief
financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They asked more to be on the sidelines and not
participate in anything,&#8221; Davis said. He declined further
comment. The agency is controlled by the governor&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank made a similar request to the Massachusetts
Housing Finance Agency, which is overseen by a board appointed
by the governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MassHousing received a call from Goldman Sachs in October
in which they asked to be removed from all MassHousing bond
deals,&#8221; said Thomas J. Farmer, a spokesman for the state
agency, in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;After confirming that their
request had nothing to do with the credit quality of
MassHousing, we complied with their request.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has also managed state general-obligation
bond sales for the treasurer&#8217;s office and in June was the senior
banker on a $486.5 million issue by the Massachusetts Water
Pollution Abatement Trust, which is controlled by Cahill. David
Kibbe, a spokesman for Cahill, declined to comment on Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s status on the treasurer&#8217;s underwriting teams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest company by market capitalization, discovered oil in a
deep-water field in Brazil&#8217;s Santos Basin after hitting a dry
hole in the same block last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traces of oil were found in the well, known as Sabia-1, in
the BM-S-22 block, according to a posting on the website of
Brazil&#8217;s National Petroleum Regulator. Exxon last year failed to
find oil or natural gas at the Guarani well in the same block. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving, Texas-based Exxon said Nov. 11 that it started
drilling the well using Seadrill Ltd.&#8217;s West Polaris rig. The
well, which hasn&#8217;t yet been declared commercially viable, is in
the so-called pre-salt area of the Santos Basin where Tupi and
Libra, the two largest oil finds in the Americas in 34 years,
are located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are continuing to drill the well to its target depth,"
Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman in Houston, said today in an
e-mailed statement. "The details of our drilling program are
confidential." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Esso Exploracao Santos Brasileira Ltda. unit owns
40 percent of the block, Hess Brasil Petroleo Ltda. owns 40
percent and Petroleo Brasileiro SA owns 20 percent. The well&#8217;s
name is 3ESSO5SPS, according to the oil regulator. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Henry Meyer and Jonathan Stearns" date="Dec 16, 2010  9:40 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-16/eu-parliament-urges-visa-ban-over-russia-lawyer-death-update1-.html"><headline>EU Parliament Urges Visa Ban Over Russia Lawyer Death</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;European Union lawmakers called on
the 27-nation bloc to consider a visa ban on 60 Russian
officials allegedly linked to the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, in a move certain to create friction with Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 736-member European Parliament voted at a session in
Strasbourg, France, today to recommend that national governments
bar the officials in the absence of &#8220;positive moves&#8221; by
Russian authorities to investigate the lawyer&#8217;s death, at age
37, in November 2009, the assembly said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While EU nations are under no obligation to adopt the
recommendation, the vote came two days after politicians from
the U.S. and Europe cited Magnitsky&#8217;s case along with that of
jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky as a litmus test of
Russia&#8217;s pledges to improve the rule of law. Similar initiatives
to impose visa sanctions are under way in the U.S. and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dmitry Medvedev has made fighting corruption and
ending what he terms as &#8220;legal nihilism&#8221; one of his key
objectives as he seeks to attract foreign investors to reduce
Russia&#8217;s reliance on oil, gas and other raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending the &#8220;persecution&#8221; of Khodorkovsky and &#8220;finding
justice&#8221; for Magnitsky and other victims &#8220;would send positive
signals of change and show that Russia is indeed on the path
towards modernization,&#8221; said an open letter to Medvedev
published Dec. 14 in the Financial Times. The signatories
included former U.K. foreign ministers, David Miliband and
Malcolm Rifkind, ex-French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner and
New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermitage Capital &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnitsky, a lawyer advising London-based Hermitage Capital
Management Ltd., once the largest foreign investment fund in
Russia, died after almost a year in pre-trial detention during
which he said he was abused and denied medical treatment to
force him to drop fraud allegations against Russian officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khodorkovsky, the former head of Yukos Oil Co., faces up to
another 14 years in jail on oil theft charges in addition to the
eight years he&#8217;s serving for fraud. A Moscow court yesterday
postponed reading the verdict in the case until Dec. 27, during
the holidays when many foreign journalists leave Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khodorkovsky, once Russia&#8217;s richest man, has said his 2005
conviction was motivated by his opposition to Vladimir Putin,
who was president at the time of his 2003 arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Interference&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced earlier votes by
human rights committees in the European and Canadian parliaments
also urging sanctions over Magnitsky&#8217;s death as &#8220;interference&#8221;
in Russia&#8217;s internal affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfax cited an unnamed Foreign Ministry source as saying
that if the EU bans these Russian officials, there will be
&#8220;identical measures&#8221; taken by Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairwoman of the European Parliament&#8217;s Subcommittee on
Human Rights, Heidi Hautala, said today by e-mail that despite
coming under &#8220;heavy pressure&#8221; from Russian lawmakers and
officials, by passing the motion the assembly was &#8220;calling for
justice for an innocent man who died in prison.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., Senator Benjamin Cardin and Congressman James McGovern, both Democrats, introduced legislation on Sept. 29
that would freeze the assets of and ban visas for the officials
accused of involvement in Magnitsky&#8217;s death. Lawmakers in the
Canadian parliament also plan to introduce similar legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KGB Successor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermitage founder William Browder&#8217;s list of those
responsible for Magnitsky&#8217;s death includes officials from the
Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, the
Interior Ministry, the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, the Federal
Tax Service and the Federal Prison Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor General&#8217;s
Office is probing officials accused of involvement in
Magnitsky&#8217;s death. Alexander Bastrykin, who heads the panel,
said in a September interview with Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the
government&#8217;s official newspaper, that there was &#8220;no reason&#8221; to
believe Magnitsky&#8217;s death was connected to the activities of
those prosecuting the criminal case against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia last year put Browder on its international
&#8220;wanted&#8221; list, saying he and Magnitsky participated in tax
evasion that deprived the government of more than 500 million
rubles ($16 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermitage, which once had assets of $4 billion in Russia,
has denied wrongdoing, calling the charges retribution for
Magnitsky accusing Interior Ministry officials of stealing more
than $230 million of state funds. &lt;/p&gt;

distributor of beverages, was rated new &#8220;overweight&#8221; with a
12-month price estimate of 23.8 liras per share at JPMorgan. The
company was downgraded to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; with
its price estimate raised to 22 liras from 16.6 liras at HSBC
Holdings Plc. Coca-Cola Icecek was unchanged at 20 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enka Insaat  Sanayi AS (ENKAI TI): The Turkish builder
was raised to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221; at Citigroup Inc. Enka fell
for a second day, losing 4 kurus, or 0.7 percent, to 5.64 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finansbank AS, the Turkish bank owned by National Bank of
Greece SA, will apply to Turkey&#8217;s market and banking regulators
to sell as much as 255 million shares in a secondary public

yesterday. Finansbank rose 16 kurus, or 2.75 percent, to 5.98
liras, the highest close since Nov. 12. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. received a June trial
date for its lawsuit claiming that PepsiCo Inc.&#8217;s Trop50 brand
of fruit juices copies the patented and trademarked look of
Coca-Cola&#8217;s billion-dollar Simply juice line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-dress and patent infringement trial will begin
June 13, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake said today in Houston.
Coca-Cola&#8217;s request to permanently bar the sale of Trop50 in its
current packaging will be heard at the same time, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rules allow the court to consolidate a preliminary
injunction hearing with trial on the merits,&#8221; Lake said at a
scheduling hearing. &#8220;It makes sense to try this case once and
only once. And that&#8217;s going to be before a jury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola sued PepsiCo in October claiming that the new
packaging for the low-calorie Trop50 brand will &#8220;likely deceive
consumers and dilute the quality&#8221; of Coke&#8217;s own brand of
premium juices, called Simply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;PepsiCo chose packaging that closely mimics the
distinctive and nonfunctional Simply trade dress and patented
Simply closure, ostensibly to revitalize PepsiCo&#8217;s fledgling
Trop50 brand,&#8221; Coca-Cola&#8217;s lawyers said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade-Dress Rights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coke has no protectable trade-dress rights,&#8221; PepsiCo
lawyers said in a court filing. &#8220;Nor is there any likelihood of
confusion between Trop50 and the Simply juice products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake told lawyers for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo that they
should try to settle the dispute out of court to avoid the
expense of trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy Durst, a lawyer for Purchase, New York-based
PepsiCo, told the judge that the parties would be &#8220;revisiting
opportunities for mediation in January.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for PepsiCo and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola declined to
comment after the 20-minute hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola introduced its Simply line in 2001 with Simply
Orange. Simply Grapefruit and other varieties followed. The
design is carafe-style with an oversized cap or closure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo began selling the Trop50 line in 2009. In August,
it introduced the new design, which is a clear plastic carafe-
style bottle with a large cap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of the Simply line grew from $650 million during the
period from 2001 to 2005 to more than $2.4 billion from 2006 to
2009, Coca-Cola said in court papers. It estimates sales this
year at more than $1 billion. Coca-Cola said it has spent more
than $160 million marketing the brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Simply line is managed by Coca-Cola&#8217;s Minute Maid unit,
based in Sugar Land, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo rose 22 cents, or 0.33 percent, to $65.97 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Coca-Cola climbed 36
cents, or 0.55 percent, to $65.70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Coca-Cola Co. v. PepsiCo Inc., 10-04184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Walt Disney Co. union that&#8217;s
seeking a new labor agreement for some of the entertainment
company&#8217;s hotel workers is proposing executive pay curbs,
singling out board member Fred Langhammer for criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unite Here is asking shareholders to limit senior
executives to one eligibility test for stock awards, according a
regulatory filing. The group is also seeking to curb potential
severance payments for executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, will hold its annual
meeting on March 23 in Salt Lake City. Current policy at Disney
allows executives up to three eligibility tests for stock
awards, Unite Here said. Langhammer, head of the compensation
committee since 2008, also had a hand in pay at American
International Group Inc. as a director from January 2006 until
he resigned in 2008, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During this period, AIG endured criticism for showering
large bonuses and lavish junkets on top executives as the
company imploded,&#8221; the union, which represents Disneyland hotel
workers, said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney offered a package that includes wage increases, paid
sick leave and health care, John Nicoletti, a spokesman for
Disneyland in Anaheim, California, said today in an interview.
Of 31 Disneyland unions, only Unite Here hasn&#8217;t reached an
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is another publicity stunt from Local 11 leadership
to distract from the fact that after three years their members
are still without a contract,&#8221; Nicoletti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langhammer didn&#8217;t respond to a phone request for comment
left at Estee Lauder Cos., where he is chairman of global
affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-Test Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG, based in New York, was once the world&#8217;s largest
insurer. It was pushed to the brink of collapse in 2008 as
investments tied to the housing market soured. The company
accepted a U.S. government rescue that has swelled in value to
$182.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fiscal 2008 and 2009, Disney allowed senior executives
to re-test whether they should receive performance-based stock
grants using different criteria, the union said in the filing.
That delinks pay from company performance, Unite Here said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s compensation committee in fiscal 2009 voted to
allow executives three tests, according to the filing. Only one
re-test was performed in calendar 2010, the union said, citing
earlier Disney regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is currently no guarantee that Disney will not
introduce more re-testing opportunities in future years,&#8221; the
union said. &#8220;Disney should better tie compensation to
performance by implementing a policy disallowing re-tests.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, rose 4 cents to
$37.05 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. trade agency will consider
whether imports of Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Xbox gaming system should
be barred after Motorola Inc.&#8217;s Mobility unit said that it
infringes patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Trade Commission in Washington today said
it would investigate the complaint filed last month by Motorola
Mobility. Notice of the investigation was posted on the agency&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, filed a
lawsuit on Nov. 9 accusing Motorola of breaching contractual
obligations to fairly license patents on wireless networking and
video coding to be used in the Xbox. A day later, Motorola filed
patent-infringement complaints in Florida and Wisconsin. The ITC
case contains allegations similar to those filed in Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said Motorola is demanding patent royalties
that are &#8220;wholly disproportionate to the royalty rate that its
patents should command under any reasonable calculus.&#8221; Motorola
has said the demand was a &#8220;fair offer&#8221; that Microsoft refused
to accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC is a quasi-judicial agency that investigates
allegations of unfair trade practices and has the power to ban
imports of products found to infringe U.S. patents. It typically
completes its investigations in about 15 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is in the Matter of Certain Gaming and
Entertainment Consoles, 337-752, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
seeks billions of dollars from JPMorgan Chase  Co., said the
bank and Chairman James Dimon helped cause its collapse and
can&#8217;t hide behind laws that protect lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan forced Lehman to give guarantees that stripped the
firm of working capital in the 2008 financial crisis, Lehman
said Dec. 15 while asking a U.S. bankruptcy judge to let its
lawsuit proceed. JPMorgan should return $8.6 billion in cash and
pay tens of billions more in damages, Lehman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s defense hinges on so-called safe harbor laws,
which allow clearing banks to take collateral from securities
dealers without getting sued if they fail. Lehman says the laws
protected New York-based JPMorgan only when it cleared trades
for Lehman&#8217;s failing brokerage. JPMorgan wasn&#8217;t a clearing bank
for the parent company, so the guarantees can be reversed,
Lehman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Bankruptcy Code doesn&#8217;t shelter &#8220;guarantees
entered into for less than reasonably equivalent value when the
debtor was insolvent or undercapitalized,&#8221; Lehman said in its
filing in Manhattan. Under the code, debtors can undo some asset
transfers completed shortly before a bankruptcy filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A victory for Lehman would help its creditors, who stand to
get an average of 15.8 cents on the dollar. JPMorgan, the
second-largest U.S. bank, reported third-quarter net income of
$4.42 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank says the guarantees can&#8217;t be reversed. Safe-harbor
laws &#8220;present an insurmountable legal obstacle to Lehman&#8217;s
lawsuit,&#8221; JPMorgan told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck in
court papers while twice asking him to dismiss the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Some Advantages&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck, who is handling Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy, previously ruled
against Lehman creditors who claimed their rights trumped safe-
harbor laws. The laws govern the $467 trillion market for swaps
and repurchase agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges think &#8220;all creditors should be equal in bankruptcy,
but the safe harbor says some have advantages,&#8221; said Guy Dempsey, a lawyer with Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in New York
who specializes in derivatives and bank regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., ordered by Peck to pay $590 million
to Lehman, said this week it appealed his ruling to a higher
court. Metavante Corp. also appealed before deciding to settle
with Lehman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, once the fourth-largest investment bank, failed in
September 2008 because of risky real estate bets and too much
debt, which it tried to hide from investors, according to
bankruptcy examiner Anton Valukas&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sued Lehman on Dec. 1, saying the firm promised to
pay back $70 billion in loans and instead saddled the lender
with $25 billion, backed by &#8220;toxic securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adversary case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jet fuel&#8217;s premium to January gasoil
futures traded on London&#8217;s ICE Futures Europe exchange rose for
the third consecutive day. Gasoil crack, a measure of refining
profitability, advanced to more than $12 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium unleaded gasoline barges for immediate loading in
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $827 and $829 a metric
ton, according to traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That&#8217;s up
from $823 to $827 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil ASA sold to Total SA in both deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurobob grade barges changed hands at $795 to $810 a ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring Platts
and the Argus Bulletin Board. That&#8217;s wider than yesterday&#8217;s
trading range at $806 to $808 a ton. Ethanol is added to Eurobob
grade to make the finished fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gasoline crack, or premium to Brent, dropped to $4.75 a
barrel from $4.80 a barrel yesterday, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle Distillates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetco, a unit of Hess Corp., sold one jet fuel barge to
Vitol SA at a premium of $61 a ton to January ICE gasoil. That&#8217;s
a $1 gain from yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil for January delivery on ICE dropped $2.25 to $767 a
ton at 5:21 p.m. local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gasoil remains surprisingly weak, given the continued
cold weather,&#8221; JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts led by New York-
based Lawrence Eagles said in a research note dated yesterday.
&#8220;However, strength in the diesel and jet fuel markets has seen
differentials to gasoil futures widen on a prompt and forward
basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil&#8217;s crack, or its premium to Brent crude, widened to
$11.94 a barrel, up 40 cents from yesterday. It earlier rose to
a high of $12.13, the highest since Dec. 7. Brent crude for
February was little changed at $91.67 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frigid weather across much of Europe in recent days has
bolstered home heating oil demand,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &#8220;We may yet
see a prolonged period of cold weather reignite consumer
interest in January.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian fuel oil production rose in November to the highest
level in at least three years, according to the Energy Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s refineries produced 6.18 million tons of fuel
oil last month, the Energy Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. That&#8217;s 5.4 percent more than the previous month
and up 9.6 percent on the same month a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. plans a full halt of its 119,000 barrels-
-a-day Fos refinery in southern France in January for about six
weeks of maintenance, according to a person with direct

&lt;p&gt;Processing units will begin to shut around Jan. 10, and
start-up is expected at the end of February, the person said,

&lt;p&gt;Statoil ASA bought a cargo of North
Sea Forties crude from Mercuria Energy Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria sold Statoil a shipment due to load on Jan. 6 to
Jan. 8 at a discount of 5 cents to the Dated Brent benchmark,
according to traders involved in North Sea transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during

days in the future cost 10 cents less than Dated Brent, compared
with a discount of 15 cents the previous day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude for February settlement traded at $91.56 a

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy call options
that expire soon while selling contracts expiring later on
potential merger or acquisition targets like Akamai Technologies
Inc. and EOG Resources Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists Maria Grant and Katherine Fogertey
recommended using the strategy on Akamai and EOG, as well as
Allergan Inc., Joy Global Inc., DirecTV and EMC Corp., because
the potential that the companies may be bought &#8220;is not being
adequately priced into&#8221; the options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have seen an increased focus on MA potential in the
options market over the course of 2010, as investors have become
more comfortable with the economic backdrop in the U.S. and MA
volumes have begun to accelerate,&#8221; Grant and Fogertey, who are
based in New York, wrote in a note today. &#8220;For the companies
our analysts view as the most likely MA candidates, we have
started to see evidence of a modest amount of pre-positioning
for MA with options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced takeovers involving a U.S. company have risen to
$910.8 billion year to date, compared with $804.2 billion in all
of 2009, while the number of deals this year is up to 9,133 from
7,691, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Using options to
bet on buyouts makes sense because target companies soar by an
average of 35 percent after merger announcements, Grant wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai Strangles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant recommended buying February $52.50 calls on Akamai
while selling both the January 2012 $40 put and $65 call, a
strategy known as a &#8220;strangle&#8221; that profits from falling
volatility. For EOG, she recommended buying April $95 calls
while selling the January 2012 $80 put and $120 call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based supplier of
software and services to make websites load faster, has a &#8220;high
probability&#8221; of being acquired at a premium of about 20 percent
because its business model is &#8220;attractive&#8221; to the biggest
telecommunications and technology companies, the report said,
citing Goldman Sachs Software analyst Derek Bingham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EOG, the Houston-based oil and gas producer, may attract a
19 percent premium amid increased consolidation in the industry
next year, the report said, citing analyst Brian Singer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brian believes the combination of a multiyear downturn in
returns for gas-focused EPs and continued attractiveness of US
oil/gas shale assets will lead to greater corporate
consolidation in the next two years,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;While
he still expects more joint ventures in natural gas, he also
sees the potential for a pickup in corporate sellers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy a security for a certain
amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the right
to sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in
the price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves
or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker
who conspired to fix prices on municipal-bond investment
contracts said he was aided by a Minnesota company that ran
auctions for the deals on behalf of public agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Hertz, 53, who admitted fraud and conspiracy charges,
said Sound Capital Management Inc., an Eden Prairie-based
financial adviser to local governments, told him what a
competitor bid so he could adjust his offer and win the deal,
according to a transcript of his plea hearing Nov. 30. The
charges say Hertz received tips about other bids from &#8220;Broker
E,&#8221; an unidentified Minnesota firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound Capital was one of at least three financial advisers
that federal agents raided in 2006. The action was part of a
national investigation of a conspiracy among banks to carve up
the market for investments made with money that public agencies
raise in the $2.8 trillion municipal-bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department hasn&#8217;t accused Sound Capital of
wrongdoing. Johan Rosenberg, the company&#8217;s chief executive, said
he has no indication that anyone at the firm will face charges
and disputed Hertz&#8217;s characterization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every situation can be interpreted two ways,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Sound Capital continues to stand by its practices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg is also chief executive of DerivActiv LLC, a firm
that values derivatives for municipalities and non-profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former employees of UBS AG, CDR Financial Products Inc. and
two other brokers for local governments have pleaded guilty to
running sham auctions for investments that delivered banks money
at taxpayers&#8217; expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigger Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz testified that information from Sound Capital boosted
JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This resulted in JPMorgan Chase being awarded the
contract at an increased profit,&#8221; he said during his court
appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz didn&#8217;t return a message left at his home in Cranford,
New Jersey. He is cooperating with the investigation, according
to a Nov. 30 Justice Department news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment. She said in a Nov. 30 e-mail that JPMorgan fired Hertz
in 2007 when he failed to cooperate with the bank&#8217;s internal
investigation of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the federal probe, advisers have admitted to
receiving kickbacks from bankers in return for steering
investment work their way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight people have admitted to participating in the
conspiracy, including a former banker with Bank of America
Corp., and nine others are fighting charges. Bank of America
this month agreed to pay $137 million to settle state and
federal investigations into the reinvestment business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation centers on investments that
municipalities buy with money raised by selling bonds. The
investments, known as guaranteed investment contracts, allow
them to earn a return until the cash is needed for schools,
roads or other public works. The contracts can be awarded on
several factors, including dollar amounts, interest rates
offered or an investment&#8217;s duration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department encourages competitive bidding
to ensure that localities aren&#8217;t receiving below-market returns.
Overcharges also cost the federal government, because it
requires localities to return some earnings on the investment of
tax-exempt-bond proceeds to the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the charges against Hertz, the government says he
conspired with Broker E, which it said worked for local
governments across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his court appearance, Hertz said Sound Capital
helped him boost his earnings on a 2004 investment agreement,
whose purchaser wasn&#8217;t identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bidding to win the contract was decided by which bank
would provide the agreement with earliest termination. After he
submitted the winning bid, Sound Capital let him revise it to
extend the maturity closer to that of the second-highest bidder,
which made the contract more profitable to the bank, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I did this with full knowledge that it would defraud the
government,&#8221; Hertz said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will collaborate
with China Mobile Communications Corp., parent of the world&#8217;s
biggest phone carrier by market value, on developing
technologies including cloud computing for Chinese businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software company, and China
Mobile also will partner on information services for businesses,
wireless devices, sales and distribution after signing a
memorandum of understanding in Beijing today, according to a
joint statement sent by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are betting that businesses in the world&#8217;s
fastest-growing major economy will increase spending on
computing services and applications accessed through the
Internet instead of through individual corporate servers.
International Business Machines Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. also
are boosting development of the cloud services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By March, 90 percent of Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft&#8217;s engineers will be working on cloud-related products,
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-owned China Mobile Communications owns 74 percent of
Hong Kong-listed China Mobile Ltd., which has more than 500
million mobile-phone users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, plans to spend $20 billion

cloud computing, Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano said in

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., the San
Francisco-based lender that doubled its size by buying Wachovia
Corp. during the credit crisis, passed JPMorgan Chase  Co. to
become the largest U.S. bank by stock-market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s market capitalization rose to $157.6 billion
at the close of New York trading yesterday, surpassing
JPMorgan&#8217;s $156.4 billion. Wells Fargo is ranked fourth by
assets and deposits, while JPMorgan is second behind Bank of
America Corp. and New York-based Citigroup Inc. is third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, 57, has used
acquisitions to fuel growth at Wells Fargo. The lender completed
more than 55 purchases in the past five years, led by its $12.7
billion takeover of Wachovia in October 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Wells Fargo had $622.4 billion in assets
in the quarter before it purchased Wachovia. It held $1.2
trillion in assets at the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo rose 0.8 percent yesterday to $30.02 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
advanced 11 percent this year, compared with a loss of 4 percent
at JPMorgan. The biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo is Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with a 6.4 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, had
outperformed peers through Oct. 21 in part because it faces
fewer mortgage-repurchase demands from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac
and private investors, FBR Capital Markets Corp. analysts led by
Paul Miller wrote in a report that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repurchase Demands &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, in a Nov. 29 report, Miller said repurchase
demands combined could cost financial institutions $54 billion
to $106 billion. Any total losses suffered by Wells Fargo will
be outpaced by those at JPMorgan and Bank of America, Miller
estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday wasn&#8217;t the first time Wells Fargo has been the
top bank by market value. On May 12, Wells Fargo passed Bank of
America as the most valuable U.S. bank before the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based company passed it on May 18, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan has held the lead for most of the
last two years, except for the five-month period between
February and July of this year when it repeatedly traded places
with Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said a pilot project to boost production by
injecting steam into an oil field shared between Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait showed &#8220;very promising&#8221; results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is trying to boost production from the Wafra field
in the so-called Neutral Zone shared between the two countries
by as much as 600,000 barrels a day once a new method for
injecting steam is applied on a large scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have 16 steam-injection wells in the field and I can
tell you that the results that came out were very promising,&#8221;
Ganesh Thakur, Chevron&#8217;s vice president and global adviser for
reservoir management, told an industry conference today in
Dharan, Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wafra field will become the world&#8217;s largest project for
oil recovery with steam injection, once the company applies it
to the entire field, Thakur said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron began injecting steam at the site in June 2009 to
extract more crude. The San Ramon, California-based company is
still testing the steam-flooding technology on a small part of
the Wafra field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of the pilot project is $340 million and to apply
the technology to the entire field would cost several billion
dollars, Gary Greaser, an assistant to the Chevron president,
told Bloomberg on Oct. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to apply the technology to the entire field
will be made in 2013, Greaser said. &lt;/p&gt;

fell 1.7 percent to 218,700 barrels a day from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural-gas output for export declined to 570 million
standard cubic meters in the same month from 680 million a year

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, will recall about 19,000 bottles of Lipitor tablets
distributed in the U.S. after a customer reported a musty odor
from bottles in which the drug was packaged, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odor is consistent with the presence of a chemical
called TBA that is linked to a wood preservative used in
shipping pallets, the New York-based company said today in a
statement posted on its website. The bottles containing 40-
milligram tablets of the cholesterol medicine, the world&#8217;s best-
selling drug, were from a third-party supplier, Pfizer said in
its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth Lipitor recall since August because of
complaints of an uncharacteristic odor, the company said in the
statement, bringing the total number bottles to 388,000. Pfizer
bans shipping its medicines on pallets made of wood preserved
with the chemical 2, 4, 6-tribromonophenol that caused the odor,
the company said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have identified the source of the odor, and we are
enacting rigorous measures to prevent odor-related issues going
forward,&#8221; Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same chemical was cited in recalls of Johnson 
Johnson&#8217;s Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicines earlier
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower state and local spending,
which accounts for 12 percent of the national economy, may
reduce U.S. gross domestic product growth by about half a
percentage point next year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipal budgets will likely increase by no more than 1
percent in 2011 after adjusting for inflation as local
governments receive less state aid and home-price declines put a
drag on property-tax collections, the bank said in a note to
clients. That is about 2 percentage points less than average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;State and local governments will continue to face
substantial budget pressures for the time being,&#8221; wrote Andrew Tilton, a New York-based economist, in the Dec. 17 note.
&#8220;Factors including, but not limited to, the lagged effect of
lower house prices will limit the growth of spending.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing prices have fallen almost 30 percent since their
height in April 2006, according to the Case-Shiller 20-city
index. States, which will lose most federal stimulus funds next
year, are faced with closing $134 billion in budget gaps in
fiscal 2012, according to a Dec. 16 report of the Washington-
based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. State tax
collections are 12 percent below pre-recession levels, the
report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowing Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipal employment, which has fallen by about 2 percent
since late 2008 -- compared with more than 5 percent in the
private sector -- is likely to fall &#8220;a bit further&#8221; before
stabilizing in 2011, Goldman Sachs said. Large layoffs may be
avoided if localities raise real estate taxes to offset declines
in assessed property values, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipalities are also likely to face higher borrowing
costs because of the potential end of the taxable Build America
Bonds program, which offers a 35 percent federal subsidy on
interest payments. Expiration of the program may cut the pool of
investors as borrowers revert to traditional tax-exempt issues,
boosting yields, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Build America Bonds program wasn&#8217;t part of the $858
billion tax-cut plan the Senate passed last week. John Mica, the
Florida Representative who will head the House Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee next session, said last week he
planned to introduce a &#8220;reincarnation&#8221; of the program in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same report, Goldman Sachs researchers boosted their
economic growth forecasts for 2011 and 2012 after Congress
signed the tax plan. The economy will grow 3.4 percent in 2011
and 3.8 percent in 2012, compared with previous estimates of 2.7
percent and 3.6 percent, the report said. The 0.5 percentage-
point drag on the economy caused by state and local budget cuts
was factored into the forecast, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund
appointed an independent panel to review the fund&#8217;s risk-
management framework that will be led by Guillermo Ortiz, former
governor of the Bank of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-member panel also includes JPMorgan Chase  Co.
International Chairman Jacob Frenkel, Deutsche Bank Group Vice
Chairman Malcolm Knight and Thomas O&#8217;Neill, former chief
executive officer of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting and
former member of the IMF&#8217;s audit committee, the Washington-based
IMF said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The review is intended to provide an objective and expert
assessment of all aspects of the fund&#8217;s risk management
framework --- the processes used to identify, evaluate and
mitigate potential risks to the Fund and its operations,&#8221; the
fund said in a statement released in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel will set its own scope and timeline, taking into
account the IMF&#8217;s &#8220;unique role in the international financial
system, particularly its surveillance activities and
responsibilities as a lender of last resort,&#8221; the IMF said. Its
focus will be a risk-management framework set up in 2007, the
fund said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group of 20 nations have turned to the IMF to help develop
a system for monitoring currencies and trade imbalances, in
hopes of identifying problem areas before they grow into full-
fledged crises. The IMF also has worked this year with the
European Union to craft rescue packages for Greece and Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has said the IMF
will play a &#8220;critical role&#8221; in efforts to overhaul the global
financial system and shore up the world economy. &#8220;It is
ultimately the responsibility of countries to act, but the IMF
must speak out effectively about challenges and marshal support
for action,&#8221; he said at the IMF&#8217;s annual meetings in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank, bought the former offices of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in London&#8217;s Canary Wharf district for 495 million
pounds ($769 million) to use as its investment bank&#8217;s European
headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased the 1 million square-foot (93,000
square-meter) building at 25 Bank Street and extended an
agreement to develop a nearby site, seller Canary Wharf Group
Plc said today in a statement. The bank will also buy 60
Victoria Embankment, a City of London property that it has
leased since 1991, New York-based JPMorgan said in a separate
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A large bank such as JPMorgan needs to have the majority
of its European operations based in London,&#8221; said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. &#8220;It&#8217;s just
not practical for them to move the business elsewhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which employs more than 11,000 people in the U.K.
capital, is moving to Canary Wharf in 2012 from the City of
London financial district, where its investment bank staff is
scattered across four properties. The switch will increase the
number of people working on the entire 97-acre (39-hectare)
Canary Wharf estate to more than 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is paying 41 percent more than the value given to
the tower by Canary Wharf as of June 30. The difference equals
about three years of rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The opportunity for our investment bank to be located in
one state-of-the-art building allows us to upgrade our
operational capabilities and maintain our strong position in the
region,&#8221; Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songbird Rises &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songbird Estates Plc, the majority owner of Canary Wharf,
advanced the most in more than five weeks in London trading. The
shares gained 3.5 pence, or 2.6 percent, to 139 pence. That was
the most since Nov. 12 when the shares rose 2.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K.-based banks have threatened to move abroad because of
rising taxes and tighter regulation. Barclays Plc and HSBC
Holdings Plc said in September they may move headquarters if the
government decides to break up the banks. Standard Chartered Plc
said in August it may quit London if new taxes are imposed on
lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a tremendous coup for London,&#8221; London Mayor
Boris Johnson said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Banking is one of
the few global industries in which we truly excel. JPMorgan&#8217;s
commitment to London will help ensure the capital retains its
position as a banking powerhouse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riverside South &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is continuing to work with Canary Wharf Group to
develop the Riverside South site that it previously planned to
use as headquarters for all its London employees. It bought the
site in November 2008 and by next year will have invested more
than 300 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canary Wharf will now have the right to make the first
offer to buy the site. Previously it had the exclusive option to
buy it at a fixed price. The development agreement has been
extended to 2016 from 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canary Wharf will also receive 144.5 million pounds from
AIG International Group Inc., the U.S. insurer that had to be
rescued by the U.S. government, to cancel a commitment to insure
Lehman&#8217;s rental payments for up to four years in the event of
default, the developer said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG posted 224 million pounds of collateral in March last
year, after its credit rating was lowered, in case Lehman
defaulted. Nomura International Plc, which bought Lehman&#8217;s
European operations, exercised an option to vacate the building
effective Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canary Wharf &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canary Wharf&#8217;s combined receipts from JPMorgan and AIG of
639.5 million pounds compares with a book value of 550 million
pounds as of June 30, according to Songbird&#8217;s semi-annual
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks a very good deal for Canary Wharf on the face of
it,&#8221; Robbie Duncan, an analyst at Nomura, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It shows they are both quite bullish about the
London office market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building was built in 2003 for Lehman on a 30-year
lease. The securities firm filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history when it failed in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. said it resumed
output from the Oso field in Nigeria more than a month after its
gas and condensate platform there was attacked by militants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have restarted 15,000 barrels per day of condensate
from the Oso field,&#8221; spokesman Ozemoya Okordion said in an e-
mailed response to questions today. &#8220;No firm time for restart
of natural gas liquids production is available at this time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production of about 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day
was shut at the platform as a &#8220;precaution&#8221; after eight workers
were kidnapped in the attack, Exxon Mobil said on Nov. 16. The
Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, the main armed
group in the region, claimed responsibility for the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troops raided militant camps on Nov. 17 and freed hostages
taken in attacks on the Exxon facility, including those of Royal
Dutch Shell Plc&#8217;s local unit and Afren Plc, the army said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attacks by armed groups in the delta cut Nigeria&#8217;s oil
production by more than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon
Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni SpA run joint
ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.
that pump more than 90 percent of the West African nation&#8217;s oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s Nigerian unit suspended oil output through its
Dibi-Abiteye pipeline in the delta after an attack by a militant
group on Dec. 17 caused a &#8220;breach,&#8221; a company spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The breach is being investigated and we are reviewing our
operations,&#8221; Scott Walker said today in an e-mailed statement.
He didn&#8217;t give details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Niger Delta Liberation Force claimed responsibility for
attacks on three oil flow stations in Nigeria&#8217;s Delta State
belonging to Chevron Corp. and Eni SpA&#8217;s local unit, a spokesman
for the group said in an e-mailed statement on Dec. 18. Eni
officials didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s largest oil producer and fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, completed a planned turnaround at its Beaumont
refinery in Texas, said Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery was undergoing maintenance on a hydrocracker,
catalytic reformer, de-ethanizer and other units at the refinery
since September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplanned and planned refinery outages can increase prices
for refined products as refiners turn to spot markets to help
them meet supply contracts. Operational disruptions can also
depress prices for crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant can process almost 360,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s top
executives view investment banking as having the best prospects
next year and expect fixed-income to pick up as well, according
to Nomura Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura in New York, described
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s view of the market in a note to investors
following a meeting with Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, and Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, makes most of its money trading fixed-income,
currencies and commodities, known as FICC. Yet it&#8217;s the
investment-banking business, which includes mergers and
acquisitions and underwriting stocks and bonds, that may show
the fastest growth next year, Goldman executives told Schorr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman remains reasonably bullish on the outlook for
investment-banking activity in 2011,&#8221; Schorr said. &#8220;In fact,
Lloyd listed investment banking as the business that he&#8217;s most
confident in as we close out 2010.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm ranks second to Morgan Stanley among global
mergers and acquisitions announced in 2010 and is third after
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co. among managers of equity
and equity-linked offerings worldwide this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In a year of record high-yield debt
underwriting, Goldman ranks sixth, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue Sources &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banking accounted for about 11 percent of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue in the first nine months of 2010,
whereas FICC comprised 51 percent of revenue in the period.
Blankfein and Viniar said FICC trading may pick up next year
because the market&#8217;s view on interest rates and inflation are
likely to change at some point, Schorr wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When changes in perception occur on these fronts, it
typically leads to a flurry of activity,&#8221; Schorr wrote. In
addition, wide day-to-day swings in prices &#8220;usually happen
before a big turn in the market, which will then lead to a
pickup in activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory changes, such as the Volcker rule&#8217;s ban on
proprietary trading and new capital requirements, may reduce
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s return on equity to a number below the firm&#8217;s
previous peak, Schorr estimated. He said that Blankfein and
Viniar didn&#8217;t agree that regulations will definitely reduce
returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Management feels like there are still a lot of moving
parts, so they are not ready to concede that future returns will
necessarily be a lot lower than the past,&#8221; Schorr wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which had $231 million of Irish government
obligations at the end of September, doesn&#8217;t face much direct
exposure to European sovereign debt problems, Schorr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &#8220;we do think management has concerns regarding the
impact that stresses in Europe could have on the macro economy
and funding costs around the globe,&#8221; Schorr wrote. &#8220;If there
was a sovereign restructuring (which we think seems hard to
avoid at some point), funding costs would rise around the globe
and be a drag on the global financial system,&#8221; Schorr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schorr recommends buying Goldman Sachs stock, which he
predicts will reach a price target of $180 from its $164.04
close on Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expects the firm to earn $7.65 billion, or $13.10 a
share, for the full year, down from $12.2 billion, or $22.13, a
year earlier. Schorr&#8217;s earnings estimate is below the $8.39
billion, or $13.74 a share, average estimate of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard, the trustee
liquidating Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s failed investment firm, will
collect $7.2 billion from the estate of philanthropist Jeffry
Picower, bringing to $9.8 billion the amount collected for
victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, the largest in U.S.
history, claimed losses of principal totaling $20 billion and
paper losses -- including fake profits -- of about $65 billion.
Picard has filed lawsuits during the past two years seeking the
&#8220;clawback&#8221; of more than $50 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picower&#8217;s estate will pay $5 billion to Picard and $2.2
billion to U.S. authorities to resolve claims that he profited
from the fraud, according to separate statements Dec. 17 from
Picard and the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.
The settlement, for the amount Picard sought, would be the
biggest so far. He had already recovered $2.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picower, 67, a billionaire, had a heart attack and drowned
in his swimming pool in Palm Beach, Florida, in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picower, his family and related entities, beginning in the
1970s, deposited $619.4 million with Madoff and took out $7.8
billion, according to a forfeiture complaint filed Dec. 17 by
Bharara as part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Zabel, an attorney for Picower&#8217;s widow, Barbara,
didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Picower, 09-1197, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Dell Worker Says He Leaked to Guidepoint Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Dell Inc. Global Supply Manager Daniel DeVore told a
judge last week that he leaked inside information to clients of
Guidepoint Global LLC, a consulting and research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeVore made the comment as part of his Dec. 10 guilty plea
in Manhattan federal court in which he admitted leaking tips to
clients of Primary Global Research, another research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I also provided material non-public information to
clients of Guidepoint and Vista,&#8221; he told U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff, according to the transcript of his plea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidepoint, a so-called expert-networking firm, acquired
Vista Research Inc. from Standard  Poor&#8217;s on May 21, 2009,
according to a statement on Guidepoint&#8217;s website. Calls for
comment to a spokesman for New York-based Guidepoint weren&#8217;t
immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 16, federal prosecutors arrested a Primary Global
sales manager, James Fleishman, and three employees of
technology companies who also worked as consultants for Mountain
View, California-based PGR in a widening crackdown on insider
trading. Prosecutors also announced DeVore&#8217;s guilty plea, a
transcript of which was made public Dec. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Shimoon, 10-mj-2823, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Jefferies Money Manager Gets Six-Year Term &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Contorinis, the former Jefferies Paragon Fund money
manager convicted in an insider-trading scheme that prosecutors
said netted more than $7 million in illegal profits, was
sentenced to six years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a crime that does damage to the national
economy,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in New York said
Dec. 17 as he sentenced Contorinis. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important to
send a message through the sentence imposed on you.&#8221; He also
ordered Contorinis to forfeit as much as $13 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contorinis was convicted by a federal jury in Manhattan in
October of securities fraud and conspiracy. Jurors found that he
illegally traded on inside merger tips supplied by Nicos
Stephanou, an investment banker who was the government&#8217;s chief
witness in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanou, who was an associate director of mergers and
acquisitions at Zurich-based UBS AG, passed along tips to
Contorinis from 2004 to 2006, according to testimony at the
trial. He was on the UBS team advising Cerberus Capital
Management LP, part of the group trying to buy Albertsons Inc.
in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanou pleaded guilty in the case and testified against
Contorinis in exchange for leniency. He testified that he told
Contorinis and other friends about pending deals, including the
acquisition of Albertsons, which was then the second-biggest
U.S. grocer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Contorinis, 09-cr-01083, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia Court Sets Aside James Hardie Director Fines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Australian appeals court set aside fines and suspensions
levied on James Hardie Industries NV former non-executive
directors over a misleading statement the company issued
regarding compensation for asbestos victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Securities  Investments Commission failed
to prove that the directors passed a resolution in 2001
approving the release of a statement to the Australian Stock
Exchange, or ASX, claiming the company&#8217;s asbestos compensation
fund was sufficient to pay all future claims, the New South
Wales Supreme Court of Appeal said Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not satisfied that the non-executive director
appellants voted in favor of the draft ASX announcement
resolution,&#8221; Chief Justice James Spigelman wrote on behalf of
the appeals panel. &#8220;We do not think ASIC discharged its burden
of proof.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASIC is reviewing the judgment and will decide later
whether to ask the High Court to consider an appeal, the
commission said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission should have called Allens Arthur Robinson
lawyer David Robb, who had advised the James Hardie board, to
support its case that the directors approved the statement, the
appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The failure to call Mr. Robb in our view significantly
undermines the cogency of ASIC&#8217;s case,&#8221; Spigelman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Hardie said in a statement to the Australian Stock
Exchange that it&#8217;s reviewing the judgment and doesn&#8217;t plan to
comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Australian Securities Investment Commission v.
James Hardie Industries NV. 2009/00298426. New South Wales
Supreme Court of Appeal (Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria Withdraws Charges Against Cheney, Halliburton &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria withdrew corruption charges against former U.S.
Vice President Dick Cheney and companies including Halliburton
Co. after the company agreed to pay a fine and repatriate funds,
a spokesman for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The charges against Dick Cheney and all the others were
dropped today,&#8221; Femi Babafemi said in a telephone interview in
Abuja, the capital on Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton, where Cheney was chief executive officer until
2000, offered to pay $120 million in fines and repatriate an
additional $130 million to Nigeria, he said. A person who
answered a call to Halliburton&#8217;s Houston office said no one was
available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigerian prosecutors filed charges on Dec. 8 for alleged
bribery against Cheney; Albert &#8220;Jack&#8221; Stanley, ex-chairman of
KBR Inc., a former unit of Halliburton; current CEO William Utt
and Halliburton CEO David Lesar, according to court documents.
Companies charged include Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti
SpA, a unit of Eni SpA, KBR and JGC Corp. of Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s biggest crude-oil producer, alleges that
the companies, which were part of group known as TSKJ, paid $180
million in bribes to Nigerian officials between 1994 and 2004 to
win a $6 billion liquefied natural gas plant contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di Giovanni Gianni, a spokesman for Eni, said by e-mail
Dec. 17 that the company has no comment. Gabriela Segura, a KBR
spokeswoman, and a spokesman for Technip didn&#8217;t respond to e-
mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBR agreed in February 2009 to pay a $402 million fine in
the U.S. after admitting it bribed Nigerian officials.
Halliburton paid $177 million to settle allegations by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission without admitting wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eni, Technip and JGC are in talks with Nigerian prosecutors
to settle the corruption charges, the country&#8217;s anti-graft
agency said on Dec. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Halliburton and
others, CV/435/10, High Court of Justice, Abuja Judicial
Division (Abuja). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Sued by States Over Loan Modifications &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. was sued by Arizona and Nevada over
home-loan modification programs intended to keep homeowners who
borrowed from its Countrywide mortgage unit out of foreclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of working to modify loans on a timely basis, Bank
of America proceeded with foreclosures while borrowers&#8217; requests
for modifications were pending, a violation of a 2009 agreement
with Arizona to help borrowers facing the loss of their homes,
Terry Goddard, the state&#8217;s attorney general, said Dec. 17 in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed that the suit was filed at this
time,&#8221; Dan Frahm, a Bank of America spokesman, said in an e-
mail, referring to the Arizona suit. &#8220;We and other major
servicers are currently engaged in multistate discussions led by
Attorney General Miller in Iowa to try to address foreclosure

&lt;p&gt;All 50 U.S. states are investigating whether banks and loan
servicers used false documents and signatures to justify
hundreds of thousands of foreclosures. The probe, announced Oct.
13, came after JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Ally Financial Inc.&#8217;s
GMAC mortgage unit said they would stop repossessions in 23
states where courts supervise home seizures, and Bank of
America, the largest U.S. lender, froze foreclosures nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is accused in the Arizona and Nevada lawsuits
filed Dec. 17 of misleading consumers about requirements for the
modification program and how long it would take for requests to
be decided. The bank provided inaccurate and deceptive reasons
for denying modification requests, according to the suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arizona case is Arizona v. Bank of America,
CV2010-33580, Maricopa County Superior Court (Phoenix). The
Nevada case is Nevada v. Bank of America, Eighth Judicial
District Court, Clark County (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CA Should Pay Fees in Lawsuit, Ex-CEO Wang Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CA Inc.&#8217;s former Chief Executive officer Charles B. Wang
sued the company he founded for about $1 million in legal fees
paid to experts in a case where the software maker seeks to
recover $1 billion Wang allegedly stole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CA, formerly known as Computer Associates Inc., is required
under its bylaws to pay fees for former employees involved in
litigation connected to their work, lawyers for Wang said in the
complaint filed Dec. 16 in Delaware Chancery Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang claims the company owes him more than $700,000 for
retaining experts in a consolidated lawsuit filed on behalf of
the company in federal court in New York. The New York suit,
filed in 2005, accuses former and current CA officers and
directors of accounting fraud. In September, CA, after
conducting an internal investigation, successfully petitioned
the judge to allow the company to realign itself as a plaintiff
in the case and seek damages against Wang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In direct contravention of its obligations under its
bylaws -- and despite its unyielding efforts to prosecute claims
against Mr. Wang seeking recovery in excess of $1 billion -- CA
has to this date refused to pay these expert fees,&#8221; lawyers for
Wang said in the Delaware complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanjay Kumar, who succeeded Wang as CEO in 2000, was
convicted in 2006 of leading a $2.2 billion fraud at the
company. Kumar, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence, blamed
the fraud on Wang. Kumar claimed Wang directed a practice of
inflating revenue, known as the &#8220;35-day month&#8221; in which the
company backdated quarterly sales contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang was never charged with wrongdoing by federal
prosecutors who investigated the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CA spokeswoman Jennifer Hallahan didn&#8217;t return a phone call
seeking comment on Wang&#8217;s lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Charles B. Wang v. CA Inc., CA6078, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flextronics&#8217; Shimoon Loses Bid for Bail in U.S. Trading Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Shimoon, the ex-manager at Flextronics International
Ltd. arrested Dec. 16 in an insider-trading probe, is scheduled
to make a formal request for bail on Dec. 20 after a federal
prosecutor said there is a danger he will flee if freed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimoon, whose former employer supplies cameras and battery
chargers for Apple Inc. devices, made his first court appearance
Dec. 17 in the San Diego federal courthouse and his lawyer
sought to post a bond allowing his release. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Marietta Geckos objected, saying there&#8217;s a &#8220;serious
risk of flight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a massive fraud involving more than $10
million&#8221; that &#8220;caused incredible damage to Apple,&#8221; Geckos
told U.S. Magistrate Judge Bernard G. Skomal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimoon, 39, was one of three technology firm employees
arrested Dec. 16 on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy for
allegedly giving inside information about their companies to
clients of Primary Global Research LLC, a consulting company
that provides experts to investors. A fourth person arrested,
James Fleishman, was an account representative at Mountain View,
California-based Primary Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the criminal complaint unsealed Dec. 17, U.S.
investigators made consensual and wiretap recordings of an
unidentified expert-networking firm&#8217;s phones, the land lines of
an unidentified hedge fund and the mobile phones of two of the
defendants, Shimoon and Mark Anthony Longoria, of Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimoon, Longoria and Manosha Karunatilaka, who was
employed at chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
were charged with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities
fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimoon didn&#8217;t enter a plea Dec. 17. Fleishman appeared in
federal court in San Jose, California, Dec. 16 and was released
on $700,000 bail. Longoria was granted $50,000 bail and freed by
a federal magistrate in Austin, Texas. Karunatilaka got bail of
$300,000 in Boston federal court, his lawyer, Brad Bailey, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimoon has been fired, Singapore-based Flextronics said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Flextronics has a practice of fully cooperating with
regulatory inquiries and has clear policies prohibiting the
release of confidential information about the company and its
business partners,&#8221; Renee Brotherton, a spokeswoman for the
company, said Dec. 17 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Shimoon, 10-02823, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Judge Orders Transocean to Turn Over Records &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd.., the owner of the Deepwater Horizon oil
rig that exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico in April, must
turn over safety records to the U.S. government, a federal judge
ruled Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans directed
the Vernier, Switzerland-based firm to turn over records
pertaining to any other rigs or vessels it had in the gulf on
the accident date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean lawyer Richard Hymel had opposed the request,
calling it &#8220;a fishing expedition&#8221; for records that were
&#8220;irrelevant&#8221; to the incident. The company has already produced
safety records for the Deepwater Horizon, the attorney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t they have pretty broad authority?&#8221; Barbier
replied, referring to the joint U.S. Coast Guard - Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement panel
request. The U.S. sued to obtain the records on Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Information contained in the requested documents will
help the joint board of investigation identify gaps in existing
laws&#8221; as well as tighten international standards &#8220;to prevent
the occurrence of similar casualties in the future,&#8221; U.S.
Attorney Jim Letten of New Orleans said when the suit was filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. wants to learn if problems leading to the
Deepwater Horizon explosion are isolated or systemic, Justice
Department attorney Sharon D. Smith told the judge Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. vs. Transocean Holdings LLC, 2:10-
cv-04397, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana
(New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michigan Blue Cross Seeks Antitrust Suit Dismissal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan asked a federal court to
throw out an antitrust suit brought by the U.S. and the state of
Michigan that accused it of driving up competitors&#8217; costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health-care insurer, in papers filed with U.S. District
Judge Denise Page Hood in Detroit Dec. 17, argued that the
federal and state governments hadn&#8217;t shown its practices cause
harm. It also said the court should refrain from hearing the
case because of its &#8220;disruptive effect on state policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case attacks Blue Cross&#8217;s efforts to ensure that it
is obtaining the best possible prices from hospitals -- prices
at least as good as, and hopefully better than, others,&#8221; it
said in the filing, adding that nothing in antitrust law bars
its practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan is the largest insurer in
the state, with about 4 million customers. About 90 percent of
the company&#8217;s business is with large group plans, insuring
companies directly or providing administrative services,
according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department&#8217;s Oct. 18 complaint said the
nonprofit insurer negotiated contracts with 70 of the state&#8217;s
131 general acute-care hospitals that led to higher prices for
its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,
10cv14155, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan
(Detroit). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Disputes JPMorgan&#8217;s Defense Against Claim for Billions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which seeks billions of
dollars from JPMorgan Chase  Co., said the bank and Chairman
James Dimon helped cause its collapse and can&#8217;t hide behind laws
that protect lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan forced Lehman to give guarantees that stripped the
firm of working capital in the 2008 financial crisis, Lehman
said Dec. 15 while asking a U.S. bankruptcy judge to let its
lawsuit proceed. JPMorgan should return $8.6 billion in cash and
pay tens of billions more in damages, Lehman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s defense hinges on so-called safe harbor laws,
which allow clearing banks to take collateral from securities
dealers without getting sued if they fail. Lehman says the laws
protected New York-based JPMorgan only when it cleared trades
for Lehman&#8217;s failing brokerage. JPMorgan wasn&#8217;t a clearing bank
for the parent company, so the guarantees can be reversed,
Lehman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Bankruptcy Code doesn&#8217;t shelter &#8220;guarantees
entered into for less than reasonably equivalent value when the
debtor was insolvent or undercapitalized,&#8221; Lehman said in its
filing in Manhattan. Under the code, debtors can undo some asset
transfers completed shortly before a bankruptcy filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank says the guarantees can&#8217;t be reversed. Safe-harbor
laws &#8220;present an insurmountable legal obstacle to Lehman&#8217;s
lawsuit,&#8221; JPMorgan told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck in
court papers while twice asking him to dismiss the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adversary case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Programmer&#8217;s Criminal Docket Most Read &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. computer programmer Sergey
Aleynikov&#8217;s criminal docket was the most-read litigation docket
on the Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was found guilty of two counts of stealing the
firm&#8217;s trade secrets by appropriating part of a high-frequency
computer source code on Dec. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov went on trial Nov. 29 in federal court in New
York on charges of violating the Economic Espionage Act and the
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. He faces as
long as 10 years in prison on the espionage charge and five
years for the interstate transportation charge at sentencing on
March 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union economy is
weathering the sovereign debt crisis, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
Chairman James Dimon told El Economista. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The EU is going through a difficult moment, a crisis of
growth, but it is holding out,&#8221; El Economista cited Dimon as
saying in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU limits on public borrowing should be applied to
create more &#8220;balance&#8221; in the region&#8217;s economy, Dimon told the
newspaper. It isn&#8217;t sustainable for some people to retire at 52
and others at 65, he was also cited as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy isn&#8217;t part of the European crisis and it&#8217;s making a
bigger contribution to the recovery than other countries, Dimon
said, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. trade agency will consider
whether imports of Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Xbox gaming system should
be barred after Motorola Inc.&#8217;s Mobility unit said that it
infringes patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Trade Commission in Washington said Dec.
17 it would investigate the complaint filed last month by
Motorola Mobility. Notice of the investigation was posted on the
agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, filed a
lawsuit on Nov. 9 accusing Motorola of breaching contractual
obligations to fairly license patents on wireless networking and
video coding to be used in the Xbox. A day later, Motorola filed
patent-infringement complaints in Florida and Wisconsin. The ITC
case contains allegations similar to those filed in Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said Motorola is demanding patent royalties
that are &#8220;wholly disproportionate to the royalty rate that its
patents should command under any reasonable calculus.&#8221; Motorola
has said the demand was a &#8220;fair offer&#8221; that Microsoft refused
to accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC is a quasi-judicial agency that investigates
allegations of unfair trade practices and has the power to ban
imports of products found to infringe U.S. patents. It typically
completes its investigations in about 15 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is in the Matter of Certain Gaming and
Entertainment Consoles, 337-752, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Seeks Patent on Mobile Phone App-Sharing Method &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., maker of the iPad and the iPhone, is seeking a
patent on a technology that would permit users to share
applications with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent of the invention is the purchase -- through an
Apple Apps Store -- of an application by the user with whom it
is shared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seed of the application is transmitted from mobile
device to mobile device, so that the recipient, who may like the
application on the sender&#8217;s phone, doesn&#8217;t have to go to the
trouble of looking it up at the App Store. The recipient can
then use the mobile device to pay for and activate the
application &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Apple&#8217;s 2010031281 application, published in
the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Dec. 9,
some applications that contain sensitive data, such as a medical
database, can be structured so that particular application can&#8217;t
be shared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only named inventor listed on the application is Edward
D. Steakley. According to the membership database of the State
Bar of California, Steakley, a lawyer, is an in-house counsel at
Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple filed the application for the patent in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zynga&#8217;s &#8216;Mafia Wars&#8217; to Incorporate Dr. Dre&#8217;s Music, Name &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zynga Game Network Inc., the social gaming company, will
partner with rap performer Dr. Dre to stream his video &#8220;Kush&#8221;
into Zynga&#8217;s &#8220;Mafia Wars&#8221; game, the San Francisco-based
company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mafia Wars game, played by users on their iPhones and
Facebook Inc.&#8217;s social network website, is played by 19 million
people per month, according to the company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to licensing his music, Dr. Dre has permitted
the use of his name for a number of &#8220;Mafia Wars&#8221; special
items. There are Dr. Dre-inspired limited-edition virtual goods,
including headphones, a vintage car and weapons. Players can
also buy the new &#8220;Kush&#8221; single from within the game through a
link to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iTunes music store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dre records his music on the Universal Music Group&#8217;s
Interscope Geffen AM Records label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Issues Permanent Order Against &#8216;Catcher in Rye&#8217; Sequel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredrik Colting&#8217;s sequel to J.D. Salinger&#8217;s &#8220;Catcher in
the Rye&#8221; can&#8217;t be published in the U.S., according to an order
by a federal judge in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The late Salinger published &#8220;Catcher&#8221; in 1951, and the
coming-of-age novel captured the imagination of several
generations of readers. The book, about the disaffected
adolescent Holden Caulfield, sold more than 10 million copies in
its first 10 years of publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colting, under the pen name John David California,
published &#8220;60 Years Later,&#8221; with his own publisher, Windupbird
Publishing, in 2009. The plot revolved around a meeting between
a 76-year-old Caulfield and the 90-year-old author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salinger sued for copyright infringement in June 2009 and
died in January 2010 at the age of 91. His survivors continued
the case as plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2010, a federal appeals court told a lower court
judge to reconsider her July 2009 ruling that blocked
publication of Colting&#8217;s book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her Dec. 14 order, U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts
ordered a permanent ban on the publication of the book. She
dismissed all claims in the case and ordered each side to pay
its own attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Salinger v. John Doe, 1:09-cv-05095-DAB, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolate Reindeer, Bunnies Not Protected, EU Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reindeer, bunnies and mice aren&#8217;t protected species when
they&#8217;re made of chocolate, a European Union court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindt  Spruengli AG, the world&#8217;s largest maker of premium
chocolate, and August Storck KG lost separate court challenges
to get EU trademark protection for their chocolate Easter
bunnies, mice and reindeer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A rabbit, a reindeer and a small bell are typical shapes
in which chocolate and chocolate goods are presented&#8221;
particularly &#8220;at Easter and Christmas,&#8221; the European Union
General Court, the region&#8217;s second-highest tribunal, ruled Dec.
17. The shapes &#8220;are devoid of any distinctive character.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindt, based in Kilchberg, Switzerland, has since 2004
failed to get EU-wide trademark protection for the shapes of a
plain chocolate bunny and chocolate bunnies and reindeer wrapped
in gold foil with red ribbon around their necks. It also failed
to get protection for the ribbon and attached bell. The EU
trademark agency based in Alicante, Spain, said in 2008 that the
shapes were too common. The agency also rejected Storck&#8217;s
trademark bid for the shape of a chocolate mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This now means Lindt can&#8217;t use an EU trademark right to
stop other companies&#8221; from making similar chocolate bunnies,
Olaf Gillert, a partner specializing in trademark law at law
firm Taylor Wessing LLP in Dusseldorf, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;Still, it doesn&#8217;t mean that in the future companies
can go ahead and make one-to-one copies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindt has other means to defend its rights, he said. It
could argue it has rights based on the fame of its product or
use national competition rules to enforce product shape, Gillert
said. A question then would be whether consumers really
recognize the golden bunny as being a Lindt product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Kaelin, a spokeswoman for Lindt, declined to
immediately comment, saying she hadn&#8217;t yet seen the ruling.
Bernd Roessler, a spokesman for Berlin-based Storck, declined to
immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindt in 2001 gained a trademark valid across the 27-nation
EU for a chocolate Easter bunny wrapped in gold foil emblazoned
with the word &#8220;Lindt&#8221; and bearing a red ribbon. In today&#8217;s
case Lindt was seeking protection for the same bunny, minus the
name, which would have given it wider rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindt already used its existing EU trademark to block an
Austrian chocolate maker from selling products similar to its
own 58-year-old Easter rabbit. This led to a dispute that
resulted in a ruling by the EU&#8217;s top court last year that the
trademark can be challenged if the Austrian chocolate maker
proves Lindt registered it in bad faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are T-336/08, T-337/08, T-346/08, T-395/08
Chocoladefabriken Lindt  Spruengli v OHMI, and T-13/09, Storck
v. OHMI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart, UFCW Reach Accord in Canadian Trademark Battle &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has settled a trademark dispute with a
labor union involved in efforts to unionize the world&#8217;s biggest
retailer&#8217;s Canadian workforce, the Montreal Gazette reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had objected to
the United Food and Commercial Workers Union&#8217;s use of the Wal-
Mart logo from a union run website, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union&#8217;s website -- www.walmartworkerscanada.ca --
contains a statement declaring the union won a victory against
Wal-Mart in a free-speech battle, according to the Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheboygan&#8217;s Lakeshore Metro&#8217;s New Name Opposed by Bus Company &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city-run bus system in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, may have
to change its name to avoid a trademark conflict with a
transportation service for the elderly and disabled, the
Sheboygan Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bus system changed its name from Sheboygan
Transit to Lakeside Metro and spent more than $30,000 to put new
logos on the buses, counsel for Lakeshore Transportation, based
in nearby Cascade, Wisconsin, complained, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lakeshore Transportation&#8217;s lawyer, Daniel Kattman of
Milwaukee&#8217;s Reinhart, Boerner  Van Deuren SC, told the
newspaper that customers are confused by the name similarity,
and some have expressed anger that they can&#8217;t use their city bus
tickets on the private transportation company&#8217;s buses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the city doesn&#8217;t remove all references to &#8220;Lakeshore&#8221;
from its buses and promotional material, the transportation
company will file an infringement case, according to the

&lt;p&gt;NBA Asks Chinese Court to Overturn Adverse Trademark Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBA Properties Inc., the manager of the National Basketball
Association&#8217;s business interests, has asked a Chinese court to
reverse a decision by that country&#8217;s trademark Appeal Board, the
People&#8217;s Daily reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sports group is appealing a ruling that permitted a
Fujian-based sporting goods team to register &#8220;Lakes Team&#8221; and
its Chinese translation as a trademark for beer and other
beverages, according to People&#8217;s Daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal group said the owners of the Los Angeles Lakers
mark hadn&#8217;t proven it was well-enough known name prior to the
Fujian company&#8217;s registration, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NBA is disputing the board&#8217;s contention that the public
isn&#8217;t confused by the beverage company&#8217;s trademark, according to
People&#8217;s Daily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins Coie LLP hired Eric L. Wesenberg for its patent-
litigation group, the Seattle-based firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesenberg, who will practice from the firm&#8217;s Silicon Valley

&lt;p&gt;He has represented clients in federal district courts, the
U.S. International Trade Commission. and the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Washington-based court
that hears appeals of patent cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesenberg has an undergraduate degree from the University
of California, Santa Barbara, a master&#8217;s degree from the

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, will announce a version of its Windows computer
operating system that runs on ARM Holdings Plc technology for
the first time, said two people familiar with Microsoft&#8217;s plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new product will debut at the Consumer Electronics Show
in January, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because Microsoft&#8217;s plans are confidential. The software would
be tailored for battery-powered devices, such as tablet
computers and other handhelds, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operating system would give Microsoft another way to
attack the market for tablets and phones, where it&#8217;s lost ground
to Apple Inc. and Google Inc. ARM chips -- made by Qualcomm
Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are
used in most smartphones, as well as Apple&#8217;s best-selling iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full-featured version of Windows for ARM chips is the
best way for Microsoft to make a dent in the iPad&#8217;s lead, said
Robert Breza, a Minneapolis-based analyst for RBC Capital
Markets. While Windows is dominant in the personal-computer
market, it hasn&#8217;t parlayed that into tablet success yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to come back with a product that&#8217;s better
than &#8216;me too&#8217; and is equal if not better in features,&#8221; Breza
said. He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Microsoft&#8217;s stock,
which he doesn&#8217;t own. &#8220;A lot of tablets today are inferior to
PCs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM Climbs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 26 cents to $28.07 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has lost 7.9 percent
this year. ARM&#8217;s U.S.-traded shares, which have more than
doubled in value this year, climbed 6.6 percent to $19.78. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new software also will be able to work on Intel Corp.
and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. processors -- the chips that
power PC versions of Windows. While other versions of Microsoft
software aimed at phones and mobile devices work on ARM chips,
this is the first time it will make a full version of Windows
available on that technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel is trying to make its own forays into tablets and
smartphones, squaring off against ARM&#8217;s technology. ARM, based
in Cambridge, England, sells the rights to use its patents and
chip designs and doesn&#8217;t manufacture the electronic components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Cox, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment. Charlene Marini, a California-
based spokeswoman for ARM, said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on
rumor or speculation. Tom Beermann, at Santa Clara, California-
based Intel, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple sold 7.46 million iPads from the product&#8217;s April
debut through September. The device accounted for 95 percent of
the tablet market last quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may be able to win 10 percent to 20 percent of
the as many as 50 million tablets that will be sold next year,
Breza estimates. He predicted that Windows tablets will be
cheaper than the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s peso rose the most in
almost two weeks as economists raised forecasts for growth next
year, citing improved prospects for the U.S., the nation&#8217;s
largest trading partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s peso gained 0.5 percent to 12.3526 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.4119 yesterday. The currency has
advanced 6 percent this year against the dollar. The peso gained
the most since Dec. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The story for Mexico is that it&#8217;s a lagged response to
what happens in the U.S.,&#8221; said Ram Bala Chandran, a Latin
American currency and rates analyst at Citigroup Inc. &#8220;As long
as data in the U.S. is good, Mexico data will begin to turn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy will grow 4 percent in 2011, RBC Capital
Markets said in a note to clients today. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. raised its estimate for next year&#8217;s expansion to 4.1
percent from 3.7 percent. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of
Mexico&#8217;s exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A combination of stronger U.S. growth, strong public
infrastructure investment and rebounding domestic consumer
spending underpin our more optimistic view,&#8221; RBC wrote in the
note. The bank raised its forecast for U.S. growth to 3.1
percent for next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Mexico&#8217;s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.217 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 0.24 centavo to
124.42 centavos per peso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders triggered $340 million of dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. So far this month,
$346 million in options have been exercised. The bank has been
auctioning $600 million in dollar options monthly, allowing it
to purchase dollars as it seeks to boost foreign reserves after
the peso reached a record low last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign reserves reached a record $112 billion in the week
ending Dec. 17, the central bank said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and a U.S. unit
of French bank Natixis (KN) SA are offering money-market mutual funds
aimed at wooing back customers spooked by the financial crisis
into moving their money to federally insured deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new offerings promise to keep the average maturity of
their holdings at 10 days or fewer, one-fourth that of competing
funds, according to the companies and researcher Crane Data LLC.
Shorter maturities allow managers to shift more quickly out of a
troubled issuer and into other securities or cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are aimed squarely at the paranoid cash manager,&#8221;
said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC in Westborough,
Massachusetts, which tracks the $2.79 trillion industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-market funds lost their place as the top destination
for short-term corporate investments after the $62.5 billion
Reserve Primary Fund collapsed in September 2008, spurring a run
on funds that buy corporate debt. Company treasurers moved cash
to the safety of insured bank deposits, which for more than a
year have also provided more income than money funds because of
historically low interest rates on short-term government and
corporate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portion of short-term investments corporate treasuries
held in bank deposits rose to 42 percent from 25 percent two
years earlier, according to a survey published in June by the
Association for Financial Professionals in Bethesda, Maryland.
Money-market funds dropped to 25 percent from 39 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10-Day Maximum &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Current Yield Money Market Fund (JCCXX), opened at the
beginning of October, will maintain an asset-weighted maturity
on holdings of 10 days or fewer under &#8220;normal market
conditions,&#8221; according to the prospectus. Current Yield is a
prime fund, meaning it invests in corporate debt as well as
government instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Deutsch, head of global liquidity at New York-based
JPMorgan, said the fund&#8217;s short duration also will allow it to
move quickly into higher-yielding bonds when the U.S. Federal
Reserve eventually raises interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNT Natixis Liquid Prime Portfolio, a prime fund run by
Reich  Tang Asset Management LLC that opened Nov. 30, will
maintain an asset-weighted average maturity of nine days or
fewer, said Tom Nelson, head of sales and marketing at the New
York-based firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average maturity of holdings in prime funds was 43 days
as of Nov. 30, according to Crane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;New Niche&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Managing funds that short is not a novelty, but promising
never to go above 10 days is unique,&#8221; Peter Rizzo, senior
director of fund services at Standard  Poor&#8217;s in New York, said
in a phone interview. &#8220;It could be a new niche.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid Prime provides shareholders with a daily disclosure
of its portfolio, while most money funds reveal holdings monthly
or quarterly. It also discloses a list of approved issuers from
which the fund can buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The focus is less on the absolute level of yield than on
making sure clients can understand what&#8217;s in the portfolio and
can see what could be in the portfolio,&#8221; Nelson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve Primary became the second money-market fund in the
four-decade history of the industry to expose investors to a
principle loss after it wrote down to zero $785 million in debt
from bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Clients pulled out
$230 billion from funds in the week ended Sept. 19, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. restarted units
and returned to normal operations at its Torrance refinery in
California, according to Aarti Ramachandran, a company
spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production was affected at the 155,800-barrel-a-day
refinery after the unplanned shutdown of two units late Dec. 20,
Ramachandran said yesterday. She declined to say which units
were shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplanned and planned refinery outages can increase prices
for refined products as companies turn to spot markets to help
them meet supply contracts. Operational disruptions can also
depress prices for crude oil as less feedstock is used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
San Francisco and in Los Angeles narrowed 2 cents to 3 cents a

&lt;p&gt;The refinery&#8217;s capacity is 155,800 barrels of crude oil a

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co.&#8217;s experimental blood thinner apixaban topped Sanofi-Aventis
SA&#8217;s Lovenox at preventing deadly clots in hip-surgery patients,
according to a study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of 5,407 patients found that those given the pill
apixaban were 64 percent less likely to develop clots in their
legs or die than those given injections of Lovenox, the standard
treatment. The research, dubbed Advance-3 and sponsored by
Pfizer and Bristol-Myers, was published today in the New England
Journal of Medicine. Both companies are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study released in March by the two drugmakers showed
apixaban was superior to Lovenox in preventing clots from
forming after knee-replacement surgery. Apixaban and similar new
oral blood thinners will provide alternatives to difficult-to-
use treatments such as warfarin, a 56-year-old anticoagulant --
first used as rat poison -- that requires constant monitoring,
said the lead researcher, Michael Rud Lassen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This new drug offers a real advancement for patients,&#8221;
said Lassen, a spine surgeon and a researcher with the
University of Copenhagen&#8217;s department of orthopedics, in a
telephone interview on Dec. 21. He said he will use apixaban in
his patients if the drug is approved by regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People undergoing hip or knee surgery are at risk of
developing blood clots, and about 40 percent to 60 percent of
patients getting the procedures develop clots if not treated
preventively, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers said in a statement
today. The global market for anticoagulants in 2009 rose to
$690.5 million, from $686.2 million in 2008, and this year
through September the market totaled $528.3 million, according
to IMS Health Inc., a research company in Norwalk, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory Approval &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Bristol-Myers are asking for European approval
for apixaban for use in patients undergoing hip and knee
replacements. In the U.S., the companies are seeking marketing
clearance of the drug for use in preventing strokes in patients
with irregular heartbeat, or atrial fibrillation. The condition
increases the likelihood of clots, said Jack Lawrence, the
Bristol-Myers vice president in charge of apixaban development,
in a telephone interview on Dec. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warfarin, the standard drug given to patients with atrial
fibrillation, causes side effects and is difficult for doctors
to dose and monitor to reduce bleeding risk. All blood-thinning
medicines raise some risk of bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is great hope in the new oral anticoagulants and
their potential to replace, to a large degree, the current
standards of care,&#8221; Lawrence said. &#8220;Likely there will be room
for multiple agents. Each drug will have subtle differences that
might encourage one or the other to be prescribed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood Thinner Rivals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson, Bayer AG and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH
sell new oral medicines in Europe to prevent clots after hip and
knee surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer, based in Ingelheim, Germany, received U.S.
approval in October for its anti-clotting drug Pradaxa to
prevent stroke in patients who have atrial fibrillation, New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ and Leverkusen, Germany-based
Bayer are awaiting U.S. clearance for their blood thinner
Xarelto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The potential impact of these oral, highly specific,
fixed-dose drugs that do not require routine monitoring will no
doubt be substantial,&#8221; wrote Elaine Hylek, an associate
professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine,
in an editorial in the journal. If these drugs &#8220;prove to be
effective across the broad spectrum of patients in routine care
and are conscientiously priced, the worldwide impact will be
huge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, patients undergoing total hip replacement
received either apixaban twice a day or an injection of Lovenox
every 24 hours. Apixaban was started 12 to 24 hours after
surgery, while Lovenox was begun 12 hours before surgery.
Treatment continued for 35 days after surgery and patients were
followed for an additional 60 days after completing their
medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that 27 patients taking apixaban, or
1.4 percent, developed blood clots in the leg or a blockage in a
lung artery or died. These figures compared with 74, or 3.9
percent, in the Lovenox group, giving those taking apixaban a 64
percent reduction in their risk of developing those
complications, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those taking apixaban were also more than 50 percent less
likely to develop blood clots in their upper legs, which can
travel to the lungs, causing death, Lassen said. Bleeding
occurred in a similar percentage of people taking either
apixaban or Lovenox, the study showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Bristol-Myers and Pfizer halted a trial of
apixaban after an increase in bleeding outweighed benefits for
patients who had recently suffered a heart attack or severe
chest pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are also studying apixaban as a treatment for
blood clots in the legs and for pulmonary embolism, a condition
in which the clot breaks free and travels to the lung, causing a
blockage in a lung artery that can lead to death, Lawrence said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline on the West Coast
weakened after Exxon Mobil Corp. started units and returned to
normal operations at its Torrance refinery in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 155,800-barrel-a-day plant reported emissions related

data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differential for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago remained unchanged at 2.25 cents a gallon, as the grade
advanced 2.6 cents to $2.4025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for the same fuel on the Gulf Coast narrowed
0.38 cent to 2 cents a gallon, while prompt delivery of the

&lt;p&gt;Banks advanced after Federal lawmakers agreed to fund the
government at current levels through March 4, denying budget
increases U.S. financial regulators needed to meet new
responsibilities imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM US) rose 2.8 percent to $42.16.
Regions Financial Corp. (RF US) gained 7.1 percent to $6.91 for
the biggest gain in the SP 500 Index. First Horizon National
Corp. (FHN US) increased 4.2 percent to $11.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC US) rose 3.1 percent, the most
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, to $13.38. Information that
may be released by WikiLeaks is unlikely to be new, said Dick
Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA US) fell 12 percent to
$1.80, the lowest price since Dec. 17. The drugmaker said it
would reapply for clearance of lorcaserin, the weight-loss drug
that failed to win a U.S. advisory panel&#8217;s recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camac Energy Inc. (CAK US) declined the most in the Russell
2000 Index, sliding 22 percent to $2.07. The oil and gas company
said it sold 9.09 million shares for $2.20 a share to some
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CPIX US) dropped 11
percent, the most since May 14, to $6.15. The Nashville,
Tennessee-based drugmaker said it received a complete response

won a court ruling allowing it to pull listings from Orbitz and
said it will immediately stop displaying and selling tickets on
the online travel site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxford Industries Inc. (OXM US) jumped 22 percent, the most
since March 2009, to $26.97. The maker of Tommy Bahama clothing
said it bought Sugartown Worldwide Inc. for $60 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress Software Corp. (PRGS US) rose 5.4 percent to
$43.38, the highest price since July 1991. The maker of business
programs raised its 2011 earnings forecast higher than the
average analyst estimate and boosted its projection for revenue
next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreen Co. (WAG US) gained 5.5 percent to $38.85 for the
second-biggest increase in the SP 500. The largest U.S. drug-
store chain had fiscal first-quarter profit of 62 cents a share.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated profit of 54 cents
on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney Holding Corp. (WTNY US) soared 29 percent to $14
for the biggest gain in the Russell 2000 Index. The lender to
the oil and gas industries agreed to sell itself to Hancock
Holding Co. (HBHC US) for $1.5 billion, or $15.48 a share.
Hancock fell 5.4 percent to $35.04. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, is
building a cloud-computing system for NATO in the first such
deal for the international military alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software and hardware will let NATO more quickly
collect and analyze data, such as military intelligence in
Afghanistan, said E.J. Herold, head of the project for IBM.
NATO&#8217;s military command department in Norfolk, Virginia, will
use the technology first, with the possibility it will expand to
other divisions, he said. Terms of the accord weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM gains a foothold for similar projects for NATO&#8217;s other
departments, as well as its 28 member countries.  The Armonk,
New York-based company is betting cloud computing, which helps
customers save money by letting them store and access data via
the Internet, will be a $3 billion business by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a first step in the door at this international
organization,&#8221; Herold said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;With 28
member nations who are all having equal say in doing things, by
definition everything you do becomes more complex.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will manage the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&#8217;s
data from inside the Norfolk base, in a so-called private-cloud
model, which lets customers put information on servers within
their own security systems. The system will help the military
command pull together information from sources such as radar
systems, cameras or infrared images that had been separated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes it easier to share information, especially in
time-sensitive situations, like combat,&#8221; Herold said. &#8220;It
makes it easier for commanders to understand the situation and
then make a decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 21 cents to $145.95 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 11 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, agreed to pay Florida $25 million
to settle allegations it sold unregistered securities to a
state-run municipal money-market fund that suffered a run on
deposits because it held defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in Florida&#8217;s Local Government Investment Pool
will get $23 million of the settlement to reimburse them for
losses in 2007 on asset-backed securities, some of which were
sold by JPMorgan to the fund&#8217;s overseer, the State Board of
Administration, Attorney General Bill McCollum said today in a
statement. The rest will pay fines and related costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement is part of the state&#8217;s continued efforts
to secure the maximum valuation of investment securities held by
the SBA,&#8221; McCollum said from Tallahassee, the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assets in what was once the largest U.S. manager of
municipal cash plunged from $27 billion in November 2007 to
about $6.9 billion this week after it said that it held
defaulted mortgage-backed bonds. A rush by municipalities to
pull out money forced the fund to freeze withdrawals, leaving
some communities without cash to pay workers and other costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, since renamed Florida Prime, was reorganized to
segregate the defaulted securities under a plan from New York-
based BlackRock Inc., the biggest publicly traded U.S. money
manager. The best-quality securities were set aside as Fund A
and resumed paying withdrawals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closed Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $2 billion of illiquid and defaulted debt was put
into Fund B and closed to transactions. As Fund B securities
paid interest and matured, proceeds were deposited into Fund A.
About $1.65 billion has been distributed from Fund B, or about
82 percent of the original principal, the state board said today
in a statement about the proceeds of the JPMorgan agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement is a fair, reasonable and a responsible
result for the participants,&#8221; Ash Williams, the state board&#8217;s
executive director, said in the statement from McCollum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCollum said the New York-based bank&#8217;s JPMorgan Securities
LLC unit had violated Florida law by selling unregistered bonds
to the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;desires to resolve this matter to avoid the
burden and cost of any litigation, and accordingly does not
admit or deny&#8221; the findings of Florida&#8217;s investigation, the
company said in the settlement agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that both parties can now move past this
issue and we look forward to continuing our service to the state
of Florida,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a statement e-mailed from the
office of its spokesman, Joe Evangelisti, in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc bought a cargo of North Sea
Forties crude from Royal Dutch Shell Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP agreed a premium of 20 cents to Dated Brent for the
cargo for loading from Jan. 3 to Jan. 5, according to a broker
involved in North Sea transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP also bid for a Jan. 1 to Jan. 5 Forties shipment at a
32-cent discount to the cash cost of North Sea cargoes in
February, without finding a seller. It bid for a second shipment
to load from Jan. 4 to Jan. 9 at a discount of 36 cents to the
cash cost of North Sea cargoes in February, also without finding
a seller, the broker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts trading window that ends daily at 4:30 p.m. in
London. Prior to the window, Forties crude loading from 10 to 21
days in the future cost 10 cents more than Dated Brent, compared
with a premium of 1 cent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude for February settlement traded at $93.74 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the
close of the window, up from $93.42 a barrel at the same time
yesterday. The March contract traded at $93.57 a barrel, making
it 17 cents cheaper than February, compared with 13 cents
yesterday. A market in which later contracts cost less than
earlier ones is described as being in backwardation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. said it resumed output from the Oso field

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have restarted 15,000 barrels per day of condensate

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s hryvnia may come under
&#8220;depreciation pressure&#8221; as President Viktor Yanukovych seeks
to replace the central bank governor with an ally likely to
favor exporters&#8217; interests, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanukovych has requested that parliament replace
Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy Governor Volodymyr Stelmakh, whose
term is up in December 2011, with his deputy, Serhiy Arbuzov,
according to a statement on the presidential website yesterday.
The 34-year-old Arbuzov, who was appointed to the central bank
in September, is the former head of PAO Ukrainskyi Biznes Bank,
the country&#8217;s 63rd-largest lender, and is from the southern city
of Donetsk, the hub for Ukraine&#8217;s steel industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given his perceived links to the industrial exporters we
think that the news could trigger some depreciation pressure on
the hryvnia in the near term,&#8221; Anna Zadornova, a Goldman Sachs
economist based in London, wrote in an e-mail to clients today.
&#8220;The market may also be concerned by Mr. Arbuzov&#8217;s limited
experience in the field.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hryvnia was unchanged at 7.9750 per dollar by 5:29 p.m.
in Kiev, and has gained 0.9 percent versus the U.S. currency
this year, according to trading data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will probably trade at 8 per dollar in 12 months, as the
central bank maintains its control over the currency, Zadornova
said. The regulator manages the hryvnia by buying and selling
foreign currency on the market to prevent swings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tighter Grip&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exporters may be forced to convert their external earnings
to hryvnia after the Natsionalnyi Bank yesterday annulled a
five-year-old decree that abolished obligatory sales of foreign
currency, according to a statement on the Ukrainian parliament
web site. Yanukovych has ordered a separate law that would allow
the temporary introduction of compulsory foreign-currency sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This law could be used to &#8220;keep a tighter grip on the
currency,&#8221; Zadornova wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hryvnia will trade at about 7.98 to 8 per dollar by the
end of this year as the central bank continues to intervene in
the currency market, Stelmakh said in September. The currency
has traded at an average 7.9514 per dollar this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast with Goldman Sachs&#8217; view, Dmitri Fedotkin, a
Moscow-based economist at VTB Capital, the investment banking
arm of neighboring Russia&#8217;s second-largest lender, said an
appointment of Arbuzov to governor may help the hryvnia
strengthen 0.8 versus the dollar by the end of this year and 2.8
by the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Appreciation Risks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Arbuzov may push some of the reforms aimed at improving
the domestic financial market,&#8221; Fedotkin said by e-mail today.
&#8220;There are more appreciation risks to the hryvnia at the
moment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the terms of two loans from the International
Monetary Fund, Ukraine is required to move toward a more
flexible-exchange rate regime. The Washington-based lender isn&#8217;t
pressuring the country to accelerate its movement toward a free-
floating hryvnia and the central bank will act to prevent any
&#8220;risks&#8221; to the currency&#8217;s stability, Deputy Premier Serhiy Tigipko said in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., weighing
2010 pay packages for a year that could rank as Wall Street&#8217;s
second best, said it may grant bonuses that depend on future
earnings, in addition to stock performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awards would go to &#8220;key employees&#8221; and be tied to a
variety of financial measures including revenue, net income and
return on equity, a gauge of profitability, the New York-based
company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Awards may
consist of cash, securities or other equity-linked components,
and carry provisions allowing their cancellation or return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan &#8220;is a tool the compensation committee may use to
further align incentive compensation with long-term
performance,&#8221; said Stephen Cohen, a company spokesman. Cohen
declined to provide figures on potential payouts, saying that
awards haven&#8217;t been set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have pushed banks to design pay packages for top
employees that would discourage excessive risk-taking, after a
financial crisis wiped out firms including Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and led to government bailouts. Most firms have
interpreted the guidance to emphasize deferred stock awards over
cash bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s new program aims to ensure &#8220;that the
firm&#8217;s incentive-compensation structure is balanced and
consistent with the safety and soundness of the firm,&#8221;
according to the filing. It won&#8217;t fuel &#8220;imprudent risk-
taking,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recipients will be selected by the board&#8217;s compensation
committee, according to the filing, which didn&#8217;t specify
eligible executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Improper Risk&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payouts may be halted or reclaimed if the firm
determines, for example, that an employee engaged in
&#8220;materially improper risk analysis or failed sufficiently to
raise concerns about risks,&#8221; according to the filing. Previous
awards have also included so-called recapture provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new plan, adopted by the compensation committee Dec.
17, was disclosed after the close of New York markets yesterday,
the last trading session before Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and the four other largest U.S. firms by
investment-banking and trading revenue -- JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley -- are
set to complete their best two years in investment banking and
trading. They will likely have a better fourth quarter than the
previous two periods, driven by equity underwriting and higher
volume in stock and bond trading, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Even if the quarter only matches the third, their
revenue will top that of any year except 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and an Alabama
agency reached a settlement to end the state&#8217;s lawsuit to cancel
a derivative contract that threatened to cost it more than $122
million, according to a court filing and bond documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alabama Public School and College Authority, which
issues debt to finance construction, and the New York-based bank
sought to dismiss the suit yesterday because of the settlement.
Terms of the agreement weren&#8217;t disclosed in the court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authority paid $19 million to JPMorgan on Dec. 21 to
settle the case, Standard  Poor&#8217;s said today in a report. SP
revised its outlook on the agency&#8217;s debt to stable from
negative, based on the agreement. No ruling has been posted in
the case, brought in U.S. District Court in Montgomery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alabama agency sued the bank in 2008 to scrap the
derivative contract, set to take effect that year, as turmoil in
the U.S. credit markets led similar agreements to backfire,
saddling taxpayer-supported bond issuers with unexpected bills.
The agency may have owed JPMorgan more than $122 million if the
contract was upheld by the court, according to bond documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat Haigler, Alabama&#8217;s debt manager, also wouldn&#8217;t comment
and referred questions on the case to Gina Smith, a spokeswoman
who didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Alabama Public School and College Authority v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, 2:08-cv-00863-WKW-CSC, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;

rejected the move by the second-largest U.S. bank on Dec. 21,
saying there were sufficient facts to continue the case. The two
bond insurers sued to recover money paid out and to pay
potential claims on the Jefferson County debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora and Assured took JPMorgan to court after a $3
billion refinancing of the sewer debt in 2002 and 2003, which
involved derivatives, collapsed during the credit crisis and
almost bankrupted the county. JPMorgan concealed that it won the
refinancing transaction with &#8220;bribes&#8221; of about $3 million
funneled to county commissioners through friends, the insurers
said. They also claimed the bank didn&#8217;t disclose a report saying
the sewer system wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay its debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiff insurer could have reasonably concluded that
defendants&#8217; alleged bribery practices were indicators that the
county&#8217;s affairs were being mismanaged if decisions were made on
this illegal basis,&#8221; Yates said in his decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurers said they wouldn&#8217;t have insured the debt if
JPMorgan had disclosed the purpose of the $3 million payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krebs Report &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond insurers also said they were unaware of a 2003
report by Birmingham-based engineering firm Paul B. Krebs 
Associates Inc. that concluded the government lacked the money
to meet sewer-debt payments. The report, which came to light in
2009 during a receivership action against the county, warned
officials that they would need to raise sewer revenue by 89
percent and recommended the county take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it never received a copy of the Krebs report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who received what and when cannot be established on the
face of the pleadings and is exactly the kind of inquiry
appropriate for discovery,&#8221; Yates wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora Guarantee insured about $1.2 billion of the sewer
debt and a $165 million surety policy. The company has paid $211
million in claims after the county defaulted on some of the debt
and expects to pay at least $205 million more, according to
court documents. Assured has paid out $4 million and may have to
pay $370 million more on its policies, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judged also dismissed a Jefferson County counterclaim
that alleged that the bond insurers breached their contract
because they failed to retain AAA credit ratings. Their
downgrades helped spark the broader credit crisis while also
leading investors to shun the sewer debt, the county claimed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest
company by market value, agreed to pay $650 million for Petrohawk Energy Corp.&#8217;s natural-gas wells and pipelines in the
Fayetteville Shale, its second shale purchase this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas assets produce about 98 million cubic feet of
gas a day, Houston-based Petrohawk said today in a statement.
The sale of the wells, valued at $575 million, is complete and
has an Oct. 1 effective date, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon also agreed to buy pipelines that collect gas from
Fayetteville Shale wells for $75 million. That sale is subject
to regulatory approval and expected to close early next year,
Petrohawk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, in June bought XTO
Energy for $35 billion including debt to add expertise and
holdings in shale deposits, where new technology has reversed a
decline in U.S. gas production and swelled reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The logic behind the purchase of XTO and the purchase of
this acreage is very much in parallel,&#8221; said Pavel Molchanov, a
Houston-based analyst for Raymond James  Associates Inc. who
rates Exxon&#8217;s shares at &#8220;market perform&#8221; and owns none. &#8220;This
represents an increase of about 40 percent in acreage they own
in the Fayetteville Shale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is paying Petrohawk about $1.92 for each thousand
cubic feet of estimated proved reserves, around 36 percent less
than it paid for XTO, Molchanov said. That&#8217;s to be expected
because gas prices have fallen 21 percent since the XTO purchase
was announced more than a year ago, he said. This transaction is
also smaller and more focused, Molchanov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrohawk&#8217;s Rising Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale formations consist of dense rock that can be broken
apart using water, sand and chemicals to release oil or gas.
Fayetteville held the third-largest reserves among U.S. shale
formations in 2009, according to the Energy Information
Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrohawk said last month it might sell its Arkansas
operations, with proved reserves estimated at the end of 2009 at
299 billion cubic feet. The company told investors on Nov. 2 it
was increasing its 2010 capital budget by 20 percent to cover
higher gas well costs in the Eagle Ford and in the Haynesville
Shale of northwest Louisiana and northeast Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 40 cents to $73.20 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Petrohawk fell 33 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $18.28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Petrohawk on both
sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. shut down a fluid
catalytic cracking unit Dec. 18 at its Chalmette refinery in
Louisiana, according to Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman. The
schedule for the unit&#8217;s restart is undetermined, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At this time the refinery is operational and all customer
needs are being met,&#8221; Allexon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplanned and planned refinery outages can increase prices
for refined products as companies turn to spot markets to help
them meet supply contracts. Operational disruptions can also
depress prices for crude oil as less feedstock is used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery is a joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela
SA and has a capacity of 200,700 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalmette is in St. Bernard Parish, adjacent to New
Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2015, your mobile phone will
project a 3-D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be
powered by kinetic energy. At least that&#8217;s what International
Business Machines Corp. sees in its crystal ball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the
Armonk, New York-based company, which surveys its 3,000
researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next
five years. IBM, the world&#8217;s largest provider of computer
services, looks to Silicon Valley for input, gleaning many ideas
from its Almaden research center in San Jose, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holographic conversations, projected from mobile phones,
lead this year&#8217;s list. The predictions also include air-
breathing batteries, computer programs that can tell when and
where traffic jams will take place, environmental information
generated by sensors in cars and phones, and cities powered by
the heat thrown off by computer servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are all stretch goals, and that&#8217;s good,&#8221; said Paul Saffo, managing director of foresight at the investment-advisory
firm Discern in San Francisco. &#8220;In an era when pessimism is the
new black, a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad
thing&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For IBM, it&#8217;s not just idle speculation. The company is one
of the few big corporations investing in long-range research
projects, and it counts on innovation to fuel growth, Saffo
said. Not all of its predictions pan out, though. IBM was overly
optimistic about the spread of speech technology, for instance.
When the ideas do lead to products, they can have broad
implications for society, as well as IBM&#8217;s bottom line, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Spending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have continued to do research when all the other
grand research organizations are gone,&#8221; said Saffo, who is also
a consulting associate professor at Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM invested $5.8 billion in research and development last
year, 6.1 percent of revenue. While that&#8217;s down from about 10
percent in the early 1990s, the company spends a bigger share on
research than its computing rivals. Hewlett-Packard Co., the top
maker of personal computers, spent 2.4 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Almaden, scientists work on projects that don&#8217;t always
fit in with IBM&#8217;s computer business. The lab&#8217;s research includes
efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles
on one charge, a filtration system for desalination and a
program that shows changes in geographic data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 9 cents to $146.04 at 11:02 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock had gained 11 percent this
year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen Science &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list is meant to give a window into the company&#8217;s
innovation engine, said Josephine Cheng, a vice president at
IBM&#8217;s Almaden lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM
and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world&#8217;s
biggest problems,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has
in the works. One of this year&#8217;s ideas -- that sensors in cars,
wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data
about the environment -- is an expansion of the company&#8217;s
citizen-science initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, IBM teamed up with the California State
Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose
Environmental Services to help gather information about
waterways. Researchers from Almaden created an application that
lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks, and
report back on conditions. The hope is that these casual
observations will help local and state officials who don&#8217;t have
the resources to do the work themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic Predictors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next
five years. Computer programs will use algorithms and real-time
traffic information to predict which roads will have backups,
and how to avoid getting stuck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today, IBM
says. Rather than using the current lithium-ion technology, new
models could rely on energy-dense metals that only need to
interact with the air to recharge. Some electronic devices might
ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic
wristwatches, which only need to be shaken to generate a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated
by computers and data centers. Almost half of the power used by
data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool. IBM
scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm
houses and offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IBM&#8217;s first list of predictions, compiled at the end of
2006, researchers said instantaneous speech translation would
become the norm. That hasn&#8217;t happened yet. While some programs
can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages,
and other apps can perform limited speech translation, there&#8217;s
nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator
in &#8220;Star Trek.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Life &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also predicted that online immersive
environments, such as Second Life, would become more widespread.
While immersive video games are as popular as ever, Second
Life&#8217;s growth has slowed. Internet users are flocking instead to
the more 2-D environments of Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as
a wallet, ticket broker, concierge, bank and shopping assistant
is coming true -- thanks to the explosion of smartphone
applications. Consumers can pay bills through their banking
apps, buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential
purchases, all with a few taps on their phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The nice thing about the list is that it provokes
thought,&#8221; Saffo said. &#8220;If everything came true, they wouldn&#8217;t be
doing their job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. continues to be
interested in developing a petrochemical complex in Qatar after
Royal Dutch Shell Plc announced plans to help build a
monoethylene glycol plant in the emirate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We signed a heads of agreement with Qatar Petroleum in
January 2010,&#8221; Nikolaas Baeckelmans, an Exxon spokesman, said
in an e-mail today. &#8220;We have progressed work jointly with Qatar
Petroleum and are awaiting a decision to proceed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, the largest investor in Qatar, signed an agreement
with state-run Qatar Petroleum to &#8220;jointly study&#8221; an estimated
$6 billion petrochemicals project at a ceremony in the Qatari
capital Doha on Dec. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, the Qatari company signed an agreement
with Exxon Mobil for building a petrochemical complex that also
was to cost about $6 billion. It was to be the emirate&#8217;s biggest
single energy project since Shell&#8217;s Pearl gas-to-liquids plant
was announced in 2006. A Qatar Petroleum official said in August
that Qatar might choose a different partner for that complex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah declined
to say if the Shell project would replace Exxon&#8217;s venture, nor
did he comment on whether Exxon would be involved in future
projects in the Persian Gulf country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility Exxon had planned was to include a 1.6
million-ton-a-year steam cracker, two 650,000-ton polyethylene
plants and a 700,000-ton ethylene glycol unit. It was to be
completed by 2015, Exxon and Qatar Petroleum said in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar, holder of the world&#8217;s third-largest gas reserves, is
investing in petrochemical, aluminum and fertilizer factories as
it diversifies away from exporting liquefied natural gas and
oil. The emirate aims to raise annual petrochemicals production
to at least 18 million tons by 2015-16, al-Attiyah said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley ended JPMorgan Chase
 Co.&#8217;s two-year run as the top banker for stock sales after
charging the lowest fees and winning deals from the U.S., China
and Brazil to arrange offerings by state-owned companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75-year-old securities firm&#8217;s global market share rose
to 10.4 percent in 2010 on $72.7 billion of initial public
offerings, additional sales and convertible bond issues, its
first top ranking in six years, according to preliminary data
compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan was second with $59.7 billion,
while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dropped to third after its share
of U.S. equity underwriting slumped to the lowest level since at
least 1998, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While banks vie for first place in the so-called league
tables betting it may lead to more business, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
ranking came at a price. It was paid an average 2.3 percent fee,
the lowest of the top 10 banks, after underwriting state-backed
sales of General Motors Co., Citigroup Inc., Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd. and Petroleo Brasileiro SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the banks wanted to remain active, they&#8217;ve had to
participate in some of the government-sponsored programs,&#8221; said
Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which manages $4.5 billion.
&#8220;Like most government programs, they tend not to be highly
profitable, but they&#8217;re larger in size. It&#8217;s about getting in on
some of those bigger deals even though there&#8217;s less profit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s Collapse &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks arranged $699 billion in share sales this year, up 22
percent from 2009, as the MSCI World Index of 24 developed
markets recouped almost all the losses spurred by the collapse
of New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September
2008. About 37 percent of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s underwriting came
from state-controlled companies, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was the hangover and the legacy of the crisis that the
government had stakes,&#8221; said Bruce McCain, Cleveland-based
chief investment strategist at KeyCorp&#8217;s private-banking unit,
which oversees $25 billion. &#8220;The market had recovered enough
this year that it made sense to bring those stakes to market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM, 61 percent owned by the Treasury, paid 0.75 percent in
fees, or a total of $136 million, to underwriters in its $18.1
billion IPO last month. The sale was the second-largest in U.S.
history behind San Francisco-based Visa Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion
deal in March 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
government spent $49.5 billion to rescue the Detroit-based
automaker after it filed for bankruptcy in June last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Bailout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley was the sole lead manager for the Treasury&#8217;s
sale of $10.5 billion of Citigroup stock this month. The deal
helped the U.S. recoup some of the $45 billion it spent to bail
out the New York-based lender. Citigroup paid $42.3 million in
fees, or 0.4 percent of the proceeds, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural Bank of China in Beijing was charged fees of
1.96 percent for the Hong Kong portion of its record $22.1
billion IPO. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras paid 0.65 percent of
the proceeds for the $22.8 billion sale underwritten by seven
banks in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees for the government offerings arranged by Morgan
Stanley averaged 0.9 percent, the data show. The firm split a
0.001 percent fee with five banks for India&#8217;s sale of a $2.2
billion stake in Hyderabad-based NMDC Ltd. in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average stock offering this year paid 3 percent in
fees, three times more than on Morgan Stanley&#8217;s government
deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Win or Lose&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to ever win or lose business solely on the
basis of fees,&#8221; John Moore, co-head of U.S. equity capital
markets at Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;As
for large transactions, the benefits of market leadership in a
single year are always important. But as, if not more, important
is the opportunity to serve clients in varied ways over a long
period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, underwrote 333
deals, the most this year and almost 10 percent more than Morgan
Stanley, Bloomberg data show. Its market share fell for a second
year even as the firm helped arrange sales for GM and
Agricultural Bank, and the $20.5 billion Hong Kong IPO by AIA
Group Ltd., the Asian unit of New York-based American
International Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank retained its top ranking for U.S. corporate bond
sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based
JPMorgan arranged 13.8 percent of the investment-grade debt
offerings, while winning a 14 percent share for junk bonds.
Tasha Pelio, a New York-based spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal India, Petronas Chemicals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Asia, which accounted for 36 percent of the world&#8217;s
equity sales, JPMorgan missed out as Morgan Stanley managed the
$3.5 billion state-backed sale from Kolkata-based Coal India
Ltd. and Malaysia&#8217;s $4.7 billion offering of Petronas Chemicals
Group Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. Goldman Sachs arranged Queensland&#8217;s
$4.2 billion IPO of Brisbane, Australia-based QR National Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia was Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest market, accounting for 47
percent of its $57.2 billion in deals. The most profitable
securities firm in the history of Wall Street also won the
largest share of business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
It was the sole manager for Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based
Renault SA&#8217;s sale of a $4.2 billion stake in Volvo AB of
Gothenburg, Sweden, the region&#8217;s largest deal of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains failed to offset Goldman Sachs&#8217;s decline in the
U.S., where its share plummeted by 51 percent to 8.6 percent.
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. yesterday emitted
gases at its Joliet refinery in Channahon, Illinois, after a
&#8220;unit upset,&#8221; according to a filing with state regulators. The
incident was a fire, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery flared an unknown quantity of hydrogen sulfide
and sulfur dioxide, the filing to the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has a capacity of 248,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. flared gases after
a process &#8220;upset&#8221; at its Joliet, Illinois, refinery, according
to a filing to the National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant flared unknown amounts of nitrogen dioxide and
nitrous oxide, according to the filing. The flaring occurred at
about 5 p.m. local time Dec. 24, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplanned and planned refinery outages can increase prices
for refined products as companies turn to spot markets to help
them meet supply contracts. Operational disruptions can also
depress prices for crude oil as less feedstock is used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News couldn&#8217;t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drug company, should have the bankruptcy of its Quigley unit
which has protected it from asbestos-related health problems
since 2004 dismissed, lawyers for the U.S. Trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bankruptcy has been pending, creditors with
alleged asbestos-related health problems have been unable to sue
New York-based Pfizer, and many have died, wrote lawyers for the
U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department that oversees
bankruptcy. A hearing to decide the U.S. Trustee&#8217;s request is
set for Jan. 13, according to court papers filed Dec. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The harm in delaying the inevitable dismissal of this
case is to the individuals who have filed asbestos claims
against the Debtor and Pfizer,&#8221; lawyers for acting U.S. Trustee
Tracy Hope Davis wrote in court papers. &#8220;For some of those
individuals, time may be of the essence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge in September denied Quigley Company Inc.
permission to exit bankruptcy under its fourth proposed Chapter
11 plan. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein found the
world&#8217;s largest drug company manipulated the bankruptcy process
to benefit itself. Bernstein said the plan was filed in &#8220;bad
faith&#8221; by Pfizer and cited testimony that asbestos claims
directed at Quigley could total $4.45 billion over the next 42
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokesman Christopher Loder said the company is
prepared to contribute additional funds to Quigley&#8217;s plan to
satisfy the court&#8217;s concerns, and will discuss fair compensation
of asbestos claims at the Jan. 13 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s important to note that in 30 years of asbestos
litigation, Pfizer has never been found to be derivatively
liable for Quigley&#8217;s liabilities,&#8221; Loder said in an emailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$701 Million Charge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reported in its third-quarter report in November a
$701 million charge for asbestos litigation for Quigley. In a
report filed Nov. 12 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Pfizer said it was filing an appeal of the Quigley
ruling to &#8220;preserve its right to address certain legal issues
raised in the court&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ad-hoc committee representing 43,100 individual asbestos
claimants in Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy had also asked in October that
a judge end the case, and also end the injunction that has
shielded Pfizer from lawsuits since 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Quigley and Pfizer have enjoyed an exceedingly valuable
reprieve from defending asbestos claims in the tort system for
that entire time, and accordingly have, at numerous junctures
throughout this case, been content to let the bankruptcy
proceedings languish,&#8221; lawyers for the committee wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working With Quigley &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in court papers requesting an appeal that it
was working with Quigley to come up with a plan that took into
account some of the points in Bernstein&#8217;s ruling. Pfizer
challenged Bernstein&#8217;s statement that Pfizer should put an
amount of money into a trust that is equal to the alleged value
of present and future claims against the drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy court &#8220;erred by precluding Pfizer from
introducing evidence that Pfizer does not have any liability for
Quigley&#8217;s conduct in making or selling asbestos-containing
products,&#8221; lawyers for Pfizer wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed Chapter 11 plan, Pfizer would have paid
about $450 million into a trust to satisfy claims about products
for which it allegedly has derivative liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy code would direct all future claims to the
trust, covering death and personal injury claims over Insulag,
Panelag and Damit, Quigley products for the steel industry
containing asbestos that were made from the time of World War II
to the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan barred claimants from taking future actions
against Pfizer. Pfizer was a defendant in 280,343 of the 411,100
claims served against Quigley, Bernstein noted in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products containing
asbestos from the 1940s to the 1970s. It was bought by Pfizer in
1968. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer, said to unveil new software for tablets
at the Consumer Electronics Show next week, will face skeptics
who say his company won&#8217;t soon narrow Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad lead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By the time Microsoft gets it figured out everybody will
already own an iPad,&#8221; said Keith Goddard, CEO of Capital
Advisors Inc. an investing firm in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that holds
Apple shares. &#8220;That train has left the station.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will announce a full version of the Windows
computer operating system that runs on ARM Holdings Plc
technology at the show, which begins in Las Vegas on Jan. 6, two
people familiar with Microsoft&#8217;s plans said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allying with ARM is Microsoft&#8217;s way of stepping up rivalry
with Apple, which has garnered the largest share of the tablet
market with its iPad, a touch-screen device introduced in April
that handles video, music and computing tasks. The effort may
falter unless Ballmer can match the features consumers have come
to expect from the iPad, Goddard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Windows version would be tailored for battery-
powered devices, such as tablets and wireless handsets, the
people said. Chips based on ARM technology are made by Qualcomm
Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment, pointing instead to remarks by
Ballmer in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re tuning Windows 7 to new slate hardware designs,&#8221;
Ballmer told analysts then. He also said, Apple has &#8220;sold
certainly more than I&#8217;d like them to sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPad Gains Share &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer makers have unsuccessfully been trying to sell
tablet-style computers based on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows for about a
decade. Before the iPad, tablets made up only about 2 percent of
the PC market. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has sold
7.46 million iPads through September. According to analysts at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., it may sell as many at 37.2 million
iPads next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That indicates that the tablet computer&#8217;s share of the PC
market may rise to 9.2 percent next year, based on a prediction
by research firm IDC for 402.7 million PC shipments in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft dropped 23 cents to $28.07 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined
7.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides gaining share, Apple has also redefined consumer
expectations for what a tablet computer should do, says Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. Instead of requiring the
use of a stylus pen to serve as a computer mouse, the iPad
allows people to navigate using their fingers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Square Peg&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple did this year what no one had done in the previous
10 -- crack that space between the PC and the phone,&#8221; said
Gartenberg, who&#8217;s based in New York. &#8220;Microsoft has been
working very hard at putting a square peg in a round hole.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, an introduction at CES gives Microsoft a chance to
win over some of the more than 100,000 people expected to attend
the premier technology trade show, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful opportunity for Microsoft and Ballmer to
put a stake in the ground,&#8221; said Gartenberg. &#8220;Now that Apple
cracked the market no one wants to get left behind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adapting its computer operating system for a tablet,
Microsoft is taking a different approach from Apple, which used
a mobile-phone operating system as the basis for the iPad.
Apple&#8217;s software enables instant startup, longer battery life,
and access to the more than 300,000 applications already
developed for the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Frankentablets&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is taking software designed for use with a mouse
and keyboard and adapting it to a touch screen, according to the
people familiar with the matter. That will require developers to
rework PC programs to make them useful on a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chips based on ARM technology are used in most smartphones,
as well as Apple&#8217;s iPad. Still, they don&#8217;t crunch numbers and
handle other computing tasks as quickly as Intel Corp. chips,
which run the majority of PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loading a full version of Windows onto a tablet powered by
a chip designed for mobile phones may result in an unresponsive
or slow-moving machine, said Michael Cherry, an analyst at
Directions on Microsoft, a Seattle-based research firm. Existing
tablets based on Windows are difficult to use, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Current Windows tablets are what I call Frankentablets --
part laptop&#8221; and part tablet, he said. &#8220;They do neither role
well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft should leave Windows in the PC environment, where
it works best, and focus instead on scaling up its mobile-phone
software to work on the bigger screen of a tablet, Cherry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then There&#8217;s Google &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has sparred with Apple since the birth of the PC.
Windows won early rounds, relegating Macintosh computers to less
than 10 percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&#8217;s also contending with Google Inc., the Mountain
View, California-based Internet company behind the Android
mobile-phone operating system. Earlier this year, Android
surpassed Apple by number of devices running the software in the
U.S., according to NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Dell Inc. and Samsung, which use
Microsoft&#8217;s software in their PCs, are already working on
tablets based on Android as they try to keep from losing ground
to Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer it takes Microsoft to get an operating system
into tablets, the less likely the company can challenge Apple
and Google, said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies,
a research firm in Campbell, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given this late move by Microsoft, it would still be
quite an uphill battle,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
Petershill Fund agreed to buy a minority stake in Mount Lucas
Management Corp., a global macro hedge-fund manager with $1.8
billion under management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Lucas will keep autonomy over management, operations
and investment strategies, the Newtown, Pennsylvania-based fund
said today in a statement. The size and value of the investment
weren&#8217;t disclosed. Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman at New York-
based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the Petershill
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Petershill fund is part of the firm&#8217;s
asset-management division and invests in hedge-fund managers.
The fund has acquired stakes in Capula Investment Management
LLP, Trafalgar Asset Managers and Shumway Capital Partners LLC.
Level Global Investors LP, a New York-based fund that sold a
stake to Petershill in April, had its offices raided by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation last month in connection with an
insider-trading probe. The fund told clients that the government
said it wasn&#8217;t a target of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul DeRosa, 69, a principal at Mount Lucas, will become
chairman of the firm at the end of this year, the company said
today. DeRosa is assuming a position that has been vacant since
Frank Vannerson died in March 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeRosa will no longer be involved in daily management of
the $1.2 billion MLM MacroPeak, the company&#8217;s global macro
strategy, Mount Lucas said. Robert J. Barbera, Mount Lucas&#8217;s
chief economist, will take over DeRosa&#8217;s role in MLM MacroPeak&#8217;s
portfolio management, the firm said. That strategy has returned
15.8 percent a year, on average, since it began in February
1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Lucas was co-founded in 1986 by Vannerson and Tim Rudderow, the firm&#8217;s president. The pair, along with two other
co-founders who have since left, had previously worked at
Commodities Corp., the Princeton, New Jersey-based company that
helped start the careers of macro hedge-fund managers Bruce Kovner, Louis Bacon and Paul Jones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1987, Mount Lucas won Eastman Kodak Co. as a client, one
of the first pension funds to hire a futures manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the macro fund, Mount Lucas manages $500
million in its MLM Index, a diversified index of major futures
markets, and $100 million in a long-only stock fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup
Inc. were among U.S. banks that closed or delayed opening most
of their branches in the Northeast today after a blizzard dumped
more than a foot of snow on the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business in cities from Philadelphia to Boston ground to a
crawl and travel was disrupted for a second consecutive day as
airports closed and train service was interrupted or halted amid
waist-high snow drifts and winds gusting to 30 mph (48 kph). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, and
Citigroup closed all retail branches in New Jersey where
authorities declared a state of emergency and closed state
offices, according to company representatives. Citigroup closed
branches in Boston and will open some in New York and
Connecticut late today, said Natalie Riper, a company
spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of JPMorgan&#8217;s New York branches and all its
Connecticut branches are closed, they may open later today as
managers evaluate whether employees can safely get to work, said
Christine Holevas, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s retail
bank in Chicago. Retail locations in Syracuse and Rochester, New
York, are open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s based on the safety of employees getting there and
the security of the branch,&#8221; Holevas said. &#8220;We want to open
more branches, but we&#8217;d like to be smart about it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also closed three office buildings on Long Island
and in New Jersey and employees worked from home. The bank&#8217;s
Manhattan headquarters remained open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Bank of America Corp. branches in Manhattan will
remain closed today, said Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender, the largest U.S. bank by
assets. Several branches were open in New England, and customers
should check the bank&#8217;s website for updates, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really on a case-by-case basis,&#8221; Burke said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We thought they would reopen by noon, but
if you look at the transit updates, a majority of the lines are
having issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City&#8217;s Central Park had 20 inches (51 centimeters)
of snow by 8 a.m. local time as the center of storm that started
in the city at mid-day yesterday shifted north and east, the
National Weather Service said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm, which began in the South over the Christmas
holiday, also brought snow as far south as parts of
Jacksonville, Florida, AccuWeather said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Motors Co., the automaker
one-third owned by the U.S. government, rose 2 percent after
analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Barclays Plc recommended
buying the shares 40 days after trading began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley,
Citigroup Inc., Royal Bank of Canada and Credit Suisse Group AG
also today advised buying shares of Detroit-based GM, which
raised more than $20 billion through an initial public offering
of common and preferred shares last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson, who led GM through the
IPO 16 months after it emerged from bankruptcy, has said the
automaker can make &#8220;significant&#8221; profit amid U.S. sales about
30 percent below the 16.8 million unit annual average from 2000
to 2007. Sales may rise to 12.9 million in the U.S. next year,
Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, said yesterday
in an interview with Pimm Fox on Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the economy improves, the auto market will pick up and
investors are going to boost exposure in the industry,&#8221; Walter Todd, who helps manage about $900 million at Greenwood Capital
Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM rose 72 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $35.32 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 7 percent from the start of trading Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebit, Tax Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM is on a path to earn $5.9 billion of earnings before
interest and taxes in North America this year, Brian Johnson, an
analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, wrote in a research
note. Ebit in North America was $4.94 billion through Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deferred tax assets that stayed with GM through bankruptcy
are worth $9.18 per share, wrote Adam Jonas, a New York-based
analyst at Morgan Stanley. The assets were accumulated in part
as predecessor General Motors Corp. lost $82 billion from 2005
to 2008, and they may allow GM to avoid paying U.S. cash taxes
until 2018, Jonas wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, 10 have a &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating on the shares, and four rate GM &#8220;hold.&#8221; The average
target price is $43.45, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM debuted at a &#8220;deep discount&#8221; to Ford and is trading at
3.9 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization, and pension income, wrote Christopher Ceraso, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. Ford trades at a multiple
of 5.5 times, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discount to Ford &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think GM&#8217;s current discount to Ford is justified, but
that the gap will close materially in 2012 as GM&#8217;s product cycle
hits its stride and Ford&#8217;s shifts to a lower gear,&#8221; Ceraso
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM has said it plans to begin building the Chevrolet Sonic
small car next year. That will be followed by the Chevrolet
Malibu midsize sedan in 2012 and Impala full-size sedan in 2013,
according to Himanshu Patel, an analyst at JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automaker may generate $4.3 billion in free cash flow
this year before pension payments, wrote Patel, who is based in
New York. At that cash flow, GM could achieve its goal of wiping
out debt and pension liabilities by 2013, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM&#8217;s European operations, which lost $1.2 billion on an
Ebit basis in three quarters this year, may break even in 2012,
wrote Barclays&#8217; Johnson and Patel of JPMorgan. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
Jonas said GM Europe may break even in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not believe that GM Europe is likely to be
profitable on a sustainable basis,&#8221; Credit Suisse&#8217;s Ceraso
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40-Day Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Stock Exchange and Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority rules prevent analysts at firms that manage IPOs from
releasing research for 40 days, according to the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup led
the IPO that included more than 30 underwriters, according to GM
regulatory filings. Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and RBC were also listed in GM&#8217;s
prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading of GM options rose to almost double the four-week
average, with volume for calls to buy the stock changing hands
2.7 times as much as puts to sell. The most-active contracts
were March $38 calls, which rose 52 percent to 91 cents and
accounted for almost one fifth of all 53,768 calls traded today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM&#8217;s 8.375 percent bonds due in July 2033, which were
issued by the old General Motors Corp. and will eventually
convert to shares in the new company, rose 1.25 cents to 34
cents on the dollar at 2:26 p.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond-pricing service of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The bonds have gained four consecutive
days to the highest since Nov. 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. call-options volume
jumped to almost triple the four-week average, with the most
trading concentrated in bets that the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker
will rally 8 percent by April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 147,000 calls to buy Pfizer stock changed hands, the
most in seven weeks and eight times the number of puts to sell,
as of 4 p.m. in New York. The shares climbed 0.6 percent to
$17.59. Almost half of today&#8217;s volume was in two block trades of
the April $19 calls, which rose 50 percent to 30 cents for the
second-biggest gain among all of the drugmaker&#8217;s options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a straight-up directional trade,&#8221; said Steven Williams, an options strategist at Louis Capital Markets LP in
New York. &#8220;With the recent bump in Pfizer&#8217;s dividend, this is
likely a bet that it will catch up to the broader market. It&#8217;s
the first big trade I&#8217;ve seen in the last few weeks where people
are going after yield stocks like this, and its likely to be a
precursor to more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said Dec. 13 that it will raise its quarterly
dividend 2 cents to 20 cents a share, after cutting the payout
last year to help fund its $68 billion Wyeth acquisition. The
New York-based company also named George Lorch board chairman,
replacing Jeffrey Kindler, who resigned from his positions as
chairman and chief executive officer on Dec. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker is down 3.3 percent this year, lagging the
1.1 percent advance for health stocks in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index and the 13 percent rally for the benchmark itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April $19 calls had an open interest of 572 existing
contracts before today, which indicates that buyers of new
positions initiated almost all of the transactions in that
contract. The shares must rally 8 percent by expiration on April
15 to reach the strike price. Pfizer hasn&#8217;t closed above $19
since February. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. reported an upset and
shutdown at its Richmond refinery in California, according to a
filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report shortly before 2 a.m. to the California
Emergency Management Agency said the plant &#8220;has been shut
down.&#8221; However, Devra Lewis, a hazardous materials specialist
at the Contra Costa County Health Services Department, said
there wasn&#8217;t a shutdown and the plant was back online within 15
minutes of the upset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a release of sulfur dioxide into the
atmosphere, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not comment on day-to-day operations at the
Richmond refinery,&#8221; Brent Tippen, a company spokesman, said in
an e-mail. Customers were unaffected, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has a capacity of more than 240,000 barrels a
day and operates a fluidized catalytic cracker and a
hydrocracker, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, with the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index extending the biggest December rally
since 1991, as a report showed the best holiday sales for
retailers in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target Corp. and Abercrombie  Fitch Co. rallied at least
0.4 percent after MasterCard Advisors&#8217; SpendingPulse said
Christmas retail sales, excluding autos, jumped 5.5 percent.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. added 0.2 percent as copper
advanced to a record. General Motors Co. rose 2.4 percent as at
least seven firms, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan
Stanley, initiated coverage of the automaker with a positive
view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,259.31 at 9:35 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average advanced 17.86 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,572.89. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People got tired of putting money in their pockets,&#8221;
said Walter Todd, who helps manage about $900 million at
Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina.
&#8220;There&#8217;s been a fair amount of consumer demand. That&#8217;s a very
positive indication of an economic recovery and signals a pretty
decent upcoming year for stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose for the sixth day in seven yesterday,
reversing losses of as much as 0.4 percent from earlier in the
session as American International Group Inc. led financial
shares higher after announcing $4.3 billion in bank credit
lines. The benchmark gauge, which is up 13 percent this year and
6.5 percent this month through yesterday, is heading for the
biggest December rally since 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices dropped more than forecast in October, a sign
housing will remain a weak link as the U.S. recovery accelerates
into the new year. The SP/Case-Shiller index of property values
fell 0.8 percent from October 2009, the biggest year-over-year
decline since December 2009, the group said today. The decrease
exceeded the 0.2 percent drop projected by the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report today may show consumer confidence rose to a
seven-month high in December. The Conference Board&#8217;s confidence
index increased to 56.3 this month from 54.1 in November,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail sales, excluding autos, rose to $584 billion from
Nov. 5 through Dec. 24, said MasterCard Advisors&#8217; SpendingPulse,
which measures retail sales by all payment forms. That compared
with a 4.1 percent gain a year earlier. The numbers include
sales made over the Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target, Abercrombie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target, rallied 0.4 percent to $60.27. Abercrombie rose 0.5
percent to $57.42. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw materials producers rallied following a rebound in
commodities prices. Copper gained to a record in New York for a
second day as investors sought alternatives to depreciating
currencies and on expectation demand will outpace supply as
consumption improves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeport, the largest publicly traded copper producer,
gained 0.2 percent to $118.82. Newmont Mining Corp. added 1.7
percent to $61.08. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Motors advanced 2.4 percent to $35.44. JPMorgan,
Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital, Citigroup Inc., Bank of America
Corp., Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG recommended the
automaker&#8217;s stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GM has the chance to translate competitive costs and a
strong balance sheet into something it hasn&#8217;t been able to do in
50 years,&#8221; Adam Jonas, an London-based analyst at Morgan
Stanley, wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. revoked the visa of
President Hugo Chavez&#8217;s ambassador to Washington as part of a
five-month diplomatic feud between the two countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernardo Alvarez, who has overseen Venezuela&#8217;s stormy
relations with the U.S. since 2003, was expelled after Chavez on
Dec. 28 said he was ready for the U.S. to break off diplomatic
ties, Venezuela&#8217;s communications ministry said. Chavez has been
refusing since July to welcome the Obama administration&#8217;s choice
of Larry Palmer as its next envoy to Caracas and on Dec. 20
delivered an official letter of protest rejecting the nominee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We said there would be consequences when the Venezuelan
government&#8221; refused to accept Palmer&#8217;s appointment, Mark Toner,
deputy State Department spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We have taken appropriate, proportional and
reciprocal action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmer angered Chavez after the former U.S. ambassador to
Honduras told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the
Venezuelan army has low morale and that members of the
government have &#8220;clear ties&#8221; with terrorist organizations in
neighboring Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez is currently in Caracas, Toner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations Rupture &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez blamed the rupture of relations on the U.S. for
sticking with a choice for ambassador who had &#8220;violated the
most elemental international laws and conventions&#8221; by openly
criticizing Venezuela. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the U.S. government is going to expel our ambassador
there, then do it. If the U.S. government is going to break off
diplomatic relations -- do it,&#8221; Chavez said in comments carried
on state television Dec. 28. &#8220;It&#8217;s not my fault. It&#8217;s theirs
for naming an ambassador who immediately goes to the press to
rant against the country where he is going as ambassador.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez said on Dec. 18 that Palmer would be turned back at
the airport if he were to board a plane for Venezuela. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Chavez threatened to cut off oil sales to the
U.S., only to back down after a week. Venezuela sells more than
half of its oil output to the U.S., which got about 10 percent
of its crude oil imports from Venezuela in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez had expelled the previous U.S. ambassador, Patrick Duddy, in 2008, in solidarity with Bolivia, which sent home the
American ambassador there and accused the U.S. of backing
opposition movements in both countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez was expelled from his post in retaliation during
the earlier standoff. He was reinstated in June 2009 with
relations normalized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBIA Inc. shares surged after
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA and Barclay&#8217;s Bank Plc said they are
withdrawing from a lawsuit over the company&#8217;s decision to split
its insurance unit in two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond insurer&#8217;s stock rose 8.8 percent to $10.36, the
most in the Russell 1000 Index today and its biggest gain since
Oct. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2009, the Armonk, New York-based debt insurer
separated its municipal bond insurance business from its
structured-finance guarantees, including those on mortgage-
related securities that caused MBIA to lose its AAA credit
ratings in 2008. In May 2009, Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase, UBS AG and 15 of the world&#8217;s largest financial companies
sued MBIA, saying that the split illegally cut their odds of
getting paid on structured-finance policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit will continue for the remaining plaintiffs,
according to a filing today with the New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays declined to comment, said Erica Chase, a
spokeswoman for the company in New York. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York, didn&#8217;t immediately return
a call seeking comment. A call to Kevin Brown, a spokesman for
MBIA, wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA has said it plans to begin insuring municipal bonds
again once the litigation over the split concludes. The company
hasn&#8217;t insured the securities since losing its top rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading of bullish MBIA options soared to a record. Almost
82,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands, 30 times the four-
week average and 10 times the number of puts to sell. Investors
who have sold a stock short sometimes protect against losses by
buying call options, which act as a hedge against losing money
in the short sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index extending its biggest December rally since
1991, led by energy companies as crude oil remained above $90
for a fifth straight day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlumberger Ltd., the largest oilfield services provider,
and Occidental Petroleum Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. oil and
natural gas producer by market value, led energy companies to
the biggest gain among 10 industries in the SP 500. BJ&#8217;s
Wholesale Club Inc. jumped 7.1 percent after the New York Post
said it may receive a takeover bid. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Morgan Stanley declined after Mike Mayo, an analyst, reduced
earnings estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 gained 0.1 percent to 1,259.78 as of 4 p.m. in
New York, the highest since Sept. 8, 2008, and its 13th gain in
the past 15 trading days. The Dow average climbed 9.84 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 11,585.38, its highest on a closing basis
since August 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The longer oil stays above $90, the more people are
convinced there&#8217;s a more stable price deck above $80 and
potentially higher,&#8221; said Michael Shinnick, a money manager in
South Bend, Indiana, for Wasatch Advisors Inc., which has $8.5
billion under management. &#8220;As a group, energy stocks haven&#8217;t
priced in $80- to $90-a-barrel oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has gained 6.7 percent this month. Last week it
closed above 1,251.70 for the first time since Sept. 12, 2008,
the last trading day before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed
the world&#8217;s biggest bankruptcy and prompted a 46 percent drop
for the benchmark gauge through March 2009. Industry reports on
business conditions and pending home sales tomorrow are expected
to show growth, according to economist forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spur Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index has surged 20 percent since Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke suggested on Aug. 27 that he was
prepared to purchase more bonds to spur economic growth. The
central bank eventually announced that second round of
quantitative easing in November, while President Barack Obama
this month agreed to extend tax cuts to aid the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to have more of the same next year,&#8221; said
Thomas Steinemann, chief strategist at Vontobel Asset Management
Ltd. in Zurich, whose parent company manages about $80 billion.
&#8220;There is enormous fiscal stimulus. Where it all leads is
another question, but the surprise is probably on the upside for
the economy and for equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 may end 2011 at 1,374, or 9.2 percent higher
than yesterday&#8217;s close, according to the average of 11 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading Slows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading slowed this week as a snowstorm hit the U.S. east
coast after the Christmas holiday break. About 468 million
shares changed hands on the NYSE on Dec. 27, the fewest for a
full-day session since May 1998, while 560 million shares were
traded in yesterday&#8217;s session and 520 million today. The average
over the past 100 days is 1.01 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 1.2 million airline customers may have been
affected by almost 8,000 flight cancellations as the storm that
hit three days ago closed major airports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.&#8217;s business
barometer, a gauge of business conditions, is forecast to show a
15th consecutive month of expansion in December. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey is 61 after a reading of 62.5 in
November. Readings above 50 indicate improving conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pending sales of previously owned homes probably rose 0.5
percent in November from the prior month, according to the
median estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlumberger, Occidental &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlumberger rose 1.7 percent to $83.63 and was the biggest
contributor to the SP 500&#8217;s gain. Occidental advanced 1.4
percent to $99.03. Energy companies in the index rose 0.8
percent as a group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil is trading over $90 for the first time since
October 2008 amid signs global demand is picking up. Crude for
February delivery fell 37 cents to $91.12 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BJ&#8217;s jumped 7.1 percent to $47.62. Private-equity firm
Leonard Green  Partners LP may present a hostile takeover bid
for the third-largest U.S. wholesale chain if the retailer
doesn&#8217;t auction itself &#8220;in the coming weeks,&#8221; the New York
Post said, citing unidentified sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined 0.9 percent to $167.63 and Morgan
Stanley fell 1.4 percent to $27.28. Mike Mayo at Credit Agricole
Securities USA Inc. lowered fourth-quarter earnings estimates
for the two securities firms, citing lower-than-expected trading
in their fixed-income, currencies and commodities units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble Energy Rises &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble Energy Inc. advanced 2.6 percent to $87.16. The oil
and natural-gas producer announced in a statement a
&#8220;significant&#8221; natural gas discovery at the Leviathan
exploration prospect off Israel&#8217;s coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Co. rose 2.7 percent to $68.92. The world&#8217;s
biggest seed company may get an earnings boost of 15 cents to 30
cents a share from a recent 20 percent increase in glyphosate
prices in China, Michael Cox, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos.
in Minneapolis, said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA Inc. jumped 8.8 percent to $10.36 after JPMorgan Chase
Bank NA and Barclay&#8217;s Bank Plc said they are withdrawing from a
lawsuit over the company&#8217;s decision to split its insurance unit
in two. The lawsuit filed in May 2009 by 18 of the world&#8217;s
largest financial companies will continue for the remaining
plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Brennan couldn&#8217;t sit still.
During a meal of beef and potatoes at AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s drug
research center near Stockholm in October, Brennan, the
company&#8217;s chief executive officer, grilled six drug-development
managers over a concern raised by a laboratory scientist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That morning, the newly recruited researcher told Brennan
during a town hall-style meeting that he didn&#8217;t have the freedom
he would have in academia to pursue unusual ideas. Brennan
wanted to know why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was quite amazing to see how agitated he was over one
question,&#8221; recalls Samantha Budd, who left her own lab in San
Diego 10 years ago to head neurological research at AstraZeneca
in Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brennan, 57, has more reason than most drug-company CEOs to
ensure that his scientists are happy and productive, Bloomberg
Businessweek reports in its Jan. 3 edition. While competitors
such as GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Sanofi-Aventis SA expand into
flea sprays and energy drinks to offset slowing drug revenue,
AstraZeneca is sticking to one business -- developing
pharmaceuticals innovative enough to command premium prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betting on drug discovery is risky these days. The industry
has gone through a dry spell, with none of the 15 best-selling
drugs winning approval in the past six years, according to data
compiled by IMS Health Inc., a Norwalk, Connecticut-based
provider of market information, and Bloomberg. More than half of
London-based AstraZeneca&#8217;s $32.8 billion in sales came from
drugs that may face generic competition by 2014. The company is
one of the worst performers among big drugmakers in winning
regulatory approval of new medicines in the U.S. or European
Union in the past three years, according to statistics compiled
by a competitor, Novartis AG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should stop betting that
Chile&#8217;s peso will beat Mexico&#8217;s currency, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. recommended today in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank had suggested in September that
investors should bet Chile&#8217;s peso would outperform Mexico&#8217;s as
Chinese economic growth bolstered demand for Chile&#8217;s main
export, copper, while sluggish U.S. demand slowed Mexican
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chilean peso today reached a 31-month high of 468.95
per U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s economy and growth
forecast make it a stronger candidate than South Africa to join
the BRIC group of major emerging markets, said Goldman Sachs
Asset Management&#8217;s chairman, Jim O&#8217;Neill, who first coined the
term BRIC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa was formally asked on Dec. 23 to become a
member of the BRIC group that comprises Brazil, Russia, India
and China. President Jacob Zuma was invited to attend the third
BRIC heads of state meeting in Beijing in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey are &#8220;growth
economies&#8221; because they each account for about 1 percent of
global gross domestic product, O&#8217;Neill said in an e-mailed
report today from London. South Africa&#8217;s economy of $285 billion
compares with South Korea&#8217;s $833 billion, Turkey&#8217;s $615 billion
and Mexico&#8217;s $875 billion, according to World Bank data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is tough to see how South Africa matches up to these
four countries, never mind the BRIC countries,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Africa&#8217;s biggest economy is less than a quarter the size of
Russia, the smallest of the BRIC nations, while its population
of 49 million is dwarfed by China&#8217;s 1.36 billion, India&#8217;s 1.2
billion and Brazil&#8217;s 191 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on Goldman Sachs Growth Environment Scores, which
give countries a weighting to indicate their level of
sustainable growth and productivity, South Africa is ranked
108th out of 181 economies, with a score of 4.88. South Korea
has a score of 7.48, which is above the U.S. and Germany,
O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;

Visa After Dispute on Airline Landing</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates will
require Canadian visitors to buy a visa for the first time to
enter the country, paying as much as C$1000 ($1000) when
applying from Jan. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is the latest in a dispute over airline landing 
rights between the two countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadians must apply for a visa 15 days prior to departure,
reversing the current regulation allowing them to enter the oil-
rich country without a prior visa and at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short-term 30-day visa will cost C$250 and a three-month
visa will cost C$500, the U.A.E. Embassy in Ottawa said on its
website. A multiple-entry visa will cost C$1000 and is valid for
six months for a maximum stay of 14-days per visit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. embassy announced in November it will require
Canadians to apply for visas after an aviation dispute between
the two countries over landing rights for commercial flights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.A.E. carriers, including Emirates, have been seeking
dozens of new landing slots in Canada, contending that the six
weekly flights currently allowed are not enough to meet demand.
Transport Canada, the government agency that oversees the
airline industry, and Air Canada opposed granting more slots on
concerns that U.A.E. carriers may eat into Air Canada&#8217;s traffic
to cities such as Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes to U.S. food-safety rules
may generate sales for International Business Machines Corp.,
Oracle Corp. and other companies that can provide systems to
track outbreaks of food-borne illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House of Representatives on Dec. 21 and the Senate
last month passed a bill instructing the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to establish over the next two years how the
tracking is to be accomplished. The study may lead to FDA
requirements that farms and manufacturers buy computer systems
to monitor and track shipments, according to agriculture trade
groups that have started work on tracking technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, which awaits President Barack Obama&#8217;s signature,
may lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales for
companies that produce the labels and scanning devices to enable
tracking systems, said Ray Connelly, general manager of closely
held Truetrac, a developer of agricultural product-tracking
software in Salinas, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s the free market,&#8221; said Larry Sanders, a professor
at Oklahoma State University&#8217;s Department of Agricultural
Economics in Stillwater, Oklahoma. &#8220;The consumer is being heard
because of the problems we have been having because of E. coli
and salmonella.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez&#8217;s
currency devaluation yesterday was too &#8220;timid&#8221; to shore up
government revenue and narrow the budget deficit because the
bolivar remains overvalued, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government weakened the exchange rate on so-called
essential goods such as food and medicine by 40 percent to 4.3
bolivars per dollar, unifying its two fixed foreign exchange
rates in a bid to pull the economy out of recession, Finance
Minister Jorge Giordani said yesterday. Imports of essential
goods were previously bought at 2.6 bolivars per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the devaluation will increase the bolivar-based value
of the state oil company&#8217;s exports, the move is too marginal to
bolster tax revenue enough to trim the deficit, said Alberto Ramos, a Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs in New York.
The central government posted a deficit of 58.2 billion
bolivars, or $13.5 billion at the 4.3-per-dollar rate, in the
first 11 months of the year, according to the National Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devaluation &#8220;is not deep enough&#8221; and will not
&#8220;correct for the real overvaluation of the currency,&#8221; Ramos
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Unifying the two cash rates is
a good development, but I think it&#8217;s a relatively timid move,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giordani, speaking on state television yesterday, said that
the measure will help pull the country out of recession. The
economy contracted in 2010 for a second consecutive year as
foreign currency shortages mounted and oil production fell, the
central bank said in a report published on its website
yesterday. Venezuela is the only major Latin American nation in
recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unregulated Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision comes seven months after Chavez suspended
trading in May in the unregulated market following a plunge in
the bolivar to 8.2 bolivars to the dollar. Chavez dismantled the
unregulated, or so-called parallel currency market administered
by brokerages, which was used by Venezuelans to obtain dollars
when they couldn&#8217;t get permission from the government to buy at
the official exchange rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitme, the state-run exchange system that replaced the
parallel market, has traded on average about $36 million per day
at an average rate of 5.3 bolivars per dollar, the upper end of
a price band between 4.3 and 5.3 bolivars per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Negative Impact&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siobhan Morden, the head of Latin America strategy at RBS
Securities Inc., said the devaluation, Chavez&#8217;s second since
January, may have a &#8220;net negative impact&#8221; on the country&#8217;s
fiscal accounts because the government had been booking its
dollar debts at the 2.6 exchange rate. State-run Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, known as PDVSA, was selling only about 30 percent
of its dollars at the 2.6 rate, according to Barclays Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil accounts for about 95 percent of exports from
Venezuela, which is the largest crude producer in South America,
according to the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There might be some marginal benefits for PDVSA but it
doesn&#8217;t really help the sovereign much,&#8221; Morden, who&#8217;s based in Stamford, Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Just
unifying the rate to 4.3 seems to fall short&#8221; of what&#8217;s needed,
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product shrank 1.9 percent this year, with
the oil industry shrinking 2.2 percent and the non-oil sector
contracting 1.8 percent, according to the central bank report
released yesterday. The economy contracted 3.3 percent in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World&#8217;s Highest Inflation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation, which is already the highest among 78 nations
tracked by Bloomberg at 27 percent, may quicken further as the
weaker bolivar pushes up food prices, said Orlando Ochoa, an
economics professor at Andres Bello Catholic University in
Caracas. He said that inflation pickup will &#8220;deepen the
recession&#8221; by eroding Venezuelans&#8217; purchasing power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez said Dec. 13 that he&#8217;s also planning to increase the
country&#8217;s value-added tax rate from 12 percent to bolster
revenue and fund housing and infrastructure projects after
torrential rains left 130,000 homeless. Chavez was granted
decree powers for 18 months by the National Assembly after he
said he needed fast track legislation following the natural
disaster. He didn&#8217;t say how big an increase he would enact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devaluation, which will take effect Jan. 1, will only
provide a temporary boost to the budget, said Jaime Valdivia,
head of emerging market research at Bluecrest Capital Management
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this changes the fundamental story of
Venezuela, which is one of very high inflation, high deficits
and increasing debt problems,&#8221; Valdivia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationalizations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s benchmark dollar bonds due in 2027 rose
today, pushing the yields down to 13 percent from 13.3 percent
yesterday, according to Trace prices. Venezuelan dollar bonds
have returned 15 percent this year, beating the 11.7 percent
average gain on emerging-market dollar debt, according to
JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI+ index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez devalued the bolivar in January for the first time
since 2005 and created a multi-tiered exchange system in an
attempt to spur non-oil exports and curb the consumption of
luxury imports at subsidized exchange rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy has sputtered as Chavez&#8217;s nationalization of
companies in business ranging from cattle ranching to
telecommunications deterred investment in the country, said
Milton Guzman, an economist at Caracas-based consulting company
Fortuny, Guzman  Asociados. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Venezuela will not raise prices at state-run
Mercal stores for the 65 percent of the food that it imports at
2.6 bolivars per dollar, El Universal reported today, citing
government officials it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela will collect an additional 13 billion bolivars
($3 billion) from state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA
and the central bank will receive more money as part of the
devaluation, El Universal reported, citing Ecoanalitica analyst Asdrubal Oliveros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. must pay $1.5 million in
damages to a pharmacist who developed breast cancer after taking
one of the company&#8217;s menopause drugs, a jury in Puerto Rico
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in federal court in San Juan deliberated about 7
hours over two days before finding yesterday that Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth
subsidiary failed to properly warn Helen Rivera-Adams and her
doctors about the health risks of its Prempro menopause
medicine, one of her lawyers said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivera-Adams, suffering from the late stages of cancer,
pushed ahead with the trial &#8220;to get the message out that this
drug is dangerous,&#8221; Michael Robb, one of her lawyers, said in a
telephone interview today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how many times Wyeth
executives will have to hear that this drug ruins women&#8217;s lives
before they acknowledge it,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed with the jury&#8217;s verdict and believe
there is no basis in fact or law for this decision,&#8221; Christopher Loder, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer, said in an e-
mailed statement today. The company is weighing its legal
options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hormone therapy medicines are an important treatment
option for many women with debilitating symptoms of menopause,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has regularly
reviewed the benefits and risks of these medicines,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs Combined &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now lost eight of the
15 Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out after trial
or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the verdicts
through settlements, while other decisions are on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, according to court filings. The companies had won
the last four Prempro suits to go to trial before Rivera-Adams&#8217;s
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; San Juan Pharmacist &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivera-Adams, 62, is a pharmacist in San Juan who owns her
own drugstore, Robb said. She and her family had sought
$8 million in damages over her Prempro-linked breast cancer, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors found the drug helped cause Rivera-Adams&#8217;s cancer
and that Wyeth officials didn&#8217;t provide adequate warnings about
the drug&#8217;s cancer risks to her or her doctors, said Robb, who is
based in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivera-Adams took Prempro for 19 months before being
diagnosed with cancer in January 2002, according to court
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rivera-Adams v. Wyeth, 03-1713 (JAF), U.S.
District Court, District of Puerto Rico (San Juan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank AG climbed three
places to No. 2 in the global corporate bond underwriter
rankings this year, challenging JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s three-
year reign as the top manager of debt offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Germany&#8217;s biggest lender managed $176 billion, or 5.5
percent, of all offerings this year, up from 5.1 percent in
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with $212 billion for New York-based JPMorgan, 6.7 percent of
the market and little changed from last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks competed for bigger shares of about $1.6 billion in
bond underwriting fees available this year as debt issuance
declined. Deutsche Bank benefited after Citigroup Inc., the top
underwriter from 2000 to 2007, was hobbled by the biggest losses
and writedowns of any lender during the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Balance sheets and relationships are the two keys,&#8221; said Gary Jenkins, head of credit strategy at Evolution Securities
Ltd. in London. &#8220;Competition has always been fierce.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank helped underwrite Kraft Food Inc.&#8217;s $9.5
billion bond sale in February to finance its purchase of Cadbury
Plc, the biggest debt offering of 2010. It also helped manage
the debut European bond offering from America Movil SAB&#8217;s of 2.5
billion euros ($3.3 billion) in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When conditions were tough in the financial crisis, we
were getting deals done that other people weren&#8217;t,&#8221; said Ivor Dunbar, head of global capital markets at Deutsche Bank in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance Slumps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global issuance of corporate bonds slumped 18 percent to
$3.19 trillion, from $3.88 trillion in 2009, Bloomberg data
show. Average fees to underwrite U.S. investment-grade bonds
rose to 0.51 percent from 0.43 percent, while the typical rate
for high-yield debt issues fell to 1.64 percent from 2.08
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the biggest U.S. lender by
assets, took third place in the global underwriter rankings this
year, with $173 billion of deals, or 5.4 percent of the market,
according to Bloomberg data. That&#8217;s up from fourth place last
year. Barclays Plc was in fourth place with 4.8 percent of
deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup underwrote 4.6 percent of this year&#8217;s company
bond sales, the smallest amount in at least 12 years and after
carving out as much as 12.4 percent of the market in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup suffered more than $100 billion in losses and
writedowns during the credit crisis, Bloomberg data show,
forcing it to accept $45 billion in cash from the government and
giving taxpayers a 34 percent stake. The U.S. sold the last of
its common shares in the New York-based lender in December,
leaving the government with warrants on 465.1 million shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, the 75-year-old securities firm, was sixth
with 4.2 percent, followed by Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group
AG at 4.1 percent, putting the second-biggest Swiss lender by
assets among the top 10 underwriters for the first time since
2004, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank avoided taking a government bailout during
the financial crisis, while JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, accepted $25 billion and repaid it in June 2009.
Michael Ridley, global head of fixed-income syndicate at
JPMorgan in London, said the bank&#8217;s ability to lend helped it
get bond underwriting mandates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German lender&#8217;s bond underwriter ranking is its highest
since Bloomberg started collating the data in 1999. It placed
among the top five every year since 2002, jumping from eighth in
2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank also helped arrange utility RWE AG&#8217;s 1.75
billion-euro hybrid bond issue in September, the biggest
offering of such securities in Europe since 2006, and Frontier
Communications Corp.&#8217;s $3.2 billion sale in March, the largest
junk bond issue this year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan expect financial company
issuance to surge next year once new bank capital rules are
clarified, and forecast that the high-yield market will remain
active after a record year in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of junk bonds tallied $367 billion this year,
surpassing the previous record set in 2009 by 74 percent. Such
securities are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is a great time to strike&#8221; for new deals, said Dunbar.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a realization by clients that their cost of finance is
more likely to increase than to decrease,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s finishing plant
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, had an upset in its refinery
operations that caused a release of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen
dioxide, according to a filing to the National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident happened at 12:47 a.m. local time yesterday
and the release was fixed when the report was filed at 2:36 a.m.
The cause was not known, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center
when they release hazardous substance in excess of reportable
quantities, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News couldn&#8217;t immediately verify whether the
information in the filing was accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
