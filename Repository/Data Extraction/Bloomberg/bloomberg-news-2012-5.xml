<p>Microsoft Corp. urged a federal judge
in Seattle today to rule that Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)
unfairly demands as much as $4 billion in annual patent
royalties. </p>
<p>Microsoft said Motorola Mobility failed an obligation to
offer fair licensing terms on some patents. Motorola Mobility
filed suit in the U.S. and Europe to ban Microsoft products,
saying the software maker refuses to pay to use inventions
essential to industry standards for Wi-Fi and video technology.
U.S. District Judge James Robart said he''ll rule later. </p>
<p>The court is well aware it is being used as a pawn in a
global, industrywide business negotiation, Robart said,
according to the Seattle Times. </p>
<p>A ruling for Microsoft may support a similar complaint
against Motorola Mobility at the European Commission, and help
avoid a ban on sales of its products in Germany. Such a decision
could bolster Microsoft''s arguments in a trade dispute that the
Asia-made Xbox shouldn''t be barred from the U.S., where it was
the top-selling gaming system last year. </p>
<p>It could take a lot off the table, said Michael
Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School in Camden, New
Jersey, who specializes in intellectual property and antitrust
issues. It could affect what''s going on in both the courts and
the agencies. </p>
<h2>Royalty Dispute </h2>
<p>The hearing today centered on whether Motorola Mobility
fulfilled its obligation to make a fair offer to Microsoft for
use of its patents that relate to industry standards. The judge
also is considering if Microsoft lost the right to complain
because it made no counteroffer to letters Motorola Mobility
sent in October 2010 asking for 2.25 percent in royalties on the
retail price of Microsoft products. </p>
<p>That rate would equal about $4 billion a year in royalties,
Microsoft contends. Motorola Mobility disputes that figure.
Should he reject Microsoft''s arguments, a trial is scheduled for
November that would determine the appropriate royalty rate. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility said in a statement it has established
cross-licensing relationships with more than 50 companies. Not
all of the patents it''s asserted against Microsoft are related
to industry standards. </p>
<h2>Aggressive Litigation'' </h2>
<p>Microsoft has refused to negotiate and has instead
initiated and continued to pursue an aggressive litigation
strategy aimed at attacking Motorola Mobility and the Android
platform, Jennifer Erickson, a company spokeswoman, said in
the statement. Regardless of their transparent tactics, we are
focused on resolving this matter in a way that fairly
compensates Motorola Mobility for the use of our valuable IP and
protects the interests of our stakeholders. </p>
<p>A ruling for Microsoft may limit Motorola Mobility''s
ability to strike back in patent-infringement disputes with
Apple Inc. (AAPL) involving phones that run on Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android
operating system. Google, in offering $12.5 billion to buy
Motorola Mobility, has cited the handset manufacturer''s history
and trove of patents as a bulwark against litigation meant to
slow the growth of Android. </p>
<p>The ITC is scheduled to announce May 18 a final decision in
Microsoft''s case against Motorola Mobility over Android phones. </p>
<h2>Sales Bans </h2>
<p>Microsoft and Apple have pledged not to use standard-
essential patents to block competitors'' products and demanded
that other companies follow suit. They retain the right to seek
import or sales bans on products that infringe patents that
aren''t part of any industry standard. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility and Google, in letters to U.S. and
European regulators, have said they wouldn''t seek a ban on the
use of standard-essential patents as long as there are licensing
talks under way. In court papers, Motorola Mobility said neither
Microsoft nor Apple will negotiate fairly. </p>
<p>Robart blocked Motorola Mobility on April 12 from taking
steps to implement a ban on Microsoft products in Germany until
he rules on the contract issue, a decision Motorola Mobility is
appealing. </p>
<p>David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said
the company is pleased that order remains in place and we look
forward to seeing Judge Robart''s decision on today''s hearing. </p>
<h2>European Commission Inquiry </h2>
<p>The European Commission is investigating patent-misuse
complaints filed by Microsoft and Apple against Motorola
Mobility. </p>
<p>A different judge with the U.S. International Trade
Commission rejected similar arguments Microsoft made in a case
that may result in a ban on imports of the Xbox gaming system.
That case is under consideration by the six-member commission in
Washington. </p>
<p>The ITC judge found that Microsoft infringed four Motorola
Mobility patents, while a second trade judge found that Apple
infringed a different Motorola Mobility patent related to 3G
technology. Apple has its own breach-of-contract suit pending
against Motorola Mobility. </p>
<p>Limiting the power of standard-essential patents may mean
lower royalty payments on them. Mobile-phone chipmaker Qualcomm
Inc. (QCOM), which gets more than a third of its revenue from
licensing, has said the high-profile nature of the fight may
push regulators and courts to make sweeping rules that hurt the
industry. </p>
<h2>Unforseen Circumstances'' </h2>
<p>It also could discourage companies from working together to
ensure products work across platforms, Carrier said. </p>
<p>The regulators or judges could set a broad rule that
could really have unforeseen circumstances considering how
fragile a lot of these arrangements are, Carrier said.
Standard-essential patents should have special obligations,
but those obligations should stem from the rules of the
organization. </p>
<p>The question of limits on standard-essential patents has
more urgency for Microsoft now that it faces the possibility it
won''t be able to bring the Xbox into the U.S. from manufacturing
plants in Asia. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility has called Microsoft''s objections a
competitive tool rather than a principled objection. Last
year, in a written statement to the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, Microsoft supported the right to assert standard-
essential patents at the ITC. </p>
<h2>Competition Concern </h2>
<p>I don''t think the agency looks upon itself as being in
the position to grant a compulsory license, said Tom Scott, a
patent lawyer with Goodwin Procter in Washington, who handles
ITC cases. </p>
<p>In a March 15 letter to the Justice Department and the ITC,
the Senate Judiciary Committee said it was concerned that
patent holders may choose to seek an exclusionary order from the
ITC in a manner that would threaten competition, rather than
simply dispute the reasonable terms of the license in court in a
way that would allow continued use by competitors. </p>
<p>While the largest companies spend millions of dollars in
legal fees, the fight hurts small businesses that may want to
enter the market, said Carl Howe, an analyst with Boston-based
research firm Yankee Group. </p>
<p>There are some broad questions about what the future of
these patents holds, Howe said. Maybe the idea of having
industry standards has gone by. A patent is no longer something
to promote innovation, but simply a weapon to be used in a court
of law. </p>
<p>The U.S. case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Motorola Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the District of Washington
(Seattle). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
biggest brokerage, lost money in its trading businesses on four
days in the first quarter, up from three days in the year-
earlier period. </p>
<p>The firm''s traders generated more than $100 million on nine
days in the quarter, compared with 10 days in the first three
months of 2011, the New York-based company said today in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. None of
the daily losses exceed the firm''s value-at-risk, a measure of
how much the bank estimates it could lose on 95 percent of days. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had the largest year-over-year increase in
trading revenue among the nine largest U.S. and European
investment banks, excluding accounting gains, as it posted a 21
percent increase to $4.43 billion. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said last month that the gains were balanced across
products and regions. </p>
<p>Trading revenue accounted for 40 percent of the firm''s
total in 2011. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp., the second-largest U.S. lender, said
in a filing last week that it didn''t record trading losses on
any day in the quarter. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s experimental pill to
treat rheumatoid arthritis, one of the company''s leading drug
candidates, raised serious safety concerns in trials, U.S.
regulators said today. </p>
<p>The pill, tofacitinib, carried increased risks of serious
infections and malignancies, in particular a higher chance of
lymphoma, Food and Drug Administration staff wrote. The agency
released the report ahead of a May 9 meeting of FDA medical
advisers who will review tofacitinib''s benefits and risks. </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the
body attacks itself. It causes deterioration of the joints,
which can make basic tasks such as walking or holding items
painful. The condition is treated with anti-inflammatory pills
like Aspirin, or drugs that attack the disease directly by
modifying the immune system. </p>
<p>The data the FDA saw also didn''t show that the pill stopped
the disease from progressing, according to the staff report.
This is particularly important in determining the overall
benefit-risk profile of tofacitinib, which is associated with
serious safety concerns. </p>
<p>About 1.3 million people in the U.S. had the disease in
2009, according to the National Institutes of Health. Early
detection can help slow or stop its progression. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $22.45 at the close of
New York trading. </p>
<h2>First New Pill </h2>
<p>If approved, tofacitinib would be the first new pill for
rheumatoid arthritis in a decade, according to Pfizer. It would
be used in patients who have tried and failed on methothrexate
or injections such as Abbott Laboratories'' (ABT) Humira. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, is seeking approval for doses of
five and 10 milligrams. The FDA report said that the higher dose
wasn''t justified, though. The 10 milligram dose is not
supported by the design of the Phase 3 studies, controlled data
or pre-determined analyses, the report said. </p>
<p>The FDA is scheduled to rule on the pill by August. </p>
<p>Pfizer has said it would first market the drug to patients
who have failed on the injectable treatments called TNF-
inhibitors. </p>
<p>That''s where the greatest unmet need exists today, Geno Germano, Pfizer''s president of specialty care, said on a May 1
conference call. In a statement, Pfizer spokeswoman Kristen Neese said the company believed the data showed a favorable
benefit/risk profile. </p>
<h2>Don''t Respond </h2>
<p>Pfizer estimates that 30 percent to 40 percent of
rheumatoid arthritis patients don''t respond to the TNF-
inhibitors, including Humira, which generated $7.9 billion in
2011, and Amgen Inc. (AMGN)''s Enbrel, which Pfizer shares some rights
to. Humira and Enbrel were among the top seven best-selling
medicines in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The drug may generate $1 billion in sales by 2015 if
approved, said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group in
New York who has a buy rating on the stock. Most of the risk of
a rejection by regulators involves safety, he said in a May 2
webcast with investors. </p>
<p>Tony Butler, an analyst with Barclays in New York, said in
an e-mail today that the FDA''s negative view of the pill was
as expected. </p>
<p>Investors mostly have priced the drug''s approval into the
stock, Schoenebaum said. We expected a tough AdCom and the
summary and questions reflect the FDA''s hard look at both tofa''s
efficacy and safety, he said in a note to clients today. </p>
<p>We see about a 5 percent downside to the stock, maybe $1,
if the thing is completely rejected, he said. </p>
<p>The FDA may take a stricter line on approval than it did
with previous rheumatoid arthritis drugs, Schoenebaum said.
Because it''s not as much of an unmet medical need as it was a
few years ago, the requirements have gone up, Schoenebaum
said. </p>

<p>Captain America and Iron Man have
analysts who cover Walt Disney Co. (DIS) scrambling. </p>
<p>David Joyce, a Miller Tabak  Co. analyst, yesterday raised
his fiscal 2012 profit estimates for Burbank, California-based
Disney, which reports second-quarter results today, citing the
record $207.4 million box-office debut of Marvel''s The
Avengers in the U.S. and Canada. Martin Pyykkonen, a Wedge
Partners Corp. analyst, Tuna Amobi of Standard  Poor''s, and
Brett Harriss, with Gabelli  Co., are considering revisions to
profit forecasts for the world''s largest entertainment company. </p>
<p>The film''s performance will dominate Disney''s earnings call
with analysts after U.S. markets close, even though its initial
impact won''t be clear until results for the current third
quarter are reported in August. Analysts will focus on how the
company will use the film''s success to boost sales through
Disney''s television, theme-park and merchandise arms. </p>
<p>I''m working on those models as we speak, Amobi, who is
based in New York, said in an interview. There are several
quarters you''re likely to see affected positively by this. </p>
<p>Disney is expected to report second-quarter profit of 55
cents a share, the average of 22 analysts'' estimates compiled by
Bloomberg, and an increase from 49 cents a year earlier. The
company has said it may post an operating loss of as much as
$120 million at its film studio after the March science-fiction
flop John Carter. Disney''s television networks and theme
parks made up 87 percent of its $8.83 billion in operating
income last year. </p>

<p>For years, New York City has
campaigned to reduce sugary soft drink consumption. Its latest
ads, plastered all over New York''s subways, compare sugary
drinks with globs of fat and packets of sugar. </p>
<p>Now, beverage makers, including Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo
Inc. (PEP), are squaring off against city health officials with the
industry''s first-ever subway ad campaign. Industry-sponsored
placards inside train cars tout lower-calorie options and
package sizes as progress against obesity. </p>
<p>The city''s anti-soft drink campaign is discriminatory and
singles out one product out of an array of foods and beverages,
all of which contribute equally to this very complex issue,
said Chris Gindlesperger, a spokesman for the American Beverage
Association. The ABA, the industry''s chief lobby group, placed
the pro-soft drink ads. </p>
<p>Beverage makers are trying to reverse seven years of sales
declines in the $74 billion U.S. soft drink industry, which
still generates a bulk of profits. The decline came as some
consumers shunned sugar and artificial sweeteners. The industry
has spent tens of millions of dollars to beat back proposed
sugary beverage taxes in New York state and elsewhere. </p>
<p>The ad campaign is part of a concerted effort by soda
makers to win the public relations struggle against local and
state governments. PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and the American Beverage
Association have spent as much as $70 million on lobbying and
issue ads since the beginning of 2009, according to the Center
for Science in the Public Interest. In that time, at least 30
states proposed aggressive excise taxes on soft drinks, all of
which failed amid industry push back. </p>
<h2>Subway Ads </h2>
<p>Since placing its first subway ads almost three years ago,
New York''s health department has had the system to itself. The
city''s new campaign, funded with a $100,000 federal grant,
includes 1,000 placards inside about 20 percent of the system''s
rail cars, said Sam Miller, a department spokesman. The subway
system carries on average 5.3 million commuters each weekday. </p>
<p>The city''s ads, some in Spanish, depict a cloud of sugar
packets spilling its contents, which transform into globs of fat
oozing on beverage containers below the tagline, Are you
Pouring on the Pounds? One says drinking three 20-ounce sports
drinks or sodas, or three 16-ounce energy drinks, is like
consuming 40 packets of sugar. The ads, to be posted for three
months, warn that extra calories can lead to diabetes and heart
disease. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s experimental pill to
treat rheumatoid arthritis, one of the drugmaker''s leading
therapy candidates, should be approved by U.S. regulators, an
advisory panel said. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, is seeking to sell
the pill, tofacitinib, for patients who don''t respond to other
rheumatoid arthritis treatments. A panel of advisers to the Food
and Drug Administration recommended in an 8-2 vote today in
Silver Spring, Maryland, that the agency clear the drug for
sale. The FDA isn''t required to follow the panel''s advice. </p>
<p>Tofacitinib is one of three experimental drugs from New
York-based Pfizer that this year will receive an approval
decision or report key data. If cleared for sale, the arthritis
pill may generate $1.5 billion annually by 2020, John Boris, an
analyst with Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in a May 7 note. </p>
<p>While Pfizer''s pill has safety concerns, they are similar
to other rheumatoid arthritis drugs on the market, said David
Blumenthal, a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve
University and a member of the panel. </p>
<p>This is as good as is possible at this stage in the
game, Blumenthal said at today''s panel meeting. Panel members
also said they wanted to see more data on the drug''s safety
after it was approved. </p>
<h2>Autoimmune Disease </h2>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the
body attacks itself. It causes swelling and damage in the
joints, which can make basic tasks such as walking or holding
items painful. The condition is treated with anti-inflammatory
pills like aspirin, or drugs that attack the disease directly by
modifying the immune system such as Amgen Inc. (AMGN)''s Enbrel and
Abbott Laboratories'' (ABT) Humira. </p>
<p>About 1.3 million people in the U.S. had the disease in
2009, according to the National Institutes of Health. Early
detection can help slow or stop its progression. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 0.1 percent to $22.45 at the close in New York.
Abbott declined 2.2 percent to $61.23 and Amgen fell 1.5 percent
to $69.62. </p>
<p>Pfizer appreciated the robust discussion regarding
tofacitinib, Kristen Neese, a company spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail after the vote. The clinical trial results demonstrated
a favorable benefit-risk profile and support the approval of
tofacitinib. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the
FDA. </p>
<h2>Dose Questions </h2>
<p>The panel also voted 7-2 that the pill was safe, and 10-0
that it was effective. Questions will now turn to how broad of
an indication Pfizer can get from the FDA, and whether the
agency will approve the proposed 5-milligram and 10-milligram
doses. The FDA is slated to decide on the drug by Aug. 21. </p>
<p>Panel members said they wanted to see more data on the
drug''s safety profile, and asked that Pfizer conduct follow-up
studies once the treatment goes on the market. </p>
<p>I''m a little concerned about the data showing increasing
risks, said Lenore Buckley, a panel member and professor at
the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in
Richmond. </p>
<p>Buckley said she was concerned that infections and
malignancies in patients on the drug seemed to be connected to
the length of time they stayed on the medicine. The 5-milligram dose looks better, but I''m not sure it would look
better at five or 10 years, she said. </p>
<p>Pfizer argued that both doses were effective and should be
approved. The committee feels some concern about the possible
toxicities, Buckley said. I don''t think anybody on the
committee has spoken out that the 10-milligram dose shouldn''t be
a possibility. </p>
<h2>Staff Report </h2>
<p>In a May 7 report, FDA staff said they had serious safety
concerns about tofacitinib. Rheumatoid arthritis treatments
that affect the immune system can have side effects including
increased infections and cancers. Regulators also consider
whether the medicines increase cardiovascular problems and
kidney toxicity. </p>
<p>The panel also voted 8-2 that the drug didn''t stop the
progression of the disease, measured by scans of patients''
joints. Panel members said that was a difficult measure, though,
and one that can''t always be relied on to assess a treatment''s
efficacy. </p>
<p>We''re going to be setting ourselves up for difficulties
by setting the bar a little bit too high, said Leslie
Crofford, chief of rheumatology at the University of Kentucky
College of Medicine in Lexington, Kentucky, and a panel member. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s longest-serving director and compensation committee chairman, James A. Johnson, should be re-elected to the board at the May 24 annual
meeting and the company''s 2011 compensation plan should be
approved, ISS Proxy Advisory Services USA told shareholders. </p>
<p>In the absence of immediate concerns, we are not
recommending a vote against Mr. Johnson at this time, the
proxy advisory firm wrote in its annual report on New York-based
Goldman Sachs, released today. However, we are highlighting
his nomination as a contentious issue and will monitor the vote
results. </p>
<p>Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc., a New York investment firm
that helps oversee $15 billion, including the $5.7 billion
Sequoia Fund Inc. (SEQUX), has publicly opposed Johnson''s re-election to
Goldman Sachs''s board this year. The company, whose co-founder
was a friend of billionaire Warren Buffett, criticized Johnson''s
role in egregious corporate governance debacles in an April
18 letter posted on its website. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs board recommended that shareholders re-elect Johnson, who was approved last year with 95.5 percent of
the vote. </p>
<p>He has served them well since 1999 and will continue to
do so, David Wells, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement on April 19. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s executive-compensation plan was endorsed
this year by ISS, which advised shareholders to vote against the
company''s pay package a year ago. </p>
<h2>Reasonably Aligned'' </h2>
<p>The firm awarded Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein $12.4 million for his 2011 performance, a 35
percent cut from a year earlier as profit and the stock price
fell. The package includes a $3 million cash bonus, $7 million
in restricted stock and a $2 million salary. </p>
<p>CEO pay and performance appear to be reasonably aligned
on a long-term basis at this time, ISS said. </p>
<p>The percentage of Goldman Sachs''s shareholders who cast
non-binding ballots in favor of the company''s compensation plan
fell to 73 percent last year from 96 percent a year earlier. The
board almost doubled Blankfein''s pay for 2010 even as profit
declined and the stock price was little changed. ISS, in its
opposition to the plan, cited a pay-for-performance
disconnect. </p>
<p>The compensation plan at Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, was rejected by most of the lender''s
shareholders at the company''s annual meeting last month. The
board and senior management will consult with representative
shareholders to understand their concerns, New York-based
Citigroup said. </p>
<h2>Cumulative Voting </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, fell
46 percent last year in New York trading as profit dropped 47
percent, the worst performance since 2008. The company''s
compensation committee, which decides how much to pay top
executives, has been led by Johnson as long as Goldman Sachs has
been a public company. </p>
<p>We engaged with many of our shareholders in advance of
and following our 2011 annual meeting of shareholders in order
to gain further insight and understanding into their views on
our executive-compensation program, particularly as expressed
through the advisory vote, the company said in the proxy. </p>
<p>ISS advised shareholders to vote in favor of two proposals
that Goldman Sachs''s board has opposed this year. </p>
<p>One would provide shareholders with so-called cumulative
voting, which permits investors to withhold votes from certain
director nominees in order to cast multiple ballots for others.
The other would require the bank''s named executive officers to
retain at least 75 percent of their stock for at least three
years after leaving the firm. </p>
<p>Similar proposals failed at last year''s annual meeting,
with cumulative voting receiving 25.6 percent of the vote and a
proposal requiring stock retention winning 20.6 percent. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the firm lost about $2 billion on 
synthetic credit securities after an egregious'' failure in its 
chief investment office, which the bank says focuses on hedging. </p>
<p>This portfolio has proven to be riskier, more volatile
and less effective as an economic hedge than the firm previously
believed, the New York-based company said today in a quarterly
securities filing. JPMorgan declined 5.5 percent to $38.50 in
extended trading at 5:55 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>The chief investment office has been transformed in recent
years under Dimon into a unit that makes bigger and riskier
speculative bets with the bank''s money, according to five former
employees, Bloomberg News reported April 13. Some bets were so
big that JPMorgan probably couldn''t unwind them without losing
money or roiling financial markets, the former executives said. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that London-based
trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the financial
health of corporations that were so large he was driving price
moves in the $10 trillion market. </p>
<p>After the Bloomberg report, Dimon on a conference call said
the news coverage was a complete tempest in a teapot. </p>
<p>The losses disclosed today were a little bit to do with
the article in the press, Dimon said, without specifying who
in the bank oversaw the trades. I also think we acted a little
bit too defensively to the reports. </p>
<h2>Flawed, Complex'' </h2>
<p>Synthetic credit products are derivatives that generate
gains and losses tied to credit performance without the owner
buying or selling actual debt. The losses occurred as the
company sought to unwind a portfolio of the instruments used to
hedge JPMorgan''s credit exposure. </p>
<p>In hindsight, the new strategy was flawed, complex,
poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored, Dimon
said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said the losses were partly offset by gains from
the sales from its available-for-sale credit portfolio,
resulting in a net loss for the firm''s corporate division, which
includes the CIO, of about $800 million after taxes. The losses
could widen or narrow during the rest of the quarter, Dimon
said. </p>
<p>The bank is repositioning the synthetic credit
portfolio, and the CIO may hold certain of its current
synthetic credit positions for the longer term, the firm said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the bank made egregious mistakes and
that the losses of about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit
securities were self-inflicted. </p>
<p>We''re accountable, and what happened violates
our own standards and principles about how we want to operate
the company, Dimon said in a conference call today. This is
not how we want to run a business. </p>
<p>The bank fell 6.2 percent to $38.20 at 5:26 p.m. in
extended trading in New York after disclosing the losses at its
chief investment office. Dimon said the New York-based lender
made the trades to guard against credit risk. </p>
<p>In re-hedging the portfolio, it was a bad strategy, badly
executed and poorly monitored, Dimon said. </p>
<p>Dimon told analysts they should assume his bank keeps
regulators informed about its finances and that the trades may
not run afoul of the so-called Volcker rule, which seeks to
limit banks'' bets with their own funds. </p>
<p>We do believe you need to have the ability to hedge in a
CIO-type position, and that Volcker allows that, he said.
This trading may not violate the Volcker rule, but it violates
the Dimon principle. </p>
<p>Dimon said that while the changes in prices contributed to
the losses, he didn''t want to cite what he called the excuse of
market dislocation and he said other banks may have been
spared losses from the disruption. </p>

<p>Last Nov.7, something went wrong at
a deep-sea oil well operated by Chevron Corp. (CVX) 230 miles (370
kilometers) northeast of Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>As a massive drill bit punctured reservoir N560, roughly
3,500feet beneath the ocean floor, monitors revealed pressure
much higher than technicians expected. The next day a routine
flyover of the field, called Frade, in the Campos Basin,
revealed oil on the water''s surface. </p>
<p>Chevron dispatched remote-controlled submarines, which
found oil seeping through fissures on the sea floor directly
above N560. The blowout preventer, a three-story-tall valve
assembly, automatically cut off oil flow at the wellhead. This
would not become another BP Plc disaster, in which the blowout
preventer notoriously failed, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in
its May 14 issue. </p>
<p>Still, George Buck, president of Chevron''s Brazil
subsidiary, ordered the Frade well shut down. Chevron sent 18
vessels in rotation to contain the oil on the surface, and it
readied pyramid-shaped steel caps to cover the seepage points.
Workers completed the job in just four days. Buck saw the
situation as under control. And technically, it was. </p>
<p>A petroleum engineer in his mid-forties, Buck has an MBA
and has worked for Chevron for 23years. He is 6-foot-5,
slender, soft-spoken, and earnest to the point of social
awkwardness. He arrived in Brazil in 2009, having worked from
Alaska to Texas to Indonesia. He lives with his family in Rio''s
fashionable Ipanema beach district. He is not a man about town. </p>
<p>After three years in Brazil, Buck speaks little Portuguese,
relying heavily on translators. Nevertheless, on the Frade
spill, Buck thought he had made himself quite clear. </p>
<h2>`Full Responsibility'' </h2>
<p>Chevron takes full responsibility for this incident, he
said at a press conference in Rio on Nov.21. At a congressional
hearing in Braslia two days later, he added, Sincere
apologies to the Brazilian people and the Brazilian
government. </p>
<p>Brazilian politicians and journalists were not placated. </p>
<p>We''re going to show this gang that they can''t come down
here and create whatever environmental mess they want, Carlos
Minc, a co-founder of Brazil''s Green Party and environmental
secretary of Rio state, told the newspaper O Globo. I want to
see the CEO of Chevron swim in that oil. </p>
<p>Local Greenpeace activists doused the door of Chevron''s Rio
office with black ink. Chevron: your mess, our loss, read
one protester''s placard. There is no doubt that an offense
occurred, declared Fabio Scliar, chief of the Brazilian
federal police department''s environmental division. What
interests me now is determining the responsibilities. </p>
<h2>Environmental Lawsuit </h2>
<p>In December, Eduardo Santos de Oliveira, a Brazilian
federal prosecutor, answered the police investigator''s question
when he sued Chevron for the equivalent of $11billion for
alleged environmental damage. </p>
<p>Twelve weeks later a Brazilian navy plane spotted a second
oil sheen above a different section of Frade, and on Mar.21,
Oliveira filed criminal charges against Buck and 16 other
employees of Chevron and its main drilling contractor. </p>
<p>The contractor, Transocean Ltd. (RIG), had operated the Deepwater
Horizon rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April2010,
killing 11 men and spewing 4.9million barrels of oil. </p>
<p>The Frade spill, by contrast, was capped at 2,400 barrels,
according to Chevron. There were no injuries at Frade, no
contaminated fisheries, no dead turtles, and no oil on shore --
the slick moved out to sea and broke up swiftly. </p>
<p>Even so, a judge acting at Oliveira''s request ordered the
Chevron and Transocean defendants not to leave Brazil and had
their passports confiscated. The accused, mostly veteran
expatriates, include six Americans, as well as citizens of
France, Australia, Canada and the U.K. </p>
<h2>`Contamination Bomb'' </h2>
<p>Chevron and Transocean have caused a contamination bomb
with a prolonged effect, Oliveira said, as he filed charges
against the 17. An outspoken career prosecutor who under
Brazilian law enjoys tenure in his influential civil service
position, he alleged crimes against the environment --
namely, that the defendants knew they were drilling in a high-pressure reservoir, recklessly proceeded anyway and caused
severe ecological harm. Oliveira has said that if convicted, the
defendants could face prison terms as long as 20 or 30years. </p>
<p>Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman based at company
headquarters in San Ramon, California, calls the charges
outrageous and without merit. Chevron, he said, will
vigorously defend the company and its employees. </p>
<p>Transocean likewise says that neither it nor its workers
did anything wrong. </p>
<h2>Sued Again </h2>
<p>Yet Oliveira wasn''t done. In early April he sued again,
escalating his total damages claim to $22 billion. A company
that tried to respond responsibly to a regrettable but
noncatastrophic accident was blindsided, says Rafael Jaen
Williamson, who handles public affairs for Chevron in Latin
America. There was among our guys a puzzlement. </p>
<p>For all its global reach and technological sophistication,
the second-largest U.S. energy company after Exxon Mobil Corp.
in market capitalization didn''t have an effective plan for a
sudden and multifront assault that included populist protest,
political posturing, and criminal prosecution for -- in
Chevron''s view -- cleaning up after itself. </p>
<p>Part of the blame rests with Chevron''s top executives in
Brazil. The company represented itself in a critical foreign
market with a surprisingly provincial American face. Buck, by
all accounts a talented and exacting internal corporate leader,
is not the statesman Chevron needed to explain the Frade
accident to Brazil''s media. </p>
<h2>Bungled Public Relations </h2>
<p>There was more to the crisis, though, than bungled public
relations. Chevron got caught up in Brazilian political
crosscurrents having little in particular to do with the U.S.
company but revealing much about the delicate state of Brazil''s
burgeoning oil industry. </p>
<p>They were the wrong company in the wrong place at the
wrong time, says Denis Palluat de Besset, managing director of
the Brazilian unit of the French oil company Total. </p>
<p>During a coffee break at an industry conference at an
oceanside Rio resort, Besset says he sympathizes with his U.S.
rivals. In Brazil, he adds, this could happen to any of us
at this moment. </p>
<p>Frade (pronounced FRA-dje) refers to a fish found off the
Brazilian coast. The project became Chevron''s when it bought
Texaco Inc. in 2001. Chevron operates the $3.6billion venture
and owns 51.7percent of it. </p>
<h2>Frade Partners </h2>
<p>Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), or Petrobrs, the Brazilian state
oil company, owns 30percent; a Japanese consortium, the
remaining 18.3percent. </p>
<p>Frade produced its first oil in 2009; until its recent
troubles, it generated 79,000barrels a day from 11wells. </p>
<p>The mysteriously elevated pressure encountered in reservoir
N560 in November occurred in an appraisal well, which is one
still being explored and not yet producing. </p>
<p>How Chevron made this mistake--misjudging the conditions in
an undersea oil pool--has not yet been determined. The company
says it''s studying the incident, as are Brazilian regulators. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether these investigations find negligence,
the Frade episode demonstrates once again that deep-water
drilling is a risky enterprise. Ph.D.s aren''t omniscient; their
computer models aren''t flawless. </p>
<p>The unanticipated pressure led to a surge of petroleum that
cracked the well bore, allowing oil to escape upward toward the
ocean floor in tiny rivulets. </p>
<h2>Remain Mum </h2>
<p>For the initial four days after discovering the accident,
Chevron had almost nothing to say in public in Brazil.
Executives at the company''s collegiate San Ramon, California,
campus instructed Buck to focus on the leaking oil and remain
mum until he and his colleagues had a sense of what had
happened. The Brazilian media took immediate and disapproving
note of Chevron''s lack of disclosure. </p>
<p>When Buck finally emerged to make a series of public
appearances, he delivered lengthy engineering and geology
lectures in English to reporters who don''t speak his language.
At times, he was visibly flustered when journalists shouted
questions in Portuguese. He admitted to colleagues he was out of
his depth. I''m just a driller, he said privately after one
heated encounter. </p>
<p>We didn''t necessarily put our best foot forward in some
of the communication, Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer John Watson conceded during a conference call with U.S.
securities analysts on Jan.27. </p>
<h2>Ecuador Comparison </h2>
<p>Nor did the company seem to appreciate that it has a
tainted reputation among environmental activists throughout
Latin America because of an unrelated case in Ecuador. </p>
<p>In February2011 an Ecuadorian judge imposed an $18.2
billion contamination judgment on Chevron concerning past
activities of Texaco in the Amazon rainforest. Chevron has lost
an initial appeal in Ecuador and is continuing to fight the
enormous verdict, alleging it was the product of fraud. </p>
<p>According to one Brazilian oil industry lawyer, the
Ecuadorian case has been inspirational to activists
elsewhere in the region who dream of winning their own
multibillion-dollar victory against a multinational. </p>
<p>Buck, for one, still seems baffled. Chevron''s lawyers won''t
let him sit for a formal interview, but he amiably agrees to a
handshake and brief chat in his spotless corner office. He''s
trying to go about his usual business in Rio, but it''s clearly
no fun living under a cloud of official condemnation. When you
figure out what happened here, he says, please let me
know. </p>
<h2>Chevron''s Antagonists </h2>
<p>Chevron''s antagonists in Brazil gained real momentum in
March, after the second seepage created the impression that the
company''s Frade operations were out of control. Yet, the
incident in March may turn out to be nothing at all. According
to Chevron, the event generated a surface sheen of only a single
barrel, and occurred three kilometers away from the November
spill, above a separate reservoir that had not been drilled. </p>
<p>The November and March incidents, the company says, seem to
have been unrelated. The much smaller amount of rogue oil
discovered in March was more degraded, suggesting it had been in
the water longer. It also lacked any trace of drilling mud, a
heavy industrial fluid used in appraisal and production. The
March mini-sheen, in other words, may have been entirely
natural; searching for natural seepage is part of the oil-prospecting business. </p>
<h2>Frade Shut-Down </h2>
<p>All the same, Chevron voluntarily shut down the entire
Frade field -- the largest such moratorium in the company''s
history -- to allow geologists to determine why they failed to
anticipate the high pressure in reservoir N560. </p>
<p>Chevron has coordinated with Brazilian authorities at all
stages and will continue to work with them until the incidents
are fully resolved, it says on its website. The company has
exchanged voluminous information with Brazilian environmental
and oil-industry regulators, and those agencies have announced
likely fines on the order of tens of millions of dollars (a
prospect that surprises no one involved). </p>
<p>So far, though, it appears unlikely that penalties of this
scale will satisfy Chevron critics such as Minc and Oliveira, no
matter how hard the company tries to resolve the overblown
scandal. </p>
<p>As Brazil''s first oil spill controversy following the 2010
Gulf of Mexico disaster, Frade has raised questions about
whether the country would back away from deep-sea exploration or
distance itself from foreign producers. At a March13 meeting
with securities analysts, Chevron''s Watson said the company
wants to be a player in Brazil for a long time. He hedged,
though, adding, it remains to be seen. </p>
<h2>Offshore Commitment </h2>
<p>In Rio, So Paulo, and Braslia, though, there is no
indication that the nation''s leadership or the majority of its
citizens are rethinking their commitment to offshore oil or to
some involvement of foreign energy companies. </p>
<p>Brazil is not Argentina -- where last month the government
expropriated the Spanish company Repsol YPF SA (REP)''s stake in the
petroleum producer YPF -- let alone Venezuela under the virulent
anti-American rule of Hugo Chvez. </p>
<p>Along with Chevron and Total, Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
Statoil ASA, and BP are all present in Brazil. With more than
800employees in the country, 90percent of them locals, Chevron
has the most substantial presence of any of the foreigners. The
very scale of Brazil''s hydrocarbon supply, along with a
spreading anxiety about the country''s ability to exploit the
resource safely and efficiently, helps explain Chevron''s
situation. </p>
<h2>''Presalt'' Bonanza </h2>
<p>In 2007, Brazilian geologists made the biggest oil find in
the Americas in three decades. Five miles below sea level, and
beneath a shifting layer of cretaceous salt deposits, the
discoveries have been estimated at 50billion to 100billion
barrels. </p>
<p>These presalt oil beds are spread over an area the size
of New York State. Frade is not a presalt field, although it''s
close to the 2007 find. </p>
<p>Already a commodity titan -- the world''s biggest exporter
of beef, coffee, sugar, and orange juice -- Brazil suddenly had
the potential to become a global leader in energy as well. Then-president Luiz Incio Lula da Silva declared that the presalt
opportunity demonstrated that God is Brazilian. His
successor, Dilma Rousseff, a former energy minister who was
chairman of Petrobrs for seven years during Lula''s
administration, has called the reserves her nation''s passport
to the future. </p>
<h2>''Illusion of Limitless Resources'' </h2>
<p>Norman Gall, executive director of the Fernand Braudel
Institute of World Economics, a corporate-funded think tank in
So Paulo, worries that oil-fueled euphoria has bred in the
Brazilian political class the illusion of limitless resources
on the horizon. </p>
<p>Gall points to a Lula cabinet statement issued after the
2007 discoveries that described the presalt fields as promising
extremely low exploration risks and great profitability. </p>
<p>This notion of easy prosperity propelled enactment of
nationalistic legislation requiring Petrobrs to be the sole
operator of all strategic presalt reservoirs and to own at
least 30percent of the projects. In a prescient 2011 paper,
Gall warned that these obligations will strain Petrobrs''s
already stretched manpower, financial, and technical
capacities. </p>
<p>Even before it begins to produce much oil from the presalt
fields, Petrobrs is struggling to keep pace with its own
ambitious plans. </p>
<h2>$225 Billion Expansion </h2>
<p>Last year it announced a five-year, $225billion expansion
program. Yet 2011 marked the first year in eight that Petrobrs
slowed capital expenditures, laying out 5.1percent less than it
did in 2010. Operating under strict local procurement rules, it
has had difficulty acquiring sufficient Brazilian-made vessels,
pipelines, and drilling gear. Its costs are rising faster than
predicted, and its refineries are overextended. In the fourth
quarter of 2011 these problems contributed to a 52percent drop
in net income, to $2.9billion. </p>
<p>The stock market has signaled concern: Petrobrs shares
traded publicly in New York have declined by a third over the
past year, to less than $22apiece. Rather than grapple with the
tremendous operational challenges accompanying accelerated oil
development, many Brazilian politicians are distracted by how to
divide up the anticipated profits, Gall says. They''re not
focused at all on the operations of the oil industry or whether
the industry is trying to do too much too quickly. </p>
<p>Reduce Royalties? </p>
<p>The Brazilian Congress is considering legislation that
would reduce future royalties flowing to coastal oil-producing
states and redistribute the money among all 26 Brazilian states. </p>
<p>Under the proposed law, the states of Rio de Janeiro and
Espirito Santo could lose billions of dollars a year. Rio
state''s governor has threatened a court challenge if the bill is
enacted. Not long after the Brazilian Senate approved the
royalty redistribution plan in mid-October, 150,000 people
marched in protest through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>It was amid this turmoil and uncertainty that the accident
in the Frade field occurred. In Brazil, Gall argues, there is
a tendency to project out, to push the blame out, as a way not
to think about difficult problems, like whether we have thought
through carefully all the risks of presalt. Chevron made
itself an easy target. </p>
<p>For an official known for public vehemence, Oliveira comes
across in an interview at the Federal Prosecutors'' Office in Rio
as open, friendly, and eager to explain himself. He brings with
him a pair of public-relations aides and a junior lawyer. In
every case, he says, he follows the facts wherever they take
him. </p>
<h2>Oliveira on Oliveira </h2>
<p>My professional career, since 1984, has always been
through competitive selection, he says. I never got a job
through political decisions. Although based in the city of
Campos in the state of Rio, he says he has no interest in the
debate about distribution of oil royalties. He also points out
that he helped investigate a notorious incident in 2001, when a
Petrobrs offshore platform called P-36 exploded as a result of
equipment failure, killing 11 workers. </p>
<p>Oliveira says he''s not grandstanding by threatening foreign
oil workers with prison. Criminal behavior demands stern
punishment, he says. </p>
<p>There is no nationalism or xenophobia. As for his
demand for tens of billions of dollars in damages, he points out
that Chevron has every right to dispute this figure, to try to
adjust the size. </p>
<h2>Chevron Refutes </h2>
<p>Previously, he has stressed the scope of ecological damage;
in the interview, he focuses on the incalculable structural
damage he alleges that Chevron caused the Frade field. Our
concern is that the geology of the field has been compromised.
Chevron says this isn''t so and that it intends to resume
exploration and production in Frade. </p>
<p>Without prompting, the prosecutor announces what seems like
big news: He plans to add another major U.S. company as a
defendant in his multibillion-dollar suit. </p>
<p>Halliburton Co. (HAL), the oil services company, he claims,
failed to use sufficient steel piping and cement in doing what''s
known as completion work on the well that leaked. Asked about
this allegation, a Chevron spokesman says it''s incorrect. </p>
<p>While Halliburton did help finalize construction of other
wells at Frade, the well was plugged before Halliburton''s
services were needed, according to Chevron. A Halliburton
spokeswoman likewise says the company wasn''t involved in the
completion work at the well. </p>
<p>Shoot From Hip? </p>
<p>Queried the next day, Oliveira says he saw Halliburton''s
name in a police investigative report on the Frade accident. He
is continuing to study the contractor''s exact role. His shoot-from-the-hip style, however, leaves Oliveira''s intentions toward
Halliburton unclear. </p>
<p>Brazilian politics and business are not easy to
understand from the outside, says Luis Octavio da Motta Veiga.
A lawyer for oil, mining, and banking interests, Motta Veiga
formerly headed the Brazilian equivalent of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Twenty-two years ago he served briefly
as chairman of Petrobrs. While he has no direct involvement in
the Frade matter, he contends that Brazilian attitudes toward
environmental threats vary according to the alleged violator. </p>
<p>Petrobrs owns 30percent of Frade [and] has had eight
small spills in the past year, and I have heard nothing about it
in terms of protest, the attorney notes. It is easier to
complain about the foreigners rather than Petrobrs, Brazil''s
flagship corporation, a source of national pride, and a funder
of numerous cultural causes. </p>
<h2>Headline-Generating Cases </h2>
<p>As for Oliveira, Motta Veiga says, the U.S. has no
equivalent official. As a tenured civil servant, Oliveira cannot
be dismissed as someone motivated by lust for campaign
contributions or reelection. This species of prosecutor,
however, makes a name by bringing headline-generating cases,
often framed in the most extreme terms imaginable, with the
widely held expectation that in due course the judicial process
will winnow down the allegations and damage claims. </p>
<p>He can ask for the highest damages possible, says
Claudio dell''Orto, president of the Rio State Magistrates
Association. Then, with the evidence, the value gets
adjusted. </p>
<p>In recent weeks the situation got even more complicated.
Going after Chevron, it''s become clear, will have collateral
consequences. The controversy has been a factor in the delayed
bidding process for the presalt oil fields, which will be the
first round of offshore licensing in Brazil since 2008.
Originally scheduled for late 2011, the globally awaited auction
is now expected in 2013 at the earliest. </p>
<h2>New Leak </h2>
<p>Petrobrs on March30 spoke for the first time about the
Frade affair. In a Brazilian regulatory filing, the company
warned investors that it theoretically could bear some liability
for the accident and called Oliveira''s gigantic damage estimates
unreasonable. </p>
<p>Chevron on April7 announced that while investigating the
ocean floor near Frade, it found a small amount of oil leaking
from the sea bed of a Petrobrs-controlled field called Ronador
-- this was the last in the series of minor Petrobrs leaks to
which Motta Veira referred. This alert was met by a lack of
excitement among Brazilian journalists and public officials. </p>
<p>Two days later, on April9, while accompanying President
Rousseff on an official state visit to Washington, Petrobrs CEO
Maria das Graas Foster commented on the Frade spill and
Chevron. We have a very good partnership in Brazil, she said
at an event at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but they are the
operators, so they need to give the official answers. </p>
<h2>First Welcome News </h2>
<p>Finally, on April11, Chevron received its first welcome
news in the matter when a Brazilian federal judge denied a
request from the prosecutor Oliveira to suspend the company from
operating in the country as part of his multibillion-dollar
suit. </p>
<p>Chevron said in a statement it acted diligently and
appropriately, and in accordance with the best practices in the
oil industry. The denial of the injunction suggests the
judiciary will examine the legal actions against Chevron and its
employees with appropriate skepticism, says David Meiler, a
partner with Felsberg  Associates, a Rio law firm that
represents drilling contractors but is not involved in the Frade
case. This is actually an opportunity for the judiciary to
demonstrate its independence, Meiler adds. </p>
<p>In early May the judge allowed Buck and four other foreign
workers to leave Brazil on the condition that they return to
face the still-pending criminal charges. </p>
<p>Barring evidence of malfeasance, Meiler predicts that none
will go to prison. All charges against one Chevron employee have
already been dropped, the company says. </p>
<p>For the moment, the threat still hangs over them, and the
Brazilian legal system grinds slowly. </p>
<p>This is going to take forever, unfortunately, Meiler
says. Oliveira, the prosecutor, explains that in Portuguese,
forever translates into five, six, 10 years. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled a new design
for its Bing Internet search engine to make results more social
by listing related functions and content from a user''s friends,
without encroaching on regular query results. </p>
<p>The new design, being introduced in the U.S. over the next
few days, divides the Web page into three. On the left, the
biggest pane displays basic search results. The center column
lists tasks associated with the query -- looking for restaurants
will bring up maps and reservations pages. The final column
shows related content from friends, such as who could help with
the search and who liked an eatery on Facebook (FB) Inc.''s site. </p>
<p>The update is the biggest change since the release of Bing
three years ago, when Microsoft completely overhauled its search
offerings, the company said in a blog post today. Microsoft
accounted for 15.3 percent of U.S. searches in March, according
to ComScore Inc., compared with 66.4 percent for market leader
Google Inc. (GOOG) The changes build on a partnership between Microsoft
and Facebook to integrate social data into search results. </p>
<p>Microsoft held an event today in San Francisco to
demonstrate the new product. The new design will be available on
mobile devices in the coming weeks, the company said. </p>
<p>Bing previously listed social content together with regular
search results, though few people used the function, and
customers complained it cluttered the results and made them
noisy, said Stefan Weitz, a director for Bing. </p>
<h2>Microsoft Study </h2>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based company said its basic search
results are now preferred to Google by users in a recent blind
study it conducted. The study, which shows search results
without telling test subjects whether they are from Bing or
Google, showed 43 percent preferred Bing, while 28 percent
preferred Google. In the same Microsoft study done in January
2011, 34 percent chose Bing to Google''s 38 percent. </p>
<p>The new Bing design''s middle pane, which displays actions
related to queries, relies on partnerships with companies like
Yelp Inc., OpenTable Inc. (OPEN) and ticket-comparison site FanSnap,
Microsoft said. </p>
<p>The social sidebar lets searchers pose the query to their
Facebook friends, gives a list of friends with expertise in the
area of the search and lists people who may be influential on
that topic outside of the searcher''s friend list by culling data
from sites like Twitter Inc., Foursquare Labs Inc., LinkedIn
Corp. and Google''s Google+ social network. </p>
<h2>Reinvent Search'' </h2>
<p>The company is trying to gain users by taking the huge
volume of social data created -- articles people read, songs
they listen to and places they''ve visited -- and funneling it
into search results, said Qi Lu, president of Microsoft''s online
services division, in a speech at the event. </p>
<p>Search, the gateway to the Web, needs to be reinvented to
unlock that vast potential, he said. We aspire to lead
innovation that will reinvent search for the future. </p>
<p>The pane also has an activity feed that shows questions
your friends have asked and posts they have chosen to share.
Users can answer the questions or like the post and the
activity will show up in both Bing and Facebook, the world''s
largest social-networking service. </p>
<p>Google in January announced a service called Search, Plus
Your World, which displays items such as photos, news and
comments users put on Google+ or from friends'' posts. Google
doesn''t have the same types of deals with Facebook and Twitter
that Microsoft does. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, positioned itself for a decline in
the value of Spanish government bonds and a rally in Italian
sovereign debt during the first quarter. </p>
<p>The firm''s market exposure to Spanish government bonds
shifted to a negative $446 million in March from a positive $151
million in December, the New York-based firm disclosed in a
quarterly regulatory filing. For Italian sovereign debt, the
exposure surged to $2.51 billion in March from $210 million in
December, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs discloses the firm''s credit and market stance
for Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain each quarter
because those five countries are viewed by investors as Europe''s
riskiest. Concern about the continent''s financial crisis has
reignited since the end of the quarter as Greek voters balked at
austerity measures and Spain prepared a fourth attempt to
overhaul its financial system. </p>
<p>Credit exposure shows the risk from a default or credit
deterioration of the counterparty or borrower, and market
exposure is the potential loss tied to price changes. </p>
<p>Total credit exposure to the five nations fell 14 percent
in the first quarter to $2.52 billion from $2.93 billion,
according to the filing. Total market exposure more than
quadrupled to $2.68 billion from $585 million. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s bankrupt Quigley Co.
unit will continue its eight-year bankruptcy, and seeks to
challenge a federal appeals court ruling, a Pfizer lawyer said. </p>
<p>Jay Goffman told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in
Manhattan court today that Pfizer may challenge a higher court''s
ruling in April that found Pfizer isn''t entitled to protection
from some asbestos claims related to Quigley. </p>
<p>Pfizer also plans to proceed with Quigley''s bankruptcy, and
seeks to have it exit court protection in September. </p>
<p>We think they got it wrong, Goffman said of the April
appeals court ruling, adding that Pfizer may bring a challenge
to the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped most
operations in 1992, filing for bankruptcy in 2004. Pfizer has
said it never made or sold any Quigley products, and some
claimants hadn''t released Pfizer from alleged derivative
liability. </p>
<p>Bernstein had ruled in bankruptcy court that Quigley''s
Chapter 11 case barred certain lawsuits against Pfizer. A May
2011 decision in district court reversed the order, and Pfizer
had appealed that ruling. </p>
<p>We affirm the district court, three judges said in
April''s ruling that upheld the May decision. In doing so, they
found that the law firm Peter G. Angelos can sue Pfizer based on
manufacturer liability under Pennsylvania law. </p>
<h2>1999 Lawsuits </h2>
<p>Angelos began bringing lawsuits against Pfizer in 1999,
saying that because the drug company''s logo appeared on Quigley
products, it should have liability for the asbestos-containing
products. </p>
<p>Goffman also told Bernstein today that Quigley plans to
file a Chapter 11 plan by the end of the month that is based on
terms with creditors it has already negotiated. </p>
<p>Lawyers for creditors as well as the U.S. Trustee, an arm
of the Justice Department that oversees bankruptcies, said they
would object to any plan that was the same as the old one. </p>
<p>We don''t want a do-over of what happened last time,
said Greg Zipes, a lawyer for the U.S. Trustee. </p>
<p>The U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department, had
asked the bankruptcy court to end Quigley''s Chapter 11, citing
the fact that creditors alleging asbestos-related health issues
have been unable to sue New York-based Pfizer during the case,
and many of them have died. </p>
<h2>Manipulated Process </h2>
<p>Bernstein had said that Pfizer had manipulated the
bankruptcy process, and refused to allow Quigley to exit Chapter
11 court protection under a deal with Pfizer. </p>
<p>During Quigley''s bankruptcy, a committee of creditors known
as the Ad Hoc Committee of Tort Victims also asked in
October 2010 to have Quigley''s bankruptcy dismissed so it could
bring tort claims, which are otherwise blocked by bankruptcy
law. </p>
<p>Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. In November, Pfizer reported a $701
million third-quarter charge for asbestos litigation related to
Quigley. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, raised estimates of potential
losses from legal claims by 13 percent and said a probe into its
handling of Greek finances includes trading and research. </p>
<p>The forecast of reasonably possible legal costs rose to
$2.7 billion as of March 31 from $2.4 billion three months
earlier, according to a regulatory filing today. The New York-based firm didn''t give specific reasons for the increase. </p>
<p>Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance chiefs
in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs when
there is at least a reasonable possibility they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves. </p>
<p>The estimate doesn''t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can''t
determine the potential amount, according to the filing. </p>
<p>An investigation of the firm''s financing and swap
transactions with the Greek government, which started about two
years ago, also includes trading and research activities with
respect to Greek sovereign debt, according to today''s filing.
Goldman Sachs has cooperated with the investigations and
reviews, the company said. </p>
<h2>Financial Crisis Probe </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs also disclosed the U.S. Department of Justice
and SEC are investigating the firm''s role in the 2008 financial
crisis. Those inquiries stem from last year''s report by the
Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which said
the firm misled clients about mortgage-related investments
before the crisis. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>The company is in arbitration with a California school
district and the cities of Houston, Texas, and Reno, Nevada,
over Goldman Sachs''s role as an underwriter and broker-dealer
for more than $1.7 billion in auction-rate securities from 2004
and 2007, according to the filing. In those cases, which started
in February, the cities and school districts seek unspecified
damages, the firm said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is also facing a suit from the founders and
majority shareholders of Dragon Systems Inc. who exchanged their
stake in Dragon for stock in Lernout  Hauspie Speech Products
NV in 2000, according to the filing. LH went bankrupt on Nov.
29, 2000. The majority shareholders and Goldman Sachs asked for
summary judgment on various claims last month, according to the
filing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, redeemed about $250 million from
hedge funds during the first quarter as it begins to comply with
rules requiring banks to reduce such investments. </p>
<p>The firm can generally redeem as much as 25 percent of
its holdings in hedge funds at any quarter-end with 91 days''
notice, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a quarterly filing
today. The company had $3.06 billion in hedge-fund stakes at the
end of March, according to the filing, which didn''t say which
fund investments were pulled during the quarter. </p>
<p>Under the Volcker rule provision of the Dodd-Frank
financial-reform law, federally backed banks are required to
limit their investments in private equity and hedge funds to no
more than 3 percent of the fund or 3 percent of the bank''s Tier
1 capital. Goldman Sachs''s fund stakes were worth $17.2 billion
at the end of March and the firm was committed to providing an
additional $7.77 billion to the funds, the filing showed. </p>
<p>We currently expect to redeem up to approximately 10
percent of certain hedge funds'' total redeemable units per
quarter over 10 consecutive quarters, beginning March 2012 and
ending June 2014, Goldman Sachs said in the filing. In
addition, we have limited the firm''s initial investment to 3
percent for certain new funds. </p>
<p>The fair value of Goldman Sachs''s stakes in private-equity
funds totaled $8.83 billion at the end of March and the company
owed the funds $3.07 billion in unfunded commitments,
according to the filing. The value of private debt fund
investments amounted to $3.74 billion. Unfunded commitments to
those funds totaled $3.24 billion, according to the filing. </p>
<h2>Transition Period </h2>
<p>The firm continues to manage its existing private-equity
funds taking into account the transition periods under the
Volcker rule, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Stakes in real estate funds were worth $1.54 billion at the
end of March and the bank owed $1.46 billion to those funds,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s investments in private-equity, private debt
and real estate funds aren''t eligible for redemption, according
to the filing. The firm expects to receive distributions from
the funds as their underlying assets are sold, and it is
estimated that substantially all of the underlying assets of the
existing funds will be liquidated over the next 10 years,
according to the filing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), one of the
five U.S. banks with the biggest positions in over-the-counter
derivatives, may owe counterparties $2.21 billion if its credit
rating falls two levels. </p>
<p>Counterparties could demand the money in collateral and
termination payments, the New York-based bank said in a
quarterly filing today. A one-level reduction would require
$1.33 billion in payments, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, is
under review by Moody''s Investors Service for a possible two-level downgrade to A3 from A1. The credit rater said in February
it was examining ratings of 17 banks and securities firms with
global capital-market operations. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) and UBS AG (UBSN) may be cut three levels, Moody''s said. </p>
<p>As of Dec. 31, a two-level cut would have obliged Goldman
Sachs to pay $2.18 billion in collateral and terminations, the
firm reported in February. A one-level reduction would have
required $1.3 billion as of December, the firm reported. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was among five companies that accounted for
96 percent of the total U.S. banking industry''s notional
holdings in derivatives and 86 percent of net current credit
exposure in derivatives as of December, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that generated 57 percent of its first-quarter
revenue from trading, had a loss from that business on one day
in the period, down from 17 during the preceding three months. </p>
<p>The firm''s traders made more than $100 million on 24 of the
62 days in the quarter ended March 31, according to a quarterly
regulatory filing today by the New York-based company. The
quarter produced the fewest days of trading losses since the
first quarter of 2011, the filing shows. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported last month that revenue from trading stocks, bonds and
other securities dropped 14 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier. That followed a 21 percent decline in trading
revenue for 2011, the worst performance since 2008. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank, said this week
that its traders lost money on four days during the first
quarter, up from three a year earlier. Bank of America Corp.,
the No. 2 U.S. lender, reported last week that it had trading
profits on every day in the period. </p>
<p>Trading losses never exceeded Goldman Sachs''s value-at-risk
limit -- a measure of how much the company estimates it could
lose in the securities markets in a single day -- during the
quarter, according to the filing. Average daily value-at-risk
dropped to $95 million in the three months ended March 31, from
$135 million in the prior period, the firm reported on April 17. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) stood by its
forecast for a rally in gold this year, saying that the precious
metal will advance to $1,840 an ounce over six months as the U.S.
central bank embarks on a third round of stimulus in June. </p>
<p>Gold remains the currency of last resort, according to
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie in a report dated yesterday, the
same day that the price sank to the lowest level in four months
as Europe''s escalating debt crisis boosted the dollar. The
restated gold forecast implies a 16 percent surge. </p>
<p>Concerns that Greece may leave the euro reignited Europe''s
crisis this week, driving commodities including gold lower along
with base metals, crude oil and equities as the dollar climbed.
The 17-nation euro area is on the verge of losing one of its
members, according to a Bloomberg Global Poll published today. </p>
<p>In early 2009, we suggested that gold had become the
currency of last resort, overtaking the U.S. dollar''s status due
to the rising risk of sovereign default and debasement
concerns, Currie wrote. Even as the U.S. currency advanced and
gold fell on the European crisis in recent months, it is too
early for the dollar to reclaim this status, he wrote. </p>
<p>Gold for June delivery on the Comex dropped 0.3 percent to
$1,589.30 an ounce at 5:25 p.m. in Singapore, declining for a
fourth day as Greek leaders struggled to form a government
following elections at the weekend. The metal, which has lost 17
percent from its all-time high of $1,923.70 in September, is on
course for a fourth monthly drop in May. </p>
<h2>Remains in Place'' </h2>
<p>The case for higher gold prices remains in place, the
analysts wrote. U.S. economic and employment data has now
disappointed for several weeks, European election results point
to further stress in the euro area, while anecdotal data
suggests that physical gold demand remains resilient. </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve will announce additional monetary
easing when policy makers meet next month, Jan Hatzius, chief
economist at New York-based Goldman, predicted in a report on
May 8. The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two
rounds of quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to
drive the recovery in the world''s largest economy. </p>
<p>U.S. payrolls climbed by 115,000 workers in April, the
smallest increase in six months, Labor Department reported last
week, boosting concern that the recovery may falter. The jobless
rate fell to a three-year low of 8.1 percent as people left the
labor force, adding to worries that the expansion is cooling. </p>
<h2>ETP Holdings </h2>
<p>Gold, which has still risen 1.4 percent in New York in 2012,
has rallied for 11 straight years as investors sought a hedge
against inflation and central banks expanded reserves. Holdings
in bullion-backed exchange-traded products are at 2,382.016
metric tons, about 1.2 percent below the March 13 record, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Emerging-market central banks continued to purchase gold
for reserves, while demand in largest user India may gain after
the government withdrew an excise tax on precious-metal jewelry,
the analysts wrote. A jump in imports into mainland China from
Hong Kong also pointed to strong growth in demand, they wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman''s forecast for additional easing from the U.S.
central bank is similar to that from Bill Gross, who runs
Pacific Investment Management Co.''s Total Return Fund, the
world''s largest mutual fund. A decision to buy more debt is
getting closer, Gross wrote on Twitter this week. </p>
<p>The euro declined to $1.2912 yesterday, the lowest level
since Jan. 23. In the Bloomberg Global Poll, 57 percent of 1,253
investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers
said that at least one country will abandon the euro by year-end. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. (EEEK), the
world''s second-largest bottler of Coke drinks, posted a wider
loss in the first quarter as bad weather and austerity measures
in European markets hit demand. </p>
<p>The company''s net loss in the three months to March 31
widened to 28.4 million euros ($36.8 million) from 8.9 million
euros a year earlier, Coca-Cola HBC said today in a statement on
its website. The higher cost of sugar also hurt profit. </p>
<p>Despite a challenging external environment, we grew or
maintained volume share in sparkling beverages, while on a
currency-neutral basis, excluding the hyperinflation impact of
Belarus, net sales revenue per case of drinks rose 3 percent,
Dimitris Lois, chief executive officer, said in a telephone
interview today. </p>
<p>Excluding the cost of reorganization, the net loss was 18.6
million euros, up from a loss of 1 million euros. We are on
target with restructuring, Lois said. </p>
<p>The Athens-based company plans to book about 50 million
euros for restructuring this year, which will bring savings of
35 million euros a year from 2013, while steps taken last year
will see benefits of about 40 million euros this year, according
to the statement. </p>
<p>While cases of drinks sold fell 2 percent to 425 million,
as the effect of austerity measures in countries such as Greece
and Ireland and cold weather in central and eastern Europe hurt
demand, revenue rose 1 percent to 1.14 billion euros. Greece
accounts for 6 percent of sales, Lois said. </p>
<h2>Volatile Outlook </h2>
<p>The economic outlook in Europe is volatile and we expect
consumer confidence to remain weak throughout this year, Lois
said. There will also be a high single-digit increase in
input costs; however, the company is confident that managing
revenue growth will offset the impact, he said. </p>
<p>Higher  costs, especially that of sugar, had a greater
effect this quarter as there was a steep rise after the first
quarter of 2011, magnifying the year-on-year effect, Lois said. </p>
<p>The company hopes to benefit from the London Summer Olympic
Games and the Euro 2012 soccer championship, Lois said. </p>
<p>The final tournament of the soccer championship will be
hosted jointly, between June 8 and July 1, by Poland and
Ukraine, both Coca-Cola HBC territories, while another five
participating countries are also company markets. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC reiterated capital spending guidance for
2012-14 of 1.45 billion euros and the same amount in free cash
flow generation. The company also plans to seek approval for a
share buyback program. </p>

<p>India barred Oriental Nicety,
formerly Exxon Valdez that caused the 1989 Alaska oil spill,
from the nation''s biggest ship-breaking yard after an activist
filed a petition in the Supreme Court saying the vessel
contained toxic material. </p>
<p>The Gujarat Pollution Control Board denied the ship entry
into Alang, on India''s western coast, for scrapping, as the
matter is sub-judice, Hardik Shah, its member secretary,
said in a telephone interview last night from the state capital
Gandhinagar. </p>
<p>Gopal Krishna, a New Delhi-based activist with ToxicsWatch
Alliance, told the Supreme Court last month that the ship had
asbestos and heavy metals on board. Concerns that ships with
hazardous material are entering India have mounted in recent
years as Alang competes with yards in China, Pakistan and
Bangladesh. </p>
<p>Priya Blue Industries Pvt. a Gujarat, western India-based
company that bought the ship for scrapping, will file a reply in
the court next week, its founder Sanjay Mehta said. He denied
the vessel, now converted into a bulk-carrier, had any toxic
material on board. The ship is currently in international waters
off India''s west coast, Mehta said. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court asked the Indian government and Ministry
of Shipping to provide information on the steps taken to prevent
the ship''s berthing at any of the nation''s ports, according to a
May 3 order posted on the court''s website. The next hearing on
the case is scheduled for August 13. </p>
<h2>Alaska Oil Spill </h2>
<p>In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilt 11 million gallons of oil
into Alaska''s Prince William Sound, devastating wildlife and
local businesses. Victims of the spill sued Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
and won a $5 billion punitive damage award in 1994. </p>
<p>The award was cut after a series of appeals by Exxon over
the next 14 years, and eventually in 2008 a divided U.S. Supreme
Court reduced the punitive damages to $507.5 million. </p>
<p>In the petition filed in India''s Supreme Court, Krishna
said the 301 meter-long ship was purchased by Best Oasis Ltd., a
unit of Priya Blue, for $16 million. Mehta declined to comment
on the price of the vessel, built in 1986. </p>
<p>Alang, which opened in 1982, has the capacity to break
ships of about 4 million metric tons a year, according to
Gujarat Maritime Board website. The yard gives direct employment
to about 25,000 workers, according to the Board. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the firm suffered a $2 billion trading
loss after an egregious failure in a unit managing risks,
jeopardizing Wall Street banks'' efforts to loosen a federal ban
on bets with their own money. </p>
<p>The firm''s chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, 55,
took flawed positions on synthetic credit securities that remain
volatile and may cost an additional $1 billion this quarter or
next, Dimon told analysts yesterday. Losses mounted as JPMorgan
tried to mitigate transactions designed to hedge credit
exposure. </p>
<p>There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,
Dimon said as the company''s stock fell in extended trading.
These were egregious mistakes, they were self-inflicted. </p>
<p>The chief investment office was thrust into the debate over
U.S. efforts to ban proprietary trading when Bloomberg News
reported last month that the unit had taken bets so big that
JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, probably
couldn''t unwind them without losing money or roiling financial
markets. Dimon, 56, had transformed the unit in recent years to
make bigger and riskier speculative trades with the bank''s
money, five former employees said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $2 billion
trading loss has intensified the call for tighter regulation in
Washington, with presidential campaign officials weighing in
alongside lawmakers in response to the bank''s disclosure. </p>
<p>Any progress by financial-industry lobbyists in securing
changes to the Dodd-Frank Act''s proprietary-trading ban may have
been halted with the May 10 announcement by Jamie Dimon,
JPMorgan''s chairman and chief executive officer, said
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-wrote the regulatory overhaul. </p>
<p>They sensed some momentum in undercutting things, but
this strengthens our case strongly politically, Frank said
yesterday in a telephone interview. It tears a lot of holes in
Jamie''s arguments. </p>
<p>In addition, New York-based JPMorgan is facing new
scrutiny, with lawmakers calling for hearings, Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro saying her agency is
monitoring the bank. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
planning to review the loss, according to a person briefed on
the matter. </p>
<p>Dimon, 56, has been a prominent critic of Dodd-Frank
provisions including the so-called Volcker rule, which is meant
to bar proprietary trading by banks with federally insured
deposits. In a conference call to discuss the losses stemming
from egregious failures in the bank''s chief investment
office, Dimon accurately forecast the Washington response. </p>
<h2>Very Unfortunate'' </h2>
<p>It is very unfortunate, Dimon said. It plays right
into all the hands of a bunch of pundits out there. </p>
<p>Senator Tim Johnson, the South Dakota Democrat who leads
the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement that the loss
underlines why opponents of Wall Street reform must not be
allowed to gut important protections for the financial system
and taxpayers. Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who
serves on the committee, called yesterday for hearings on the
loss. </p>
<p>Sean Oblack, Johnson''s spokesman, said in a statement that
the Banking Committee is waiting to learn more of the facts
before making a decision on a hearing. </p>
<p>Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who co-wrote the
trading ban named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, said in a conference call with reporters that the loss
shows Dimon''s view to be dramatically proven wrong. </p>
<h2>Telling Moment'' </h2>
<p>It''s a very telling moment and I guess we should thank
JPMorgan for exposing an area where we clearly need more
oversight, Jared Bernstein, former chief economist for Vice
President Joe Biden, said yesterday. </p>
<p>Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Republican presidential
contender Mitt Romney, said yesterday that the loss
demonstrates the importance of oversight and transparency in
the derivatives market, something Governor Romney has called for
in the past. </p>
<p>As president, Governor Romney will push for common-sense
regulation that gives regulators tools to do their jobs, and
that gives investors more clarity, Saul said in a statement. </p>
<p>Romney, a former private-equity executive who served as
Massachusetts governor, declined to answer questions about
JPMorgan during a campaign rally yesterday in Charlotte, North
Carolina. </p>
<h2>Textbook Illustration'' </h2>
<p>Levin and Senator Jeff Merkley, the Oregon Democrat who co-wrote the proprietary-trading provision, said yesterday during
their conference call that JPMorgan has become a textbook
illustration of why federal regulators should tighten the
restrictions being drafted in the Volcker rule. </p>
<p>Four years after the downfall of Bear Stearns, Lehman
Brothers and the hundreds of billions in a bank bailout, we
still see that there is a nagging need for regulators to
implement financial reforms which became law in 2010, Bart Chilton, a Democrat on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
said yesterday. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have lobbied regulators including the
Fed, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. to expand exemptions included in their initial
Volcker rule proposal, complaining that the measure is so broad
and ill-defined that it will increase risks for clients. </p>
<p>The rule would allow banks to continue activities that are
considered hedging, as well as to serve as market-makers,
accepting risk or holding shares of trades to facilitate client
orders. Levin and Merkley said JPMorgan''s loss shows the need
for a stricter interpretation of the hedging exemption included
in the draft proposal released in October. </p>
<p>Dimon has said the trade wouldn''t have run afoul of the
Volcker rule restrictions, which are scheduled to take effect on
July 21. </p>
<p>Frank said he planned to use the bank''s loss to defend the
law against efforts to roll back derivatives regulations and
force wider exemptions in the Volcker rule. He pointed to the
impact of the losses on Dimon, who has been the leading voice
against many of the regulations Frank put into place. </p>
<p>This will diminish his ability to be that voice, Frank
said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) fell the most in
nine months after Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the
firm suffered a $2 billion trading loss he attributed to
egregious failures in a unit managing risks. </p>
<p>JPMorgan dropped 9.3 percent to $36.96 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York, marking the stock''s biggest decline since Aug. 8 and the
day''s second-worst showing in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>The bank''s chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, 55,
took flawed positions on synthetic credit securities that remain
volatile and may cost the lender an additional $1 billion this
quarter or next, Dimon, 56, said yesterday in a conference call
with analysts. The loss originated out of the firm''s London CIO
unit, an executive at the bank said. </p>
<p>There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,
Dimon said. These were egregious mistakes, they were self-inflicted. </p>
<p>The chief investment office was thrust into the debate over
U.S. efforts to ban proprietary trading when Bloomberg News
reported last month that the unit had taken bets so big that
JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, probably
couldn''t unwind them without losing money or roiling financial
markets. Dimon, 56, had transformed the unit in recent years to
make bigger and riskier speculative trades with the bank''s
money, five former employees said. </p>
<h2>FSA Examination </h2>
<p>The U.K.''s Financial Services Authority, which regulates
banks, is examining the role London employees played in the
loss, according to two people familiar with the talks. The
agency hasn''t opened a formal investigation and there was no
evidence of criminal activity, these people said. </p>
<p>It will weigh on the sector pretty bad, said Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. Miller and Christopher Mutascio at Stifel Nicolaus 
Co. downgraded their recommendations on the shares today.
Investors are going to say that these are general big black
boxes that can''t be analyzed, not even the management companies
understand what they''re doing themselves. </p>
<p>Dimon had defended the chief investment office as a
sophisticated guardian of the bank''s funds on an April 13
conference call, calling news coverage a complete tempest in a
teapot. On May 2, he led fellow Wall Street CEOs in a closed-door meeting to lobby the Federal Reserve about softening
proposed U.S. reforms that might crimp their profits. </p>
<h2>Bunch of Pundits'' </h2>
<p>Yesterday, he said the timing of the trading blunders
plays right into the hands of a bunch of pundits out there
who are pushing for a strict version of the proprietary trading
ban named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. </p>
<p>Given Dimon''s resistance to the ban and new regulations,
he''s got a lot of egg on his face right now, said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston. Any
chance they had of getting a relative loosening of Volcker rule,
anything of that nature, that''s out the window. </p>
<p>The chief investment office''s push into risk-taking was led
by Achilles Macris, 50, according to three former employees,
Bloomberg News reported on April 13. He was hired in 2006 as its
top executive in London and led an expansion into corporate and
mortgage-debt investments with a mandate to generate profits for
the New York-based bank, they said. Dimon closely supervised the
transition from its previous focus on protecting JPMorgan from
risks inherent in its banking business, such as interest-rate
and currency movements, they said. </p>
<h2>Talented People'' </h2>
<p>I wouldn''t call it more aggressive,'' I would call it
better,'' Dimon told analysts yesterday. We added different
types of people, talented people and stuff like that. Until
recently, they were careful and successful, he said. </p>
<p>It''s classic Wall Street hubris, which we''ve seen so many
times before, said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at
the International Monetary Fund who now teaches at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. What''s particularly
ironic here is that Jamie presents himself, and is believed by
others to be, the king of risk management. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that London-based
JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the
financial health of corporations that were so large he was
driving price moves in the $10 trillion market. </p>
<p>The $2 billion loss occurred in London under multiple
traders, according to an executive at the bank, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. Dimon wasn''t immediately told about
their shift in strategy and didn''t know the magnitude of the
losses until after the company reported earnings April 13, the
executive said. As the position deteriorated rapidly, the bank
gathered internal analysts and examiners to investigate, and
Dimon grew more distressed by the day, the executive said. </p>
<h2>Corrective Action'' </h2>
<p>While no one has been fired yet, Dimon told analysts he
will take corrective action. The bank is keeping employees
involved on hand while it deals with the transactions, and some
are likely to lose their jobs afterward, said an executive with
knowledge of the situation. The bank is also reevaluating its
risk-monitoring team within the chief investment office, the
person said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan risks losing more money now because other market
participants will figure out what the bank has to do to unload
its position, said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales
Partners LLC in New York. Costs from the trades may affect
earnings through the end of the year, he said. </p>
<h2>Sharks to Blood </h2>
<p>When there''s blood in the water, the sharks are going to
attack that animal, said Peabody, who downgraded his
recommendation on the stock in March to sector perform. It
could make it very difficult for them to unwind a trade. </p>
<p>Investors bet more damage lies ahead. Bearish JPMorgan
options had the second-largest increase in trading among all
U.S. stocks today as 418,892 puts to sell JPMorgan shares
changed hands. That was 12 times the four-week average and 1.4
times the number of calls to buy, the data show. JPMorgan''s June
$35 puts were the most-traded options on the stock as they more
than tripled to 85 cents from a close of 26 cents yesterday. </p>
<p>More than 216 million JPMorgan shares traded, breaking the
prior one-day record set in 2008. </p>
<p>Dimon declined on the call to discuss the specific
transactions or people involved. Synthetic credit products are
derivatives that generate gains and losses tied to credit
performance without the owner buying or selling actual debt.
JPMorgan used the instruments to hedge exposure on loans and
other credit risks tied to corporations, banks and sovereign
governments. The losses emerged after the firm tried to reduce
that position and unwind the portfolio, Dimon said. </p>
<p>The bank said losses were partly offset by gains from the
sales from its available-for-sale credit portfolio, resulting in
a net loss for the firm''s corporate division, which includes the
CIO, of about $800 million after taxes. Dimon said losses could
widen or narrow in coming weeks and months, and that he can''t
estimate potential costs. </p>
<h2>Long-Term Holdings </h2>
<p>As the bank repositions the synthetic credit portfolio, the
chief investment office may hold certain of its current
synthetic credit positions for the longer term, the firm said. </p>
<p>Hopefully, this will not be an issue by the end of the
year, but it does depend on the decisions and the markets,
Dimon said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan also changed how it calculates so-called value at
risk, or VAR, a measure of how much the company estimates it
could lose on securities on 95 percent of days. The company
restated its VAR for the first quarter, previously disclosed at
$67 million, at $129 million. The bank used a new model for
calculating its trading risk in the first quarter that Dimon
said was inadequate. It is reverting to the old model. </p>
<h2>Hidden Risk </h2>
<p>It''s a major event that confirms a lot of investors''
worst fears about bank risk, said Frank Partnoy, a former
derivatives trader who''s now a law and finance professor at the
University of San Diego. Concern is that at a large,
supposedly sophisticated institution, even something called a
hedge'' can contain all kinds of hidden risks that the senior
people don''t understand. </p>
<p>Iksil may have amassed a $100 billion position in contracts
on Series 9 of the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index, counterparts at hedge funds and rival banks said in
April. They based their estimates on the trades and price
movements they witnessed as well as their understanding of the
size and structure of the markets. The positions amounted to
tens of billions of dollars, under the firm''s own math, a person

FXSpotStream solution, Schwarz said in a release. </p>
<p>The service will begin June 1 in Europe and Aug. 31 in

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Investment
Officer Ina R. Drew, head of the unit responsible for a $2
billion trading loss, built a 30-year career at the largest U.S.
bank by embracing risk and avoiding the spotlight. </p>
<p>With everything she does, she thinks in terms of
trading, said Stephen Murray, head of CCMP Capital Advisors
LLC, created from a JPMorgan private-equity unit in 2006.
There are risk-lovers, there are risk-haters, and the best
traders will take the risk as long as they get paid for it. </p>
<p>Drew''s operation, which helps manage the bank''s risk, has
been transformed under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon to
make bigger speculative bets with the firm''s own money,
according to five former employees, Bloomberg News reported last
month. Some bets were so big JPMorgan probably couldn''t unwind
them without roiling markets, the former executives said. </p>
<p>The loss disclosed yesterday came after an egregious
investment-office failure tied to credit derivatives, Dimon said
in a conference call. In hindsight, the new strategy was
flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly
monitored. </p>
<p>Drew, 55, is one of two women who sit on the New York-based
firm''s operating committee. Her office oversees about $360
billion, the difference between money from deposits and what the
bank extends in loans. Dimon, 56, had pushed the unit to boost
profit by buying higher-yielding assets, including structured
credit, equities and derivatives, two former employees have
said. The shift to riskier bets underscores how blurry the line
can be between so-called proprietary trading and what banks say
is hedging. </p>
<h2>Chemical Bank </h2>
<p>Drew has overseen both kinds at the firm for decades. She
joined Chemical Banking Corp. in 1982 after graduating from
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and receiving a master''s
degree from Columbia University''s School of International
Affairs, according to the bank. </p>
<p>When Chemical merged with Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in
1991, Drew was put in charge of managing U.S. interest-rate
risks and given oversight of discretionary trading positions,
according to a news release that year. </p>
<p>Ina was all about risk-taking, said Mark Schneiderman,
a former human resources manager at Chemical. She was scary-
smart, she was very determined, she was very low-key compared to
the crazies that you find on a trading floor -- but very, very
determined. </p>
<p>Petros Sabatacakis, a former chief risk officer for
Citigroup Inc. and now a director of the National Bank of Greece
SA (ETE), said he promoted her at Chemical. </p>

<p>Diageo Plc (DGE), the world''s biggest
distiller, and computer-services provider International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) led $27.6 billion of corporate bond sales in the
U.S. this week as relative yields on investment-grade debt rose. </p>
<p>Diageo, the seller of Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky and
Guinness beer, raised $2.5 billion in a three-part offering and
Armonk, New York-based IBM sold $1.5 billion of debt, including
seven-year notes at a record-low coupon, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales for the week compare with $32.6
billion in the period ended May 4 and a weekly 2012 average of
$30.1 billion. </p>
<p>IBM and Diageo were joined by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) in
tapping the bond market, showing investor appetite for the most
creditworthy corporate borrowers even as political turmoil in
Europe threatened to unravel the region''s common currency and
disrupt the financial system. Yields on investment-grade debt in
the U.S. touched an all-time low this week. </p>
<p>In a world of dwindling quality debt instruments, there''s
going to be demand for the IBMs and the Berkshires of the world,
and for other high-quality issuers, Anthony Valeri, a market
strategist in San Diego at LPL Financial, which oversees about
$330 billion, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
corporate bonds rather than government debentures increased as
spreads rose 3 basis points to 203 basis points, or 2.03
percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s
U.S. Corporate Master index. Yields fell as low as 3.33 percent
on May 8 before rising to 3.35 percent yesterday. </p>
<h2>Europe Crisis </h2>
<p>Sales of investment-grade bonds fell to $22.3 billion this
week from $26.8 billion in the period ended May 4, the most in
seven weeks, Bloomberg data show. Sales compare with a weekly
average this year of $23.2 billion. </p>
<p>Investor concern is mounting that European policymakers
will fail to stem the region''s debt crisis after France elected
socialist leader Francois Hollande and Greece''s elections ended
with inconclusive results on May 6. Speculation has since risen
over whether Greece will exit the euro zone. </p>
<p>In the U.S., consumer borrowing surged in March by $21.4
billion, the biggest gain since November 2001, to $2.54
trillion, Federal Reserve figures showed May 7 in Washington.
The advance was paced by a $16.2 billion jump in non-revolving
debt, including student and car loans. </p>
<h2>Diageo, IBM </h2>
<p>Diageo sold $1 billion each of five- and 10-year notes and
$500 million of 30-year bonds, Bloomberg data show. The 4.25
percent debt due in May 2042 yielded 125 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Diageo spokeswoman Kirsty King declined to comment. </p>
<p>IBM sold $900 million of 0.75 percent, three-year notes at
a relative yield of 45 basis points, and $600 million of seven-year bonds at a record low 1.875 percent and a 65 basis-point
spread, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Proceeds from the issue will be used for general
corporate purposes, which could include refinancing long-term
maturities and commercial paper, or funding acquisitions, said
Doug Shelton, a spokesman for IBM. </p>
<p>Berkshire, run by 81-year old billionaire Warren Buffett,
issued $1.6 billion of bonds and China Petrochemical Corp.,
known as Sinopec, sold $3 billion in its first dollar-denominated issue since 1996, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Berkshire didn''t immediately respond to a request for
comment, sent to Buffett''s assistant Carrie Kizer. </p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. (F) sold $1.25 billion of bonds two weeks after
Fitch Ratings raised the automaker''s credit ranking to
investment grade. Moody''s Investors Service and Standard 
Poor''s still rate the Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker as junk. </p>
<p>Margaret Mellott, a spokeswoman for Ford, didn''t
immediately return a phone call or e-mail. </p>
<h2>High-Yield Sales </h2>
<p>Sales of speculative-grade or high-yield bonds, graded
below Baa3 by Moody''s and lower than BBB- at SP, fell to $5.3
billion from $5.7 billion last week, Bloomberg data show.
Speculative-grade relative yields versus Treasuries widened to
600 basis points yesterday from 594 basis points on May 4. </p>
<p>Dish Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-television provider to DirecTV, issued $1.9 billion of bonds to
help refinance debt coming due in 2013 and 2014. The sale was
increased from $1.5 billion. </p>
<p>It''s still a pretty attractive place to issue for
corporates, said Bradley Rogoff, head of global credit
strategy at Barclays Capital, in an interview on Bloomberg
Television''s InsideTrack with Stephanie Ruhle. Going
forward, I think if we see some volatility but we reset at a
slightly higher yield, you''ll still see a decent amount of
issuance. </p>
<p>Among planned issues is $1 billion from Inmet Mining Corp.,
the Toronto-based mining company, and $450 million from coal
producer Penn Virginia Resource Partners LP, according to
Bloomberg data. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the firm suffered a $2 billion trading
loss after an egregious failure in a unit managing risks,
jeopardizing Wall Street banks'' efforts to loosen a federal ban
on bets with their own money. </p>
<p>The firm''s chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, 55,
took flawed positions on synthetic credit securities that remain
volatile and may cost an additional $1 billion this quarter or
next, Dimon told analysts yesterday. Losses mounted as JPMorgan
tried to mitigate transactions designed to hedge credit
exposure. </p>
<p>There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,
Dimon said as the company''s stock fell in extended trading.
These were egregious mistakes, they were self-inflicted. </p>
<p>The chief investment office was thrust into the debate over
U.S. efforts to ban proprietary trading when Bloomberg News
reported last month that the unit had taken bets so big that
JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, probably
couldn''t unwind them without losing money or roiling financial
markets. Dimon, 56, had transformed the unit in recent years to
make bigger and riskier speculative trades with the bank''s
money, five former employees said. </p>
<h2>FSA Examination </h2>
<p>The U.K.''s Financial Services Authority, which regulates
banks, is examining the role London employees played in the
loss, according to two people familiar with the talks. The
agency hasn''t opened a formal investigation and there was no
evidence of criminal activity, these people said. The loss
originated out of the firm''s London CIO unit, an executive at
the bank said. </p>
<p>I think it will weigh on the sector pretty bad, said
Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. Miller and Christopher Mutascio at Stifel Nicolaus 
Co. downgraded their recommendations on the shares today.
Investors are going to say that these are general big black
boxes that can''t be analyzed, not even the management companies
understand what they''re doing themselves. </p>
<p>Dimon had defended the Chief Investment Office as a
sophisticated guardian of the bank''s funds on an April 13
conference call, calling news coverage a complete tempest in a
teapot. On May 2, he led fellow Wall Street CEOs in a closed-
door meeting to lobby the Federal Reserve about softening
proposed U.S. reforms that might crimp their profits. </p>
<h2>Bunch of Pundits'' </h2>
<p>Yesterday, he said the timing of the trading blunders
plays right into the hands of a bunch of pundits out there
who are pushing for a strict version of the proprietary trading
ban named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. </p>
<p>Given Dimon''s resistance to the ban and new regulations,
he''s got a lot of egg on his face right now, said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston. Any
chance they had of getting a relative loosening of Volcker rule,
anything of that nature, that''s out the window. </p>
<p>The chief investment office''s push into risk-taking was led
by Achilles Macris, 50, according to three former employees,
Bloomberg News reported on April 13. He was hired in 2006 as its
top executive in London and led an expansion into corporate and
mortgage-debt investments with a mandate to generate profits for
the New York-based bank, they said. Dimon closely supervised the
transition from its previous focus on protecting JPMorgan from
risks inherent in its banking business, such as interest-rate
and currency movements, they said. </p>
<h2>Talented People'' </h2>
<p>I wouldn''t call it more aggressive,'' I would call it
better,'' Dimon told analysts yesterday. We added different
types of people, talented people and stuff like that. Until
recently, they were careful and successful, he said. </p>
<p>It''s classic Wall Street hubris, which we''ve seen so many
times before, said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at
the International Monetary Fund who now teaches at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. What''s particularly
ironic here is that Jamie presents himself, and is believed by
others to be, the king of risk management. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that London-based
JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the
financial health of corporations that were so large he was
driving price moves in the $10 trillion market. </p>
<p>The $2 billion loss occurred in London under multiple
traders, according to an executive at the bank, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. Dimon wasn''t immediately told about
their shift in strategy and didn''t know the magnitude of the
losses until after the company reported earnings April 13, the
executive said. As the position deteriorated rapidly, the bank
gathered internal analysts and examiners to investigate, and
Dimon grew more distressed by the day, the executive said. </p>
<h2>Corrective Actions'' </h2>
<p>While no one has been fired yet, Dimon told analysts he
will take corrective actions. The bank is keeping employees
involved on hand while it deals with the transactions, and some
are likely to lose their jobs afterward, said an executive with
knowledge of the situation. The bank is also reevaluating its
risk-monitoring team within the chief investment office, the
person said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan risks losing more money now because other market
participants will figure out what the bank has to do to unload
its position, said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales
Partners LLC in New York. Costs from the trades may affect
earnings through the end of the year, he said. </p>
<h2>Sharks to Blood </h2>
<p>When there''s blood in the water, the sharks are going to
attack that animal, said Peabody, who downgraded his
recommendation on the stock in March to sector perform. It
could make it very difficult for them to unwind a trade. </p>
<p>JPMorgan shares, which closed at $40.74 yesterday, fell 8.4
percent to $37.30 at 8:52 a.m. in New York trading. The stock
had advanced 23 percent this year before the losses were
disclosed. </p>
<p>The cost of insuring debt of JPMorgan from default rose.
Credit-default swaps insuring JPMorgan''s debt climbed 17 basis
points to 124, the highest since Feb. 16, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is equivalent to a
hundredth of a percentage point. </p>
<p>Bonds of JPMorgan declined the most in six months, widening
the gap in yield between the lender''s $6 billion of undated 7.9
percent junior subordinated notes and the 0.875 percent Treasury
due 2018 by 16 basis points to 392.2 basis points, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices at 10:10 a.m. in London. The price
of the note, callable in 2018, fell 2.2 cents on the dollar to
107.84 cents, pushing up the yield to 6.3 percent. </p>
<h2>Credit Risks </h2>
<p>Dimon declined on the call to discuss the specific
transactions or people involved. Synthetic credit products are
derivatives that generate gains and losses tied to credit
performance without the owner buying or selling actual debt.
JPMorgan used the instruments to hedge exposure on loans and
other credit risks to corporations, banks and sovereign
governments. The losses emerged after the firm tried to reduce
that position and unwind the portfolio, Dimon said. </p>
<p>The bank said losses were partly offset by gains from the
sales from its available-for-sale credit portfolio, resulting in
a net loss for the firm''s corporate division, which includes the
CIO, of about $800 million after taxes. Dimon said losses could
widen or narrow in coming weeks and months, and that he can''t
estimate potential costs. </p>
<h2>Confirming Fears </h2>
<p>As the bank repositions the synthetic credit portfolio, the
chief investment office may hold certain of its current
synthetic credit positions for the longer term, the firm said. </p>
<p>Hopefully, this will not be an issue by the end of the
year, but it does depend on the decisions and the markets,
Dimon said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan also changed how it calculates so-called value at
risk, or VAR, a measure of how much the company estimates it
could lose on securities on 95 percent of days. The company
restated its VAR for the first quarter, previously disclosed at
$67 million, at $129 million. The bank used a new model for
calculating its trading risk in the first quarter that Dimon
said was inadequate. It is reverting to the old model. </p>
<p>It''s a major event that confirms a lot of investors''
worst fears about bank risk, said Frank Partnoy, a former
derivatives trader who''s now a law and finance professor at the
University of San Diego. Concern is that at a large,
supposedly sophisticated institution, even something called a
hedge'' can contain all kinds of hidden risks that the senior
people don''t understand. </p>
<h2>Difficult Exit </h2>
<p>Iksil may have amassed a $100 billion position in contracts
on Series 9 of the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index, counterparts at hedge funds and rival banks said in
April. They based their estimates on the trades and price
movements they witnessed as well as their understanding of the
size and structure of the markets. The positions amounted to
tens of billions of dollars, under the firm''s own math, a person
familiar with its view said at the time. </p>
<p>The trade on the index probably wasn''t a one-way bet, the
market participants said. Iksil may have offset it by buying
protection on the same index with contracts that expire about
seven months from now, the people said. That strategy would pay
JPMorgan the difference between the long-dated contracts and the
short-dated ones, and the trade would gain when the gap narrows.
The hedge would end in December unless another trade is made to
replace it. </p>
<p>Satyajit Das, the author of Extreme Money: Masters of the
Universe and the Cult of Risk, compared the publicity around
JPMorgan''s situation to losses that spiraled at hedge funds like
Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and Amaranth Advisors LLC
in 2006. </p>
<p>A $2 billion loss suggests a position of considerable
size, Das said. I think you remember LTCM and a few other
people like Amaranth that have had the exact same problem and
have learned it''s a bit like hell -- easy to get into, not so
easy to get out of. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s trading
position that led to a $2 billion loss may call for increased
Federal Reserve scrutiny of risk management as the central bank
steps up its post-crisis supervision of lenders. </p>
<p>Fed officials are gathering more information about the
trading position, which they have known about for several weeks,
according to a person familiar with the matter. They don''t view
it as their role to approve or reject individual trades, the
person said. Rather, their job is to ensure firms have enough
capital to withstand losses, said the person, who wasn''t
authorized to discuss the matter and asked not to be identified. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon announced the
egregious trading loss on May 10, saying there were many
errors, sloppiness and bad judgment. Dimon said on a
conference call with analysts that while the firm kept its
regulators up to date, he didn''t have great information
to share with them. </p>
<p>The fact that Jamie Dimon could come out and make some of
those statements raises lots of questions about who was
watching the store, said Robert Eisenbeis, chief monetary
economist at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors and a
former Atlanta Fed research director. The Fed should be going
in and looking at the internal controls and monitoring
procedures that the institution is taking, and stress those. </p>
<p>Dimon announced the trading loss two months after the
biggest U.S. bank by assets passed a Fed stress test that put
its loans and securities through a scenario of deep recession
and a simulated global financial market shock. </p>
<h2>Small Loss'' </h2>
<p>It''s a relatively small loss in a bank of that size,
said William Isaac, a chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in the 1980s and now a senior managing director at FTI
Consulting Inc. The thing that''s rattling people is JPMorgan
Chase is widely considered one of the strongest and best banks
in the world. </p>
<p>JPMorgan shares fell 9.3 percent, the most in nine months,
to $36.96 at the close of trading yesterday in New York. The KBW
Bank Index (BKX) of 24 financial stocks was down 1.2 percent. </p>
<p>Krishna Guha, a spokesman for Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, JPMorgan''s regulator, declined to comment. JPMorgan
spokesman Joseph Evangelisti also declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main U.S.
derivatives regulator, has been reviewing JPMorgan''s derivatives
trading activities since last month, according to a person who
was briefed on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity
because the review is private. The CFTC hasn''t opened an
enforcement action against the bank, the person said. </p>
<h2>SEC Probe </h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened a
preliminary investigation into JPMorgan''s disclosures related to
the trades, according to another person briefed on the probe who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter isn''t public. </p>
<p>Dimon, in an interview with NBC''s Meet the Press to air
tomorrow, said he didn''t know whether the bank had broken any
law or accounting rules. </p>
<p>We''ve had audit, legal, risk, compliance, some of our
best people looking at all of that, he said. We don''t know
if any of that is true yet. </p>
<h2>Fed Analysis </h2>
<p>Fed officials need to examine their own analysis of the
bank''s risk management procedures and its governance, said Dino Kos, a former executive vice president at the New York Fed. He
said Fed supervisors should ask questions about how information
on risk is collected and reported, and what is done with it once
it reaches the executive level. </p>
<p>What information is the board of directors being given?
What is being sent to the CEO and the senior managers on the
risk committee? said Kos, now a managing director at
Hamiltonian Associates, a New York economic research and
consulting firm. There is a separate question about judgment
if Dimon understood the risks the bank was taking, he said. </p>
<p>Daniel Tarullo, the Fed governor in charge of supervision,
has emphasized that boards need to serve as independent monitors
of risk. The stress-tests were focused on whether a bank''s staff
and boards can put together a plan to manage capital through
times of economic turmoil. </p>
<h2>Checks and Balances </h2>
<p>It''s exceedingly important for boards to be involved, not
in micromanaging, but providing checks and balances on a
company, said Timothy Smith, a senior vice president at
Boston-based Walden Asset Management, which manages $2.2
billion. It''s a fair question to ask if Jamie Dimon says this
was just sloppy, where was the board as the $2 billion was being
lost? </p>
<p>Tarullo has piloted one of the biggest overhauls of
financial supervision in the central bank''s history. In addition
to annual stress tests, the Fed routinely looks at risks across
all large banks in a new group formed from economists,
examiners, and computer modelers. </p>
<p>The Fed has also boosted its surveillance of financial
markets and bank lending to spot asset bubbles that may lead to
financial turmoil. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke established a new
Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which was
instrumental in shaping tougher guidelines earlier this year on
high-yield, high-risk bank loans. </p>
<h2>Fed Letters </h2>
<p>At the end of April, the Fed sent letters critiquing banks
on their stress-test performance. Among the red flags Fed
officials spotted: the amount of capital that risk managers said
one bank might lose in stress test scenarios was at odds with
the payouts that the board wanted to make in the form of
dividends or share buybacks. </p>
<p>Peter Wallison, a former member of the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission, said boards are neither equipped to
understand the scope of a bank''s risks or engaged full-time in
the bank''s business. </p>
<p>Instead, What boards can do is appoint a risk committee,
to which the bank''s risk manager will report, independently of
the CEO. The risk committee can then keep the board apprised of
the risks communicated by the risk manager. However, this
requires very deft management, said Wallison, a fellow in
financial policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute in
Washington. </p>
<h2>Ratings Reduction </h2>
<p>Fitch Ratings, which yesterday lowered JPMorgan''s credit
grade by one level to A+ from AA-, said the $2 billion loss
raises questions regarding JPM''s risk appetite, risk
management framework, practices and oversight. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s losses weren''t large enough to pose a risk to
the bank or the broader financial system, said Robert Engle,  a
winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in economics and a professor at
New York University''s Stern School of Business. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s tier 1 common capital ratio, a measure of
capital strength tracked by the Fed, never dipped below 5
percent in the 2012 stress scenario despite a hypothetical $28
billion in trading and counterparty losses and $56 billion in
loan losses, according to results of the stress tests released
on March 13. </p>
<p>I don''t think this particular number is big enough to get
in the way of the capital buffers that JPMorgan has, Engle
said of the $2 billion loss. </p>
<h2>Systemic Institution </h2>
<p>We think of JPMorgan as being one of the more systemic
institutions because it is so big, said Engle, who helped
develop a model of systemic risk at the Stern school''s
Volatility Institute. But because it is big, a loss like this
is not going to bring it to its knees. </p>
<p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of
regulators charged with preventing a financial crisis, wasn''t
convened to discuss the JPMorgan loss and has no plans to meet,
said a Treasury Department official who declined to be
identified. The council''s chairman is Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, and it includes Bernanke. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger sold $81.6 million in stock after
the record-setting box-office performance of Marvel''s The
Avengers powered the shares to new highs. </p>
<p>The sale of 1.8 million shares took place on May 10 at an
average price of $45.36, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. Disney closed at a record on May 9, after the company
outlined plans for an Avengers sequel on its second-quarter
earnings call, and set subsequent marks on May 10 and May 11. </p>
<p>Iger, who plans to step down as CEO in March 2015,
exercised options at a cost of $55 million, according to the
filing, suggesting profit of $26.6 million before taxes and
commissions. The sales were part of routine financial planning
to meet his family''s diversification goals, Burbank, California-based Disney said in a statement. </p>
<p>Even after today''s transactions, his holdings exceed what
Mr. Iger owned at year-end, the company said. </p>
<p>Iger retains 1.14 million shares with value that is 400
percent greater than the company''s ownership requirements,
Disney said. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, rose 0.6
percent to $45.56 yesterday in New York. The shares have climbed
21 percent this year. </p>
<p>Iger became chairman in March, with a contract that runs
through June 2016. The company announced in October that it
would name a new CEO to succeed him in March 2015. </p>

<p>As a Wall Street trader named Scott
watched the mortgage market crater in late 2007, a switch buried
deep in his brain flipped. </p>
<p>What happened next is anatomized, tick by clinical tick, in
John Coates''s unsettling book, The Hour Between Dog and Wolf. </p>
<p>Scott''s heart rate sped up, to pump extra blood to his arms
and thighs, Coates writes. His pupils dilated, to absorb more
light. He began to sweat, his breathing accelerated and he got a
hit of adrenalin. Then, as his losses surged to $24 million, his
bowels liquefied. </p>
<p>Though Scott is a fictional representation, his symptoms
are all too real, judging from the observations of Coates, who
spent 12 years trading derivatives for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
Merrill Lynch  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK) </p>
<p>As losses mount on the trading floor, one observes anxious
traders marching briskly to the toilets, the men''s room starting
to exude the fear and stench of a slaughterhouse, he writes. </p>
<p>If this book isn''t on Jamie Dimon''s reading list, it should
be following the $2 billion trading loss at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The biological side of financial markets struck Coates
during the dot-com bubble in the 1990s, as he watched normally
prudent tech-stock traders become overconfident, reckless and
euphoric. At the time, he had become fascinated with
breakthroughs in neuroscience, notably research into how
hormones affect the brain, influencing how we think and behave. </p>

<p>(Corrects Avatar number in second paragraph.) </p>
<p>Marvel''s The Avengers, broke
another box-office record, taking in $103.2 million for Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) in its second weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters. </p>
<p>The film surpassed the $75.6 million benchmark for a second
weekend in 2009 by Avatar, researcher Hollywood.com Box-
Office said today in an e-mailed statement. Last week The
Avengers smashed the opening-weekend record with $207.4
million in domestic receipts. The vampire comedy Dark
Shadows, starring Johnny Depp and directed by Tim Burton,
opened in second place with $28.8 million. </p>
<p>The records raise the prospect studios will top their
previous best yearly sales of $10.6 billion set in 2009, Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com Box-Office, said in an
interview. Sales and attendance for 2012 are both up over 2011,
according to Hollywood.com. Opening May 25 is Sony Corp. (6758)''s Men
in Black 3, forecast by Boxoffice.com to generate $205 million
in domestic sales. </p>
<p>Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger told investors
on a conference call last week the company will turn The
Avengers into a franchise. The studio also will continue to
draw individually from the characters for more films, he said.
Disney is developing a third Iron Man movie and a sequel to
Thor, the hammer-wielding Norse demigod also featured in
The Avengers. </p>
<p>In The Avengers, several Marvel heroes band together to
fight an army of aliens led by Loki, also a character from Norse
mythology. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris
Hemsworth as Thor and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. </p>
<p>Dark Shadows, from Time Warner Inc. (TWX)''s Warner Bros., is
inspired by the daytime television show about a New England
family entangled with vampires, ghosts and werewolves. Burton''s
tongue-in-cheek interpretation also features Michelle Pfeiffer,
Helena Bonham Carter and Eva Green. </p>
<p>Dark Shadows was the only film to open in wide release. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest U.S.
oil company, said it sold more than 80 percent of the gas from
its Wheatstone project in Western Australia after reaching an
agreement with Tohoku Electric Power Co. </p>
<p>The Japanese electricity supplier will buy as much as 1
million tons of liquefied natural gas per year under a 20-year
agreement, Roy Krzywosinski, managing director of Chevron''s
Australian unit, said yesterday in Adelaide. </p>
<p>Wheatstone is off to a flying start, Krzywosinski said.
The Asian LNG market is certainly growing and we continue to
see demand. </p>
<p>Chevron decided in September to go ahead with the A$29
billion ($29 billion) Wheatstone project, with the first
shipment of the fuel scheduled to begin in 2016. The venture,
along with the company''s A$43 billion Gorgon project, are among
seven LNG developments under way in the country to meet rising
Asian demand for the fuel. San Ramon, California-based Chevron
has said that Gorgon and Wheatstone are at the center of its
global expansion plans. </p>
<p>Thirteen out of 14 wells drilled in Australia since 2009
have been successful, adding resources to underpin potential LNG
plant expansions, Chevron said in March. </p>
<p>Chevron said in April it signed an accord with Chubu
Electric Power Co. to buy gas from Wheatstone. Shipments are
scheduled to begin in 2016, with the project initially producing
8.9 million tons of LNG a year from two processing units. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s lawsuit claiming
attorneys for Ecuadorean plaintiffs in a pollution case
conspired to fabricate evidence was narrowed by a federal judge
in New York. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan today allowed racketeering
claims in the suit to continue while dismissing three of the
claims that included fraud and tortious interference. </p>
<p>In a separate ruling, Kaplan also denied Chevron''s bid to
attach $780 million it claims in damages. </p>
<p>Chevron was ordered last year to pay as much as $18 billion
in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.''s alleged
dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorean jungle from
1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-old lawsuit
decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial capital near the
Colombian border. </p>
<p>Chevron has denied wrongdoing in the Lago Agrio lawsuit.
The company says Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at
its former oil fields, which were taken over by PetroEcuador,
Ecuador''s state oil company. Chevron says it was released from
any future liability by an agreement between Texaco and Ecuador.
Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. </p>
<p>Today''s order affirms the core premise of Chevron''s RICO
and fraud case, said Justin Higgs, a spokesman for Chevron.
We are eager to progress our racketeering case and remain
resolute in our efforts to hold the perpetrators of this
unprecedented fraud and misconduct accountable. </p>
<p>Judge Kaplan''s decisions to deny Chevron attachment and
to throw out several fraud claims represent yet another setback
for the oil company and its shareholders, said Karen Hinton, a
spokeswoman for the plaintiffs. Chevron''s RICO charges always
have been baseless and are nothing more than a public relations
stunt to hide the company''s environmental abuses and fraud in
Ecuador that destroyed the rainforest and killed numerous people
with cancer and other oil-related diseases. </p>
<p>The case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 11-691, U.S.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Matt Zames,
newly appointed to lead the bank''s chief investment office after
the unit suffered a $2 billion loss, shook up leadership and
announced a renewed focus on hedging risks. </p>
<p>Zames named new finance and risk chiefs and wrote in a
staff memo that top London-based trading executive Achilles Macris would hand off duties. JPMorgan named Zames head of the
office earlier today to succeed Ina Drew, whose retirement after
the surprise loss marked the downfall of one of the highest-ranking women on Wall Street. </p>
<p>We will have a sharp, renewed focus on our hedging
strategies, risk management and execution, Zames, 41, wrote in
the memo. JPMorgan Chase will come out of this experience as a
stronger firm. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, announced the loss
May 10, assailing his firm''s handling of trading in synthetic
credit positions as flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored. New York-based JPMorgan is
examining whether anyone in the unit, which employs a few dozen
people in London, sought to hide risks, though there isn''t yet
evidence that''s the case, the person said. </p>
<h2>New London Chief </h2>
<p>It''s good to see there''s accountability as well as
responsibility here, said David Hendler, an analyst at
CreditSights Inc., a New York-based research firm. This person
was in charge of this strategy and it appears was not aware, or
giving the right signals to top management, of the risks that
were building. </p>

expected to be discussed at these hearings, Johnson said. </p>
<p>The panel doesn''t have a hearing scheduled specifically
about the bank''s losses or its chief investment office, which
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said made
egregious mistakes in overseeing the trades. There are no
plans at this point to invite executives of the New York-based
bank to testify, said Sean Oblack, Johnson''s spokesman. </p>
<p>We need to hear from regulators, and also review relevant
facts as they become available, before making a decision,
Oblack said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Johnson announced that JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank,
would be discussed at Senate hearings as lawmakers and
regulators sift through reports stemming from Dimon''s May 10
disclosure of losses tied to flawed positions on synthetic
credit trades. Johnson''s statement was a response to a request
from Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, to hold
hearings on the bank''s losses as expeditiously as possible. </p>
<h2>Dodd-Frank Hearings </h2>
<p>The Banking Committee will hear from representatives of the
Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
and other agencies at hearings on implementation of Dodd-Frank,
the regulatory law enacted in response to the 2008 credit
crisis, and the stability of financial markets, Johnson said. </p>
<p>Congressional Democrats have seized on JPMorgan''s loss as
an example of why new bank regulations, including the so-called
Volcker rule, are needed. Regulators are in the final stages of
rulemaking on the proprietary trading ban named for former Fed
Chairman Paul Volcker. </p>
<p>The only reason the Senate Banking Committee wouldn''t hold
a hearing on the JPMorgan trade is that maybe it points to
some flaw in the Volcker rule itself or flaw in Dodd-Frank,
Corker, a member of the panel, said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview. </p>
<p>I think any responsible chairman of any banking committee
right now would want members of that committee to understand how
something like this happens, Corker said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s top spokesman,
Joseph Evangelisti, sold his four-story townhouse in Manhattan''s
West Village for $6.7 million, more than three years after first
putting it on the market. </p>
<p>The sale of the 3,765-square-foot (350-square-meter) home
at Grove and Bedford streets was completed on April 12,
according to New York City property records filed May 3. The
buyer was listed as East Hamptons Village LLC. Evangelisti
bought the property in 2005 for $4.7 million, city records show. </p>
<p>Evangelisti listed the five-bedroom home for $7.9 million
in November 2008, when the global economy slid into recession
and the Manhattan sales market stalled after the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to property website
StreetEasy.com. He withdrew the listing in March 2009, then
offered the home that November for $7.5 million. The asking
price was whittled to $7 million in January, StreetEasy shows. </p>
<p>Fantastic views from the roof where you can see the
Empire State Building, according to the listing by Robin
Bowden, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.
There is a separate garden apartment that can be used for
income, or great for a nanny. </p>
<p>Evangelisti declined to comment on the sale. Bowden didn''t
return a telephone message. </p>
<h2>Luxury Sales </h2>
<p>The median price of Manhattan luxury apartments, defined as
the top 10 percent of all sales, climbed 4.4 percent in the
first quarter to to $4.13 million, according to appraiser Miller
Samuel Inc. and Prudential Douglas Elliman. </p>
<p>Evangelisti has worked for JPMorgan for more than 20 years.
As head of the company''s global media relations division, he is
also Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon''s spokesman. </p>
<p>JPMorgan suffered a $2 billion trading loss after an
egregious failure in a unit managing risks, Dimon said on
May 10. The firm''s chief investment office took flawed positions
on synthetic credit securities that remain volatile and may cost
an additional $1 billion this quarter or next, Dimon told
analysts last week. </p>

<p>Signs are emerging that traders are
already attempting to squeeze JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) after the
biggest U.S. bank said it faced $2 billion in trading losses
related to credit derivatives in the past six weeks. </p>
<p>The 10-year Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index
Series 9, an older, less-active benchmark for credit-default
swaps created in 2007 in which JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil in
London was said to have amassed as much as a $100 billion
position, jumped the most in almost eight months on May 11.
Another index contract that takes more concentrated risks on the
same companies recorded the biggest two-week surge in two years. </p>
<p>Hedge-fund managers and other investors are circling as
speculation mounts over how and whether New York-based JPMorgan
will unwind the trades. JPMorgan said May 10 in a regulatory
filing that it may hold certain of its synthetic credit
positions for the longer term, a scenario that may backfire
on traders who have taken the opposite positions. </p>
<p>We''re all trying to figure out what trade he had on,
Peter Tchir, founder of New York-based hedge fund TF Market
Advisors, said in reference to Iksil. It''s been nonstop.
Everyone''s trying to get their hands around it. </p>
<p>Trading volumes rose at the end of last week on contracts
that Iksil, known as the London Whale for the size of his
positions, is believed to have taken, according to market
participants who asked not to be identified because their
trading strategies aren''t public. </p>
<h2>Narrowing Gap </h2>
<p>Credit swaps on Series 9 of the Markit CDX index that
expire in December 2017 jumped 12.3 basis points to 139.3 basis
points on May 11, the biggest increase since Sept. 22, before
reaching 145.9 today, according to data provider CMA. The
difference between the index and the weighted average of its
members, a gap that was said to have swelled from Iksil''s
trades, shrank to 1.5 basis points today from 14 on May 10 and
18 on May 1, according to prices from two market participants. </p>
<p>A so-called tranche of the same index that covers the first
3 percent of losses, concentrating its risks in companies from
distressed bond insurer MBIA Inc. to mortgage insurer Radian
Group Inc., jumped to the highest since Jan. 5, climbing 2.6
percentage points to 71.9 percent upfront, CMA prices show. </p>
<p>The tranche, in which market participants familiar with
trading flows said Iksil also took positions, has climbed 8.9
percentage points this month. </p>
<h2>Egregious Mistakes'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan is seeking to stem losses after its chief
investment office took flawed positions on synthetic credit
trades, which may cost the lender an additional $1 billion this
quarter or next, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said May 10
on a conference call with analysts. The loss originated from the
firm''s London CIO unit, an executive at the bank said. </p>
<p>There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,
Dimon said. These were egregious mistakes, they were self-inflicted. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said today Matt Zames will succeed Ina Drew as
chief investment officer. The entire staff of the London CIO
unit is at risk of dismissal as the trading loss prompts the
first executive departures as soon as this week, a person
familiar with the situation said. The firm is examining whether
anyone in the unit, which employs a few dozen people in London,
sought to hide risks, said the person, who requested anonymity
because the deliberations are private. </p>
<h2>Poorly Executed'' </h2>
<p>The losses stem from trades that were designed to hedge the
bank''s overall credit risks, Dimon said on the conference call.
The bank was reducing the hedge, he said, but in hindsight,
the new strategy was flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed, and poorly monitored. </p>
<p>The portfolio has proven to be riskier, more volatile,
and less effective as an economic hedge than we thought, he
said. </p>
<p>Dimon, 56, has been a critic of regulations including the
so-called Volcker rule meant to bar proprietary trading by banks
with federally insured deposits. He told analysts that the
timing of the announcement plays right into all the hands of
those pushing for a strict version of the restrictions. </p>
<p>The chips at the poker table are in fewer and fewer hands
because there are fewer firms with size balance sheets, said
Lawrence McDonald, senior director for credit, sales and trading
at Newedge USA LLC and author of the book A Colossal Failure
of Common Sense about the 2008 demise of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. This is the product of the government''s
regulation. It''s crazy. It puts some firms at greater risk. </p>
<h2>Multiple Traders </h2>
<p>Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that Iksil had
amassed positions that were so large he was driving price moves
in the $10 trillion market for credit swaps indexes tied to
corporate creditworthiness. The loss occurred in London under
multiple traders, according to an executive at the bank, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>A group of hedge funds and other money managers began
looking to profit by betting distortions created by JPMorgan''s
moves would normalize. The dislocations were so large that they
were creating situations in which traders were able to
effectively buy $1 of default protection for about 80 cents, the
market participants said. </p>
<p>Series 9 of the Markit CDX index is tied to 121 companies,
all of which were investment grade more than four years ago,
including Armonk, New York-based MBIA''S now junk-rated MBIA
Insurance Corp. unit and Philadelphia-based Radian. </p>
<h2>Index Rolls </h2>
<p>New versions of Markit Group Ltd.''s indexes are created
every six months. Companies are replaced if they no longer have
appropriate credit grades, aren''t among the most actively traded
borrowers, or fail to meet other criteria. Four other companies
initially included in Series 9, CIT Group Inc., Washington
Mutual Inc., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, triggered credit events
during or after the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The Series 9 contract expiring in 2017 climbed 27 basis
points from the end of March through last week. JPMorgan''s
trades probably aren''t one-way bets, market participants said in
April. The bank may be offsetting the trades by buying
protection on the same index with contracts that expire about
seven months from now, the people said. </p>
<p>That strategy would pay JPMorgan the difference between the
long-dated contracts and the short-dated ones, about 41 basis
points at the end of March for Series 9, and the trade would
gain when the gap narrows or lose when it widens. The hedge
would end in December unless another trade is made to replace
it. </p>
<p>The gap on the index soared 14 basis points on May 11 and
has climbed 25 basis points since the end of March, a 61 percent
increase, according to data from CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. </p>
<h2>Blood In The Water'' </h2>
<p>The difference between the same maturities of the riskiest
tranche contracts ballooned to 54.2 percentage points from 45.5
percentage points at the end of March, CMA prices show. It
widened 3 percentage points on May 11. </p>
<p>I know how Wall Street works. When there''s blood in the
water, the sharks are going to attack that animal, Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales Partners LLC in New York who
downgraded his recommendation on JPMorgan''s stock in March to
sector perform, said in a telephone interview last week.
It could make it very difficult for them to unwind a trade. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, the current version of the
Markit CDX Investment Grade Index, Series 18, climbed by 5.3
basis points to a mid-price of 113.9 basis points as of 12:07
p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>That''s the highest level since Jan. 18 on an intra-day
basis for the index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default
swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. </p>
<h2>Rate Swap Spreads </h2>
<p>The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
bond market stress, also reached the highest level since
January, climbing 3.1 basis points to 37.78 basis points as of
11:51 a.m. in New York. The gauge, at the highest level since
Jan. 12 on an intra-day basis, widens when investors seek the
perceived safety of government securities and narrows when they
favor assets such as corporate bonds. </p>
<p>Bonds of Chesapeake Energy Corp. are the most actively
traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
with 218 trades of $1 million or more as of 11:52 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>

dismissal, a person familiar with the situation said. </p>

<p>Treasuries have room to rally further if the situation in

Greece since voters revolted against austerity in May 6
elections raises the risks of a Greek exit from the euro zone
following the new elections likely to take place June 17, they
wrote. </p>

commodities in the Americas, according to the memo. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, confirmed
the memo''s contents. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which generated 57 percent of its first-quarter revenue from sales and trading, is forming the so-called
Institutional Client Group to provide a central point of
contact and relationship management for clients of the
securities division, according to the memo. ICG will be

<p>Sugar supplies will outpace demand by 7.8 million metric
tons in 2012-13, the bank said in a report e-mailed today. That
compares with a forecast for a surplus of 6.8 million tons on

bigger than consumption, with a surplus of 8.1 million tons in
the current 2011-12 season, according to the bank. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s ESPN sports network
is talking with Apple Inc. (AAPL) about giving subscribers online
access to programming through the computer maker''s Apple TV
device, according to two executives. </p>
<p>The network would consider putting its WatchESPN
application on Apple TV for users who confirm they are pay-TV
customers, ESPN executive Sean Bratches said today. </p>
<p>ESPN, the most-watched U.S. sports network is making more
programming available online and on mobile devices to reach
customers watching TV in new formats. The network now provides
subscribers ESPN3, a digital channel that''s part of the
WatchESPN app, to subscribers through Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s Xbox
video-game console as part of some pay-TV plans, including from
Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)''s FiOS and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) </p>
<p>We''re a platform-agnostic content company, Bratches,
the network''s executive vice president of affiliate and
advertising sales, said today in an interview. To the extent
that in the future there''s an opportunity with Apple to
authenticate through the pay-TV food chain as we''re doing with
Microsoft, that''s something that we will participate in. </p>
<p>ESPN is also talking with other Internet video providers,
said Ed Erhardt, ESPN''s president of global customer marketing
and sales. Earlier this year, ESPN allowed Facebook Inc. (FB) users
to watch college basketball games on an authenticated basis. </p>
<p>The executives spoke at advertiser meetings in New York
today, where the network announced programming for the TV season
starting in September. </p>
<h2>No Deal </h2>
<p>No deal is imminent with Apple, said Amy Phillips, a
spokeswoman for Bristol, Connecticut-based ESPN. </p>
<p>We''re not having conversations with Apple about
authenticating WatchESPN, Phillips said. </p>
<p>Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Using apps to expand cable-channel viewing online involves
a number of steps, including security, carrier access and
getting the software installed on Web-connected devices, such as
the Xbox, that are popular with viewers. </p>
<p>Time Warner Cable Inc., for example, offers customers
WatchESPN, though ESPN3 isn''t available through Xbox. The cable
system, second to Comcast, expects to have a deal soon,
according to Alex Dudley, a spokesman for New York-based Time
Warner Cable. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, declined 0.4 percent
to $45.01 at the close in New York. The stock has climbed 20
percent this year. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fell
0.9 percent to $553.17 and has gained 37 percent this year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, will consider reclaiming incentive pay from employees
including former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew after her
unit had a $2 billion trading loss, said two senior executives. </p>
<p>The lender can cancel stock awards or demand they be repaid
if an employee engages in conduct that causes material
financial or reputational harm, JPMorgan said in its annual
proxy statement. The company will claw back pay if it''s
appropriate, said one of the executives, who asked not to be

<p>The incident, which led to Drew''s retirement yesterday, may
test JPMorgan''s clawback policy amid mounting investor criticism
over Wall Street pay practices and as regulators investigate the
trades. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the strategy
that led to the loss was poorly executed and poorly
monitored and that it gave ammunition to proponents of
stricter bank regulation. </p>
<p>The political environment is very sensitive right now and
this couldn''t have come at a worse time, said David Knutson, a
credit analyst in Chicago with Legal  General Investment
Management, which owns JPMorgan debt. I can see how pressure
from regulators could result in JPMorgan attempting to exercise
a clawback. </p>

<p>Broker-dealer Morgan Keegan  Co. (RJF) and
Exis Capital Management Inc. won the dismissal of racketeering
claims in an $8 billion lawsuit brought by Canadian insurer
Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) </p>
<p>New Jersey Superior Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury in
Morristown ruled that Fairfax couldn''t apply state law in
bringing such claims. Fairfax, in its 2006 lawsuit, accused
investors of conspiring with analysts and researchers to drive
down its stock price by spreading false rumors in a so-called
bear raid. </p>
<p>The allegations make clear that New York law
presumptively applies, Hansbury ruled May 11 in an opinion
made public today. Fairfax''s allegations of an enterprise to
deflate its stock value through a conspiracy of lies clearly
took place in New York, he ruled. </p>
<p>Hansbury will hold a trial in September on the remaining
claims, which include tortious interference and disparagement,
said Fairfax attorney Michael J. Bowe of Kasowitz Benson Torres
 Friedman LLP. </p>
<h2>Remaining Claims </h2>
<p>This decision is wrong and we will appeal it, Bowe said
in a phone interview. But the fact is the defendants are still
facing a September trial on plaintiffs'' remaining claims
involving the same multiple-billion dollar damages covered by
the dismissed racketeering claims. </p>
<p>Raymond James Financial Inc. last month completed a $1.2
billion acquisition of Morgan Keegan from Regions Financial
Corp. (RF) </p>
<p>We''re pleased that the court refused to allow Fairfax''s
RICO against Morgan Keegan and the remaining defendants to go
forward, Kathy Ridley, a spokeswoman for Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan, said in an interview. As the judge
pointed out, Fairfax lost the opportunity for treble damages and
reimbursements of their fees and costs. </p>
<p>The case is Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. v. SAC Capital
Management LLC, L-2032-06, Superior Court of New Jersey, Morris
County (Morristown). </p>

<p>More Morgan Stanley shareholders
approved the firm''s executive compensation package for top
managers after Chief Executive Officer James Gorman took a 25
percent pay cut and received no cash bonus. </p>
<p>Investors voted 95 percent in favor of the policy in a non-
binding resolution, up from about 79 percent last year,
according to a preliminary tally at the bank''s annual meeting
today in Purchase, New York. Corporate Secretary Martin Cohen
was interrupted in announcing the tally by about 20 protesters
who engaged in an organized chant about executive pay and income
inequality. </p>
<p>ISS Proxy Services USA and Glass-Lewis  Co., proxy
advisory companies, endorsed the New York-based firm''s pay plans
after ISS last year recommended shareholders vote against it.
Citigroup Inc. (C) shareholders rejected an executive pay plan last
month, a first among the six largest U.S. banks, amid criticism
it lets CEO Vikram Pandit collect millions of dollars in rewards
too easily. </p>
<p>Gorman, 53, received a $10.5 million package for 2011, down
from $14 million for 2010, after the bank''s shares dropped 44
percent last year. He got $5.04 million in restricted stock,
$1.94 million in shares tied to company performance, $800,000 in
salary and a deferred cash bonus of $2.72 million that can be
clawed back. </p>
<h2>Protester''s Questions </h2>
<p>The meeting was held in an auditorium at the headquarters
of Morgan Stanley (MS)''s wealth-management unit. The protesters were
allowed in as shareholders, and some asked questions or made
statements about income inequality, the rising cost of
education, the firm''s inability to create jobs in New York City
and unethical behavior by the firm. </p>
<p>Gorman said he took umbrage with the assertion that the
firm had engaged in unethical behavior, saying any past mistakes
were bad business decisions rather than a breach of ethics. He
didn''t answer a question about whether regulatory fines meant
the bank was too big to manage. </p>
<p>Each of this year''s 13 director nominees received at least
93 percent of the votes, according to the preliminary tally. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said its executive compensation plan won
the approval of 91.5 percent of shareholders in a non-binding
annual advisory vote, up from 73 percent last year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan announced the preliminary results today at the
company''s annual shareholder meeting in Tampa, Florida, where
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also addressed
the $2 billion trading loss disclosed last week. </p>
<p>This should never have happened, Dimon, 56, said at the
meeting, where about a dozen protesters stood outside carrying
signs. I can''t justify it. </p>
<p>The board awarded $23 million in salary and bonuses to
Dimon for his 2011 performance, the same amount he received for
2010. The New York-based bank reported record net income for
2011 and its stock fell 22 percent during the year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s compensation plan also awarded $14 million in
salary and bonuses to Ina Drew, 55, who resigned yesterday. Her
departure came four days after JPMorgan disclosed that the chief
investment office that Drew oversaw lost $2 billion and may lose
more. The company will consider reclaiming some of her stock
awards, according to two senior executives. </p>
<p>All corrective action will be taken as necessary, Dimon
said at the meeting. Ina served the firm for more than 30
years and has been a great partner. But it''s important that we
bring in new management. </p>
<h2>Shocking'' News </h2>
<p>Most of the votes on compensation and other proposals were
probably cast before the loss was announced, according to Nell Minow, co-owner and board member of GMI Ratings, a research firm
that specializes in corporate governance. </p>
<p>I don''t think that the vote will be indicative of
shareholder concerns on this issue, Minow said. It''s unusual
to have such shocking and bad news come in after most of the
votes have been cast. </p>
<p>Dimon read a statement about the losses at the start of the
meeting and the matter was raised only in passing by
shareholders who were given an opportunity to speak. Talking to
reporters after the meeting concluded, Dimon said, The buck
always stops with me. </p>
<p>ISS Proxy Services USA and Glass Lewis  Co., two
shareholder advisory firms, recommended on April 30 that
JPMorgan shareholders approve the bank''s compensation plan. </p>
<p>ISS said that while JPMorgan continues to resist adopting
incentive plans with pre-established goals and long-term
objectives, it added a feature that provides both an
incentive for sustained performance and some mitigation against
excessive risk-taking. </p>
<p>Shareholders also approved the re-election of all the
directors up for a vote, with each receiving at least 86.2
percent of the ballots cast, according to preliminary results
announced at the meeting. They defeated a proposal that would
have split the role of chairman and CEO. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s Xalkori, a drug that
targets lung cancer caused by a gene defect, wiped out all signs
of malignancy in some children with different tumor types, in a
study that proves aiming treatment at genes rather than disease
sites may be more effective. </p>
<p>The findings, being released today in advance of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting that starts June
1, tested the medicine against rare child tumors of the nerves,
blood and soft tissue that can be driven by mutations in the ALK
gene targeted by Xalkori. The drug helped kids with all three
tumors, with the most impressive results seen in a blood cancer
called anaplastic large cell lymphoma. In these cases, all signs
of cancer vanished in 7 of 8 kids who got the drug. </p>
<p>The results show how gene-targeted medicines first tested
in one cancer can rapidly be applied to other malignancies with
the same gene abnormality. By identifying the genetic drivers of
pediatric tumors, scientists may be able to take targeted drugs
already approved for adults and apply them to children. </p>
<p>This is a glimpse of the new paradigm of cancer drug
development, said Michael Link, a Stanford University pediatric
cancer specialist and president of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, on a conference call. By understanding the
molecular drivers of the tumors, we have the prospect of
seeing dramatic responses. </p>
<p>In an interview, Link called the preliminary results
really extraordinary. </p>
<h2>Nerve-Cell Cancer </h2>
<p>The Pfizer drug also eliminated measurable signs of cancer
in 2 of 27 kids with neuroblastoma, a rare nerve cell cancer,
who had failed standard therapy. The drug also shrank tumors in
2 of 7 children with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, a rare
malignancy of soft tissues. </p>
<p>The trial was sponsored by the government-funded Children''s
Oncology Group, a consortium of experts, children''s hospitals,
cancer centers and universities, and also received support from
New York-based Pfizer (PFE), the world''s largest drugmaker. </p>
<p>While it is far too soon to tell if any of the children are
cured, these are very promising results for kids who
historically have had very few options and no hope, Yael
Mosse, a pediatric oncologist at the Children''s Hospital of
Philadelphia and the study''s lead researcher, said in an
interview. They have their whole lives ahead of them. </p>
<p>About 120 kids in the U.S. each year develop ALK-positive
lymphoma, while 100 get neuroblastoma that contains defects in
the ALK gene, Mosse said. </p>
<h2>Advanced Testing Planned </h2>
<p>Mosse said the researchers plan to begin a final-stage
trial of the Pfizer drug in kids with lymphoma by the end of the
year. The goal is to use the Pfizer drug for all children newly
diagnosed with this type of lymphoma and replace some of the
toxic chemotherapy that is used today, she said. </p>
<p>It is a major opportunity to lessen the intensity of
chemotherapy so that cure comes at less of a cost, she said. </p>
<p>Zach Witt is one child who was helped by the drug, said his
mother Pam Witt, who lives in outer suburbs of Philadelphia, in
a phone interview. The 6-year-old developed lymphoma in
September 2010 and relapsed in the middle of his chemotherapy
treatment in early April of 2011. </p>
<p>He soon developed high fevers and became so weak that he
couldn''t make it to the hospital playroom just down the hall
from his room, she said. </p>
<p>Doctors at the Children''s Hospital of Philadelphia gave her
and her husband a choice of putting Zach on a more toxic chemo
regimen or going into the trial of Xalkori. They chose the
Xalkori. </p>
<h2>Being a Kid Again </h2>
<p>By the third day on the drug, Zach was running to the
hospital playroom, she said. Today he is out of the hospital,
and does everything any other kid would do, she said. He is
so energetic he recently went on a 21-mile bike ride with his
father, she said. </p>
<p>I don''t think Zach would be here without the Pfizer
drug, she said. </p>
<p>Child and adult cancer drug testing used to operate in
separate universes, said Rob Sweetman, a senior director at
Pfizer''s cancer unit. Now we understand these molecular
drivers that are connecting these two that weren''t as obvious
before. </p>
<p>Sweetman said Pfizer is carefully monitoring the progress
of the child trials and will make a determination whether to
seek regulatory approval for the child uses when more data is
available. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) climbed the most
in seven weeks after announcing its finance unit will resume
payouts to the parent company that were suspended in 2009 during
a freeze in credit markets. </p>
<p>GE Capital will pay a special dividend of $4.5 billion this
year and hand over a $475 million quarterly payout in the three
months through June, according to a statement today. Full-year
payments, excluding the special dividend, are targeted to be 30
percent of the finance unit''s 2012 earnings. </p>
<p>Restarting the dividend is a milestone in GE Capital''s
recovery from the financial crisis, when the unit suffered $32
billion of credit losses and received capital infusions from the
parent. Proceeds from the transfer will be used to accelerate
share repurchases, one of Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt''s priorities this year. </p>
<p>It''s earlier than we thought and bigger than we thought,
so on an overall basis it''s very bullish, said Scott Davis, an
analyst at Barclays Capital in New York who had forecasted a
$3.2 billion payout in the second half of this year. Without
this dividend up to the parent, you can''t really do buybacks,
which is something shareholders really want them to do. </p>
<p>GE gained the most today of any stock in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU), advancing 3.3 percent to $19 at the close in
New York. The increase was the largest since Nov. 30. </p>
<h2>Fed Review </h2>
<p>GE, which had targeted a payment of 45 percent of the
finance unit''s profits, told investors in April that the plan
was subject to the business''s review by the Federal Reserve, its
new regulator. Annual payments from the unit were as much as
$8.6 billion before the dividend''s suspension amid the global
financial crisis following Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''s 2008
bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Deirdre LaTour, a spokeswoman for Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE, said the company can''t comment on the Fed process. A
Federal Reserve spokeswoman, Barbara Hagenbaugh, also declined
to comment. </p>
<p>GE Capital''s decision to declare and pay dividends to GE
is a management decision of the GE Capital board, LaTour said.
Like other communications with the bank regulators, our
discussions with the Fed involve confidential supervisory
information that we cannot disclose. </p>
<p>The $475 million quarterly dividend approved by the finance
unit''s board represents 30 percent of earnings for the three
months through March, LaTour said in an e-mail. </p>
<h2>Industrial Businesses </h2>
<p>As GE Capital sells or winds down unwanted assets, the
parent could receive any excess capital above what regulators
require to be retained by the finance unit, Chief Financial
Officer Keith Sherin has said. </p>
<p>Since the financial crisis, GE has pared the finance unit
while Immelt focuses on industrial businesses such as energy and
transportation, which are typically valued more highly by
investors. He has worked to shrink GE Capital by exiting
businesses such as Irish mortgage lending and reducing the size
of its balance sheet. </p>
<p>GE Capital accounted for 31 percent of the company''s $147.3
billion of revenue last year, compared with 39 percent in 2007,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. </p>
<p>The parent company, which invested $11 billion in energy
acquisitions completed through 2011, said yesterday it agreed to
buy Australian manufacturer Industrea Ltd. for about A$470
million ($466 million) to add mining equipment, technology and
services businesses in emerging markets. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, will eliminate 20 investment-banking jobs
in London as market conditions weaken, according to a person
with knowledge of the cuts. </p>
<p>The staff cuts aren''t related to the $2 billion loss at the
New York-based company''s chief investment office in London, said
the person, who asked for anonymity because the investment bank
reductions haven''t been made public. The firm has about 8,000
employees in the London investment bank, the person said. </p>
<p>Lenders are trimming staff amid pressure to cut expenses as
new revenue becomes scarce and regulators demand more capital.
Banks pulled back from making new loans to package into bonds as
Europe''s debt crisis roiled credit markets. Trading revenue from
securitized products at the 10 biggest global investment banks
dropped to about $10 billion last year from about $17.5 billion
in 2010, according to data from consultant Coalition Ltd. </p>
<p>JPMorgan eliminated some senior mortgage traders and
salespersons in the U.S. investment bank earlier this year,
according to people with direct knowledge of the moves. The firm
also dismissed about 5 percent of its equities traders and sales
staff on March 20 and cut about 100 employees in its treasury
and securities services unit in January, according to three
people with knowledge of those moves. </p>
<h2>Sticking With Iksil </h2>
<p>The bank continues to employ Bruno Iksil, the trader known
as the London Whale whose positions may have distorted prices in
some derivatives markets. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the
New York-based firm, confirmed Iksil''s status. The New York
Times reported earlier that Iksil is leaving JPMorgan by the end
of this year. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that Iksil had
accumulated derivatives that track the financial health of
corporations, and that the holdings were so large that they
distorted prices. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon later
disclosed a $2 billion trading loss that he attributed to an
egregious failure at the chief investment office in London,
where Iksil works. Ina Drew, who ran the CIO, retired days after
the loss became public. </p>
<p>A call to Iksil in London was referred to the public
relations office. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent to $35.82 at 2:52
p.m. in New York. The stock has gained 7.7 percent this year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) shareholders
sued the bank and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon in two
separate cases over the company''s $2 billion trading loss. </p>
<p>An Arizona trust filed a securities-fraud lawsuit in which
it seeks to represent all investors who lost money on the stock
as a result of alleged misstatements by the bank about its
losses. In the second case, an individual investor asked for
damages on behalf of the company from Dimon, the bank''s board
and other executives. Both suits were filed late yesterday in
Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>In the fraud suit, the trust seeks damages for investors
who bought JPMorgan stock from April 13, when Dimon called
concerns over the bank''s trading risk a complete tempest in a
teapot, to May 10, when he disclosed the trading loss
publicly. </p>
<p>The trades in question, however, were anything but a
tempest in a teapot, and quickly went from bad to worse,
according to the complaint filed by Saratoga Advantage Trust --
Financial Services Portfolio, based in Goodyear, Arizona.
During the week following the April 13 conference call, losses
from the trades ballooned to as much as $200 million per day. </p>
<p>In the action seeking damages on behalf of the company,
called a shareholder derivative suit, the plaintiff claims
JPMorgan executives and directors permitted a radical change in
the bank''s exposure to undisclosed investment risk. </p>
<h2>Dimon Statement Cited </h2>
<p>The defendant Dimon went so far as to publicly and
vigorously dispute that any investment safety regulation was
necessary for financial institutions such as JPMorgan, because
the company was purportedly so careful with its investments that
no such regulations would be necessary, James Baker, a
California resident, said in his complaint. All of the
individual defendants knew this was simply not the case. </p>
<p>Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on the lawsuits. </p>
<p>The shareholder fraud suit seeks unspecified damages on
behalf of investors. </p>
<p>The derivative suit seeks unspecified damages from the
officers and directors for the bank. </p>
<p>It also asks for a court order requiring that JPMorgan
improve corporate governance by allowing its shareholders to
vote on proposals to strengthen board supervision, to install
two shareholder representatives on the board, to test internal
audit and control policies and to ensure that management be
immediately informed about unacceptable trading risks. </p>
<h2>Credit Products </h2>
<p>The trading losses came on synthetic credit products, which
are derivatives tied to credit performance. In disclosing the
$2 billion loss on transactions he said were intended to manage
risk, Dimon cited egregious failures by the bank''s chief
investment office. </p>
<p>JPMorgan named Matt Zames to lead the office, succeeding
Ina Drew, who retired May 14 amid news of the $2 billion loss. </p>
<p>JPMorgan fell 21 cents to $36.03 at 1:50 p.m. in New York.
The stock advanced 23 percent this year before the losses were
disclosed. </p>
<p>The cases are Baker v. Dimon, 12-cv-03878, and Saratoga
Advantage Trust -- Financial Services Portfolio, 12-cv-03879,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and regulators
may face increasing pressure to explain the lender''s $2 billion
trading loss as the misstep becomes fodder for lawmakers still
haggling over a regulatory overhaul enacted two years ago. </p>
<p>A day after JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told shareholders there was no justification for the
egregious mistakes by the biggest and most profitable U.S.
bank, Federal Reserve and Treasury Department officials faced
lawmakers amid conflict over the meaning of the losses at a
House hearing on systemically important financial firms. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that this week''s news of JPMorgan''s
trading losses has raised significant questions about the
supervision of risk, said Representative Shelley Moore Capito,
the West Virginia Republican leading today''s hearing of her
House Financial Services subcommittee. </p>
<p>The panel''s inquiry, scheduled before Dimon disclosed the
loss on May 10, deals with a Dodd-Frank Act designation that
will impose higher capital standards and more regulatory
scrutiny on firms whose collapse could imperil the economy. It
follows calls by lawmakers for formal review of JPMorgan''s
trades, with Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the Senate
Banking Committee''s top Republican, saying Dimon absolutely
should be called to testify before his panel. </p>
<h2>Political Split </h2>
<p>The politics underlying the debate have split lawmakers by
party lines, with Democrats including Senator Carl Levin using
the loss to bolster the case for tighter restrictions on banks.
Representative Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican who leads
the Financial Services panel, pushed back against that view. </p>
<p>We are again hearing from some of our colleagues that we
need a law which will essentially prevent a business from losing
money or taking risk, Bachus said. No law can do that, nor
should a law prevent a company from taking risks. </p>
<p>Unless the facts are diametrically different from what
lawmakers have been told, depositors and taxpayers aren''t at
risk from the bank''s loss, Bachus said. </p>
<p>While neither house of Congress has set hearings dedicated
to JPMorgan''s disclosure, today''s comments by lawmakers show the
New York-based bank won''t escape the Washington spotlight.
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a South Dakota
Democrat, said he''s planning hearings on financial stability and
Dodd-Frank implementation that will give lawmakers a chance to
address the issue with regulators. </p>
<h2>All the Facts'' </h2>
<p>Lawmakers from both parties and both chambers are calling
for reviews and hearings. Representative Michael Capuano, a
Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the House Financial Services
Oversight and Investigations panel, requested a hearing on the
issue last week. Bachus, in a statement yesterday, said he will
set a hearing on the public-policy implications of the loss. </p>
<p>I don''t think we know what all the facts are, Senator
John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, said yesterday. Certainly I
would support the call for an investigation to find out. </p>
<p>As lawmakers question regulators, JPMorgan is responding by
reaching out. The bank''s Washington operation has deployed
representatives to brief House and Senate staff members on the
strategy that led to the losses, according to three
congressional aides familiar with the briefings. </p>
<h2>Volcker Rule </h2>
<p>The discussions have emphasized that the trades were meant
to hedge risk -- not as proprietary trades targeted by Dodd-Frank''s Volcker rule -- and that JPMorgan is conducting an
internal audit to identify failures and wrongdoing, according to
the aides who participated in or were informed of the briefings. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has had a strong presence on Capitol Hill,
spending $7.6 million on lobbying in 2011, almost $2 million in
the first quarter of this year and distributing more than
$340,000 in campaign contributions from its federal political
action committee since the start of 2011. Much of that money is
directed to House and Senate leadership and lawmakers on the
Senate Banking and House Financial Services (HIG) panels, according to
federal filings. </p>
<p>The bank''s Washington office has dedicated resources for
responding to lawmakers'' inquiries, according to a person with
knowledge of the bank''s strategy. </p>
<h2>Treasury, Fed </h2>
<p>Treasury and Fed officials were the first to face lawmakers
poised to probe JPMorgan as Lance Auer, Treasury''s deputy
assistant secretary for financial institutions, and Michael
Gibson, director of the Fed''s Division of Banking Supervision
and Regulation, testified before Capito''s panel. </p>
<p>The full Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hear
tomorrow from Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement
Director Robert Khuzami, Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez and
top lawyers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. Lawmakers said yesterday
they were preparing questions specifically about the bank. </p>
<p>I certainly expect that the losses at JPMorgan Chase will
be something we talk about, said Representative Brad Miller, a
North Carolina Democrat who said he plans to use the bank''s
disclosure to drive discussion over whether to force the break
up of the largest financial institutions. </p>
<p>Dimon, who had his pay package of $23 million in salary and
bonus for his 2011 performance approved yesterday by 91.5
percent of shareholders, told investors in Tampa yesterday that
the bank has a fortress balance sheet to manage surprises and
setbacks like this. Still, he said, the losses never should
have happened. I can''t justify it. </p>
<p>Even with Dimon''s expressions of contrition and removal of
executives responsible for the loss, lawmakers said scrutiny of
JPMorgan is unlikely to let up any time soon. </p>
<p>I have the greatest respect for Jamie Dimon, I like him,
but this is a bad deal, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said
yesterday. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and funds
managed by the firm raised $1.09 billion selling stock in
Facebook Inc. (FB)''s initial public offering, cashing out almost half
their stake in the social network. </p>
<p>The investment bank and its funds offered 28.7 million of
the 65.9 million shares they own at $38 apiece, the top of the
price range. Goldman Sachs sold 6.18 million of its own
holdings, raising $235 million. The number of shares being
offered by Goldman Sachs was included in a filing yesterday by
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook. </p>
<p>The investment gain helps validate Goldman Sachs Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein''s business model and a
January 2011 transaction that threatened to undermine efforts to
improve his New York-based company''s reputation after it settled
fraud claims a year earlier. U.S. regulators are drafting rules
to prevent banks that receive federal backing from making risky
bets with their own money. </p>
<p>What risks should government-insured banks be taking?
What if, hypothetically, Facebook had imploded? asked Benjamin B. Wallace, an analyst at Westborough, Massachusetts-based
Grimes  Co., which manages about $1 billion and doesn''t hold
Goldman Sachs shares. This is what happens when it works
out. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and its funds could sell 4.3 million more
shares -- bringing the total raised to as much as $1.25 billion
at the $38 price -- if the IPO''s underwriters decide there''s
enough demand, according to Facebook''s filing. If that so-called
greenshoe option is exercised, the investment bank and its funds
will have cut their holdings 50 percent. Underwriters include
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman Sachs. </p>
<h2>Group Effort </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs created a special-purpose vehicle to bundle
the holdings under one name and sell the stock to wealthy
clients. That kept it from running afoul of securities rules
mandating that companies with at least 500 investors meet U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements. Jon Stewart, discussing the deal on Comedy Central''s The Daily
Show, joked at the time, Oh Goldman, is there any
regulation''s intent you can''t subvert? </p>
<p>A document for investors disclosed that Goldman Sachs might
sell or hedge its stake without warning clients, underscoring
potential conflicts in the firm''s business model of investing
its own money as well as advising customers. The bank eventually
said it canceled an offering of Facebook shares to U.S.
investors amid concern that intense media attention may
violate rules limiting marketing of private securities. Only
offshore clients could participate in the deal. </p>
<h2>Balancing Act </h2>
<p>Investing for clients, that''s certainly something they
should be doing, Wallace said about Goldman Sachs. If,
instead of investing proprietary money you pool investor money
and manage that, there''s still an opportunity for Goldman
Sachs, he said. </p>
<p>The IPO, the largest by a technology company, values
Facebook at more than $104 billion. That''s more than double the
$50 billion value at which Goldman Sachs offered $1 billion of
stock to non-U.S. clients in January 2011. The firm and the
Goldman Sachs Investment Partners hedge fund run by Raanan A. Agus bought $450 million of Facebook stock. </p>
<p>A Bloomberg poll in late January 2011 found that 69 percent
of global investors, traders and analysts surveyed thought the
$50 billion valuation was too high. </p>
<h2>What Goldman Gets </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, sold
6.18 million of the 14.2 million shares it owns for its own
account, according to Facebook''s filing. The sale price values
the firm''s total investment at $540 million, of which Goldman
Sachs is cashing in $235 million in the IPO. If the greenshoe is
exercised at $38, Goldman Sachs will raise an additional $35
million. That would cut the size of its holding to 7.1 million
shares, valued at $270 million. </p>
<p>The gain on Goldman Sachs''s Facebook stake will be
recognized in second-quarter results, helping to mitigate
weakness in investment banking and trading revenue, Edward Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy  Investment
Group Inc., wrote in a research note this week. He cut his
second-quarter earnings per share estimate for Goldman Sachs to
$2 from $2.60. </p>
<p>GSIP, the fund run by Agus, sold 1.57 million of the 3.61
million Facebook shares it holds in two investment pools,
according to the filing. The IPO helped GSIP raise $59.6 million
and a greenshoe at the same price would add $8.9 million,
leaving GSIP with 1.8 million shares valued at $69 million. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s non-U.S. clients, whose Facebook shares are
held in a Cayman Islands-based investment pool called FBDC
Investors Offshore Holdings LP, sold 20.9 million shares for
$795 million. A greenshoe at the same price would raise another
$119 million and leave the investor pool with 24.1 million
shares worth $914 million at $38 a share. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the share sales. </p>

<p>A Pfizer (PFE) Inc. drug that has
transformed treatment for adult lung cancers caused by a gene
defect is now saving children with deadly tumors. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Xalkori eradicated signs of malignancy in some
kids with rare tumors of the nerves, blood and soft tissue,
according to findings released yesterday in advance of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting that starts June
1. The three tumor types can be driven by ALK gene mutations
targeted by Xalkori. </p>
<p>The results show how medicines that target genetic flaws
can be first tested in one cancer and then rapidly applied to
other malignancies with the same gene abnormality. The drug
helped kids with all three tumors, with the most-impressive
results seen in a blood cancer called anaplastic large cell
lymphoma. In these cases, all signs of cancer vanished in seven
of eight kids who got the drug. </p>
<p>This is a glimpse of the new paradigm of cancer drug
development, said Michael Link, a Stanford University pediatric
cancer specialist and president of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, on a conference call with reporters. By
understanding the molecular drivers of the tumors, we have the
prospect of seeing dramatic responses. </p>
<p>By identifying the genetic drivers of pediatric tumors,
scientists may be able to take targeted drugs already approved
for adults and apply them to children. </p>
<p>In an interview, Link called the initial results really
extraordinary. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $22.56 at the close of
New York trading. </p>
<h2>Nerve and Tissue Cancers </h2>
<p>The Pfizer drug also eliminated measurable signs of cancer
in 2 of 27 kids with neuroblastoma, a rare nerve cell cancer,
who had failed standard therapy. The drug also shrank tumors in
2 of 7 children with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, a rare
malignancy of soft tissues. </p>
<p>The trial was sponsored by the government-funded Children''s
Oncology Group, a consortium of experts, children''s hospitals,
cancer centers and universities, and also received support from
New York-based Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker. </p>
<p>While it is far too soon to tell if any of the children are
cured, these are very promising results for kids who
historically have had very few options and no hope, Yael
Mosse, a pediatric oncologist at the Children''s Hospital of
Philadelphia and the study''s lead researcher, said in an
interview. They have their whole lives ahead of them. </p>
<p>About 120 kids in the U.S. each year develop ALK-positive
lymphoma, while 100 get neuroblastoma that contains defects in
the ALK gene, Mosse said. </p>
<h2>Advanced Testing Planned </h2>
<p>Mosse said the researchers plan to begin a final-stage
trial of the Pfizer drug in kids with lymphoma by the end of the
year. The goal is to use the Pfizer drug for all children newly
diagnosed with this type of lymphoma and replace some of the
toxic chemotherapy that is used today, she said. </p>
<p>It is a major opportunity to lessen the intensity of
chemotherapy so that cure comes at less of a cost, she said. </p>
<p>Zach Witt is one child who was helped by the drug, said his
mother Pam Witt, who lives in outer suburbs of Philadelphia, in
a phone interview. The 6-year-old developed lymphoma in
September 2010 and relapsed in the middle of his chemotherapy
treatment in early April of 2011. </p>
<p>He soon developed high fevers and became so weak that he
couldn''t make it to the hospital playroom just down the hall
from his room, she said. </p>
<p>Doctors at the Children''s Hospital of Philadelphia gave her
and her husband a choice of putting Zach on a more toxic chemo
regimen or going into the trial of Xalkori. They chose the
Xalkori. </p>
<h2>Being a Kid Again </h2>
<p>By the third day on the drug, Zach was running to the
hospital playroom, she said. Today he is out of the hospital,
and does everything any other kid would do, she said. He is
so energetic he recently went on a 21-mile bike ride with his
father, she said. </p>
<p>I don''t think Zach would be here without the Pfizer
drug, she said. </p>
<p>Child and adult cancer drug testing used to operate in
separate universes, said Rob Sweetman, a senior director at
Pfizer''s cancer unit. Now we understand these molecular
drivers that are connecting these two that weren''t as obvious
before. </p>
<p>Sweetman said Pfizer is carefully monitoring the progress
of the child trials and will make a determination whether to
seek regulatory approval for the child uses when more data is
available. </p>

<p>Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s
chief executive officer, agreed to testify before a Senate
committee on the company''s $2 billion loss as lawmakers debate
whether to tighten rules on trading by U.S. lenders. </p>
<p>Dimon was asked to appear after the Senate Banking
Committee concludes hearings on industry reforms in June,
according to a statement from Chairman Tim Johnson, a South
Dakota Democrat. </p>
<p>As always, we will continue to be open and transparent
with our regulators and Congress, said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan, who confirmed Dimon''s plan to testify.
The New York-based lender is the largest in the U.S. by assets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and regulators face pressure to explain the loss
as lawmakers haggle over rules for the Dodd-Frank regulatory
overhaul enacted two years ago. Dimon, 56, announced the loss
May 10, assailing his firm''s handling of trading in synthetic
credit positions as flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored. </p>
<p>While the company and regulators have briefed the committee
over the past week, our due diligence has made it clear that
the Banking Committee should hear directly from JPMorgan Chase''s
CEO Jamie Dimon, Johnson said. </p>
<p>Johnson''s decision to invite Dimon came after joint staff
briefings with federal regulators and a separate briefing from
JPMorgan, the lawmaker said in a statement. The invitation comes
as Congress increases scrutiny, with at least one Republican
senator calling for Dimon to claw back pay from employees
responsible for the losses and Senate Democrats using the
disclosure to bolster their case for tighter restrictions on
proprietary trading. </p>

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lawyer
from Sullivan  Cromwell LLP may testify at next week''s insider-trading trial of Rajat Gupta, a former director at the bank, a
prosecutor said. </p>
<p>At a pretrial conference yesterday in Manhattan federal
court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky said prosecutors
expect to present testimony from Steven Peikin, a lawyer at
Sullivan  Cromwell who advises New York-based Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Peikin''s testimony will relate to certain statements made
by Mr. Gupta in an interview, Brodsky told U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff, without providing other details. </p>
<p>Brodsky''s comments came at the close of a hearing in which
Rakoff said he''s likely to allow prosecutors to introduce as
evidence four wiretaps from 2008 that are critical to the
government''s case. </p>
<p>In one, Gupta is heard discussing Goldman Sachs business
with Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, who is now
serving an 11-year prison term for insider trading. In three
others, Gupta isn''t a participant as Rajaratnam discusses stock
trades with his employees. </p>
<p>Prosecutors say Rajaratnam made the trades based on Gupta''s
leaks. Rakoff said the three wiretaps may show Rajaratnam, as
one member of an insider-trading conspiracy, referring to tips
he got from Gupta, who prosecutors say is another member of the
scheme. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won a federal trade
ruling that will force Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) to alter
software on some of its Android-based mobile phones to keep
bringing them into the U.S. </p>
<p>A U.S. International Trade Commission judge found that
Motorola Mobility infringed a patent covering a program by
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft called ActiveSync, which
lets users generate meeting requests among a group. Six other
patents weren''t violated, the judge ruled. </p>
<p>The ruling still must be reviewed by President Barack Obama, who can override the order on public policy grounds. </p>
<p>We hope that now Motorola will be willing to join the
vast majority of Android device makers selling phones in the
U.S. by taking a license to our patents, David Howard,
Microsoft''s deputy general counsel, said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>An exclusion order would affect Droid 2, Droid X, i1, Cliq
XT, Devour, Backflip, Charm and Clip models, according to a
filing with the ITC. </p>
<h2>Android Fight </h2>
<p>Motorola Mobility said it was disappointed and would
explore options including an appeal. Motorola Mobility will
not experience any impact in the near term, Jennifer Erickson,
a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The ruling probably will push Motorola to reach a
settlement and pay Microsoft a licensing fee instead of having
to modify the phone software, said Charlie Wolf, an analyst with
Needham  Co in New York. </p>
<p>These cases usually end up with the parties settling,
Wolf said. </p>
<p>The case is part of a broader effort by Microsoft and Apple
Inc. to curtail the growth of mobile devices that run on Google
Inc. (GOOG)''s Android operating system. Google licenses Android for
free to further its mobile-advertising business. </p>
<p>The platform has become the most popular for smartphones,
with more than half of a market for mobile devices that Yankee
Group has projected will reach $360 billion this year. </p>
<h2>Licensing Deals </h2>
<p>Microsoft contends it should be paid royalties by makers of
mobile devices that run on Android. The software maker has
reached licensing deals with Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC
Corp. (2498) </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, which is being bought by Google, refused
to pay and instead struck back in a case at the trade agency. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s willingness to license is different from Apple,
which wants makers of Android smartphones to make changes to its
devices, Wolf said. </p>
<p>I would expect Motorola to get together with Microsoft to
resolve this, he said. </p>
<h2>Xbox, Windows </h2>
<p>Microsoft has capitalized on patents it said cover features
of Android, and said it has struck licensing agreements with
makers of more than 70 percent of all Android devices sold in
the U.S. Microsoft''s only litigation with Android-device makers
is with Motorola Mobility, following a settlement reached last
month with Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS) </p>
<p>The software maker filed the ITC complaint in October 2010.
Motorola Mobility responded by sending letters demanding
royalties on Microsoft products, including the Xbox and Windows
operating system. The legal battle has since escalated, with
Microsoft accusing Motorola Mobility of misusing its patents in
a lawsuit pending in Seattle and before regulators in the U.S.
and Europe. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility has filed its own patent-infringement
claim against Microsoft at the agency, seeking to block sales of
the Xbox. An ITC judge said Microsoft was infringing four
Motorola Mobility patents; Microsoft wants the commission to
review that decision. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s case against Motorola Mobility is In the Matter
of Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components
Thereof, 337-744, while Motorola Mobility''s case against
Microsoft is In the matter of Gaming and Entertainment Consoles,
337-752, both U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, was upgraded to buy by UBS AG (UBSN) after the
firm''s shares dropped to a level Chief Executive Officer James Gorman deemed inexplicable. </p>
<p>Drags on trading revenue from Europe''s debt crisis are
already reflected in the price of Morgan Stanley''s stock, which
has fallen 23 percent this month, UBS analysts led by Brennan Hawken said in a note to investors today. That valuation, less
than half the tangible book value, reflects a very negative
outcome, and the shares should rise about 30 percent, Hawken
wrote. </p>
<p>The bank may face lower trading revenue as client activity
dwindles and credit spreads widen, with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
analyst Kian Abouhossein estimating today that Morgan Stanley''s
fixed-income revenue may drop 31 percent. The lender''s stock has
also fallen because of concern that Moody''s may cut its credit
rating three levels and that the firm may face increased
regulation after JPMorgan''s $2 billion trading loss, Susquehanna
Financial Group''s Doug Sipkin wrote today. </p>
<p>I find the stock trading around half-book to be a little
inexplicable, but these markets are fragile, Gorman, 53, said
this week at the company''s annual meeting. I believe in the
long-term strategy for our business, I''m very comfortable with
it, and I think we''re positioned well. Short-term, I''m not going
to lose any sleep over it. </p>
<p>Tangible book value is the bank''s estimate of how much
money would remain if all its assets were liquidated and
liabilities paid off. The bank should trade between 60 percent
and 70 percent of adjusted tangible book value, Hawken said. </p>
<h2>Over Penalized'' </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 0.8 percent to close at $13.35 in New
York. The bank''s shares have dropped 26 percent since rising to
$18.07 on April 19, when the firm reported first-quarter results
that beat estimates. The stock is down 12 percent this year,
after falling 44 percent last year and 8.1 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s credit ratings may be reduced by as many
as three levels, the largest potential downgrade among U.S.
lenders, Moody''s has said. The ratings firm will take action by
the end of June, according to a statement last month. </p>
<p>We believe investors have over penalized Morgan
Stanley, Susquehanna''s Sipkin said, recommending investors buy
the bank''s shares and sell Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) stock. With
respect to Moody''s, we believe a three-notch rating downgrade is
more than discounted in MS stock at this point. </p>
<h2>Credit Spreads Widen </h2>
<p>A downgrade could force Morgan Stanley to post more
collateral on derivatives trades and pay more to borrow. Gorman
said last month the investment bank has taken steps to ensure
any fallout from a downgrade would be manageable, and Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, said the firm has liquidity of
$179 billion. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s credit spreads have widened in the last
month, with credit-default swaps on the bank''s five-year senior
debt climbing to 454 basis points yesterday, the highest level
since November. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage
point. </p>
<p>The financial sector has been under stress, and all of
the companies'' spreads aren''t where they''d ideally long-term
like them to be, Gorman said this week. </p>
<p>International Strategy  Investment Group Inc.''s Ed Najarian cut his second-quarter earnings estimate by 17 cents
this week as he sees a 40 percent drop in fixed-income trading
revenue from the first quarter. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) recalled 650,000 units of

<p>The pills were recalled from stores by distributors in a

<p>Republicans in the U.S. Congress were
uniting behind a call to repeal all or part of the 2010
financial regulatory overhaul. Since JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
announced its $2 billion trading loss earlier this month, that
front has splintered. </p>
<p>Some are seeking investigations, with Senator Mike Crapo of
Idaho among those calling on JPMorgan Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon to testify, which he has agreed to
do. Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the Banking Committee''s
top Republican, said the loss emphasizes the need for capital
standards for banks tougher than what the overhaul requires.
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee says Congress has no
business getting involved. </p>
<p>The divisions point to a party torn by instincts to fix
problems as significant as the losses suffered by one of the
nation''s biggest banks, by a Tea Party-backed faction that seeks
to avoid any prospect of future bailouts, and by presumptive
Republican nominee Mitt Romney''s stance that one bank''s loss was
another investor''s gain. </p>
<p>We need to get over the idea that every time a bank fails
or has a problem that Washington''s job is to bail it out or fix
it, Alexander said. </p>
<h2>Suspicious of Banks </h2>
<p>Congressional Republicans may not be able to resolve their
differences on this issue, said Michael Franc, vice president of
government relations at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based research group that favors small government. While most
Republican lawmakers oppose strict regulation, more are becoming
as suspicious of big banks as they are of big government, he
said. </p>
<p>One of the dynamics that''s emerged in the Republican
Party over the last decade or so is a growing populist feel,
he said. </p>
<p>As Republican lawmakers split over their response to the
JPMorgan loss, Democrats are unified on their message: that the
trading loss underscores the need for tougher regulation of
banks. </p>
<p>It''s one of those things that''s clear that they were
betting like you would do at the craps table in Las Vegas and
they bet the wrong way, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a
Nevada Democrat, said of the company''s loss this week. That''s
fine if they did it with their own money, but the problem is,
the way Wall Street''s been working, is that heads they win,
tails we lose. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan Loophole'' </h2>
<p>Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon,
the two Democrats who drafted the ban on proprietary trading
included in the Dodd-Frank Act, are increasing pressure on
regulators to tighten the so-called Volcker rule, which they say
has a JPMorgan loophole. </p>
<p>Last fall''s proposed rule ignored the clear legislative
language and clear statement of congressional intent and allowed
for so-called portfolio hedging,'' the lawmakers wrote in a
letter yesterday to the five federal regulators drafting the
rule. Now, in recent days, we''ve seen exactly what portfolio
hedging'' might mean. </p>
<p>Dimon, who disclosed the loss May 10, told shareholders
there was no justification for the egregious mistakes by the
biggest and most profitable U.S. bank. In two lawsuits filed
this week in Manhattan federal court, shareholders sued the bank
and Dimon over the loss. He agreed yesterday to testify before
the Senate Banking Committee as it concludes hearings on
regulatory changes in June. </p>
<h2>Way America Works'' </h2>
<p>Days after the bank''s loss was disclosed, Romney weighed
in. The former Massachusetts governor said business losses are
part of the way America works and urged caution in adopting
new rules in response. </p>
<p>I would not rush to pass new legislation or new
regulation, Romney said. </p>
<p>The matter puts Republicans in the position of deciding
whether to take action that will affect an industry that is a
top donor to the party. Congressional Republicans are
campaigning, with the election less than six months away, to
keep control of the House and win a majority in the Senate now
governed by Democrats, 53-47. </p>
<p>Campaign contributions from the banking industry were
almost evenly split in the 2008 presidential election year, when
Republicans reaped 54 percent of industry donations, according
to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington
group that tracks the influence of money on politics. That
improved for Republicans in 2010 as they sought to win control
of the U.S. House. In the 2010 election cycle, commercial banks
donated $9 million to federal candidates, 61 percent of which
went to Republicans. </p>
<h2>PAC Contributions </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s political action committees donated $829,000 to
candidates, parties and political action committees between Jan.
1, 2011, and March 31, 2012, up from $459,000 in that period two
years earlier, Federal Election Commission records show.
Republican candidates have received 57 percent of the company''s
donations in this election cycle, compared with 43 percent for
Democrats. </p>
<p>Since the announcement of the loss, Republican lawmakers
have moved in different directions, with most calling for a
closer examination of what happened before tightening rules. </p>
<p>You have to get all the facts on the table, said
Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican. We''ve passed a
plethora of laws and regulations. I think we let it settle out
before we overreact. </p>
<p>Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, said he
favors hearings to make sure there is not a culture and
attitude that is threatening the stability of the entire
system. </p>
<h2>Tougher Capital Standards </h2>
<p>Meanwhile, a few congressional Republicans, including
Shelby, are making the case that tougher capital standards are
needed beyond what is in the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul. </p>
<p>I would certainly be in favor of starting to raise
capital requirements to make sure banks are secure, said
Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican. Then the taxpayer
won''t have to back it up. </p>
<p>He said that doesn''t mean the government should break up
big banks. If the markets determine that''s the best way to go,
that''s fine, Johnson said. </p>
<p>Others are urging the government not to get involved,
particularly because JPMorgan''s solvency isn''t in question. </p>
<p>Nobody has said that what happened created any kind of a
risk that bank couldn''t handle, said Senator Saxby Chambliss,
a Georgia Republican, who said regulators can handle the matter
with the tools they have. The CEO had to respond to
shareholders. There was no tax money at risk. </p>
<h2>Brown''s Letter </h2>
<p>One Republican seeking re-election this fall has struck out
on his own path. Senator Scott Brown, a Massachusetts
Republican, sent a letter to Dimon this week, telling him he
should impose financial penalties on employees responsible
for the trading loss. </p>
<p>It has been very frustrating to watch the continuing
volatility in our financial markets, and this $2 billion loss,
while painful, provides a good opportunity for JPMorgan to prove
that compensation practices have truly changed since the 2008
financial crisis, Brown wrote to Dimon in a letter dated
yesterday. </p>
<p>Brown, one of three Senate Republicans who voted in favor
of the 2010 financial regulatory law, is seeking re-election in
a close race against the presumed Democratic nominee, Elizabeth Warren, who advised President Barack Obama in setting up the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. </p>
<h2>''Big Financial Scandal'' </h2>
<p>The differing responses among Republicans suggests that
there may not be enough votes in Congress to make any big
changes to the regulatory overhaul. Jaret Seiberg, a senior
policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities'' Washington Research
Group, said it may take one more big financial scandal to
galvanize Republicans around the notion of breaking up big
banks. </p>
<p>When push comes to shove, the risk here is that you give
momentum to the break-up-the-bank faction, he said. </p>
<p>Cole said Republicans were slow to discuss the JPMorgan
trading losses because we''re obviously not for Dodd-Frank;
most of us voted against it. </p>
<p>Still, he said, people in both parties have been cautious
about commenting, in part, nobody knows if there is another shoe
to drop out there. It caught people by surprise. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s loss from
derivatives trading may widen to $5 billion, the Wall Street
Journal reported. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon personally approved the
strategy that led to the trades, without monitoring how they
were executed, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with
the matter that it didn''t identify. His failure to closely
regulate that activity caused resentment among executives whose
departments face tighter oversight, according to the Journal. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last week announced a $2 billion trading loss on
synthetic credit products, or derivatives tied to credit
performance. Dimon said the transactions, intended to manage
risk, were egregious failures by the bank''s chief investment
office. JPMorgan has said the amount could increase by $1
billion or more as it winds down the positions. </p>
<p>Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the $5 billion estimate. </p>
<p>JPMorgan fell 0.5 percent to $33.77 by 10 a.m. in German
trading, after closing at $33.93 in New York yesterday, down 4.3
percent. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. lender by assets didn''t have a treasurer
during the five months when the trades took place, the Journal
reported in a separate article. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s chief investment office oversees about $360
billion, or the difference between deposits and what the bank
lends. Matt Zames, who was appointed to lead the division after
the loss was reported, shook up leadership and announced a
renewed focus on hedging risks. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Overhaul </h2>
<p>The loss has prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
to examine how banks in its district are managing cash after
receiving a flood of deposits since the credit crisis, according
to a person familiar with the matter. Dimon, 56, has agreed to
testify before a Senate committee that''s debating whether to
tighten rules on trading by U.S. lenders. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and regulators face pressure to explain the loss
as lawmakers haggle over rules for the Dodd-Frank regulatory
overhaul enacted two years ago. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in New York have begun a criminal probe of the
trading loss, a person familiar with the matter has said. The
inquiry is in its most preliminary stage, the person said. </p>
<p>The company was trying to reposition a portfolio of
corporate credit derivatives and used a trading strategy that
was flawed, complex, poorly conceived, poorly vetted and
poorly executed, Dimon told shareholders this week at the
bank''s annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. </p>

<p>Generali Deutschland Holding AG (GE1) plans
to increase lending to companies to diversify its investments,
Boersen-Zeitung reported, citing an interview with the insurer''s
Chief Financial Officer Torsten Utecht. </p>
<p>We''re expanding our credit exposure, hence loans to
medium-sized companies would be of interest for us for
diversification, Utecht was quoted by Boersen-Zeitung as
saying. While the company still lacks the know-how to compete
with banks, it plans to invest to build expertise, he said, the
newspaper reported. </p>
<p>Generali is generating yields of 3.5 percent to 4 percent
on new investments, Utecht said, according to Boersen-Zeitung.
The company isn''t currently buying German government bonds and
the share of sovereign debt in its portfolio is declining, he
added, the newspaper said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Managing Director Mike
Hennessy and his 40-foot ocean racing yacht Dragon were
scheduled to set out today from New York harbor bound for
Newport, Rhode Island, on the second leg of sailing''s Atlantic
Cup. </p>
<p>Hennessy, 45, said the course will take him and co-skipper
Chris Museler down the New Jersey shoreline before following the
coast of Long Island toward the finish 231 nautical miles (428
nautical kilometers) away. Hennessy stands in seventh place
after the regatta''s opening stretch from Charleston, South
Carolina, to New York City. </p>
<p>On the run down to Barnegat Bay, there''s not a ton of
tactics, Hennessy said during a tune-up sail off Manhattan''s
Battery Park. Then it''s play the gradient or play the sea
breeze up the coast. As you approach Block Island, you''ve got to
think about which side you want to go in. That''s all currents
and tides. </p>
<p>This year''s Atlantic Cup includes 15 vessels, the largest
fleet assembled in the U.S. for the Class 40, a boat designed in
France to make solo and shorthanded ocean racing accessible to
amateur sailors, said Merfyn Owen, who designed Dragon at his
U.K.-based Owen Clarke Design LLC. </p>
<p>The race along the coast of Long Island should allow the
two-person crews to build straight-line speed over long
distances, Owen said. </p>
<p>The term you end up using is easy miles,'' Owen said as
he steered Dragon downwind toward the skyscrapers of lower
Manhattan. They just tick on by. </p>
<p>Winning the regatta, in which Hennessy placed second last
year, also requires a good finish in a crewed inshore regatta
off Newport that ends May 27. </p>
<p>Hennessy''s looking forward to restarting the race and
getting to Newport with Museler, who won nine U.S. sailing
championship medals between 1998 and 2009. </p>
<p>Lunch Sunday would be a bit aggressive, he said.
Maybe dinner. Last year, we were docking at 11. </p>

<p>Irvin Goldman, who oversaw risks in
the JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit that suffered more than $2 billion
in trading losses, was fired by another Wall Street firm in 2007
for money-losing bets that prompted a regulatory sanction at the
firm, Cantor Fitzgerald LP, three people with direct knowledge
of the matter said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan appointed Goldman in February as the top risk
official in its chief investment office while the unit was
managing trades that later spiraled into what Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon called egregious, self-inflicted
mistakes. The bank knew when it picked Goldman that his earlier
work at Cantor led regulators to penalize that company,
according to a person briefed on the situation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s oversight of risk in its chief investment office
has become a focal point as U.S. authorities examine the
incident and lawmakers debate how to prevent banks from making
wagers that might endanger depositors. Goldman was given the
risk-oversight job after his brother-in-law, Barry Zubrow, 59,
stepped down in January as JPMorgan''s top risk official to
become head of corporate and regulatory affairs, according to a
person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>Less than a week after the loss became public, the bank
stripped Goldman of his duties, though he remains at the firm,
according to a person familiar with the situation. Chetan
Bhargiri was named to succeed him. </p>
<h2>No Admission </h2>
<p>The Cantor case culminated in 2010 when the enforcement arm
of NYSE Arca Inc. fined Cantor $250,000 after finding it failed
to supervise Goldman, 51, who was buying and selling the same
stocks in personal accounts that he traded in a proprietary
account at the New York-based brokerage. His stock investments,
one of which plunged in December of 2006, presented a conflict
of interest that could have affected his investment decisions,
NYSE Arca found, according to a settlement document on its
website. </p>
<p>Cantor settled the case without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. The NYSE document identified Goldman only by his
former title as CEO of debt capital markets at Cantor, and he
wasn''t directly accused by the watchdog of misconduct. People
with knowledge of his dismissal spoke on condition of anonymity
because the reasons for his departure were private. </p>
<p>Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on Goldman''s actions at Cantor or the bank''s decision to
put him in charge of risk management. Goldman didn''t respond to
messages seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Administrative Leave </h2>
<p>JPMorgan is investigating whether anyone at the firm sought
to hide trading risks, people familiar with the matter have
said. It hasn''t found that Goldman did anything improper, one
person said. </p>
<p>Goldman''s resume lists more than a decade of work in
trading and investments before he was appointed to be risk
chief. He spent 13 years at Credit Suisse First Boston and ran
sales and trading for interest-rate products, according to a
2003 statement on Cantor''s website. </p>
<p>That year, he joined Cantor as president of debt capital
markets and asset management as the firm sought to rebuild from
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, which
killed 658 of its 960 New York-based employees. </p>
<p>After leaving Cantor, he joined JPMorgan''s chief investment
office as a trader, according to two people. As the NYSE inquiry
at Cantor progressed, he went on administrative leave at
JPMorgan, one person said. His trading book was down around that
time and his departure helped result in a loss of about $10
million to $15 million, the person said. The Wall Street Journal
reported that loss yesterday on its website. </p>
<h2>London Trades </h2>
<p>Ina Drew, then head of JPMorgan''s chief investment office,
reenlisted Goldman to help with strategy at her unit after
Cantor settled the NYSE''s inquiry in 2010, according to two
people. He was head of risk strategy before his appointment in
February, when the company''s main risk officer, John Hogan,
named Goldman the unit''s head of risk, one of the people said.
While others at the bank knew about Goldman''s firing from
Cantor, Hogan wasn''t aware when he appointed him to the job, the
person said. </p>
<p>Drew retired four days after Dimon announced the CIO loss
on May 10. For years, Dimon had sought to transform the unit and
increase the size of its speculative bets, former employees have
said. The firm hired Achilles Macris, 50, in 2006 to oversee
trading in London and lead an expansion into corporate and
mortgage-debt investments with a mandate to generate profits,
three former employees have said. One London trader, Bruno Iksil, amassed positions so big he began driving price moves in
the $10 trillion market for derivatives linked to the financial
health of corporations, Bloomberg News reported on April 5. </p>
<h2>Criminal Investigation </h2>
<p>On April 13, Dimon called news about the London trades a
complete tempest in a teapot. As the positions fueled losses
in the following days, Hogan removed Goldman from much of his
duties, one of the people said. </p>
<p>The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in New York have begun a criminal probe of the
trading loss, a person familiar with the matter has said. The
Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the transactions
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted May 18 to
open an investigation, according to two people briefed on the
matter. The U.K. Financial Services Authority, which regulates
banks, is examining the role played by employees in London,
where the trading occurred, people familiar with the talks have
said. </p>
<p>NYSE investigators focused on Goldman''s trading in shares
of Forbes Medi-Tech Inc. and Immunicon Corp. In October 2005, he
bought Forbes Medi-Tech, a Vancouver-based biotech firm, for his
retirement account, a joint account with his wife and trust
accounts for his two children, according to Cantor''s settlement.
Goldman also started buying the shares for a Cantor proprietary
account in January 2006, accumulating more than 3.4 million by
March 2 of that year, the document shows. </p>
<h2>Dozens'' of Orders </h2>
<p>In December 2006 the biotech company announced
disappointing results for a clinical trial of its cholesterol-reducing drug, prompting the shares to drop. Goldman sold the
stake in the proprietary account over the next several days,
continuing to trade in personal accounts for another nine
months. </p>
<p>He accumulated more than 2 million shares of Immunicon, a
Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania-based maker of cancer diagnostic
tests, for Cantor in 2006, while buying as many as 367,000
shares for his personal account, according to the NYSE. On some
days, Goldman placed dozens of buy and sell orders, often
within minutes of each other, according to the settlement
document. Immunicon filed for bankruptcy protection in June
2008, agreeing to sell most of its assets to a unit of Johnson 
Johnson, the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based maker of health-care products. </p>
<p>The NYSE found that Cantor failed to monitor Goldman''s
personal bets. The firm''s own policies also barred traders from
making personal wagers on the same stocks they bought for
proprietary accounts, and it required them to hold their
personal investments for at least 10 days, the settlement shows. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) suspended its
daily stock repurchase program because the bank needs money
to meet international capital rules, not because of the size of 
trading losses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. </p>
<p>The quarterly dividend won''t change, Dimon said during an
investor conference today in Manhattan where analysts peppered
him with questions about how the New York-based firm''s chief
investment office racked up at least $2 billion in losses since
March. </p>
<p>JPMorgan agreed with regulators to increase capital levels
to what we think our Basel III target will be, Dimon said,
referring to international bank rules that require the largest
global financial companies to maintain higher capital levels.
While Dimon said he intends to restart buybacks, he won''t say
when. We want to box those things first, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is under
pressure from investors and regulators to explain how the chief
investment office, which is assigned to manage excess cash while
minimizing risk, made wrong-way bets on illiquid credit
derivatives, some of them so large that they distorted market
prices. While the loss may increase, the affair is an isolated
event and the ensuing investigations aren''t likely to find any
big surprises, Dimon said. </p>
<h2>Carried Away </h2>
<p>There''s no outcome that will be a disaster for this
company, Dimon said. I am not sitting here worried about the
ultimate loss on this thing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan dropped 2.9 percent to close at $32.51 in New
York, erasing the last of this year''s gains. The shares have
fallen 20 percent since the loss was disclosed on May 10 and are
trading below tangible book value, which is the estimated value
of the company if it had to be liquidated today. </p>
<p>It is likely JPMorgan was told to stop buying back stock
by its primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, said Ed Najarian, head of bank research at International Strategy 
Investment Group Inc., an independent research firm in New York.
Based on Dimon''s previous comments, this is a price where he
would like to be buying back the stock. </p>
<p>Dimon also told investors today that the CIO losses won''t
do any long-term damage to the company. If that''s true and
you''d like to buy back stock at this price, the only reason not
to is because regulators told you to stop, Najarian said in an
interview. </p>
<h2>Economic Animals'' </h2>
<p>The $350 billion portfolio managed by the CIO has a very
short duration and an average credit rating of AA designed to
very conservatively handle interest-rate risks, Dimon said.
The synthetic credit derivatives at the heart of the losses were
a part of the broader portfolio, he said. </p>
<p>Dimon wouldn''t elaborate on holdings that caused the losses
beyond the $2 billion already disclosed. The CIO has $7 billion
in unrealized gains that may be used to offset the damage, he
said. To book those profits, JPMorgan would have to sell those
assets and close out the positions. </p>
<p>It''s just not tax-efficient, Dimon said. Being
economic animals, we''re going to be very economic in how we
handle CIO. </p>

<p>Derivatives losses of at least $2
billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) show the need for extending
Dodd-Frank Act swap regulations to overseas trades, said Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading (RTSIX)
Commission. </p>
<p>We''ve had another stark reminder of how trades overseas
can quickly reverberate with losses coming back to the United
States, Gensler said today in a speech at a Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority conference in Washington. The bank here
in the U.S. is absorbing these losses on trades conducted at
JPMorgan in London, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and other U.S. banks
have said Dodd-Frank rules designed to bolster oversight of the
derivatives market will hurt their ability to compete with
foreign-based rivals if the rules are applied to overseas
offices. The debate over the reach of Dodd-Frank overseas is
among the most controversial elements of the 2010 financial-
overhaul. </p>
<p>I think it''s a reminder that when we go forward with the
cross-border application of Dodd-Frank, that we not accept some
of the industry''s comments that we exempt those from Dodd-Frank
reforms, Gensler said. In comments after his speech, Gensler
confirmed that the CFTC is investigating the credit derivatives
transactions that led to the JPMorgan loss. </p>
<h2>Foreign Competition </h2>
<p>Applying Dodd-Frank margin requirements to overseas swaps
would eviscerate our ability to serve clients overseas and
cede the global market to foreign competitors, JPMorgan
Associate General Counsel Don Thompson said at a House Financial
Services Committee hearing Feb. 8. The International Swaps and
Derivatives Association Inc. and Institute for International
Bankers backed House legislation seeking to limit the
international reach of Dodd-Frank. </p>
<p>The House Agriculture Committee last week delayed a
committee vote on the legislation, citing a need to take more
time to debate potential unintended consequences of the measure. </p>
<p>The CFTC will soon propose guidelines for when Dodd-Frank
rules apply to overseas transactions and swap dealers, Gensler
said. </p>
<p>In the midst of a default or a crisis, there is no
satisfactory way to really separate the risk of a bank and its
branches, Gensler said in the speech. Likewise, I believe
this must include transactions with overseas affiliates that are
guaranteed by a U.S. entity, as well as the overseas affiliates
operating as conduits for a U.S. entity''s swap activity. </p>
<h2>Extent of Guidelines </h2>
<p>Under the guidelines, Dodd-Frank clearing and collateral
rules may not apply to trades between overseas affiliates of
U.S. firms and foreign-based companies that don''t have a
guarantee from another U.S. company, Gensler said. </p>
<p>We''ve seen time and again that U.S. overseas branches,
overseas affiliates guaranteed by a U.S. entity, and overseas
affiliates acting as conduits for U.S. entities bring risk
crashing back onto U.S. shores, Gensler said. </p>
<p>Gensler said he has concerns about the so-called Volcker
rule''s restrictions on proprietary trading being undermined by
exemptions for hedging. </p>
<p>You wouldn''t want the permitted hedging to swallow up the
prohibition, Gensler told reporters. From my own experience,
the challenge when somebody uses a word like portfolio hedging''
is it can mutate and morph into many things beyond hedging
specific positions, and though the statute uses the word
aggregate, I take it to mean still something specific -- that
there is real positions there. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may face even
bigger losses on faulty bets in credit markets if Europe''s debt
crisis worsens, according to one of the hedge funds that took
the other side of the trades. </p>
<p>They''re not out of those positions, Michael Platt, co-
founder and chief executive officer of BlueCrest Capital
Management LLP, said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television''s Inside Track. If we end up with a catastrophe
in Europe in the short run, they''re probably not positions that
anyone would want to have. </p>
<p>BlueCrest, based in Geneva, manages $32 billion. Platt said
a credit fund run by his firm took a small position against
JPMorgan after finding anomalies in the pricing of certain
credit derivatives. BlueCrest would make money as the prices
corrected, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking to
stanch losses in its chief investment office as other hedge 
funds exploit its money-losing positions by trading in indexes 
tied to credit-default swaps. New York-based JPMorgan revealed 
a $2 billion loss on May 10, and CEO Jamie Dimon said it could 
increase by as much as $1 billion this quarter. </p>
<p>The bank''s positions were built by Bruno Iksil, a JPMorgan
trader nicknamed the London whale because his bets had
become so large, Bloomberg News reported on April 5. Traders on
the other side, known as counterparties, say the market has
since moved even further against JPMorgan. </p>
<h2>Hedges Questioned </h2>
<p>Platt said he doubted Dimon''s explanation that the trades
had spawned from hedges intended to protect the value of credit
assets such as corporate loans. </p>
<p>I don''t think they could be described in any way as a
hedge, he said. I think it''s a trading loss. They
deliberately put the positions on. The London whale, who has
subsequently been harpooned, put the positions on. </p>
<p>Platt said the crisis in Europe could worsen quickly if
Greece leaves the euro, a possibility now being discussed by
European politicians. </p>
<p>The order of events would be Greek exit, shock wave
across Europe, massive stress in banks, Spain turns into the
battleground for the euro, because of the stresses in their own
banking system, he said. Then we either get a very swift and
strong European solution or we get a hugely disorderly meltdown
in Europe. </p>
<p>Platt, 44, is a former trader for JPMorgan who founded
BlueCrest in 2000. He said the hedge fund took its positions
against the bank in the normal course of our business and
not looking to try and cause them any problem. </p>
<h2>Able to Exit </h2>
<p>Dimon, 56, has said JPMorgan is in no rush to unwind the
trades, even if adverse market moves produce bigger losses in
the short term. Platt said he agrees with that approach. </p>
<p>They would ultimately be able to exit this position, he
said. I would be looking, if I was in that position,
creatively at finding other avenues to reduce the value at risk
of the book. </p>
<p>At a conference organized by Deutsche Bank AG today Dimon
called the trading loss an isolated event and said JPMorgan is
making progress in efforts to limit fallout. The positions are
very volatile right now, though less so than previously, he
said, declining to answer a question on how big the loss may
get. </p>

<p>(Corrects name of investor in 12th paragraph.) </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
which last week doubled its money from a 2010 bet on Facebook
Inc. (FB), is ramping up investments in Web startups, underscoring
the allure of high-growth tech companies to financiers far from
Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs led a $52 million round of funding in
AnchorFree, the Mountain View, California-based maker of
Internet-surfing software said today in a statement. The bank is
also in talks to invest in Spotify Ltd. in a deal that would
value the London-based music-streaming service at up to $4
billion, a person familiar with the matter said last week. </p>
<p>Under Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman
Sachs increased the size of its trading and investing operations
before the financial crisis, helping to make it the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history. The company
has funded rising technology startups including Facebook,
LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD), Dropbox Inc., Gilt Groupe Inc., Uber
Technologies Inc., and ZocDoc Inc. In addition to providing
quick returns, relationships with these companies could help the
bank get mandates to handle their initial public offerings or
acquisitions, said Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist at
Benchmark Capital in Menlo Park, California. </p>
<p>They''re active in the private market and they certainly
would relish the opportunity to have a relationship with someone
who might become a banking client somewhere down the road via an
IPO or M  A, Gurley said in an interview, referring to
mergers and acquisitions. </p>
<h2>LinkedIn Investment </h2>
<p>Principal investing -- where Goldman Sachs uses its own
money, instead of clients'' capital, to buy stakes in companies
or real estate -- has been a significant source of profits for
the firm in the past. Investing and lending, the Goldman Sachs
segments that records gains and losses from such holdings,
produced 7 percent of the bank''s revenue last year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs raised $235 million selling its stake in
Facebook''s May 18 IPO at a valuation of more than twice the $50
billion level at which the firm made its December 2010
investment. Funds that Goldman Sachs manages for the firm''s
clients also raised $855 million in the IPO. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which bought 871,840 LinkedIn shares in June
2008, sold all of them in that company''s IPO, according to
LinkedIn''s IPO prospectus. The IPO was priced at $45, meaning
Goldman Sachs collected $39.2 million at the time of the offer.
The bank could have more than doubled its money if it had held
the shares, which closed on May 18 at $99.02. </p>
<h2>Lone Institutional Investor </h2>
<p>AnchorFree invited Goldman Sachs to be the only new
institutional investor in its recent funding after turning down
offers from several venture-capital firms, said David Gorodyansky, the company''s chief executive officer. The Goldman
Sachs representatives participating in the deal, who Gorodyansky
declined to name, behaved more like Silicon Valley investors
than bankers, he said. </p>
<p>They are investing the same way that any venture
capitalist would invest, Gorodyansky said. They are very
savvy product people. </p>
<p>Co-founded by Gorodyansky in 2005, AnchorFree provides a
so-called proxy service, which lets users connect to the
Internet via remote servers so that they can''t be tracked and so
residents of countries like China and Iran can skirt censors
enforced by governments. With the new cash, the company plans to
buy servers and hire engineers to help with its push into mobile
Web browsing, Gorodyansky said. </p>
<h2>Web Advertising </h2>
<p>AnchorFree, which previously raised $11 million from
Landmark Ventures and others, is profitable and makes money by
selling ads to Web surfers as well as premium versions of its
software with more capabilities, Gorodyansky said. Goldman Sachs
will get a seat on its board of directors as part of the funding
agreement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s potential investment in Spotify could help
the bank get access to a fast-growing business which expects to
exceed 6 billion kronor ($833 million) in revenue this year,
according to an interview its CEO Daniel Ek gave to Dagens
Industri. Spotify raised $100 million last year from venture
capital investors including DST Global, Accel Partners and
Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, achieving a valuation of about
$1 billion. </p>
<p>As with Facebook, Goldman Sachs''s investments in tech
startups may not ensure it a leading spot on any future deals.
Gorodyansky has not set plans for a public offering but said
that Goldman Sachs''s investment will not give it preference over
other banks should that opportunity arise. </p>
<p>We have got no obligations, Gorodyansky said. If we
wanted to do an IPO we could do with anyone. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs works with clients as their needs dictate,
which can mean providing advice or financing, whether debt or
equity, David Wells, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon may give investors a better explanation
of how the bank lost $2 billion on trading and whether the
dividend is safe when he appears at an investor conference later
today, according to Citigroup Inc. (C) analysts. </p>
<p>A lot of investors'' concerns have gotten to extreme
levels, wrote Citigroup''s Keith Horowitz in a note to clients.
Dimon''s presentation may include we would hope a very clear
statement that dividend is not at risk and that buybacks are
still expected in 2012. </p>
<p>Citigroup called New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, an absolute buy, saying that estimates on
the ultimate size of the trading loss are getting a bit
carried away. A dividend cut is very unlikely, Horowitz wrote. </p>
<p>Dimon is scheduled to speak at 9:30 a.m. New York time at a
conference sponsored by Deutsche Bank AG in lower Manhattan.
He''s under pressure from investors and regulators to explain how
the bank''s chief investment office, which is assigned to manage
excess cash while minimizing risk, wound up with a $2 billion
loss from trades in illiquid credit derivatives. </p>
<p>Dimon announced the loss May 10 and said it could expand in
coming weeks. He assailed the bank''s handling of trading in
credit derivatives as flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, has hired former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission enforcement chief William McLucas to help respond to
regulatory probes of the firm''s $2 billion trading loss. </p>
<p>The lender retained law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale 
Dorr LLP, where McLucas is a partner, shortly after the bank
disclosed the loss on May 10, said Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman
for New York-based JPMorgan. </p>
<p>The probes began after JPMorgan traders in London built up
positions in illiquid credit derivatives that were so large they
distorted market prices and eventually led to what Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called self-inflicted losses
that may grow. That spurred reviews by the SEC, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. </p>
<p>Our focus right now is on whether the company''s public
disclosure and financial reporting is accurate, SEC Chairman
Mary Schapiro said today in congressional testimony. The
agencies collectively, including the criminal authorities, are
working very hard to untangle what happened at the firm. </p>
<p>The SEC is reviewing the accuracy and timing of JPMorgan''s
disclosure of changes in how it calculates value-at-risk, or
VaR, which shows how much it could lose from trading most days,
Schapiro said. The bank changed its VaR model for the chief
investment office during the first quarter without telling
investors. The new model, which has since been scrapped, had cut
the risk estimation almost in half, Dimon told investors May 10. </p>
<h2>Disclosure of Changes </h2>
<p>When there are changes to the VaR model, those changes
have to be disclosed to the public, said Schapiro, 56. When
companies report large trading losses, we actually make them
back-test and provide us with full information about why their
estimates of losses were so far off, she said. </p>
<p>McLucas, 61, led the SEC''s enforcement division from 1989
to 1998 and represented board committees in the collapses of
Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. He didn''t reply to a phone call
and e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>The losses occurred in a portfolio of credit investments
overseen in London by JPMorgan''s chief investment office, which
manages risks. The company used a trading strategy that was
flawed, complex, poorly conceived, poorly vetted and poorly
executed, Dimon, 56, has said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s general counsel and most senior lawyer, Stephen Cutler, also previously served as the head of enforcement at the
SEC. Cutler, 50, worked with McLucas at WilmerHale from 2005 to
2007, before JPMorgan hired him. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by a
former employee seeking to represent participants in the bank''s
retirement plan who lost money on company stock the plan held
after the bank reported a $2 billion trading loss. </p>
<p>The complaint filed yesterday by Gregory Scrydloff in
Manhattan federal court accuses New York-based JPMorgan of
making misstatements about its financial health that allowed the
company''s stock to trade at inflated prices between April 13,
when the company reported earnings, and May 10, when Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon disclosed the trading loss. </p>
<p>Last week, an Arizona trust filed a securities-fraud
lawsuit seeking to represent all investors who lost money on the
stock as a result of alleged misstatements by the bank about its
losses. In another case filed last week, an individual investor
asked for damages on behalf of the company from Dimon, the
bank''s board and other executives. </p>
<p>The trading losses came on synthetic credit products, which
are derivatives tied to credit performance. In disclosing the
$2 billion loss on transactions he said were intended to manage
risk, Dimon cited egregious failures by the bank''s chief
investment office. </p>
<p>Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on the most recent lawsuit. </p>
<p>The employee case is Scrydloff v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 12-4027, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The earlier cases are Baker v. Dimon, 12-cv-03878,

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s biggest U.S.
competitors say their corporate investment offices avoid the use
of derivatives that led to the bank''s $2 billion loss and buy
fewer bonds exposed to credit risk. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo  Co.
say the offices don''t trade credit-default swaps on indexes
linked to the health of companies. JPMorgan is said to have
amassed positions in such indexes that were so large they drove
price moves in the $10 trillion market. </p>
<p>The loss has prompted shareholders to join regulators in
scrutinizing how banks use their investment offices to hedge
risks and manage deposits they aren''t using for loans.
JPMorgan''s competitors confine corporate-level trading mostly to
interest-rate and currency swaps -- the most common derivatives
-- and put a greater percentage of funds into U.S. government-
backed securities such as Treasury bonds. </p>
<p>Traditionally, banks use government bonds, because
they''re safer, said Ray Soifer, a former Brown Brothers
Harriman  Co. bank analyst who''s now chairman of Green Valley,
Arizona-based Soifer Consulting LLC, which advises banks and
investors on strategy and risk management. JPMorgan is going
down the credit spectrum from U.S. Treasuries, because they''re
reaching for yield. </p>
<h2>Seeking Returns </h2>
<p>The concentration of assets that carry the risk a borrower
might default reflects JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon''s push over the past five years to seek higher returns at
the New York-based bank''s chief investment office, as reported
by Bloomberg News April 13. Dimon said at an investment
conference yesterday that the bank has more of such assets than
competitors, while asserting it isn''t taking undue risks. </p>
<p>We have more credit exposure than other people, and we
think when we put that credit exposure on, it was actually very
good, said Dimon, 56. We bought some triple-A securities
that we think are as good as gold. </p>
<p>About half of the $381.7 billion in JPMorgan''s chief
investment office portfolio is in company bonds, asset-backed
securities and mortgage debt not backed by the U.S. government,
according to a March 31 filing. That compares with 7.7 percent
at the end of 2007. The amount, $188.1 billion, is more than the
holdings of such securities by its three biggest competitors
combined. It exceeds the total assets of Atlanta-based SunTrust
Banks Inc., the 10th-biggest U.S. lender. </p>
<p>Similar assets at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (WFC) represent
34 percent of a $230.3 billion portfolio. It''s 11 percent of New
York-based Citigroup''s $270.6 billion book, and 10 percent of
the $297.1 billion pool of securities at Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America. </p>
<h2>Fewer Treasury Bonds </h2>
<p>JPMorgan has about 30 percent of its holdings in U.S.
Treasuries and bonds issued or guaranteed by U.S. government-
backed agencies, according to its filings. That compares with 87
percent at Bank of America, 50 percent at Citigroup and 47
percent at Wells Fargo. </p>
<p>The payoff: JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, gets a yield
of 3.2 percent on its corporate bonds, compared with 1 percent
for Treasuries and debt issued by government-backed agencies. </p>
<p>The pressure to take bigger risks has increased as the
Federal Reserve keeps benchmark interest rates near zero,
shrinking the returns banks can get from keeping their money in
short-term U.S. government bonds. </p>
<h2>Credit-Heavy'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan is more credit-heavy than other banks, said
David Hendler, an analyst with CreditSights Inc. in New York.
It''s just another indication that they''re searching for yield
like other money managers. </p>
<p>Citigroup senior managers were getting so many questions
about corporate liquidity that Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach and Chief Risk Officer Brian Leach last week sent a
memo to staff outlining how the money is managed. Liquidity is
the term financial executives and regulators use to describe
cash or investments that can be easily sold and converted into
cash to meet redemption requests from depositors or pay off
short-term debts. </p>
<p>We are conservative in our mix of assets, Gerspach and
Leach wrote in the May 14 memo. There are clear risk limits
and parameters throughout the firm. </p>
<p>At issue is how banks manage their securities portfolios --
the investments they buy with funds left over when deposits
exceed the amount of loans. Putting the money into bonds is
supposed to bring higher yields than the bank could get from
parking the money at the Fed, currently paying 0.25 percent on
deposits. The four biggest U.S. banks manage a combined $1.2
trillion in these portfolios. </p>
<h2>Everyone Does It'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s holdings are overseen by the chief investment
office, where the flawed derivatives trades took place. The
former head of the unit, Ina Drew, reported directly to Dimon
until she resigned last week. </p>
<p>Think of this as a big fixed-income portfolio, Dimon
said yesterday. Almost every single bank, whether you call it
CIO or treasury, almost everyone does it. </p>
<p>Bank of America''s portfolio is run by Chief Investment
Officer Walter Muller, who reports to CFO Bruce Thompson.
Citigroup Treasurer Eric Aboaf manages his bank''s pool,
overseeing a chief investment office and deputy treasurers in
countries outside the U.S. At Wells Fargo, the function is split
between CFO Tim Sloan and John Shrewsberry, who runs the
investment banking and trading division. </p>
<h2>Macroeconomic Risk </h2>
<p>The differences between JPMorgan and its competitors extend
to the use of credit derivatives by corporate investment offices
to hedge macroeconomic risks in the company, such as the
possibility that more loans might sour as unemployment rises.
While all four banks buy and sell credit-default swaps, such
transactions typically are done in trading departments. </p>
<p>Dimon, on a May 10 conference call with analysts and
investors, said the bank''s losses stemmed from a strategy to
hedge the firm''s overall credit exposure, which is our largest
risk overall, in a stressed credit environment. He said the
bank now plans to scale back. </p>
<p>We are reducing that hedge, Dimon said. The portfolio
has proven to be riskier, more volatile and less effective as an
economic hedge than we thought. </p>
<p>While Citigroup''s corporate office tries to hedge some
credit risks, those trades are small and linked to consumers''
financial health, said Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for the bank. </p>
<p>Citi has a small amount of straightforward economic
hedges managed at the corporate center to mitigate our credit
exposure, principally relating to consumer loans, Bell said,
declining to provide a figure. </p>
<h2>Wells Fargo, BofA </h2>
<p>Wells Fargo also shuns such bets, Mary Eshet, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo does not have a CIO function that employs
large-scale macroeconomic credit-derivative hedges, she wrote. </p>
<p>Bank of America CEO Brian T. Moynihan said yesterday at the
investment conference that while his company sometimes uses
credit-default swaps tied to individual companies, it doesn''t
hedge against broader macroeconomic risk. </p>
<p>We don''t do the macro hedging from a corporate
perspective, he said. We obviously manage our interest-rate
risk every day. </p>
<p>That doesn''t make Bank of America, Wells Fargo or Citigroup
risk-free. </p>
<p>The scale of their transactions remains an important
issue, said Eric Hilt, an associate professor of economics at
Wellesley College in Massachusetts. A currency hedge could be
just as damaging and risky as a credit hedge if done on an
absurdly large scale. </p>
<p>Bank treasury departments are a sleepy little world,
and aggressive risk-taking should be left to the trading
division, said Thomas Obermaier, a former Citigroup risk officer
who''s now CEO of Regulatory DataCorp Inc., a consulting firm
based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. JPMorgan is a client and
owns a stake in the company, he said. </p>
<p>This was clearly a treasury department designed to
maximize profit as much as trying to manage the portfolio, and
they got burned, Obermaier said. They can eat a $3 billion
loss. But you shouldn''t eat a $3 billion loss from treasury
trading. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) increased bets
on credit derivatives on investment-grade debt eightfold in the
first quarter, the period when the bank says it built trading
positions that have produced at least $2 billion of losses. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had sold $83.6 billion more of the derivatives
than it bought as of March 31, according to a Federal Reserve
report dated May 17. That compares with a $10.7 billion
difference as of Dec. 31, according to an earlier report. The
reports don''t provide details on specific trades or bank units
that contributed to the positions. </p>
<p>The latest report provides a glimpse of New York-based
JPMorgan''s total derivatives-trading at the end of March, more
than a month before the bank disclosed the trading loss. Reuters
reported on the Fed data earlier today. </p>
<p>While the bank had a $101.3 billion position on derivatives
expiring more than five years from now, it had a negative $53.8
billion position on derivatives maturing within one year,
according to the latest Fed report. JPMorgan had a $35.1 billion
position in derivatives maturing between one and five years as
of March 31. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s plan to
introduce an exchange-traded fund linked to copper will
severely disrupt the market, a group of industrial copper
users told the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Funds backed by copper would leave less of the metal
available for manufacturers, creating shortages and driving up
prices, according to a letter filed to securities regulator by
Vandenberg  Feliu, a New York-based law firm representing a
major copper-merchant company and several copper fabricators. </p>
<p>ETFs trade like stocks, giving investors access to
commodities such as copper without taking physical delivery.
NYSE Arca Inc., the electronic platform of NYSE Euronext, filed
with the SEC to list and trade JPM XF Physical Copper Trust,
according to an April 2 document. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s offering initially calls for the removal from
the market of as much as 61,800 metric tons of copper, or the
withdrawal of more than 30 percent of the supplies available for
immediate delivery worldwide, the merchants group said in its
letter. </p>
<p>JPM''s offering will therefore result in a substantial
artificially-induced rise in near-term copper prices on the
London Metal Exchange, which will severely disrupt the world
market for the trading of such copper, the group said in the
letter, dated May 9. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and ETF Securities Ltd. said in
2010 they planned to start exchange-traded funds for industrial
metals. ETF Securities started the first exchange-traded
products backed by copper, nickel and tin in London in December
2010. </p>
<p>Copper holdings in ETF Securities'' exchange-traded product
were 3,426.83 metric tons as of May 23, compared with 225,700
tons in stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange.
Copper for delivery in three months fell 2.7 percent to $7,531 a
ton today, and has dropped 10 percent this month. </p>
<p>The Financial Times reported the copper group''s letter to
the SEC earlier. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $2 billion
trading loss shows regulators need to focus on ensuring banks
have enough capital relative to their risks, rather than trying
to ban proprietary trading, Sallie Krawcheck wrote in a
Financial Times op-ed article. </p>
<p>It''s often impossible to distinguish between proprietary
trading, services for clients and hedging, said Krawcheck,
former head of Bank of America Corp.''s wealth-management
division. Regulators should instead work to measure how much
risk banks have and on improving inadequate risk measurements,
in order to guarantee lenders have the right amount of capital,
she wrote. </p>
<p>Bank regulators shouldn''t allow any activities that are too
complex for their risk models or stress tests to assess,
Krawcheck said. They also need to complete new regulations on
credit-rating companies, which could then act as an unbiased
partner in assessing bank risk, she added. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and other underwriters along with
Facebook Inc. (FB) were sued by investors who claimed they were
misled in the purchase of the social network firm''s stock. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, who are seeking to proceed on behalf of a
class of Facebook investors, said the company and the banks
didn''t disclose lower revenue estimates before the share sale.
The members of the proposed class have lost more than $2.5
billion since the initial public offering last week, according
to a complaint filed today in Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>The true facts at the time of the IPO were that Facebook
was then experiencing a severe and pronounced reduction in
revenue growth, the plaintiffs said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Also sued were units of Bank of America Corp. and Barclays
Plc (BARC), as well as Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg
and Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman. </p>
<p>Facebook went public at $38 a share and plunged 19 percent
over two days. Facebook rose 3.2 percent, or $1, to $32 at 4:22
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq trading. </p>
<p>We believe the lawsuit is without merit, Andrew Noyes,
a spokesman for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook, said in
an e-mail. He said the company would fight the claims. </p>
<p>Pen Pendleton, Michael DuVally and Mark Lane, spokesmen for
New York-based Morgan Stanley, New York-based Goldman Sachs and
London-based Barclays, respectively, declined to comment on the
lawsuit. Representatives of New York-based JPMorgan and
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America didn''t
immediately return calls for comment. </p>
<h2>Revenue Growth </h2>
<p>The complaint states that Facebook''s revenue growth is
declining because its greatest expansion is coming from users of
mobile devices rather than personal computers. The company
hasn''t shown advertisements to people who log on through mobile
applications, according to the complaint. Facebook booked 85
percent of its revenue from advertising in 2011, according to
the complaint. </p>
<p>The banks named in the lawsuit reduced their estimates for
Facebook for the second quarter and full year of 2012 and didn''t
inform potential investors in presentations before the IPO,
according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The underwriters took down their earnings estimates
dramatically during the road show and only told a select group
of investors, Samuel Rudman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said
today in a phone interview. </p>
<h2>Difficult Time </h2>
<p>The plaintiffs may have a difficult time proving the case
if it''s based on the presentation made to potential investors,
according to a securities lawyer. </p>
<p>It''s going to depend on who knew what when, Jeremy
Garvey of Buchanan Ingersoll  Rooney in Pittsburgh said in a
phone interview. The real question is, based on the final
prospectus, were the statements complete and correct? Garvey
said. If they have enough cautionary language in the
prospectus, they do have a bit of a disclaimer. </p>
<p>A Facebook investor sued Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. yesterday in
the same court, saying the exchange badly mishandled trades
in Facebook stock, which resulted in delays and a failure to
complete customer orders. </p>
<p>That investor is also seeking class-action status for the
lawsuit on behalf of investors who lost money because their buy,
sell and cancellation orders weren''t properly processed. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said it
will review the first day of trading in Facebook shares. </p>
<p>The underwriter case is Brian Roffe Profit Sharing Plan v.
Facebook, 12-04081, and the Nasdaq case is Goldberg v. Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc., 12-cv-04054, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>MF Global Holdings Ltd. argued in a
December 2010 letter to regulators that futures brokers didn''t
need tighter restrictions on how they invest client funds. Ten
months later, as MF Global filed for bankruptcy, about $1.6
billion in customer accounts was missing. </p>
<p>Within weeks, U.S. derivatives regulators approved a
measure, dubbed the MF rule, designed to limit the kinds of
transactions firms could make using client funds. The rule had
been on the regulatory backburner as lobbyists sought to stall
or alter new curbs proposed after the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>Along with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s recent $2 billion loss,
MF Global''s case demonstrates that an army of Washington
lobbyists can sometimes succeed in rolling back or delaying U.S.
rules and regulations to the detriment of investors and
depositors, with rippling effects on the broader economy. Also,
their actions can backfire on the businesses that hired them in
the first place. </p>
<p>This is a classic example of how industry claims to know
better than the bothersome bureaucrats in Washington, said
Nancy Watzman, a consultant for the Sunlight Foundation, a
Washington-based group that advocates open government records. </p>
<p>The group documented nine meetings between MF Global
officials and staff from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission about the financial overhaul. The meetings focused on
such topics as money market mutual funds and provisions for
compiling information from various accounts, according to the
foundation. </p>
<h2>An Embarrassment'' </h2>
<p>The paper trail companies have left pleading their cases
becomes an embarrassment, Watzman said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s loss follows lobbying by its chief executive,
Jamie Dimon, to weaken the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul,
which he has referred to as Dodd Frankenstein. Dimon''s
criticism of regulatory efforts may come back to haunt him and
the firm as lawmakers in Washington are pointing to the $2
billion loss as evidence that tougher regulation is needed. </p>
<p>Both examples illustrate former Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker''s comment to reporters following a May 9 Senate
hearing that there''s no question that lobbying from banks
contributed to the complexity of the initial 298-page Dodd-Frank
proposal, including many rules that have been delayed. </p>
<p>I could give you stories all day about lobbyists making
things more complicated because they may do it for reasons they
want to disrupt the whole process, Volcker said at the time. </p>
<h2>Intent'' of Volcker Rule </h2>
<p>JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli declined to
comment, referring to Dimon''s March 30 annual letter to
shareholders in which he said he didn''t disagree with the
intent of the Volcker rule. At the same time, he was critical
of the financial regulatory overhaul. </p>
<p>As a result of Dodd-Frank, we now have multiple
regulatory agencies with overlapping rules and oversight
responsibilities, Dimon said in the letter. We now have
allowed regulation to become politicized, which we believe will
likely lead to some bad outcomes. </p>
<p>JPMorgan employs 12 lobbyists and spent $7.6 million on
lobbying in 2011, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics in Washington, which tracks spending on Lobbying. </p>
<p>Lobbying topics included patent reform and helping
refinance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-held mortgages, according
to the group. Commercial banks spent a combined $61.8 million in
that period, employing 456 lobbyists, compared with the steel
industry''s 107 lobbyists and the airline industry''s 198 paid
representatives. </p>
<h2>Secure, Profitable'' </h2>
<p>Jon S. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor and U.S.
senator, was MF Global''s chairman and chief executive officer.
Executive Vice President Laurie Ferber said in the Dec. 2, 2010,
letter to the U.S. derivatives regulator that it would be
unnecessary to block futures firms from investing funds from
customer segregated accounts. The letter said such restrictions
would eliminate a liquid, secure, profitable and necessary
category of investment. </p>
<p>Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, delayed the rule after a lobbying push by MF Global
and another firm, Newedge USA LLC, saying the agency needed more
time to assess the proposal. MF Global, the first Wall Street
firm to fail since the Dodd-Frank Act became law in July 2010,
filed for bankruptcy protection Oct. 31 after making wrong-way
bets on European sovereign debt. </p>
<h2>Time of Stress'' </h2>
<p>Corzine, who resigned on Nov. 4, later gave testimony that
endorsed Gensler''s assessment that the new rule would help
protect client funds held by futures firms. At a time of
stress, his arguments may be much stronger, Corzine said Dec.
8 before the House Agriculture Committee. </p>
<p>Corzine said he was more in support of the CFTC''s
recommendations for tighter controls. He said he thought they
should be modified a bit. </p>
<p>Diana DeSocio, an MF Global spokeswoman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>It was hardly the first time high-powered Washington
lobbyists, who often are former lawmakers or government
officials, succeeded in forestalling rules and regulations or
helped broker a policy that backfired on their clients. </p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,
the industry''s lobbying group, supported President Barack Obama''s health care proposal after the group''s then-Chief
Executive Billy Tauzin negotiated agreements with the White
House. The group agreed to $80 billion in discounts and rebates
while some provisions it opposed were dropped from the
legislation. </p>
<h2>Drug Imports </h2>
<p>PhRMA also sought for the administration to block the
importation of less expensive drugs because of safety concerns.
They and everybody else was hoping that by being cooperative
they could negotiate certain specifics that would be a little
more beneficial to them, said Joseph Antos, a health care and
retirement fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a
Washington group that favors free enterprise and smaller
government. </p>
<p>Since then John Castellani, PhRMA''s current chief
executive, has said Obama''s proposals cutting billions of
dollars from Medicare and Medicaid spending on drugs would hurt
his groups. Taking more money from drug companies would result
in lost jobs and fewer cures, Castellani said. </p>
<p>I see our critics and their one-dimensional focus on
costs, and I say: How dare they?'' he said in a speech at the
group''s annual meeting last month. </p>
<h2>Medicare Part D </h2>
<p>Matt Bennett, a spokesman for PhRMA, said the group
discourages any cuts to Medicare Part D, the drug program for
senior citizens. This does not appear to be the right place to
cut, he said. </p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry group has continued to lobby on
the issue, spending $240 million in 2011 and registering more
than 1,500 lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics. </p>
<p>Another illustration of U.S. companies complaining of
Washington regulation is the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Obama administration''s efforts to promote clean air
policies. </p>
<p>Lobbyists for coal producers such as Arch Coal Inc. and
Southern Co. opposed a measure in the U.S. House of
Representatives in 2009 that would have capped greenhouse gases
from power plants and provided credits that could be traded. The
measure also would have provided government investments in
technology to capture carbon dioxide from power plants. </p>
<h2>Coal-Fired Plants </h2>
<p>Following the legislation''s failure, the EPA is now moving
to regulate power plant emissions in a way that may preclude the
construction of new coal-fired power plants, without providing
the credits or government investments. The EPA pointed to its
statement in March that the standard was a common-sense step
that would minimize carbon pollution and ensure progress toward
cleaner and more modern power. </p>
<p>Officials at American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity,
a trade association representing the coal industry, didn''t
return messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>Because these coal interests got their wish, there is
little investment in this so-called clean coal'' technology,
said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate change at the Center
for American Progress in Washington. </p>
<p>Instead, utilities are switching from dirty coal to
cleaner-burning, cheaper natural gas, he said. Coal and
utility companies have no one to blame but themselves for
helping strangle legislation that would have invested in clean
coal.'' </p>
<h2>PAC Costs </h2>
<p>Examples of lobbying efforts gone awry go back decades and
aren''t limited to corporations, said Clyde Wilcox, a political
science professor at Georgetown University in Washington. </p>
<p>In 1971, with robust membership and plenty of cash to
invest, labor unions backed the Federal Election Campaign Act,
which allowed corporations and unions to pay the administrative
costs of political action committees. At the time, companies
were barred from making direct political donations and unions
were more active with PACs. </p>
<p>Unions assumed they would have the upper hand, Wilcox said.
Since then, their financial resources and membership have
dwindled and they''ve been outspent by companies, with pro-business PACs outnumbering union PACs by more than six-to-one,
Wilcox said. </p>
<p>Almost immediately, the Chamber of Commerce and National
Association of Manufacturers encouraged companies to organize
PACs, he said. Within two years, the unions regretted it. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, has hired former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission enforcement chief William McLucas to help respond to
regulatory probes of the firm''s $2 billion trading loss,
according to two people with knowledge of the assignment. </p>
<p>The lender''s May 10 announcement of the self-inflicted
loss spurred reviews by the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and
Federal Bureau of Investigation. JPMorgan has said the losses
may increase. Kristin Lemkau, a company spokeswoman, didn''t have
an immediate comment on the hiring. The people requested
anonymity because the appointment hasn''t been made public. </p>
<p>McLucas, 61, a Washington-based partner at law firm Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale  Dorr LLP, led the SEC''s enforcement
division from 1989 to 1998. He didn''t reply to a phone call and
e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>DTCC Plans Study on Faster Settlement for U.S. Securities </h2>
<p>The Depository Trust  Clearing Corp. is commissioning a
study on whether the U.S. securities industry should cut the
time it takes to process transactions, a shift that may reduce
risk and compel brokers and asset managers to spend more on
further updating their systems. </p>
<p>The New York-based company that handles and guarantees
trades in U.S. stocks, corporate bonds and municipal securities
hired the Boston Consulting Group Inc. to assess the costs and
benefits of settling trades in fewer than three days, the
current standard, Elena Staloff, a vice president at DTCC, said
in a phone interview. A shorter cycle would mean firms could
post less capital to the clearing fund run by DTCC subsidiary
National Securities Clearing Corp. to cover a defaulting
broker''s obligations and pay less to meet the organization''s
liquidity needs to handle a problem, she said. </p>
<p>A 2000 industry report about completing transactions in a
day said the one-time cost of moving to a so-called T+1
settlement would be $8 billion for the securities industry and
could be implemented within four years. The savings would be
$2.7 billion annually, the study found. </p>

<h2>More Executives Choosing to Fight the SEC in Post-Crisis Suits </h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, long known for
settling enforcement actions without having to prove its case in
court, is struggling to cope with a surge in the number of
executives and companies willing to go to trial to defend
themselves. </p>
<p>The SEC''s office in Washington is actively litigating about
90 cases, up more than 50 percent in the past year, Matthew
Martens, the SEC''s chief litigation counsel, said in an
interview. At the same time, Martens''s trial unit staff has
stayed relatively flat at about 36. Martens, who recently added
three more lawyers to his group and is looking to hire more,
said it''s critical that his unit present a credible threat. </p>
<p>The wave of litigation has two main sources: more complex
cases stemming from the 2008 financial crisis and a related
increase in lawsuits filed against individual executives. </p>
<p>The collapse of the housing market and resulting financial
turmoil involved complex securities for which there was little
legal precedent. In addition, the agency has brought more
financial crisis lawsuits against executives -- more than 50 so
far -- and individuals are often inclined to fight claims that
could damage or end their careers. </p>
<p>Prolonged courtroom battles could sap resources from the
SEC, which has said funding gaps have already diminished its
ability to regulate securities markets. </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Citigroup to Pay $3.5 Million Over Faulty Subprime RMBS Data </h2>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, agreed to pay
$3.5 million to resolve regulatory claims that it gave investors
inaccurate data for subprime mortgage-backed securities as the
housing market collapsed. </p>
<p>The bank posted incorrect information for three residential
mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, from January 2006 through
October 2007, and it remained on Citigroup''s website until this
month, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said
yesterday in a statement. The firm failed to correct the data
even after the errors were brought to its attention, said Finra,
the brokerage industry''s self-regulator. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit is dealing with
mounting costs from Citigroup''s conduct in the U.S. mortgage
market. The lender agreed to pay $158.3 million in February
after regulators alleged the firm had falsely declared some
loans fit for a federal insurance program. The bank must also
pay $2.2 billion as part of a $25 billion, 49-state settlement
between attorneys general and the biggest mortgage lenders,
after a nationwide probe into foreclosure practices. </p>
<p>RMBS issuers are required to disclose historical
performance data for securities similar to those they are
offering. That information is critical for investors to assess
whether future returns may be disrupted by mortgage holders
failing to make loan payments, Finra said in its statement. </p>
<p>The brokerage lacked procedures to verify the pricing of
the securities and didn''t sufficiently document steps taken to
assess whether the traders'' prices were reasonable, Finra said.
The unit also failed to keep proper records following margin
calls that prompted revisions in the prices, according to the
Washington-based regulator. </p>
<p>Citigroup settled the claims without admitting or denying
wrongdoing, Finra said. </p>
<p>We are pleased to put this matter behind us, Danielle
Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said
in a statement. </p>
<h2>Fidelity''s Stairs Gets Securities Dealing Ban in Hong Kong </h2>
<p>Former Fidelity Management  Research Co. portfolio manager
George Stairs was banned from dealing securities in Hong Kong
for two years for selling Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings
Ltd. (682) shares using inside information. </p>
<p>The Hong Kong Market Misconduct Tribunal, which announced
the ban today, didn''t penalize Stairs for the losses he avoided
because the insider trading was executed on behalf of his funds. </p>
<p>Stairs had argued that he didn''t agree to restrict himself
from trading in exchange for material non-public information,
and that he thought the information was already public
knowledge. </p>
<p>The three-member Hong Kong tribunal, led by High Court
Judge Michael Lunn, ruled on April 26 that Stairs received non-public information in June 2009 about a share placement and sold
down his Chaoda holdings before the placement was announced,
according to Hong Kong''s government. He netted HK$1.98 million
($255,000) for his funds by selling Chaoda shares ahead of the
announcement. No wrongdoing was found on the part of Fidelity
and the firm isn''t liable to any disgorgement orders from Hong
Kong authorities. </p>
<p>Vincent Loporchio, a Boston-based spokesman for Fidelity,
said on May 20 the company respectfully disagrees with the Hong
Kong tribunal''s conclusions regarding Stairs. </p>
<p>He did not knowingly trade on non-public price sensitive
information, Loporchio said in an e-mail at the time.
Fidelity conducted a thorough internal review of this matter
consistent with its strong protocols. </p>
<p>Stairs remains an employee and is no longer managing assets
on behalf of funds or clients, Loporchio said. </p>
<h2>Google Meets French Regulator on Review of Privacy Policy Change </h2>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) will meet with France''s data-protection
authority today to discuss an inquiry into whether revised
privacy policies for users of the world''s largest Web-search
provider violate European rules. </p>
<p>The National Commission for Computing and Civil Liberties,
known by its French acronym as CNIL, asked to discuss Google''s
responses to questions it sent in March covering topics from the
Android operating system to how information is collected with
cookies, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based agency said. </p>
<p>CNIL is acting on behalf of other European regulators who
sought the review after Google announced changes to its privacy
rules. The Mountain View, California-based company defied two
CNIL requests to halt changes while it determined whether
European standards were met. Google implemented it as planned on
March 1. </p>
<p>The change is an important part of our layered approach
to providing users with clear and comprehensive information
about how we use data, and it is supplemented by additional
privacy information to our users, Google said in an e-mailed
statement before today''s meeting. We are confident that our
privacy notices respect the requirements of European data
protection laws. </p>
<p>Google and CNIL declined to comment on what would be
discussed at today''s meeting or on possible outcomes. </p>

<h2>U.K. Regulator Takes Another Look at Swap Sales to SMEs, FT Says </h2>
<p>The U.K.''s Financial Service Authority is making a second
review of sales of interest-rate swaps to small and mid-size
businesses, after an earlier probe found few problems, the
Financial Times said, citing a letter published by FSA Chairman
Adair Turner. </p>
<p>After reviewing a small number of complaints from small
businesses about interest-rate swaps in 2010 and 2011, and
concluding that there were no widespread underlying
problems, the FSA is doing more now to examine how the
products are designed and sold, Turner said, according to the
newspaper. </p>
<p>The action follows a request from Parliament''s Treasury
Select Committee for further investigation, the FT said, citing
committee Chairman Andrew Tyrie. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Yahoo Executive, Fund Manager Plead Guilty to Insider Trading </h2>
<p>A former Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) executive and a former mutual fund
manager at a unit of Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP) pleaded guilty to
insider trading and resolved civil complaints by federal
securities regulators, the U.S. said. </p>
<p>Robert W. Kwok, Yahoo''s senior director of business
management, gave illegal tips to Reema D. Shah, a portfolio
manager at the Ameriprise unit, RiverSource Investments LLC,
about Yahoo''s quarterly earnings and potential transactions with
outside companies, Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for Manhattan,
said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Kwok, 36, of Danville, California, and Shah, 40, of Menlo
Park, California, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, according to the statement. Kwok''s sentencing
is scheduled for Sept. 18 and Shah''s is set for May 24, Bharara
said. </p>
<p>Neither Kwok nor Shah could be reached at their home phone
numbers for comment. Laura Birger, a lawyer representing Kwok,
and Ted Cassman, an attorney for Shah, didn''t immediately return
calls seeking comment on the pleas. </p>
<p>The cases are U.S. v. Shah and U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission v. Shah, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>SEC Sues Two Florida Men Over Claims They Fueled Rothstein Fraud </h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued two
Florida men over claims they fraudulently raised more than $157
million to fuel a Ponzi scheme that collapsed in October 2009. </p>
<p>George Levin and Frank Preve used money from 173 investors
to purchase phony legal settlements from Florida attorney Scott
Rothstein, who is serving a 50-year prison sentence for running
the fraud, the SEC said yesterday in a statement. Levin and
Preve misrepresented to investors that they had procedures in
place to protect the funds, the SEC said. </p>
<p>At least eight people have pleaded guilty to helping
Rothstein, who admitted in 2010 that he persuaded wealthy
investors to buy stakes in what he said were payouts from
settlements of sexual-harassment and workplace-discrimination
cases. The cases were fabricated, using forged documents and
fictitious plaintiffs and defendants, the SEC said. </p>
<p>In a joint statement, attorneys for Levin and Preve said
their clients were two of the biggest victims of Rothstein''s
fraud. </p>
<p>Mr. Levin and Mr. Preve have testified at length on
multiple occasions before the SEC and have provided many
thousands of pages of documents to the SEC to assist it in its
investigation, according to the statement. Their extensive
cooperation, and the detailed written submissions of counsel for
Mr. Levin and Mr. Preve, showed that Mr. Levin and Mr. Preve
were not involved in the Ponzi scheme and were deceived and
defrauded by Mr. Rothstein. </p>
<p>The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and
unspecified financial penalties. The agency''s investigation is
continuing, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Levin, 12-cv-21917, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
Florida (Miami). </p>
<p>Special Section: Facebook IPO </p>
<p>Facebook Investor Sues Nasdaq Over Mishandled'' Stock Offering </p>
<p>A Facebook Inc. (FB) investor said in a lawsuit that Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. (NDAQ) badly mishandled Facebook''s initial public
offering, delaying trading and failing to cancel orders when
requested by customers. </p>
<p>Phillip Goldberg, a Maryland investor, said in a complaint
filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court that he tried to both
order and cancel requests for Facebook shares through an online
Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) account the morning after the May 17 IPO.
He is seeking to represent a class of investors who lost money
because their buy, sell or cancellation orders for Facebook
stock weren''t properly processed, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Orders placed by investors seeking to purchase Facebook
shares during the first trading day often took hours to
execute, Goldberg said in the complaint. In the meantime,
the investors seeking to purchase those shares had no idea if
their trades had executed, and, accordingly, had no idea if they
owned Facebook shares at all. </p>
<p>Goldberg, who claims Nasdaq acted negligently, is seeking
unspecified damages. </p>
<p>Robert Madden, a spokesman for Nasdaq, didn''t return a call
yesterday seeking comment on the suit. Ashley Zandy, a
spokeswoman for Facebook, the world''s biggest social network,
declined to comment on the suit. </p>
<p>Also yesterday, Facebook settled a lawsuit in principle
over claims that it used information supplied by users to
advertise products without their consent. Terms of the agreement
weren''t disclosed in a filing in federal court in San Jose,
California. </p>
<p>Facebook was accused in the complaint of appropriating the
names, photographs and identities of users for advertising
endorsements as part of a misleading advertising scheme,

<h2>Finra Chief Says Morgan Stanley May Face Probe Over Facebook IPO </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) could face regulatory scrutiny over claims
that an analyst shared negative news about Facebook Inc. with
institutional investors before that firm''s initial public
offering last week, according to the head of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>If true, the allegations are a matter of regulatory
concern to the industry-funded brokerage watchdog and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, Finra Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Richard Ketchum said today in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Ketchum commented in response to a news report that an
analyst for Morgan Stanley, lead underwriter for the IPO,
lowered a Facebook revenue forecast after the social-networking
company said growth in mobile products could hurt its business.
Such a move could come under scrutiny from regulators if the
warning was only provided to institutional investors. </p>
<p>Finra''s chief didn''t say whether his Washington-based
agency is investigating Morgan Stanley. John Nester, a spokesman
for the SEC, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Facebook Tumble Means Morgan Stanley Gets Blame for Flop </h2>
<p>After one of the most anticipated initial public offerings
in history, Facebook Inc.''s 11 percent drop May 21 and further
decline yesterday prompted investors to fault everything from
Morgan Stanley''s role as lead underwriter, to the Nasdaq Stock
Market. </p>
<p>Taking the most heat is Morgan Stanley, said Michael
Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust in Boston. </p>
<p>For more, click here. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter, released a statement
defending its handling of the May 17 IPO after the Massachusetts
security division yesterday subpoenaed the investment bank over
its communications with clients. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the brokerage industry''s watchdog both
said they may review the offering, and a buyer of Facebook stock
sued Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. over glitches in opening-day trading. </p>
<p>The anticipation that preceded history''s biggest technology
IPO has been replaced by investor ire, including about whether
the offer was priced too high. </p>
<p>Facebook increased the number of shares being sold in the
IPO by 25 percent last week to 421.2 million and raised its
asking price to a range of $34 to $38 from $28 to $35. The
shares closed yesterday at $31 in the U.S. </p>

<h2>Nasdaq CEO Blames Software for Delayed Facebook IPO Trading </h2>
<p>Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., under scrutiny after shares of
Facebook Inc. were hit by delays and mishandled orders on its
first day, blamed poor design in the software it uses for
driving auctions in initial public offerings. </p>
<p>Computer systems used to establish the opening price were
overwhelmed by order cancellations and updates, Nasdaq Chief
Executive Officer Robert Greifeld, 54, said in a conference call
with reporters. Nasdaq''s systems fell into a loop that kept
the second-largest U.S. stock venue operator from opening the
shares on time following the $16 billion deal. </p>
<p>While the errors were resolved and Facebook completed its
offering, the day was another setback for equity exchanges
trying to erase the memory of the botched IPO in March by Bats
Global Markets Inc., another bourse owner. Nasdaq''s issues
contributed to disappointment among investors as Facebook''s
stock plunged as much as 14 percent May 21. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it will
review the trading. </p>
<p>There is a lot of reason to have confidence in our
markets and the integrity of how they operate, but there are
issues we need to look at specifically with regard to
Facebook, SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro told reporters in
Washington. </p>
<p>Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for Menlo Park, California-based
Facebook, declined to comment. </p>

derivatives market. </p>
<p>The types of derivative swaps said to have led to a loss of
at least $2 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. may be the first for
which the CFTC would require guarantees by clearinghouses under

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will next month hear
the result of its European Union court challenge over an 899
million-euro ($1.14 billion) penalty for failing to comply
with an antitrust decision. </p>
<p>The EU''s General Court will rule June 27 on Microsoft''s
appeal of fines for breaching an earlier order by overcharging
rivals for licenses they needed to connect products to Windows
computers, according to a filing on the court''s website today. </p>
<p>Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy to be penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The case is the last remnant of years of disputes with
the European Commission that resulted in fines totaling 1.68
billion euros. Microsoft agreed in 2009 to settle an antitrust
clash over Internet browsers in a bid to repair the company''s
uneasy relationship with the EU regulator. </p>
<p>The commission, the EU''s antitrust authority, imposed the
fine as a so-called periodic penalty payment on Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft for failing to comply with a 2004
antitrust order. Under the initial decision, Microsoft was
fined 497 million euros and ordered to provide data to
competitors to allow servers to connect to computers using its
Windows operating system. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software company told judges at an
appeal hearing last year that the 2008 fine was especially
unfair because the regulator failed to give it sufficient
guidance to avoid the fine. The court should annul the
unnecessary, unlawful and totally disproportionate penalty,
Jean-Francois Bellis, a Microsoft lawyer, told the court. </p>
<p>Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, today
declined to comment before the ruling. </p>
<p>The court''s ruling can be appealed to the EU''s highest
tribunal, the European Court of Justice. </p>
<p>The case is T-167/08, Microsoft v. European Commission. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s 2011
executive compensation plan, which awarded Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein $12.4 million, won approval from more
than 94 percent of shareholders. </p>
<p>The tally was announced by General Counsel Gregory K. Palm
at the company''s annual shareholder meeting today in Jersey
City, New Jersey. The New York-based company won more support in
the non-binding advisory vote than last year, when 73 percent of
shareholders approved the awards. </p>
<p>All 10 board members at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, were re-elected by a majority of
shareholders, Palm said. James A. Johnson, the former Fannie Mae (FNMA)
CEO who is the longest-serving director and the chairman of the
bank''s compensation committee, had been publicly opposed by
shareholder Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc. </p>
<p>Support for Johnson fell to 83.6 percent from 95.5 percent
last year, according to results published in a company filing
after the meeting. About 49 million votes were cast against
Johnson''s re-election, the most of any board member and four
times as many as were cast against Blankfein, who was reelected
with 96.2 percent of the vote, the results showed. </p>
<p>Shareholders rejected three proposals offered at the
meeting by investors, according to Palm. All three had been
opposed by the company''s board of directors. </p>
<h2>Executive''s Holdings </h2>
<p>One would have provided shareholders with so-called
cumulative voting, which permits investors to withhold votes
from certain director nominees in order to cast multiple ballots
for others. It received approval from 24 percent of voters. </p>
<p>Another that would have required the bank''s named executive
officers to retain at least 75 percent of their stock for at
least three years after leaving the firm was approved by 17
percent. </p>
<p>The third would have required the company to prepare an
annual report disclosing its direct and indirect lobbying
expenditures, and was approved by 7 percent of the voters. </p>
<p>Similar proposals failed at last year''s annual meeting,
with cumulative voting receiving 25.6 percent of the vote and a
proposal requiring stock retention winning 20.6 percent. </p>

<p>As Facebook Inc. (FB) and Morgan Stanley
executives gathered on a call May 17 to arrange terms for the
social-networking company''s initial public offering, they faced
a trade-off: set the IPO price low and give up enough money to
let investors profit from a day-one pop -- or push the price
high to help the company reap as much as possible from the sale. </p>
<p>On the conference call, joined by Morgan Stanley Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman and Facebook Chief Financial
Officer David Ebersman, the company and its lead bankers
discussed an IPO price range of $36 to $41 a share, people with
knowledge of the matter said. Ebersman''s aim was to maximize the
company''s IPO proceeds and to cap the first-day increase at 10
percent, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the talks were private. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
co-led the IPO, were also on the call, as were Michael Grimes,
global co-head of Morgan Stanley''s technology investment banking
group, and Dan Simkowitz, chairman of its global capital markets
group, the people said. Absent was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan bankers indicated that they had significant client
demand at a price above $38, one person said. The group quickly
reached consensus at $38 and discussions were not drawn out, the
people said. </p>

<p>Silver Lake Partners LP and Partners
Group AG hired Royal Bank of Canada (RY), JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co., and

Blue, a travel-related tax-refund services provider. </p>
<p>Silver Lake and Partners Group said today they agreed to
buy the Nyon, Switzerland-based company from Equistone Partners
Europe Ltd. for about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). </p>
<p>In this challenging environment we were very fortunate to

<p>The acquisition loans will account for 3.5 times Global

<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O''Neill said the U.S. housing market is in the
early stages of a recovery as affordability improves. </p>
<p>I''m in the camp that believes the U.S. housing market is
in the early days of turning, O''Neill said at the Society of
Business Economists'' annual conference in London today. I just
spent all of last week travelling around the U.S., I was on the
west coast, the east coast, and everywhere I went, I heard quite
lively anecdotes that this was the case. </p>
<p>Looking forward, U.S. house prices to personal incomes
are now actually below where they were at the start of the
1990s,'''' he said. So for people not trapped in the negative
equity problem, U.S. housing is cheap.'''' </p>
<p>O''Neill also added that the position of the U.S.
government''s finances is an enormous dilemma and November''s
presidential election will not provide a solution. </p>
<p>After being there last week, it''s not entirely clear to
me that this election coming up is going to solve any of that at
all, the economist said. The strength of conviction of the
Republicans and Democrats conceptually is so strong, I rather
suspect that, without a financial crisis, it''s not clear to me
that the U.S. is going to do anything about its fiscal position. </p>
<p>There are such fundamental philosophical differences
about the role of government spending and taxation which are not
easily solved,'''' he said. </p>

<p>(Corrects ending year of director''s tenure in penultimate
paragraph of story originally published May 25, 2012.) </p>
<p>The three directors who oversee risk
at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) include a museum head who sat on
American International Group Inc.''s governance committee in
2008, the grandson of a billionaire and the chief executive
officer of a company that makes flight controls and work boots. </p>
<p>What the risk committee of the biggest U.S. lender lacks,
and what the five next largest competitors have, are directors
who worked at a bank or as financial risk managers. The only
member with any Wall Street experience, James Crown, hasn''t been
employed in the industry for more than 25 years. </p>
<p>It seems hard to believe that this is good enough, said
Anat Admati, a professor of finance at Stanford University who
studies corporate governance. It''s a massive task to watch the
risk of JPMorgan. </p>
<p>The bank has been under siege since CEO Jamie Dimon said
May 10 that the firm''s chief investment office suffered a $2
billion loss trading credit derivatives. He later called it a
Risk 101 mistake. Shares of the New York-based company have
fallen about 18 percent since, and at least half a dozen

Securities and Exchange Commission, are investigating. </p>

<p>Lou Lebedin, a former Bear Stearns
Cos. executive who had become JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s global head
of prime brokerage, is being replaced in that role, according to
three people familiar with the situation. </p>
<p>Teresa Heitsenrether, 47, based in London, will take over
for Lebedin, 54, said two of the people, who declined to be
identified because the changes aren''t public. Heitsenrether, who
worked at JPMorgan before the New York-based bank bought Bear
Stearns, was named co-head of fixed-income prime brokerage in
2008 when Lebedin took charge of the equity side. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, had the sixth-biggest prime brokerage, according to a ranking by client assets
in Global Custodian magazine''s 2011 survey. The bank expanded its
prime brokerage in Europe last year and plans a similar move in
Asia this year, Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s
investment bank, said in a February presentation. </p>
<p>Prime brokerages provide financing and administrative
services such as lending, clearing trades and record-keeping that
help managers run their hedge funds. </p>
<p>The changes are taking place more than two months after
Sandie O''Connor was promoted to treasurer. O''Connor previously
oversaw prime brokerage, futures and options, over-the-counter
derivatives clearing and broker-dealer services. Two of those
units, prime brokerage and broker-dealer services, now report to
John Horner. </p>
<p>Lebedin was tapped to run JPMorgan''s equity prime brokerage
in 2008 when JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns, where he held the same
role. In March he was named sole head of global prime brokerage
when his co-head, London-based Andrea Angelone, was moved to run
the bank''s equity treasury business, the Wall Street Journal
reported on March 23. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a bank spokeswoman, declined to
comment, and Lebedin didn''t return a phone message. </p>

<p>The U.S. Senate Banking Committee
said JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
was invited to testify on June 7 about the New York-based
lender''s credit derivatives losses. </p>
<p>I expect Mr. Dimon to come prepared to provide the
committee a better understanding of this massive trading loss,
Senator Tim Johnson, the committee''s chairman and a South Dakota
Democrat, said in a statement today. Dimon, who runs the largest
bank in the U.S. by assets, indicated previously that he will
accept an invitation. </p>
<p>Jamie will of course be able to testify next month,
said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, without
specifying a date. We are working with the House and Senate to
determine a timeframe that will work for both chambers in June
and allow us to provide the most thorough testimony. </p>
<p>Dimon is under pressure to explain how bets on illiquid
credit derivatives led to at least $2 billion in losses at his
chief investment office, which is supposed to manage excess cash
while minimizing risk. The strategy was flawed, complex,
poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored,
according to Dimon, 56. </p>
<p>His testimony may influence lawmakers as they haggle over
rules for the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul enacted two years
ago. They''re debating along with regulators whether the new law
would have prohibited the errant trades and if the rules should
be tighter. Dimon has been campaigning for a looser
interpretation. </p>

<p>The JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) office that
lost $2 billion on flawed derivatives trades also owns stakes in
the publisher of Ebony, the magazine for black Americans led by
a former White House social secretary, and Technicolor SA, the
money-losing French maker of film technologies. </p>
<p>The Special Investments Group, part of JPMorgan''s chief
investment office, took the minority stake in Johnson Publishing
Co., according to a July press release from the Chicago-based
publisher. The size of the investment wasn''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Desiree Rogers, 52, was named chief executive officer of
the family-controlled firm in August 2010, six months after
leaving President Barack Obama''s White House. She stepped down
after criticism for her handling of a state dinner that was
crashed by a Virginia couple, Tareq and Michaele Salahi. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s losses sparked criticism of the New York-based
bank''s investment office for taking too much risk with the
company''s idle cash. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon on May
14 accepted the resignation of the office''s head, Ina Drew,
after wrong-way bets on credit derivatives. Dimon has said the
positions can''t be quickly unwound and that the losses may
expand at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender. </p>
<p>The bank also invested about $150 million last year in
LightSquared Inc., the failed wireless venture backed by hedge-fund manager Philip Falcone that filed for bankruptcy on May 14,
a person with knowledge of the matter said. Technicolor''s
unprofitable set-top box factor in Angers, France filed for
insolvency today. </p>
<h2>Family Enterprise </h2>
<p>Johnson Publishing is majority-owned by the family of
founder John Johnson, according to a video by his daughter,
company Chairman Linda Johnson Rice, which was posted on the
firm''s website when JPMorgan''s investment was announced. </p>
<p>Ebony is the No. 1 magazine focused on black Americans,
reaching almost 11 million readers, according to the monthly
magazine''s website. Circulation dropped 27 percent from 2007
through 2010 before rebounding 8 percent last year to 1.13
million, according to The Association of Magazine Media. Johnson
also owns Jet magazine and Fashion Fair Cosmetics. </p>
<p>Rogers, a longtime friend of the president and first lady
Michelle Obama, was White House social secretary from January
2009 through February 2010. She had been the Illinois lottery
director and later served as a natural-gas utility executive,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Getting the Picture </h2>
<p>JPMorgan plans to invest as much as 158 million euros ($197
million) in Paris-based Technicolor (TCH), according to an
announcement from the company on May 3 -- one week before Dimon
disclosed the derivatives-trading losses. Technicolor''s shares
tumbled 68 percent in the preceding year and have fallen another
19 percent since the announcement to 1.37 euros. The firm posted
losses for the past five years, according to a notice on the
company''s website, and its debt is rated as junk by Moody''s
Investors Service and Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>JPMorgan holds a 1 percent equity stake and could wind up
with as much as 30 percent, according to Technicolor. The funds
came from JPMorgan and its private-investment arm, One Equity
Partners, according to the Technicolor news release. The Special
Investments Group is one of the shareholders in a fund that
would provide the Technicolor capital injection, said Benedicte
Hautefort, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Norma Corio, a former JPMorgan treasurer and restructuring
head who now oversees the Special Investments Group, has been
nominated to become a director of the Technicolor board at a
shareholder meeting scheduled for June 20, according
Technicolor. Also listed among nominees is David Walsh, a
partner and managing director at One Equity. </p>
<p>Corio, 51, Walsh, 50, and Rogers at Johnson Publishing
didn''t immediately respond to requests for comment. The stakes
in Ebony and Technicolor were reported yesterday on the Wall
Street Journal''s website. </p>
<p>These activities are done out of the holding company, not
the bank, said Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman. They
are funded with company-issued debt and equity. </p>

default swaps on Wall Street banks than any other companies as
they seek insurance against the prospects for diminished revenue
amid tighter regulations, downgrades and Europe''s debt crisis. </p>
<p>Contracts tied to the debt of Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp.
were the most traded among companies last week, with a combined
gross notional amount of $7.45 billion, according to the latest
data from the Depository Trust  Clearing Corp., which runs a
central registry for the market. Swaps on New York-based Goldman
Sachs were the most active, up from 13th the previous week. </p>
<p>Calls for tighter regulation are intensifying as JPMorgan
grapples with $2 billion of losses on derivative bets and Morgan
Stanley faces an inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over Facebook Inc.''s initial public offering. Global
investment bank revenue will fall 24 percent in the second
quarter, JPMorgan (JPM) analysts wrote in a May 18 note. </p>
<p>People are worried about the regulatory scrutiny these
banks will face, said Peter Tchir, founder of New York-based
hedge fund TF Market Advisors. People now fully believe
regulators are in charge and will get to push things through,
and there''s a real risk they overregulate. </p>
<h2>Moody''s Review </h2>
<p>Swaps insuring an average $470 million of Goldman Sachs''s
debt were traded each day last week, double the past month''s
average of $230 million. They were the seventh most traded of
1,000 entities tracked by the DTCC, following Italy, France,
Brazil, Spain, Turkey and Portugal. </p>
<p>Contracts on JPMorgan were the second-most traded, up from
ninth and the eighth highest overall, followed by Russia and
Mexico. Morgan Stanley jumped three levels to third among
companies and Bank of America advanced to fourth from 19th. </p>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service is in the process of reviewing
its credit ratings for banks, and may downgrade 26 lenders,
according to a May 22 report from JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Moody''s remains the largest overhang for the sector,
strategist at the New York-based bank wrote in the report. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, United Technologies Corp. (UTX)
raised $9.8 billion in the largest U.S. corporate bond sale in
more than three years to help finance its $16.5 billion
acquisition of Goodrich Corp. (GR) Vanguard Group Inc., the world''s
biggest mutual-fund provider, closed its $16.9 billion High
Yield Corporate Fund (VWEHX) to most new investors. Cheniere Energy
Partners LP is seeking $2.05 billion of loans. </p>
<h2>Swap Spreads Fall </h2>
<p>The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, declined 0.4 basis point to 34.4 basis
points. The gauge, which has dropped from a four-month high of
39.13 on May 15, narrows when investors favor assets such as
corporate bonds and widens when they seek the perceived safety
of government securities. </p>
<p>The cost of protecting corporate debt from default in the
U.S. declined for a second day, with the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index of credit-default swaps, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, falling 1.03 basis point to a
mid-price of 117.24 basis points, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The index has dropped from a five-month high of
123.4 on May 18. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was unchanged at 175 basis points at
10:40 a.m. in London. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan declined 2 to 196,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show. </p>
<h2>United Technologies Bonds </h2>
<p>The indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves
and rise as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the buyer face
value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>Bonds of Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies
were the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate
securities by dealers, with 304 trades of $1 million or more,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>United Technologies bond sale was the largest in dollars
since March 2009, when Pfizer Inc. (PFE) sold $13.5 billion of bonds
in a five-part offering, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The maker of Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt  Whitney
engines, with investment-grade ratings from Moody''s Investors
Service and Standard  Poor''s, is seeking to lure bond buyers as
turmoil in Europe sends them to safer assets. While speculative-
grade bonds in the U.S. have declined 1.3 percent this month,
investment grade is unchanged, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<h2>Vanguard Funds </h2>
<p>In its previous sale in February 2010, the Hartford,
Connecticut-based company sold $2.25 billion of debt split
between 10- and 30-year maturities, Bloomberg-compiled data
show. </p>
<p>Vanguard restricted access to its fund after clients poured
$2 billion into it over the past six months. The fund, managed
by Boston-based Wellington Management Co. since 1978, remains
open to existing shareholders and some Vanguard clients, the
Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based company said yesterday in a
statement. The fund has gained 4.2 percent this year, trailing
61 percent of rivals, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>We are taking these proactive steps to preserve the
ability of the advisor to manage the fund effectively and
protect the interests of existing shareholders, William McNabb, Vanguard''s chief executive officer, said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Investors have poured money into funds that invest in
higher-yielding securities as the Federal Reserve has kept rates
near zero since December 2008. U.S. high-yield mutual funds
attracted $16.6 billion in deposits this year through April,
second-highest among all categories tracked by Morningstar Inc. </p>
<h2>Loan Prices Fall </h2>
<p>The SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index fell for a
second day by 0.05 cent to 92.79 cents on the dollar. The
measure, which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-
lien leveraged loans, has declined from 94.56 cents on May 14,
the highest since July 28. </p>
<p>Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody''s and lower than BBB- by SP. </p>
<p>Cheniere Energy''s debt is intended to help fund the
expansion of a liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana. The
energy company is seeking a 6.5 year $750 million term loan with
proceeds being used to finance the acquisition of the Creole
Trail Pipeline, said a person familiar with the transaction, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing and will
host a lender meeting May 29 at 2 p.m. in New York, said the
person. </p>
<h2>Volker Rule </h2>
<p>In emerging markets, relative yields fell 4 basis points to
404 basis points or 4.04 percentage points, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s EMBI Global index. The measure has
averaged 372.5 this year. </p>
<p>Banks are under pressure as Europe''s debt crisis causes
lenders to retrench and fire thousands. In the U.S., the so-
called Volcker rule, the provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act
named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, will set
limits on risk-taking by depositories with government backing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s losses, which Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called egregious, self-inflicted mistakes that he said
could increase by $1 billion, came at a key point in the almost
two-year-old debate over Wall Street regulation. The 2010 Dodd-
Frank Act, which includes a ban on proprietary trading by banks,
is being decided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<h2>Bank Revenue Falls </h2>
<p>Lessons will have to be learned and heads may have to
roll, said Georg Grodzki, who helps manage $515 billion as
head of credit research at Legal  General Investment Management
in London. I hope it stops there and regulators resist the
habitual urge to throw more regulation at banks. </p>
<p>While global investment bank revenue will fall 24 percent
this quarter, fixed income, currencies and commodities will be
the worst hit, dropping 32 percent from the previous quarter,
JPMorgan analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a May 18
note. </p>
<p>JPMorgan s announcement May 10 that the biggest U.S. bank
by assets had lost $2 billion on corporate credit indexes fueled
a surge in the cost of insuring debt across Wall Street. Default
swaps on the bank jumped as high as 154 basis points this week
from 90 in March. </p>
<p>Swaps on Goldman Sachs soared to a 5 1/2-month high of 348
basis points May 21 from 200 in March. Morgan Stanley climbed to
453 this week from 278 in March and Bank of America rose to 306
from 200 in March. Swaps on Citigroup Inc. rose as high as 271
this week, from 183 in March while Wells Fargo  Co. got as high
as 126 from 80 in March. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Requirements'' </h2>
<p>Their bonds have also suffered. The extra yield investors
demand to hold the debt of banks worldwide instead of benchmark
government securities increased 47 basis points to 294 basis
points as of March 23 from the low this year of 247 on March 21,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s Global Corporates,
Banking index. Investors in the bonds have lost 0.45 percent
this month, heading for the first monthly decline since
November. </p>
<p>The combination of deteriorating market conditions and
increased regulatory requirements and restrictions has
diminished longer-term profitability and growth prospects,
according to Tony Smith, a senior banking analyst at Moody''s
Analytics in New York. </p>
<p>Default swaps on Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley imply
credit ratings that are six levels lower than their actual
grades, according to Moody''s Analytics, while JPMorgan''s signal
the bank should be rated five levels lower. </p>
<p>Further deterioration in the perceived credit quality of
banks may spark the Federal Reserve to provide more assistance
to the financial system, according to TF''s Tchir. </p>
<h2>Wall Street Reputation </h2>
<p>With bank swaps rising I''ve got to believe the Fed is
watching that as much as any other economic data, Tchir said.
Their biggest fear is getting back to where people don''t trust
the banks and stop trading with each other. </p>
<p>The reputation of Wall Street banks took a hit as the IPO
of Facebook (FB) turned into a quagmire of blame as the company''s
shares tumbled. Buyers of the stock sued the company, Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. and the underwriters, claiming they were misled. The
SEC and the brokerage industry''s watchdog both said they may
review the offering, and the scrutiny prompted Morgan Stanley,
the lead underwriter, to defend its handling of the IPO in a
statement. </p>
<p>Bank risk is also rising as Europe''s sovereign debt crisis
deepens, with investors concerned that a Greek exit from the
euro area may trigger a banking crisis. Loan and currency losses
in the event of a euro breakup may reach $1.1 trillion across
German, French, U.K., U.S., Swedish, Swiss, Dutch, Austrian and
Belgian banking systems, analysts at Paris-based Societe
Generale SA estimated in a note last week. </p>
<p>The market is more correlated now than it was two to
three weeks ago, said Graham Neilson, who helps manage about
$20 billion as chief investment strategist at Cairn Capital Ltd.
in London. The losses have clearly impacted JPMorgan''s bottom
line and there''s stuff going on in Greece and Europe that
impacts everyone. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the
world''s biggest brokerage, told its financial advisers yesterday
that it will adjust prices on a few thousand client trades of
Facebook Inc. (FB), according to a person on the conference call. </p>
<p>The company also told brokers that limit orders to sell
shares for at least $43 each after the social network''s initial
public offering won''t be filled because of low volume at that
price range on May 18, said the person, who requested anonymity
because the call was private. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney told
brokers May 23 it was reviewing pricing and execution of orders,
according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Nasdaq Stock Market trade confirmations were delayed and
some orders may have been mishandled by the exchange. The IPO
was marred on the first trading day when Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.
was overwhelmed by order cancellations and updates that delayed
trading in Facebook shares. The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it will conduct a review. </p>
<p>Facebook''s underwriters had gains of about $100 million
through their work to stabilize the share price since the IPO, a
person familiar with the matter said May 23. Morgan Stanley (MS) will
use some of the gains to reimburse clients who lost money
because of glitches in trade execution, the person said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which is owned by Morgan
Stanley and Citigroup Inc. (C), had more than 17,000 advisers and
$1.74 trillion of client assets as of March 31. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, increased the capital of its China unit by 2.5
billion yuan ($394 million) to meet rising demand for financial
services in the world''s fastest-growing major economy. </p>
<p>The second infusion since the local subsidiary was
incorporated in 2007 will bring its capital to 6.5 billion yuan,
the New York-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.
The U.S. bank also received approval from the China Banking
Regulatory Commission to open a branch in Suzhou. </p>
<p>JPMorgan joins Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)
and DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) in adding to investments in China,
seeking a bigger share of the world''s third-biggest banking
market, where local currency loans have grown by an average 22
percent a year since 2008. Foreign banks may lend a maximum of
10 percent of their net capital to a single borrower, which
limited their participation in the three-year lending boom. </p>
<p>JPMorgan now sees a good opportunity to expand in China,
given that there''s a lot of demand for all kinds of financial
services, Victoria Mio, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at
Robeco Hong Kong Ltd., whose parent firm oversees about $222
billion in assets globally as of March 31, said by telephone.
There''s still growth in China, versus other parts of the world
where there''s contraction or slower growth. </p>
<h2>Third-Largest Market </h2>
<p>With 114 trillion yuan of assets at the end of last year,
China''s banking system is larger than the combined size of the
30 other emerging markets tracked by Fitch Ratings, and smaller
than only the U.S. and Japan. About 45 percent of the nation''s
55 trillion yuan of outstanding loans were doled out in the past
three years as the government spurred lending during the global
financial crisis to resuscitate the economy. </p>
<p>Foreign banks more than doubled their combined profit from
China to 16.7 billion yuan last year, according to the banking
regulator. JPMorgan''s China unit earned 297.3 million yuan in
2011, compared with 70.4 million yuan a year earlier, according
to its annual report. </p>
<p>ANZ Bank said this month it plans to invest $300 million in
its China unit. DBS, Southeast Asia''s largest bank, announced in
April it would inject 2.3 billion yuan into its Chinese
subsidiary, adding to a 4 billion-yuan initial investment five
years ago. </p>
<p>The additional capital will better position the bank in
the evolving regulatory environment and cement our commitment to
clients in China, Shao Zili, chairman and chief executive
officer of JPMorgan China, said in the statement. The capital
will be used to expand the bank''s branch network, develop
products, increase corporate lending and recruit employees. </p>
<h2>Ties Since 1911 </h2>
<p>The U.S. bank''s ties to China go back to 1911, when it led
a syndicate in managing a railway company''s $7.5 million bond
sale. In 1921, Equitable Eastern Banking Corp., one of
JPMorgan''s predecessor firms, opened a Shanghai branch,
according to the lender''s website. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Guangzhou, Chengdu and Harbin. The company also offers
investment banking services in China through a joint venture
with First Capital Securities Co. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) is considering using
solar energy to produce the steam needed to pump heavy crude
from an oilfield straddling Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. </p>
<p>Chevron may start a pilot solar plant at the end of 2013,
Hashim al-Rifaai, chairman and managing director of Kuwait Gulf
Oil Co., told reporters in Abu Dhabi today. Energy from the sun
would heat water to create steam, which would then be injected
underground to make the heavy oil liquid enough to flow, al-Rifaai said. </p>
<p>Solar power would be used in conjunction with burning
natural gas for the so-called steam-flood development at the
Wafra field in the Neutral Zone, which Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
share. Kuwait Gulf is responsible for managing Kuwait''s share,
while Chevron operates Saudi Arabia''s interest. </p>
<p>Chevron is assessing the use of solar energy as it seeks to
free up much-needed natural gas. Kuwait buys the fuel in liquid
form at international prices while Saudi Arabia burns crude in
its power stations because they don''t have sufficient local
supply of gas to generate electricity. </p>
<p>A final investment decision for steam injection in the
Wafra field will be made next year, with the aim of producing as
much as 600,000 barrels a day of heavy oil from 2017. Saudi
Arabia, the largest member in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, says it''s pumping more than 10 million
barrels of oil, the highest in more than three decades. Kuwait''s
output was 2.7 million barrels last month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Every barrel of oil would need about 5 barrels of steam,
according to Yasser Dib, regional vice president at BrightSource
Energy Inc. The solar-thermal technology company supplied the
plant, which Chevron has been using since October to extract
crude at its Coalinga field in southern California. The system
uses mirrors to focus sunlight on a boiler to produce steam. </p>
<p>The neutral zone is producing 220,000 barrels a day onshore
and 320,000 barrels offshore, al-Rifaai said. While the offshore
target is 350,000 barrels, onshore output is dropping.
Developing the heavy oil would help maintain total output and
the crude would be exported to Asia, upgraded or used in a
planned refinery in Kuwait, he said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shareholders again
rejected a proposal to split the chairman and chief executive
officer roles amid increasing investor scrutiny of board
accountability in the energy industry. </p>
<p>Sixty-five percent of votes opposed the separation, down
from 69 percent last year, according to a tally announced at the
company''s annual meeting in Dallas today. This was the 11th
consecutive year in which the shareholder resolution failed. Rex Tillerson has served in both roles for the Irving, Texas-based
company since January 2006. </p>
<p>About 41 percent of the companies in the Standard  Poor''s
500 Index have separate chairmen and CEOs, according to Ram
Trust Services, a Portland, Maine-based investment fund and lead
sponsor of today''s resolution. Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), the
second-largest U.S. natural-gas producer after Exxon, announced
May 1 that it will appoint an independent chairman and strip CEO
Aubrey McClendon of the job after revelations that he personally
borrowed money from the company''s financiers. </p>
<p>A combined CEO-chair role potentially establishes an
imperial CEO, lessening accountability, Ram said in its
written proposal. Chairing and overseeing the board is a time-
intensive responsibility, and a separate chair leaves the CEO
free to manage the company and build effective business
strategies. </p>
<h2>Tillerson''s Seat </h2>
<p>The proposal wouldn''t have forced Tillerson to surrender
the chairman''s seat. It would''ve directed the board to find a
new chairman when the next CEO is named. </p>
<p>Chesapeake is searching for a new chairman after starting
an internal probe of McClendon''s personal finances. The Oklahoma
City-based company''s annual shareholders'' meeting is scheduled
for June 8. </p>
<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil company, said
about 62 percent of votes cast at its annual meeting today were
against a shareholder proposal that called for an independent
chairman. About 64 percent of oil and gas producer Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC) shareholders rejected a proposal to make its
chairman an independent director at the company''s May 15 annual
meeting. </p>
<p>Exxon opposes splitting the roles on the grounds that
directors should judge who is most qualified to fulfill the
chairman and CEO roles. </p>
<p>The board retains authority to amend the bylaws to
separate the positions of chairman and CEO at any time,
according to an April 12 proxy statement. Exxon''s 11 board
members were re-elected to their positions today. One member
retired. </p>
<h2>Insular Corporate Culture'' </h2>
<p>The proposal was supported by the AFL-CIO, which represents
more than 12 million union workers, and activist investors
including the Needmore Fund and several descendants of John D.
Rockefeller, who founded Exxon''s predecessor companies in the
1880s. </p>
<p>Ram Trust held about 120,000 Exxon shares in the $168
million of equities it had under management as of March 31,
according to a filing with the Securities  Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Splitting the roles would break down Exxon''s very insular
corporate culture, said Tracey Rembert, senior manager of
investor engagement at Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group.
There really has to be an independent person leading the
board. </p>
<p>Other shareholder proposals, including a requirement that
Exxon report on its political contributions and a company policy

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) isn''t liable for the
breast-cancer death of a woman who died after taking menopause
drugs made by the company''s units, a Connecticut jury ruled. </p>
<p>Jurors in federal court in Bridgeport deliberated about
five hours over two days before finding Pfizer''s Wyeth unit
provided proper warnings about the health risks of its Prempro
hormone-replacement pill to Lynn Moss. The 62-year-old nurse
died in December 2006 after a protracted battle with breast
cancer, according to court filings. </p>
<p>This verdict affirms the fact that Wyeth acted
responsibly by communicating accurately the risks and benefits
of its hormone therapy medicines, Chris Loder, a Pfizer
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Moss, a Danbury, Connecticut, resident, took all three
drugs over a seven-year period starting in 1993 to treat her
menopause symptoms, according to court filings. She was
diagnosed with breast cancer in 1999. </p>
<h2>Evidentiary Rulings </h2>
<p>Lawyers for Moss''s family, who pressed on with her lawsuit
after her death, said in an e-mailed statement today that they
were disappointed with the jury''s verdict. </p>
<p>There is a great deal of evidence that was excluded from
this trial that we believe hampered the jury''s ability to
appropriately consider all of the issues, Neal Moskow, one of
the family''s attorneys, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now won 10 of 21
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The New York-based drugmaker got some of the verdicts
against it thrown out after trial or had the awards reduced. It
resolved some of the verdicts through settlements, while other
decisions are on appeal. Pfizer also has had cases thrown out
before trial and settled others. </p>
<p>Pfizer announced in May 2011 it had settled a third of the
pending Prempro cases and had set aside $772 million to help
resolve the claims. </p>
<h2>Winning Streak </h2>
<p>In his statement, Loder said the verdict in the Moss case
means Pfizer has now won eight of the last 10 cases that have
reached a final trial verdict. </p>
<p>The company''s win comes about a month after another
Connecticut jury ordered Pfizer to pay at least $4 million in
damages to a woman who developed breast cancer after taking
Prempro. </p>
<p>That jury, in federal court in New Haven, found Wyeth
liable for causing Margaret Fraser''s cancer and awarded
compensatory and punitive damages. A judge is considering how
much Pfizer should pay in punishment damages, according to court
dockets. </p>
<p>The Moss case is Lynn Gardner Moss and Kenneth P. Moss v.
Wyeth, 04-cv-1511, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut
(Bridgeport). </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE), with businesses
ranging from energy to health care to aviation, plans to open
its second China innovation center in Xi''An city to be closer to
customers in faster-growing regions. </p>
<p>The company intends to set up more centers in China after
opening the Xi''An facility in the central province of Shaanxi
this summer, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said at a
briefing today in Chengdu, western China. GE is working on two
to three more joint ventures in the country, according to
Immelt, who said it''s too early to provide details. </p>
<p>GE is carrying out projects as part of a $2 billion
commitment made in late 2010 for innovation and technology
partnerships over three years in China, where annual revenue
gains of 20 percent contrast with negative growth for the
company. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE today opened an $80
million center in Chengdu for researching products in areas
including health care, energy and transportation. </p>
<p>We expect to see steady and consistent growth in China
over a period of time, Immelt said at the briefing to open the
Chengdu center. Our revenue growth in China is 20 percent a
year, which is quite substantial. </p>
<p>GE recorded revenue declines for the three years through
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales from the
U.S., the largest revenue contributor, dropped 7.1 percent last
year, the data show. </p>
<p>The company is focusing on international markets and plans
to boost sales outside the U.S. to 65 percent of total
industrial revenue by 2020 from 59 percent now, GE said in a
presentation on its website March 7. </p>
<h2>China Products </h2>
<p>China, Australia and Peru are among the so-called growth
markets that GE projects will account for half its industrial
revenue by 2020, Vice Chairman John Rice said in March. </p>
<p>GE''s center in Chengdu will mainly focus on developing new
health-care products aimed at solving rural medical needs, while
the Xian center focuses more on lighting and coal, Immelt
said today. </p>
<p>At the Chengdu center, hospital simulation areas have been
set up where GE customers can try new products in recreated
maternity wards or intensive care units, and then suggest
modifications. GE researchers are working on medical devices
better suited for rural markets, including a handheld
ultrasound, and teleconference facilities allowing doctors in a
city hospital to diagnose patients sitting in a county-level
clinic. </p>
<p>China is trying to improve quality health-care for its
poorest citizens, including setting up community level health
clinics throughout its rural districts and training thousands of
general practitioners to staff them. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the

benefit from a long-term global shift to electronic payments. </p>
<p>Shares of Visa and MasterCard outperformed every company in
the Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index during the past year,
according to the BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING. Visa, based
in San Francisco, returned 1.59 percent after adjusting for
price swings in the 12 months ended last week, helped by a
volatility that was lower than that of two-thirds of the stocks

<p>The networks route payments and guarantee settlement, and
both have more than doubled revenue in the past six years amid a
consumer shift from cash to electronic payments that shows no

squeeze banks face from record-low rates, and they''re subject to
less regulatory scrutiny than lenders or insurers, insulating
their stocks from sharper price swings, analysts said. </p>
<p>They are very sophisticated toll collectors, said

profitable group that''s very capable of managing and controlling
their earnings power. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is so eager to have a
panoply of applications for the next version of its Windows
operating system that it has lined up design firms, recruited
interns and sent engineers on an around-the-world road show to
help developers get them built. </p>
<p>Unlike Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG), which run the world''s
largest app stores, Microsoft doesn''t have the luxury of waiting
for programmers to come knocking when they want to create
downloadable games, productivity tools or online magazines for
its computer software. </p>
<p>As Microsoft struggles to keep up with a technology
landscape that is moving beyond personal computers into a future
defined by mobile devices, the company is under pressure to gain
a toehold in tablets. Demand for these handheld machines is
driven by apps, which Gartner Inc. predicts will generate $58
billion in sales in 2014. </p>
<p>It''s going to be very important to have a lot of apps,
said Bill Predmore, president at Pop, a Seattle-based company
that designs and develops apps, including a Windows 8 app for
Major League Soccer. You''re competing with the iPad. You have
to have some compelling alternative to that. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which is working on a revamped version of its
flagship software -- Windows 8 -- today released an almost-
complete iteration called a Release Preview. The company also
said for the first time that it plans to have machines with the
operating system on store shelves by year-end holidays. </p>
<h2>From Scratch </h2>
<p>The machines that are most comparable to the iPad -- which
boasts more than 200,000 apps -- won''t be able to run older
Windows apps, forcing Microsoft to start from scratch. The
company is racing to fill the gap because consumers won''t clamor
for computers that lack an array of downloadable tools. </p>
<p>Windows 8 is the first Microsoft operating system for
computers that use chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology.
These chips are widely used in mobile devices, including the
iPad. Trouble is, Microsoft''s ARM-based devices will run only
apps designed specifically for Windows 8 -- and none of the
millions of programs already available for Intel-based machines. </p>
<p>Hence the app-building drive. For much of February, app
developers could come to Building 20 at Microsoft''s Redmond,
Washington campus and turn their app over to a Windows engineer
who tries it out and provides feedback. Now Microsoft has taken
that program on the road, visiting 87 cities, including New
York, Paris and Guangzhou, China. </p>
<p>Developers who are earlier in the process -- those with an
idea yet no app -- can attend a different program called an App
Acceleration Lab to get advice on shaping their product. </p>
<h2>Moonlighting Staff </h2>
<p>Another Microsoft-led effort has been in place since
September. The company has trained more than 80 design firms to
aid or build apps for developers who aren''t familiar with
Windows'' new design or design in general, said Catherine Brooker, a spokeswoman for Microsoft. </p>
<p>As with Windows Phone, Microsoft encouraged its own
employees to write apps by waiving so-called moonlighting
restrictions on workers, which keep staff from writing apps on
their own time. Unlike with Windows Phone, Microsoft is not
paying app developers to build for Windows 8. </p>
<p>The company is also running a 12-week paid internship
program called the Foundry at its New England Research and
Development Center, NERD for short. There, 22 college students
in the program will build Windows 8 apps while getting training,
product reviews and mentorship from Microsoft. </p>
<p>With traditional PCs, it wasn''t hard to convince developers
to build programs for Windows, the dominant operating system. </p>
<h2>Convincing Skeptics </h2>
<p>Microsoft''s tablet challenge is steeper. It must win over
app firms and developers that grew up building programs for
smartphones and tablets, where Microsoft has little and no
share, respectively. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s pitch: Unlike the old apps that don''t work with
some Windows 8 devices, the new ones will be available not only
to buyers of tablets, but also to the more than 300 million
buyers of Windows PCs. That won over SigFig, a maker of a
program that lets users track investments. </p>
<p>Some programmers remain unconvinced of the need to make
games, magazines or other online tools for a software maker more
than two years late to the tablet market. </p>
<p>Facebook Inc. (FB), the largest social network, has no plans to
make a Windows 8 app even though it makes apps for the iOS and
Android, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Flipboard, whose CEO is ex-Microsoft executive Mike McCue,
isn''t planning a Windows 8 version, said Marci McCue, head of
marketing at the Palo Alto, California-based company.
Flipboard''s app, which aggregates a user''s social-networking
feeds, has built apps for the iPad and tablets that run Android. </p>
<h2>Waiting Game </h2>
<p>Other big app makers, including Zynga Inc. (ZNGA), PopCap Games,
Twitter Inc., Pandora Media Inc. (P) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), declined
to comment on their plans for Windows 8. </p>
<p>Companies such as SigFig or graphic-design software maker
Corel Corp., make apps that work well on both tablets and PCs.
For them, writing for Windows 8 is a no-brainer. </p>
<p>Other developers of tablet-focused applications will wait
to see whether enough consumers purchase Windows tablets, said
Laurent Bugnion, a senior director for European operations at
IdentityMine, one of the agencies in Microsoft''s program that is
working on Windows 8 apps for clients that declined to name. </p>
<p>The Apple fanatics, who anyway won''t touch a PC with
chopsticks, they won''t be interested, he said. But the
pragmatic people will probably wait for a while and suddenly
when we see a few good devices come out they will start
developing. </p>
<h2>Digital Chocolate </h2>
<p>Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is another one of the companies working on
apps for Windows 8, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Some of the initial apps will be in the Windows store with the
advent of the Release Preview. </p>
<p>Mobile games maker Digital Chocolate Inc. also plans to
have games available for Windows 8 at launch, said Chief
Executive Officer Trip Hawkins, while declining to specify
further. Corel is working on several. </p>
<p>Before Pop started building its app for Major League
Soccer, the team and employees of the professional soccer
federation spent a day at Microsoft''s campus getting guidance
from the company, said Kaylynn Kelley, who oversees Pop''s work
with Microsoft. Pop had an engineer and a designer assigned to
handle questions, which included nighttime calls that went on
for two hours. The free app, which includes news, videos and
standings, will probably be available in the next few days. </p>
<h2>Microsoft''s Handholding'' </h2>
<p>SigFig, whose app is already in the Windows Marketplace,
received concierge-like service from Microsoft, said Patrick Cushing, the company''s product manager for mobile. For example,
Microsoft looked over SigFig''s code and showed ways to make use
of Windows 8 features they hadn''t thought of using. </p>
<p>Corel, which made its first program for Windows in 1984,
plans to have an app in the store in the next few days for
finding graphics and a Windows 8 Metro version of WinZip is
slated for availability when Windows 8 is released. Corel too
benefited from a lot of handholding from Microsoft, said
Patrick Nichols, a unit president at Corel. </p>
<p>Extra help isn''t just for big companies. Microsoft is also
assisting individual developers, such as 21-year-old music
student Grant Kot, who graduated from the Julliard School last
week. Kot had written a touch-controlled musical instrument
simulation called Grantophone for Windows Phone and Microsoft
wanted it for Windows 8. So a Microsoft developer who tries to
promote Windows met Kot in New York. He hooked him up with a
designer to advise him and got him a prototype Windows 8 tablet. </p>
<p>I was pretty surprised with the amount of attention I
got, said Kot, who plays cello. They''re putting in a lot of
effort. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which today unveiled
a near-final test version of its Windows 8 software, said its
goal is to have machines with the operating system on store
shelves in time for the year-end holiday season. </p>
<p>If all goes well, the Redmond, Washington-based company
will be able to put the finishing touches on the product in time
to meet a goal of holiday delivery for personal computers with
the software, Windows President Steven Sinofsky wrote in a blog
post on Microsoft''s website. </p>
<p>The updated Windows software will be the first to run on
chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)''s technology and the first
designed for touch-screen control. Both changes are aimed at
capturing a portion of the tablet market, which is dominated by
Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. Demand for tablets has been siphoning off
customers from Windows-based PCs and curbing Microsoft''s
influence among consumers. </p>
<p>Based on feedback from this latest test version, Microsoft
will move forward toward a milestone called release to
manufacturing, at which point computer makers will start putting
the software on their devices. Microsoft aims to enter that
final phase in about two months, Sinofsky said. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell less than 1 percent to $29.19 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 12 percent this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein will testify at the insider-
trading trial of the bank''s former director Rajat Gupta, a
prosecutor said. </p>
<p>With jurors briefly out of the courtroom today, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff
in Manhattan that prosecutors would call Blankfein as their
next-to-last witness before wrapping up about June 6. Brodsky
didn''t say what Blankfein would testify about. </p>
<p>Blankfein testified at last year''s trial of Galleon Group
LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, to whom Gupta is accused of
leaking inside information. Rajaratnam was convicted and
sentenced to 11 years in prison. Gupta denies wrongdoing. </p>
<p>At Rajaratnam''s trial, Blankfein said Gupta violated
Goldman Sachs''s confidentiality policies by allegedly telling
Rajaratnam about the firm''s earnings and strategic plans. </p>
<p>We don''t want information about our company to get
outside before the time is appropriate, Blankfein testified on
March 23, 2011. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on Blankfein as a witness in Gupta''s trial. </p>
<p>Defense attorney Gary Naftalis identified likely defense
witnesses, listing Gupta family members and Gupta''s personal
assistant. Naftalis also said he planned on reading deposition
testimony from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)''s reinsurance chief, Ajit Jain, a close friend of Gupta''s. Naftalis said he didn''t know
yet whether Gupta will testify on his own behalf. </p>
<h2>Berkshire Investment </h2>
<p>Gupta, who ran McKinsey  Co. from 1994 to 2003, is on
trial for leaking tips about Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble
Co. (PG), where he was also a director. One of the alleged tips
involved a Berkshire Hathaway investment in Goldman Sachs. Gupta
has pleaded not guilty. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam and Gupta are the biggest figures yet to be
caught up in a nationwide insider-trading probe. Gupta is
charged with conspiracy and securities fraud, which carries a
maximum 20-year prison sentence. </p>
<p>Earlier today, a government witness testified that Gupta
joined a Galleon executive on a marketing trip to the Middle
East and was named by Rajaratnam to be chairman of a Galleon
investment fund. </p>
<p>Ayad Alhadi, who was a Galleon marketing executive from
February 2008 to October 2009, told jurors about Gupta''s role in
helping Galleon recruit clients. Prosecutors offered the
evidence to highlight the business relationship between the two
men and to provide a motive for Gupta''s alleged leaks. </p>
<h2>Friend and Adviser'' </h2>
<p>He was going to be helping Galleon meet prospective
investors, Alhadi said of a two-day trip he and Gupta took to
the United Arab Emirates beginning on March 31, 2008. Before
that trip, Alhadi said he sent an e-mail to a banker in
Switzerland calling Gupta a friend and adviser to Galleon. </p>
<p>Alhadi also told jurors about a meeting in Rajaratnam''s
office on March 28, 2008, where the Galleon co-founder said
Gupta, who was present, would be the new chairman of Galleon
International and responsible for investments outside the U.S. </p>
<p>I think I congratulated him, Alhadi said. Gupta may not
have been officially named Galleon International chairman,
Alhadi said. </p>
<p>Alhadi testified that after the trip, one of the sovereign
wealth funds he and Gupta met with on their Middle East trip
agreed to invest $25 million in a Galleon fund and pledged to
invest another $50 million four days after meeting them again at
Galleon''s office in New York. Alhadi described this development
in an e-mail to his Galleon superiors as a startling
investment. </p>
<p>He testified that in September 2008, Gupta asked for the
contact details of potential investors the two had met in
the Middle East. </p>
<h2>$400 Million </h2>
<p>He said he was raising a telecommunications fund with the
current or former chairman of ATT, Alhadi testified. He
said ATT would invest $400 million in this billion-dollar fund
if Mr. Gupta could come up with the rest of the money. </p>
<p>Alhadi said he heard nothing more about the possible fund
after the conversation. </p>
<p>During cross-examination by one of Gupta''s defense lawyers,
Robin Wilcox, Alhadi testified that agents with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation appeared, unannounced, at his home at 6
a.m. on Aug. 3, 2011. He later met with prosecutors and agents
two more times, he testified. </p>
<p>Did you ever tell the government that for some investors,
having a meeting with Mr. Gupta was like having a meeting with a
rock star? Wilcox asked. </p>
<p>I don''t remember saying that, Alhadi answered. </p>
<h2>Kumar Testimony </h2>
<p>With Alhadi''s testimony, prosecutors are seeking to counter
a defense claim that Rajaratnam and Gupta had a falling out at
the time of the alleged leaks. Defense lawyers say Rajaratnam
lost $10 million that Gupta invested in a Galleon fund,
prompting Gupta to consider a lawsuit. </p>
<p>Ex-McKinsey director Anil Kumar may testify as early as
today, Brodsky told Rakoff. At Rajaratnam''s trial, part of
Kumar''s testimony focused on the relationship between Gupta and
Rajaratnam. Kumar has pleaded guilty to insider trading and is
testifying for prosecutors in a bid for leniency. </p>
<p>Among defense witnesses named by Naftalis were Rick Schutte, Galleon''s former U.S. president; Richard Feachem,
executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis  Malaria; and Gregory Orman, Gupta''s financial
adviser. Naftalis didn''t say what the witnesses would testify
about. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said the firm is limited by competitive pressures in
how much further it can cut compensation as its seeks to
increase returns. </p>
<p>There is enormous pressure out there, even in a market
environment like this, for the best people, Cohn said today at
a New York investor conference. There''s always a competitor or
in some cases a client willing to hire our good people. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs reduced compensation costs by 40 percent
since 2007, while its U.S. peers cut just 1 percent, according
to a presentation Cohn gave. Managing pay is one way to make up
for lower leverage as it seeks to improve returns on equity, the
firm said. Still, Cohn said the New York-based firm can''t risk
defections of its top performers. </p>
<p>Losing those good people will have a dramatic impact on
revenue, Cohn said. It''s not as simple as just paying people
less and increasing dividends. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, could
have increased the average ROE over the last 13 years by about 3
percentage points if it had applied its 39 percent compensation
ratio from the last three years to the period before the
financial crisis, according to the presentation. That would more
than offset the reduction in ROE resulting from a cap of 20
times leverage, the firm said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs set aside $4.4 billion for employee
compensation in the first quarter, enough to give each of its
32,400 employees $135,123. A year earlier, the company''s
$5.23 billion first-quarter compensation expense equaled
$147,825 for each of the 35,400 employees at the time. </p>
<p>The firm is reducing compensation costs in part by
increasing hiring in what it called high-value locations,
including Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore and Bangalore,
India. Those cities cost 40 percent to 75 percent less than New
York, London and Tokyo, Cohn said. More than a third of the
firm''s hires since 2011 have been in the lower-cost locations,
he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will eventually
divest holdings in LightSquared Inc., the bankrupt wireless
network, and Ebony magazine as new Chief Investment Officer
Matthew Zames unwinds the unit responsible for the investments. </p>
<p>Zames, who''s in charge of cleaning up the chief investment
office''s $2 billion trading loss, told employees yesterday he''s
moving the special investments group out of the division,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Zames wants
to narrow and refocus the CIO on safer holdings, according to
the person, who asked not to be identified because the changes
weren''t public. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s shares have dropped about 19 percent since the
New York-based company''s May 10 disclosure that a bet on credit
derivatives had gone awry, and that the loss could get bigger in
the weeks ahead. Zames was plucked from the investment bank four
days later to replace former CIO Ina Drew at JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. lender by assets. </p>
<p>The special investments unit, headed by Norma Corio, will
be placed under the company''s corporate umbrella, which includes
the CIO unit, other private-equity investments and corporate-
wide units such as human resources and treasury, the person
said. About 10 people who report to Corio will be shifted to the
corporate division. </p>
<p>Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment. The Financial Times reported the changes yesterday. </p>
<p>Holdings in the special investments group included Ebony
publisher Johnson Publishing Co. and a $150 million stake in
LightSquared, which filed for bankruptcy protection on May 14.
The unit also is one of the shareholders in a fund that agreed
to provide capital to Technicolor SA, the money-losing French
maker of film technologies where Corio is listed as a nominee
for the board of directors at a shareholder meeting scheduled
for June 20. </p>

<p>Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s

a Senate committee hearing on his bank''s $2 billion trading loss
and will be asked to appear at a similar House hearing. </p>
<p>Dimon plans to appear June 13 before the Senate Banking
Committee, led by Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat,
a committee spokesman said. He will also be asked to give
testimony on June 19 before the House Financial Services
Committee, a person familiar with the plans said. </p>
<p>Jamie Dimon has accepted Chairman Johnson''s request to
testify before the Senate Banking Committee, Sean Oblack, the
panel''s spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Dimon is under pressure from lawmakers and regulators to
explain the losses and the strategy behind them. In a May 10
conference call, Dimon called the credit derivatives trades
linked to the losses flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored. </p>
<p>Johnson decided to push back the initial date for the
Senate hearing from June 7 to accommodate the schedules of both
parties, Oblack said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s exchange-
traded note tied to energy companies organized as partnerships
rose to a record number of shares as investors look for higher
yields with interest rates reaching record lows. </p>
<p>Shares outstanding of the JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ)
climbed to 113 million on May 29. The security, the largest U.S.
ETN, has a market capitalization of $4.2 billion, which makes up
almost 24 percent of the entire ETN market. Master limited
partnerships, which trade publicly, typically invest in assets
ranging from pipelines to ships transporting commodities. </p>
<p>Demand for notes tied to MLPs has surged as new
technologies such as hydraulic fracturing increase oil and gas
production, said Ethan Bellamy, a Robert W. Baird  Co. equity
analyst. ETNs tied to MLPs also benefit because they are more
tax efficient than investing directly into the partnerships
since buyers may have to file separate tax returns in each state
a partnership does business, Bellamy said. </p>
<p>The real simple reason is yields are low everywhere else
and MLPS are still offering, depending on the product, 5 to 7
percent in distributions, which are like dividends, Bellamy
said in a telephone interview from his office in Denver. </p>
<p>That growth may continue since alternative securities that
track MLPs make up about 7 percent of the overall market
capitalization of the partnerships, Bellamy said. </p>
<p>You can easily see the assets under management in all
these alternative products double or triple from here. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan ETN tracks a gauge of 50 publicly traded
partnerships, which don''t pay federal income taxes and rely on
assets, such as pipelines, to generate cash flow for taxable
payouts to holders. The note matches dividends from the Alerian
MLP Index minus a 0.85 percent management fee, according to a
prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer''s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of ETNs based on the level of demand
for the securities. That demand typically doesn''t affect the
price since the ETNs track the performance of an index. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the majority owner of
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC, plans to buy an
additional 14 percent stake in the brokerage from Citigroup Inc. (C) </p>
<p>The price will be determined over a 90-day period,
according to a statement today from New York-based Morgan
Stanley. The investment bank already owns 51 percent of Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney, which is the world''s largest brokerage.
Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, sold the controlling
stake to Morgan Stanley in 2009. </p>
<p>Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit, 55, is
unloading unwanted assets in the Citi Holdings division to
buttress the bank''s balance sheet. Morgan Stanley has the right
to buy the entire brokerage, which has more than 17,000 advisers
and $1.74 trillion in client assets, over the next two years. </p>
<p>Several years ago, after taking a dispassionate look at
all of our businesses, we placed Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in
Citi Holdings because we decided it was not core to our
strategy, Jon Diat, a Citigroup spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. Citi has made enormous progress in reducing similar
non-core assets in an economically rational manner. </p>
<p>In addition to paying for the stake, Morgan Stanley must
pay New York-based Citigroup a premium for about $5.4 billion of
customer deposits that will be transferred as part of the sale,
according to a regulatory filing. </p>
<h2>Estimates Due </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Citigroup will submit their estimates of
the brokerage''s fair value within about 45 days from tomorrow.
If the figures are within 10 percent of each other, the stake
will be sold at the average of the two, according to a
regulatory filing. If the difference is more than 10 percent,
the firms would bring in an outside appraiser, who will submit
an estimate of fair value by the end of August. </p>
<p>Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, 58,
indicated last month that the bank may be willing to sell the
rest of its stake to Morgan Stanley this year. Morgan Stanley
CEO James Gorman said April 19 that he feels no particular
compulsion to speed up purchases of the remaining pieces. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his bets this year were
so large, has been a leviathan of a risk-taker since at least
2010, a person with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Iksil''s value-at-risk, a measure of how much a trader might
lose in one day, was typically $30 million to $40 million even
before this year''s buildup, said the person, who wasn''t
authorized to discuss the trades. Sometimes the figure, known as
VaR, could surpass $60 million, the person said. That''s about as
high as the level for the firm''s entire investment bank, which
employs 26,000 people. </p>
<p>Investigators are examining how long senior executives knew
about Iksil''s swelling bets at the chief investment office
before losses approached $2 billion. One focal point is why the
formula used to calculate Iksil''s VaR was altered early this
year, cutting the reported risk by half. The change followed an
internal analysis in late 2011 and was approved by top risk
executives, said a person close to the bank. About the same
time, half a dozen managers typically involved in such decisions
moved to new jobs. </p>
<p>If it was something that had that large an impact, it
would have to be agreed to at the very-most-senior level within
risk management, probably including the bank''s chief risk
officer, said Steve Allen, a former head of risk methodology for
JPMorgan who retired in 2004. You''re not going to make a
change of that magnitude on the basis of one risk manager. </p>
<h2>Unexplained Change </h2>
<p>JPMorgan hasn''t detailed how or why the New York-based
lender altered the VaR formula. The changes -- and the timing of
the firm''s disclosures about them -- are the focus of an inquiry
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Chairman Mary Schapiro told a congressional panel on May 22. Shares of the
bank, the biggest in the U.S., have tumbled 25 percent since
April 5, when Bloomberg News first reported on Iksil''s trades. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, has since
suspended the bank''s $15 billion share buyback program and
replaced executives who oversaw the errant trades. Dimon has
said the losses could grow and that it might take the rest of
the year to liquidate trades at the unit, which is charged with
managing the bank''s idle cash to earn a profit while minimizing
the company''s risk. </p>
<p>Iksil, who joined JPMorgan in 2005 according to U.K.
regulatory records, was given more leeway than many traders
because he produced outsized gains during previous years --
including more than $100 million in 2011, said a person close to
the bank. </p>
<h2>Whale Watching </h2>
<p>His bosses may not have understood the complexity of his
trades, said the person, who asked for anonymity because the
information hasn''t been released publicly. Executives and risk
managers in the chief investment office were aware of Iksil''s
positions because they met every Thursday morning to discuss the
unit''s trades, the person said. </p>
<p>Iksil was assigned to devise hedges and make trades to
counter the risk that a faltering economy might lead to a surge
in losses on corporate loans or bonds. By 2010, the VaR on his
trading book was about half of that for JPMorgan''s entire chief
investment office, which at the time also oversaw more than $300
billion of securities, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the CIO''s operations. </p>
<p>VaR represents the maximum JPMorgan traders would expect to
lose on 95 out of 100 trading days, according to quarterly
filings with regulators. It is calculated daily, and the average
for a quarter is reported in regulatory filings. </p>
<h2>Flawed Formulas </h2>
<p>While there''s no estimate of what the losses might be on
the worst days, a string of daily losses exceeding the VaR can
be a warning that the formulas are flawed or that markets have
turned unusually volatile. Dimon had encouraged the once-conservative CIO operation, run by Ina Drew, to boost profit by
buying higher-yielding assets such as structured credit,
equities and derivatives, Bloomberg News reported on April 13. </p>
<p>Banks and their traders have multiple computer models to
estimate potential swings in profits and losses. Value-at-risk
is among the most crucial because it''s reported to investors in
filings that are reviewed by the SEC. Any changes to the model''s
characteristics are supposed to be disclosed, Schapiro said. </p>
<p>The bank produces more than half a dozen VaR barometers for
different parts of the firm, and the chief investment office
gets one of its own. Toward the beginning of this year, the bank
changed the mathematical formulas used to calculate VaR for that
unit, Dimon said on May 10, without elaborating on the reasons. </p>
<h2>Quarterly Rise </h2>
<p>The new formula showed average VaR for the chief investment
office stood at $67 million, according to a regulatory filing on
April 13, the day JPMorgan reported first-quarter results. When
JPMorgan reverted to the old model, it showed the average VaR
was $129 million, and that the figure ballooned to $186 million
at the end of the period, a May filing showed. </p>
<p>We implemented a new VaR model, which we now deemed
inadequate, Dimon said. We went back to the old one, which
had been used for the prior several years, which we deemed to be
more adequate. </p>
<p>Iksil alone may have amassed a $100 billion position this
year in contracts on one credit-derivative index, counterparts
at hedge funds and rival banks said in April. The holdings
amounted to tens of billions of dollars under the firm''s own
math, a person familiar with JPMorgan''s view has said. </p>
<p>The VaR changes may have allowed or encouraged Iksil or
other traders in the chief investment office to take bigger
positions, said David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. </p>
<p>It''s possible that when the new model said, Hey, we can
put on more risk,'' they did, he said. And then when they
went back to the old model, they saw, Oh my God, our risk is
much higher than we thought.'' </p>
<h2>Internal Probe </h2>
<p>The bank is conducting its own probe into the CIO''s losses
and plans to report on the findings, said Kristin Lemkau, a bank
spokeswoman. Dimon is scheduled to testify June 13 before the
Senate Banking Committee, and will be asked to appear June 19 at
the House Financial Services Committee, a person familiar with
the plans has said. </p>
<p>Dimon didn''t mention Iksil by name on May 10, when the CEO
first disclosed the losses and the decision to revert to the old
version of VaR. There are constant changes and updates to
models, always trying to get them better than they were
before, Dimon said. </p>
<p>In practice, such updates typically occur no more than once
a year, said a former JPMorgan risk manager who asked not to be
identified to avoid alienating the bank. Lesley Daniels Webster,
a former head of market and fiduciary risk management at
JPMorgan, said that new models are usually tested in
parallel with old models for about three months to make sure
they''re working properly before being used. </p>
<h2>Signing Off </h2>
<p>There''s a formal approval process for the adoption of a
new model, said Daniels Webster, who retired in 2005 and runs
her own risk-management firm, Daniels Webster Capital Advisors,
based in Naples, Florida. Somebody has to sign off. </p>
<p>Allen, the other former JPMorgan risk manager, said that a
model change big enough to reduce the VaR by half probably would
need approval from the chief risk officer, especially if a
trading book is unusually large. </p>
<p>Dimon said in April 2009 that he doesn''t pay much attention
to VaR and has criticized the gauge when analysts questioned him
in past years about its levels. VaR is a very imperfect
number that bounces around all the time, he said on a Jan.
18, 2006, conference call. </p>
<h2>Washington Warning </h2>
<p>U.S. banks were warned last year by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency to closely scrutinize the
possibility that computer models used to calculate VaR might not
be properly designed or calibrated. </p>
<p>The use of models invariably presents model risk, which
is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based
on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports, according
to the April 4, 2011, document from the OCC, which supervises
JPMorgan''s primary banking subsidiary. Model risk can lead to
financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making or
damage to a bank''s reputation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s team that handled such matters was on the verge
of a shakeup that involved at least six management changes in
late 2011 or early this year within the chief risk office, chief
investment office and treasury. The personnel changes may have
contributed to lapses in risk management, said the person close
to the company. </p>
<h2>People in Motion </h2>
<p>Barry Zubrow, 59, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. veteran who
was hired by JPMorgan in November 2007, served as chief risk
officer through Jan. 12, when Dimon shifted him to oversee
regulatory, public relations and lobbying strategy. His
replacement was John Hogan, 45, who oversaw risks within
JPMorgan''s investment bank during the U.S. subprime mortgage
crisis in 2008 and 2009. </p>
<p>Hogan, after being named chief risk officer in mid-January,
didn''t announce his new management team -- including his own
successor -- until Feb. 13, so he was doing both the new job and
the old job for about a month, according to the person close to
the bank. A chief risk officer signed off on the VaR change,
which took effect in January, the person said. It couldn''t be
determined whether Zubrow or Hogan signed off, and neither
responded to phone calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>The new team included Irvin Goldman, 51, who had been
overseeing strategy at the chief investment office, as the
unit''s chief risk officer. He replaced Peter Weiland, who
remained with the bank as head of market risk for the investment
office, reporting to Goldman. </p>
<h2>Family Tie </h2>
<p>Goldman, Zubrow''s brother-in-law, had been fired in 2007 by
Cantor Fitzgerald LP for money-losing bets that led to a
regulatory sanction of the firm, Bloomberg reported on May 20.
Regulators didn''t accuse Goldman of wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Evan Kalimtgis, 42, who co-headed risk management for the
$355.6 billion book of securities in the investment office, quit
in March after learning that Goldman would become his new boss,
people with knowledge of the move said. Kalimtgis, who until
mid-2011 was overseeing market risks in the London CIO office
where Iksil worked, said he couldn''t comment. Keith Stephan
succeeded Kalimtgis as head of market risk in the London office,
two people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Andrew Abrahams, who had been head of quantitative research
and model oversight at JPMorgan, reporting to the chief risk
officer, retired in May, according to his profile on the website
LinkedIn. He''s now a founder at Gnana Inc., according to
LinkedIn. He''s also an instructor at Stanford University near
Palo Alto, California, where in January he taught a seminar on
model risks, safeguards and new directions, according to the
school''s website. </p>
<h2>Leaving the Bank </h2>
<p>Abrahams said in an interview that he started planning
career changes in the latter part of 2011, and his departure had
nothing to do with the current news story. He said that
while his official retirement date was in May, he wasn''t
physically present after the end of 2011. Abrahams was succeeded
by C.S. Venkat Venkatakrishnan, according to a Feb. 13 memo
from Hogan. </p>
<p>Joseph Bonocore, 44, a former finance chief in the CIO who
was promoted in November 2010 to become the bank''s treasurer,
quit in October to join Citigroup Inc. (C) The job stood open for
five months until prime-brokerage and futures chief Sandie O''Connor, 45, was promoted to the post in March. The treasurer
shares responsibility with the chief investment officer for
managing capital, liquidity and structural risks of the
firm, according to JPMorgan''s annual report. </p>
<p>Drew, 55, who as chief investment officer oversaw Iksil''s
trades, resigned on May 14 and was replaced by Matthew Zames,
41, who had headed fixed-income trading. Goldman was stripped of
his duties in May, though he remains at the firm, according to a
person familiar with the situation. </p>
<h2>Internal Memo </h2>
<p>JPMorgan named Ashley Bacon as deputy chief risk officer,
in addition to his role as head of firmwide market risk,
according to a memo today to employees from Hogan. He will
partner with me to review and assess firmwide risk and risk
governance, Hogan wrote. </p>
<p>After Dimon held the May 10 conference call to announce the
derivatives-trading losses, Hogan sent an internal memo urging
his employees in the risk department to remain vigilant. </p>
<p>Our focus is no surprises, Hogan wrote. Remember, as
an independent oversight function, it''s our responsibility to
escalate early and often. </p>
<h2>Credit Derivatives </h2>
<p>That oversight extends to JPMorgan''s chief investment
office, which in 2008 and 2009 started expanding its use of
credit derivatives to hedge its holdings against an economic
slump. The shift was led by Drew''s top deputy in London,
Achilles Macris, who in turn oversaw Iksil''s boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Iksil was assigned to design those hedges and execute
trades. Last year, Iksil made a bearish bet on an index of
credit derivatives, speculating that one or more companies
included in the index would default before trading contracts
expired in December, according to market participants at hedge
funds and banks. Some hedge funds were taking the opposite view. </p>
<p>Iksil''s bet won out, and the hedge funds faced losses of 25
percent, when American Airlines parent AMR Corp. filed for
bankruptcy less than a month before the insurance-like swaps
matured, the market participants said. The trades were made in
so-called tranches of the index, which concentrates risks on the
member companies. </p>
<h2>Various Complaints </h2>
<p>Traders sometimes complain about VaR models that have
adverse effects on the business, and they''re less likely to
challenge an outcome that results in an advantage for them,
according to the OCC supervisory guidance. </p>
<p>The agency said May 14 that it was examining the losses at
JPMorgan, including details related to the specific
transactions as well as the surrounding risk-management
processes that resulted in this unexpected loss. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, as JPMorgan''s holding-company
supervisor, is studying organizational issues around the trading
loss to assure that they aren''t repeated in other areas of the
firm, Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman for the central bank,
said on May 15. </p>
<p>The most common reasons for altering a VaR model include
changes in the range of historical pricing data used to estimate
the potential swings and revisions in the amount of hedging
activity that''s allowed as an offset, said Daniels Webster, the
ex-JPMorgan risk manager. </p>
<p>Some of the toughest questions about the VaR changes may be
reserved for the executives who approved them, she said. </p>
<p>There is no one VaR model out there that is recognized as
the sine qua non, Daniels Webster said, invoking the Latin for
something indispensable or essential. So we''re dealing with
judgment. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, plans to build factories that produce ethylene and
plastics in Texas, joining a growing group of competitors racing
to use U.S. natural gas to make chemicals. </p>
<p>A new plant at the company''s site in Baytown would produce
1.5 million metric tons of ethylene annually starting in 2016,
pending regulatory approvals, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said
today in an e-mailed statement. The gaseous chemical would be
used to make 1.3 million metric tons of polyethylene plastic at
two plants to be built in nearby Mont Belvieu, the company said. </p>
<p>The Houston-area plants would significantly increase
exports of plastics, Exxon said in the statement. Chevron
Phillips Chemical Co. is planning a $5 billion ethylene project
at its Baytown site and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) is also expanding to
use more gas-based raw materials that provide a cost advantage
over oil-based production in Europe and Asia. </p>
<p>The proposed investment reflects Exxon Mobil''s continued
confidence in the natural-gas-driven revitalization of the U.S.
chemical industry, the company said in the statement. </p>
<p>Gas prices in New York fell to a 10-year-low in April and
have pushed costs for U.S. chemical producers to the lowest
outside of the Middle East, Cynthia Werneth, an analyst at
Standard  Poor''s, said on a conference call today. </p>
<h2>Exxon''s Largest </h2>
<p>The ethylene plant would be Exxon''s largest in the U.S. and
its first in the country since 1997. The company has two
ethylene plants in Baytown with capacities of 1 million tons and
1.2 million tons; a 800,000-ton capacity factory in Beaumont,
Texas; and 1-million-ton plant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
according to Exxon''s 2011 Financial  Operating Review. </p>
<p>The polyethylene plants would increase by 34 percent
Exxon''s U.S. output of the resin used to make products such as
food packaging and plastics bags, based on data in the company
review. Globally, Exxon''s ethylene capacity would increase 17
percent and its polyethylene production would rise 18 percent. </p>
<p>The project would create 10,000 construction jobs and would
boost Exxon''s Baytown workforce of 6,500 by about 350, the
company said. Margaret Ross, a company spokeswoman, declined to
say in a telephone interview how much the project would cost. </p>
<p>Exxon filed applications with Texas and U.S. environmental
regulators on May 22. </p>

<p>A ship hired by Morgan Stanley (MS) is
bringing liquefied natural gas to Argentina from Trinidad and
Tobago after Repsol SA (REP) canceled shipments following the
government''s takeover of its YPF SA unit. </p>
<p>The Excel will arrive in Bahia Blanca tomorrow, ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. The carrier is
employed by Morgan Stanley, according to the website of its
Antwerp, Belgium-based owner, Exmar NV. (EXM) </p>
<p>Repsol canceled 10 shipments of LNG to Argentina this year
because the government breached contracts following the seizure
of YPF, the country''s biggest oil producer, Madrid-based

to pay more than foreseen as it competes with Asian buyers
for spare cargoes, Julio De Vido, minister of federal planning,

<p>Miguel de Potter, chief financial officer at Exmar, said
Morgan Stanley charters the Excel. Hugh Fraser, a London-based

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) plans to
name Mario Greco, head of general insurance at Zurich Insurance
Group AG (ZURN), as chief executive officer to replace Giovanni Perissinotto, ousted after shares slumped to a 26-year low. </p>
<p>Perissinotto''s powers were revoked due to the necessity
to bring about change in the company''s management, the
Trieste, Italy-based insurer said yesterday. Ten out of 17 board
members voted in favor of Perissinotto''s departure, Director
Claudio De Conto said. Chairman Gabriele Galateri will act as
the interim CEO. </p>
<p>Investors including Mediobanca SpA (MB), the insurer''s biggest
shareholder with a 13 percent stake, and Leonardo Del Vecchio,
who owns 3 percent of the company, are betting Greco, 52, can
revive the performance and strategy of Italy''s largest insurance
company. Profit has fallen for four consecutive quarters amid
writedowns of assets including Greek bonds and a drop in
earnings at the company''s life unit. </p>
<p>Perissinotto is inadequate to lead Generali, Del
Vecchio, founder of eyewear maker Luxottica SpA, said in a
statement June 1. This was proved by poor operating results, a
more than negative perception by markets of his management and
more generally his total lack of a strategic vision. Greco''s
appointment would bring a new pace to the company, Del
Vecchio said. </p>

<p>When is a hedge not a hedge? </p>
<p>That''s the question regulators from the Federal Reserve to
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are confronting
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported a $2 billion trading loss
from a credit-derivatives position Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called a hedge. </p>
<p>Regulators are under pressure to respond to JPMorgan''s loss
as they finish writing the so-called Volcker Rule, which
restricts banks'' proprietary trading and is the most
controversial provision in the Dodd-Frank Act. They''re
scrutinizing the so-called hedging exemption in the proposed
regulation and probably will narrow the exceptions for trades
banks say are designed to mitigate risk, according to two people
familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s loss will reinforce the position of those who
want to be tough, Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat and co-author of the financial-overhaul legislation,
said in a telephone interview. I do think it will mean Volcker
will not allow such trades. </p>
<p>The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, is
intended to reduce the chance that banks will put depositors''
money at risk. Dodd-Frank, signed into law in 2010, largely left
regulators to define the provisions, and in October, they
released a proposal for the rule, which is scheduled to take
effect in July. In April, the Fed said banks would have two
years to implement it, as long as they make a good faith
effort to comply with the ban on proprietary trading. </p>
<h2>Pool of Investments </h2>
<p>Under the proposed version, bankers would be permitted to
do risk-mitigating hedging activities for aggregate
positions. That means using derivatives or other products to
reduce the risk of an entire pool of investments, as opposed to
a single transaction or position. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan loss has ignited a debate whether aggregate or
portfolio hedging is appropriate at all and how to define and
spot these trades. </p>
<p>Frank said he hopes regulators will prevent such positions,
allowing banks to hedge only against specific investments to
offset potential losses. </p>
<p>Aggregate hedging isn''t hedging, it''s a profit center,
he said. They are talking about making money out of it, when
hedges break even. </p>
<h2>Skeptical Look </h2>
<p>In the wake of JPMorgan''s loss, regulators clearly are
looking more skeptically at the claim about portfolio hedging
and what does the word aggregate'' in the law mean you have to
do, said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal
Financial Analytics, a Washington research firm. </p>
<p>Wall Street has aggressively lobbied against the Volcker
Rule. The five regulators implementing the provision received
over 17,000 comment letters -- the most for any part of the law.
Bankers devoted the majority of their efforts to aspects other
than hedging, such as allowances for trading by so-called
market-makers who buy and sell securities to establish prices
and whether banks can take positions in sovereign debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan employs 12 lobbyists and spent $7.6 million on
these activities in 2011, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics in Washington. Dimon led Wall Street bosses in a
closed-door meeting with Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on May 2 to
press the central bank to ease regulations, including the
Volcker Rule. </p>
<h2>Public Challenge </h2>
<p>Dimon publicly challenged Ben S. Bernanke in June 2011 on
tougher oversight, asking whether the Fed chairman had a fear
like I do that overzealous regulation will be the reason it
took so long for banks, credit and job creation to recover
from the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Fed spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh declined to comment. </p>
<p>The KBW Bank Index of 24 financial stocks has dropped 14
percent (BKX) since July 2010, the month Dodd-Frank was passed,
compared with a 16 percent gain in the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index of stocks. JPMorgan shares have underperformed both,
tumbling 21 percent to $31.93 on June 1. </p>
<p>Bank lobbyists now say they''re on hold in reaction to the
attention JPMorgan has attracted. Their complaints may only
strengthen the call for tougher rules, said Oliver Ireland, a
partner at Morrison  Foerster LLP. </p>
<p>The problem with this event is it doesn''t do the
industry''s credibility any good, so it''s not clear the industry
pushing a lot harder now would do any good, Ireland said. It
may create a backlash.'''' </p>
<h2>Egregious Mistakes'' </h2>
<p>Dimon, who asked regulators in a February letter to loosen
up their definition of portfolio hedging, said on a May 10 call
with analysts that JPMorgan''s chief investment office made
egregious mistakes'''' by taking flawed positions on synthetic
credit. He previously pushed the unit, which oversees about $360
billion, to seek profit by speculating on higher-yielding
assets, ex-employees said in April. </p>
<p>The positions were done with the intention to hedge the
tail risk for JPMorgan'''' and could result in an additional $1
billion loss or more as they''re wound down, Dimon said. But I
am telling you it morphed over time; and the new strategy, which
was meant to reduce the hedge overall, made it more complex,
more risky, and it was unbelievably ineffective.'''' </p>
<p>JPMorgan profited in 2011 by betting that credit conditions
would worsen. Then in December, the European Central Bank
provided long-term loans to euro-zone banks, igniting a bond
rally and leaving JPMorgan''s bearish bets vulnerable. So the
chief investment office made offsetting bullish investments
using credit-default-swap indexes that are thought to expire at
the end of 2017, according to market participants. </p>
<h2>Bearish Trade </h2>
<p>The office put on another bearish trade to protect against
short-term losses using contracts due in 2012, market
participants said. Losses may have mounted when prices between
the two indexes became distorted because JPMorgan was such a big
seller of insurance. The trader who built the credit-derivatives
positions, Bruno Iksil, was nicknamed the London whale''''
because the investments became so large. </p>
<p>Credit conditions subsequently deteriorated, and hedge
funds increased purchases of the 2017 contracts, sending those
higher than the 2012 index and boosting JPMorgan''s losses. </p>
<p>The company''s investments can''t be described in any way
as a hedge, Michael Platt, co-founder and CEO of BlueCrest
Capital Management LLP, said in a May 21 interview with
Bloomberg Television. I think it''s a trading loss. They
deliberately put the positions on. The London whale, who has
subsequently been harpooned, put the positions on. </p>
<p>Geneva-based BlueCrest manages $32 billion and took a
small position against JPMorgan, Platt said. </p>
<h2>Gone Too Far </h2>
<p>U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler and U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro both acknowledged May 22 the difficulty regulators face
in allowing some risk-mitigating hedging and then trying to
determine when it''s gone too far. </p>
<p>The challenge when somebody uses a word like portfolio
hedging'' is that it can mutate and morph into many things beyond
hedging specific positions, Gensler said May 21, 10 days
before the CFTC held a round-table discussion about narrowing
exemptions in the Volcker Rule. </p>
<p>An administration official told reporters on May 22 that
regulators will use the JPMorgan loss as a real-life example to
inform the final rule. Regulators feel pressure to react and
will scrutinize the hedging exemption, according to another
person who works for an agency involved in the writing of the
law who wasn''t authorized to speak publicly and declined to be
identified. </p>
<h2>Unpopular Regulations </h2>
<p>More stringent regulations are sure to be unpopular with
bankers. You wouldn''t want to make a big change based on one
event, said Tim Ryan, president and CEO of the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street''s main
lobbying group. This is a complicated proposal. </p>
<p>Lawmakers are using JPMorgan''s loss for political
expediency, and it''s unlikely that portfolio hedging actually
will be banned, predicted Douglas Landy, a partner at Allen 
Overy LLP in New York. </p>
<p>Banks do need the ability to mitigate risks in their
portfolio using derivatives, said Ernest Patrikis, a partner at
White  Case LLP. </p>
<p>It''s insanity to think that they shouldn''t be doing it,
said Patrikis, former general counsel at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. Regulators may consider options such as
forcing financial institutions to demonstrate more fully
their positions or restricting how they can hedge, he said. </p>
<h2>Prohibit Trades </h2>
<p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council, created by Dodd-Frank and led by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner,
discussed JPMorgan''s loss and the Volcker Rule at a May 22
meeting, Treasury spokesman Anthony Coley said. It''s
premature to conclude whether the rule would have
prohibited these trades and the hedging activity the bank
conducted, Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the comptroller''s
office, said May 14 in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Senators Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, and Carl Levin,
a Michigan Democrat, who co-wrote the Volcker provision, said
JPMorgan''s trading losses underline why hedging on a portfolio
basis should be barred in the final version. </p>
<p>Pressure from lobbyists during the rule-making process
gave rise to regulatory loopholes that would allow proprietary
trading to be hidden within market-making, risk-mitigating
hedging and wealth management, among other areas, the senators
said in a May 17 letter to the Fed and other regulators. </p>
<p>The Senate Banking Committee has begun hearings on JPMorgan
and its implications for regulatory changes. The bank regulators
and Neal Wolin, Treasury Department deputy secretary, will
testify on June 6; Dimon will testify June 13. Dimon also will
appear before the House Financial Services Committee on June 19. </p>
<p>The main impact of JPMorgan''s sour trades will be to speed
up work on finalizing the Volcker rule, said Brian Gardner,
senior vice president in Washington at investment bank Keefe
Bruyette  Woods Inc. </p>
<p>Regulators are under the gun to finish in a way that is
totally unreasonable, which is to make sure there are no
losses at banks, he said. They''ve basically been assigned
mission impossible. </p>

<p>Iraq and Chevron Phillips Chemical
Co., a joint venture of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), signed
a letter of intent to evaluate the feasibility of developing a
petrochemical plant in the country, officials said. </p>
<p>The company would examine building a new facility and
upgrading an existing Iraq-owned petrochemicals factory in
southern Basra province, Hanaa al-Husseini, a spokeswoman for
the Industry and Minerals Ministry, said today in Baghdad. </p>
<p>Melanie Samuelson, a spokeswoman for Chevron Philips, said
in an e-mailed statement that the company, with headquarters in
The Woodlands, Texas, wants to assess the feasibility of
developing an integrated petrochemical complex. Both Chevron
Phillips and the ministry declined to give additional details,
including cost estimates or dates for the project. </p>
<p>Iraq holds the world''s fifth-largest crude reserves and the
fifth-biggest natural-gas deposits in the Middle East, according
to data from BP Plc that also include Canadian oil sands. The
government, which depends on crude sales for more than 90
percent of its official income, wants to diversify into
chemicals production and other industries. </p>
<p>Iraq''s oil output is on the rebound after stagnating for
years during the rule of Saddam Hussein, ousted by a U.S.-led
invasion in 2003. The nation burns off natural gas produced in
association with crude because it lacks the infrastructure to
use it as a fuel for electricity plants or feedstock for
petrochemicals. </p>
<p>The ministry''s al-Husseini said April 9 that Shell
Chemicals Ltd. agreed in a separate arrangement to study the
feasibility of a petrochemical plant. </p>
